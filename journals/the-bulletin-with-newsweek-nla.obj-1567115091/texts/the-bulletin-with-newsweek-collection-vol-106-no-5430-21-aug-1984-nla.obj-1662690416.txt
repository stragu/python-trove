Rival 4 cylinder two litre engine at 2500 rpm.
A martini may be improved by being
shaken. But drivers and passengers
seldom are.
BMW insists on using six cylinders in
engines of 2 litres and over. But most
other luxury car makers still persist with
four or five cylinders, despite the laws of
physics which decree that engines of
less than six cylinders can never be
perfectly balanced.
A four cylinder engine will have up to
10 times more vibration than a six
cylinder engine. And a four cylinder car
engine can transmit three times more
vibrations to the passenger compartment.
In a BMW however, you will feel
fewer vibrations than if you were sitting
in an eight cylinder car.
To improve this smoothness even
further, each cylinder has its own
counterweight. Some other cars only
have one counterweight to balance
several cylinders.
When you drive the BMW 323 i for
example, you will be surprised at the
uncanny quiet but effortless acceler-
ation of its electronically fuel injected six.
And when you fill up with petrol you
will be pleasantly surprised at how
economical six cylinders can be, when
combined with energy-saving computer
electronics like a fuel cut-off system.
BMW believes that, if you are to
build the most sophisticated and refined
car in the world, the last place for
compromise is the engine. And if other
manufacturers are prepared to com-
promise on this the most important part
of the car, where will they stop 7

Toshiba Introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisywheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. Perfect
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a bit
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you
most of the features of the other two, for less.
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAT
A matter of standards
Congratulations to you on your new
Bulletin from one who remembers it
from the Norman Lindsay era.
May I submit my additions to H. J.
Holden’s pet aversions list (July 31)
starting with such shockers as
“klommitter” for kilometre, “ree-
search,” “rowdeeoh” for rodeo, “fillum”
for film and other slovenly items such as
“sorta like,” “eh but,” “gunna” and
“dunno” plus “there” tacked on to the
end of every sentence.
Furthermore, there cannot be “a
point in time” (or fixed position) since
time is constantly changing.
Much of the mutilation of the
English language today stems from the
influence of American television and
the inadequate education standard of
some media newsreaders.

The price of eggs
Perhaps Bert Kelly’s testiness is a conse-
quence of his addiction to bran (The
Modest Farmer, B, August 7).
However, I am sure Mavis’s reason
for weaning him on to bran was not re-
lated to the price of eggs, the cost of
bran/kg being approximately the same
as eggs.
The regulated system of producing
eggs, in a large measure, has been able
to achieve minimal increases in the
price of eggs over the past five years
to the extent of little more than half the
rate of the increase in the cost of living
during the same period.
Few industries could make the same
claim.

All work and no play...
I confess I am a little alarmed at the
suggestion of Trevor Sykes that politi-
“I used to feel paranoid until I realised there are those in positions
of power who want us to feel paranoid!”
cians spend more time on serious sub-
jects and less in the entertaining pastime
of bagging heads on the opposing side
(B, August 7).
Where would such a notion lead us?
Would customs officials be told to con-
centrate on catching drug-smugglers
and the big importers, and forgo the
sport of minister-hunting and tourist-
teasing?
Would ASIO be told to go back
to the hard slog of finding out which
Commonwealth country is due to be
invaded next, instead of being able to
pursue Canberra lobbyists and each
other, for a little sport?
Or even, perish the thought, the
Immigration Department might have to
concentrate on arresting dangerous
criminals, trying to enter the country,
and leave the lovesick ladies alone.
It might all well result in better gov-
ernment, but think how dull the news-
casts would be.

Steele Rudd memorial
I was surprised to read Peter Ellingsen’s
feature “Tarnish on our Steele Rudd (B,
July 3) in which he states the Darling
Downs people have forgotten Arthur
Hoey Davis and that, although his work
was “monumental,” no real monument
has emerged to keep the faith.
I seriously doubt whether Mr
Ellingsen earned his keep when he
made his pilgrimage to Darling Downs
in search of Steele Rudd’s memorials.
Please find enclosed a photograph of
the magnificent A. H. Davis College at
the Darling Downs Institute of Ad-
vanced Education, Toowoomba.
This co-educational residential col-
lege was built as a monument to the
memory of Arthur Hoey Davis about 16
years ago.

Good fellowship
It was very pleasing indeed to read the
letter by Dr Kenneth Rivett, acting
chairman of the Australian Institute of
Multicultural Affairs (B, August 7). Un-
fortunately, I, for one, cannot but dis-
agree with him as to the value of the
so-called “multicultural policies” which
as administered by the institute as such
are indeed “in tatters.”
A statement by Dr Mariah Evans,
post-doctoral fellow in Sociology, Re-
search School of Social Sciences at the
Australian National University, was
published in the press a few weeks ago.
According to Evans, “Asian-born mi-
grants are more likely to integrate
quickly into Australian society than
Europeans from the Mediterranean
area ... adult migrants from Mediter-
ranean countries had relatively poor
English and occupational skills, low in-
come levels and a more family-oriented
way of life than other migrant groups.”
Being naive enough to look upon
such statements as tending to fuel a feel-
ing of superiority on the part of one
group of migrants toward another and
thus creating racial tension, being fur-
thermore of the opinion that multi-
culturalism did not mean integration, I
took the liberty of appealing to Dr
Rivett for some comment on Dr Evans’
statements. I was very disappointed
when his reply contained, among other
statements, that Dr Rivett “.. . would
not regard criticism of my Anglo way of
life, nor therefore of any other way of
life, as necessarily contrary to the ideal
of multiculturalism ...”
I quote from a letter to me by Dr
Evans that “I have not seen the report
of my research ... but the part you
quote contains some correctly stated
facts about Mediterranean immigrants
... the more we know about one an

A ‘grave disservice’
Bulletin articles “Ringbarked in the
Alice” (July 10), and “Parliamentary
probe into use of funds” (July 31) have
confirmed my belief that successive gov-
ernments have rendered a grave disserv-
ice to the Aborigines. The magnitude of
the hand-outs without any requirements
of accountability has resulted in a race
of people the majority of whom are, in
varying degrees, irresponsible. Irres-
ponsibility exists in all nationalities but
the percentage is noticeably greater in
the Aboriginal race, ie, children in care,
prison numbers, etc.
Tales abound of grocery and other
bills being paid by a government de-
partment only days after the receipt of a
shearing cheque and pastoral stations
which originally carried thousands of
head of stock being reduced to hun-
dreds within three or four years for
want of necessary windmill repairs and
similar neglect. These stories are too nu-
merous not to contain at least a grain of
truth.
The perceived monumental waste is
the cause of the increasing white back-
lash against the granting of inalienable
land rights not racism, as (Aboriginal
Affairs minister) Mr Holding in his
blinkered state believes.
The proposed $200,000 to be spent
on advertising counteracting the critics
of the federal government’s land rights
plans would be better directed to con-
ducting a royal commission into the
true state of Aboriginal affairs.
One would also believe that animal
liberationists would, as a priority, in-
quire into the alleged deaths by thirst of
thousands of head of stock by negli-
gence or perhaps, ignorance.

Realities of divorce
Considerably more thought should have
been given to the effects of divorce than
was the case when the Family Law Act
was proclaimed.
Neither Willa McDonald (B, July 17)
nor others who have written thoughtful-
ly on the subject have considered the
proposition that, do what they want
under the act, divorce never results in
the dissolution of a marriage particu-
larly if children are involved.
Looking back from a distance of 41
years to the date of my first marriage
and 32 years to when it was officially
dissolved in court, I must state that I
never felt completely free from the
bonds of that officially dissolved act.
Nor did others.
Although the marriage was dis-
solved, the children were NOT! This is
only the starting point.
Impossible marriages must be dis-
solved. But impossible laws must be
revoked, too. I do not have the answer
to the multitude of problems divorce
creates but the Family Law Act merely
replaced speedily one injustice with
another.

Arts funding
On arts funding, W. O’Connor (B, July
17) suggests that by diverting funding
away from “the successful members of
our culture” for instance, the Austra-
lian Opera we would in fact be initiat-
ing a decline in our artistic standards
and a return to “the cultural desert of 30
years ago.” I would contend that the op-
posite result would be more likely; since
a large percentage of the Australian
population exist in this cultural desert
still, any move to widen the effects of
funding would have to be some im-
provement.
The amount of financial support pro-
vided to such bodies as the Australian
Ballet by private companies and the
government has enabled them to oper-
ate on a plane of elitism that disregards
the need for funding to support regional
and country theatre groups and pro-
grams. This is not even to mention the
need for job creation in this field.
I am musical director for a regional
company based on the northern NSW
coast that not only provides a modern,
challenging repertoire to discerning
audiences but also performs curricu-
lum-based material in schools, runs
drama workshops for the general public
“Most of this is just a figure of speech now!”
and works with handicapped children.
Not all people after funding are “un-
talented” or “pornographic.”
There are many such small compan-
ies serving the needs of country areas;
who then best serves to green the
neglected wastelands of Australian cul-
ture?
Most of the population has neither
the inclination, opportunity nor
finances to enjoy the heavily-subsidised
institutions so revered by attitudes such
as those of W. O’Connor. It is this snob-
bish ideal of what culture is that is most
detrimental to Australia’s growing artis-
tic maturity. Culture is what exists
among the cross-section of society and
not in the sacred monoliths that churn
out the same repertoire year after year
to cater to the tastes of the privileged
few.
What limited funds exist should be
used to provide a broad basis for the
development of projects and ideals that
move towards making artistic sensitivity
a factor in all areas of the society, re-
gardless of where they live or what their
financial privileges be.

Taxing appointment
It appears that the new Commissioner
of Taxation, Mr Boucher, has been a
public servant for all his working life.
Therefore, it would be realistic to as-
sume that Mr Boucher has a rather nar-
row view of the Australian economy
ie, from the confiscatory viewpoint of
revenue collection rather than from the
viewpoint of the production of wealth.
In the long term, it could be ben-
eficial for Australia if appointments for
positions such as commissioner of tax-
ation were made from outside the pub-
lic service.
Surely a person who possessed a
wide and varied working career could
give a better perspective and balance to
a position such as commissioner of tax-
ation, rather than a person who has en-
joyed a working career with limited hor-
izons.

Says it all
I wanted to write a letter defending Pro-

but R. J. O’Bryen in his letter “Blainey’s
View” (B, July 24) with its quotation
from Kipling’s If says it for me.

Emotional stress
Having experienced the cold, cold pro-
cedure of divorce and property settle-
ment recently, I was somewhat amused
at Trevor Nyman’s statement (B, July
17) that “immediate improvement”
would be to restore wigs and gowns,
raise the height of the judge’s bench and
reintroduce the practice of standing
when addressing the judge. What the
hell has all this to do with improving the
Family Law Act of 1976?
It is not expected that lawyers be-
come father confessors but all too often
they work hand in glove with colleagues
representing the other party; the whole
situation becomes a sham, a game
played between two opposing (?) law-
yers. Then the judge rubber-stamps their


submissions and calls the next “case.”
This is a simplistic assessment of
events dealing with the emotional stress
which ranks second-highest of all such
stresses the death of a life-long spouse
is statistically the highest and Trevor
Nyman talks about wigs and gowns!
The “no-fault” application of the
Family Law Act in effect pronounces
both parties guilty. So profound is this
effect that friends, relatives and the pub-
lic at large accept the result as six of one
and half-a-dozen of the other. The “in-
nocent” is then placed in the same
stream as the guilty party or parties.
The emotive stress of divorce is like-
wise aggravated by the so-called 50-50
split of property. The reality is that the
50-50 ratio is only the starting point of
negotiations. Such negotiations are
based on need and the ability to pay. As
essential as these factors are, the contri-
butions by one or the other party to the
joint accumulated assets although le-
gally to be taken into consideration
are frequently given the heave-ho be-
cause of the costs in litigation. Fault, of
course, is irrelevant.
These factors alone cause much of
the anguish within the Family Law
Court and I have not even mentioned
the traumatic upheaval involving the
children of divorced parents!
It is agreed that more staff is neces-
sary within each court but please, please
let them be competent as advisers and
above all listeners. People in divorce
situations do not want to feel like beasts
in a slaughterhouse with the herders
anxious for the 5 o’clock whistle!
Judicial costumes may or may not be
an effective side issue at the time of the
final resolution but people contempla-
ting divorce need to be fully aware of
their rights, the costs legal and personal,
the possible end result with property
and custody of children, exactly where
they stand on each issue peculiar to
them; they need to be prepared for the
reaction of the other party, to be
listened to, and equally important is
that such discussions and consultations
be held in private not over a counter
or within the view of a crowded waiting-
room.
Preparedness will assist the accept-
ance of any decision handed down.

Lightning strikes
Phillip Adams referred in his article “A
burning question for the church” (B,
July 31) to the initial reluctance of
churches to install Benjamin Franklin’s
lightning rod for fear of offending the
Almighty.
The extent of the Almighty’s dis-
pleasure with his worshippers at that
time was indicated by lightning strikes
on 400 church towers in Germany alone

Hitachi's visual-tactile robot can
handle objects as fragile as eggs,
because its sensors detect size,
shape and required pressure to
attain sensitivity almost equal to
that of a human hand.
Nearly two decades ago, Hitachi began
turning common science fiction into startling
industrial fact. The device: The company’s
first servo-manipulator, a key component in
the development of real robots to eliminate
the monotony, danger and dirty work
of manufacturing.
Your mechanical right-hand man
Today, the results of Hitachi research are
in use all around you. Robot welders using
microcomputers and built-in sensors to
detect weld lines automatically. Spray-
painting robots capable of remembering up
to 2,000 instructions and performing 99
different painting tasks. Robots on wheelsfor
transporting parts and warehouse stock.
In fact, we are constantly coming up
with innovations and new applications. One
of the latest: A visual-tactile sensing robot
with multiple arms and seven camera eyes,
developed to independently assemble home
appliances such as vacuum cleaners.
The best of worlds is yet to come
Our vision of the future includes robots with
artificial intelligence that will learn from their
own experiences. Personal robots that will
take the drudgery out of household chores.
And much, much more.
We’d like you to share in the benefits
of our scientific research, covering the next
generation of lasers, sensors and other
electronic devices. For improved business
efficiency. For a higher quality of life. Two
goals we've pursued for 74 years as part of
our commitment to a better world through
electronics.

FACT TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
"Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity., but all of mouth-
watering configuration." The Advertiser.
“The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning." The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact.

tions such as pent roof combustion chambers and

In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!

Locating and evaluating the vast mineral
resources at Olympic Dam in South Australia has
meant years of hard, constant work.
The next stage in the project could well mean
more work for many other Australians.
Before you can develop the deposits of copper,
uranium, gold and silver, you first need to develop a
new way of life in this harsh, isolated area.
SSBM/BP 245
Already, roads are being constructed, and a
new town is being planned to house 9,000 people.
Taking part in the Olympic Dam
project is just one more way that BP
Australia is continuing to invest in this
country’s potential, and its future.

during a 33 year period in the 18th cen-
tury. Attempts were made to appease
the Lord by ringing the church bells
during thunderstorms but this only re-
sulted in the deaths of 12 bell-ringers.
The congregation of the church of
San Nazaro in Brescia, Italy, not only
rejected the protection of lightning rods
but also had sufficient faith in the sanc-
tity of their church to store 100 tons of
gunpowder in its vaults. In 1767 light-
ning struck the church and ignited the
gunpowder, causing an explosion
which destroyed one-sixth of the city
and killed 3000 people.
After this, superstition surrendered
to reason and falling attendances and
lightning rods were fitted to churches.

Sex discrimination
With the introduction into law of the
Sex Discrimination Act, Australia has
entered the era of government procrus-
tean dictatorship.
From now on, the vociferous min-
ority groups will be attacking every cita-
del they can find to destroy. Especially
licensed clubs. No longer will Australia
present that freedom of life both sexes
have enjoyed in past years.
Membership of purely ladies’ clubs
will have to be opened to men and vice
versa. Such organisations as RSL, Free-
masonry, Rotarians and countless other
worthwhile bastions may be forced into
mixed membership giving equal rights
to either sex. Possibly brothels will be
renamed “mixed sexual clubs!”
If we are to have equality, why is
there only one commissioner? A
woman. Surely there should be two
one of each sex thus supporting the
object of the Act.
When the GREAT CREATOR made
humans, he made two prototypes. HE
equipped them differently, so that pro-
creation could people the world HE had
created. HE did not intend any reversal
of roles or the prototypes would have
been different. HE gave woman her
guiles and her charms and man the
means of expressing love and admir-
ation.
There was no intention that they
were unequal so it should not be neces-
sary to dictate to this nation how, when,
what and where the two sexes must mix.
It is a diabolical infringement of human
rights.

Plea over prisoners
This is a public letter to the Socialist
Libyan People’s Bureau which opened
in Canberra last year.
Since the end of their trial in June
1980, four Libyan writers and journal-
ists Muhammad Abdulhammid
Muhammad El Maliki, Fathi Nasib
Muhammad, Ramaden Ali El Farisi
and Muhammad Omar Ben Saud
have been held in Tripoli Central prison
and Kuweifiya prison in Benghazi.
They were arrested under articles 2, 3
and 6 of Law 71 of 1972 concerning il-
legal political activities. The prosecu-
tion alleged that they had held meetings
to discuss Marxist theories and had
published material embodying these
ideas. The defendants were said to have
attempted to infiltrate two state-owned
newspapers, Cultural Week and Political
Week. These charges are punishable by
death. The sentences imposed on these
men are not known, although it is re-
ported that they have been sentenced to
life imprisonment.
Numerous approaches have been
made to the Libyan Government but no
information about the situation of these
men has been forthcoming. Therefore, I
appeal publicly to Mr Suleiman Oreibi,
Secretary of the Libyan Bureau in Can-
berra, to make known the sentences the
defendants received and to urge his gov-
ernment to conduct an inquiry into the
charges brought against them which I
believe were politically motivated and
carried inappropriately harsh sentences.

The Russian empire
With monotonous regularity Soviet
Russian leaders refer to the western
countries, particularly the USA, as “im-
perialists.” Perhaps out of reverence to
the concept of peaceful co-existence,
rarely does one hear a western leader
including our own foreign minister
meet this accusation head-on.
If by imperialism we understand
total or near-total political domination
of one nation by another, the world
turns an official blind eye to Russia’s
empire.
“Item six on the agenda: an opportunity to re-consider the vote taken at the
last meeting opposing Merlin’s demand for a salary increase...
Half of the population of the USSR
Ukrainians, Balts, Georgians,
Uzbeks, Armenians, etc were them-
selves conquered by Russia and are still
very much second-class citizens in an
oppressively closed, centralised and
Russified society.
Russia’s east European satellites
(sometimes euphemistically referred to
as “allies”) are kept loyal with the aid of
approximately half-a-million Soviet
troops stationed on their territories.
And, of course, anti-imperialist and
peace-loving Russia currently has about
100,000 members of the Red Army
liberating Afghanistan from western im-
perialists.
In terms of numbers, about 130 mil-
lion Russians control an empire of close
to 400 million people.
When will we find political leaders
with the humanity and courage to call
for the decolonisation of the Russian
empire and the granting of geniune self-
determination to Russia’s numerous
subject peoples?
Might not this course be less costly,
in human and material terms, than an
escalating arms race?

Heroic sacrifice
I call for more recognition for Father
Brian Gore who, persecuted and op-
pressed by a cruel regime, rejected the
offers of freedom as long as his mates
were not set free as well. This is a great
and really heroic sacrifice in the services
of mankind and moral principles.
Gore certainly deserves the Nobel
Peace Prize 1000 times more than my
compatriot, Lech Walesa, who uses the
sacred symbol of the Black Madonna
worn in his lapel for political gains. I,
for one, do not find it amusing.

How a man who’s owned
the same suit for the last
thirty years has changed
the way the world dresses.
Your name’s Pierre Cardin.
You’ve just bought Maxim’s in Paris,
possibly the world’s most famous and
exclusive restaurant.
A thought strikes you.
Why not open a cheaper sister-
restaurant to Maxim’s?
Brilliant.
But what will you call this sister
restaurant... Max’s? Maxine’s? Maxelle’s?
As you ponder, you might let your
mind wander back over your career.
How you started at Christian Dior’s
then set up your own design firm in 1950.
How your bubble dresses triumphed
all over the world.
You smile as you remember the
shock you caused in haute couture circles
when you became the first top designer
to launch a ready-to-wear collection.
And then you had the nerve to open
ready-to-wear departments for both men
and women, bringing style and elegance
to people without limitless money,
particularly the young.
(Just as you hope to do with this
restaurant you’re trying to name.)
Then came those wonderful ’6o’s.
Your simple geometric shapes dom-
inated even that dazzlingly flamboyant
age.
And your idea of exaggerated
shoulders was one of the few landmarks
in the anonymous ’7o’s.
It amuses you to know that you’ve
given the world some of its most
adventurous fashions, yet you have long
preferred immaculate suits.
You’ve been wearing one of them
for over 30 years.
They suit you. You know they’re
right for you in the same way that your
designer’s eye knows what’s right for
millions of other people.
Yes, you’ve been at the top of the
fashion world for 40 years and have
won every award it offers.
Yet you can’t think of a name for
Maxim’s cheaper sister-restaurant.
But wait.. .of course, Minim’s,
So deceptively simple, so obviously
right. So like every item that bears your
name. And so typical of you if your
name’s Pierre Cardin.

AUSTRALIA
in Australia (57 percent of
them are Malaysian), the set-
ting up of a joint trade com-
mittee between the countries
and the future of the Austra-
lian air base at Butterworth,
Malaysia.
Jet cost soars
ACCORDING to the Joint
(Federal) Parliamentary Com-
mittee of Public Accounts, the
cost of the 75 McDonnell
Douglas F/A-18 Hornet
fighters “which will be Aus-
tralia’s principal air defence
to the turn of the century and
beyond” has risen to an es-
timated $4OOO million. When
ordered in November 1981,
they were to have cost $2430
million.
Sperm count warning
A TWO-year survey of 119
men at Sydney’s Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital had revealed
that smoking might reduce a
man’s sperm count by half,
according to Dr Ann Conway,
head of the hospital’s artificial
insemination unit. She said
that 25 percent of the men sur-
veyed were smokers. Their
sperm count was 50 percent
lower than that of non-
smokers.
Redistribution
PROPOSED new electoral
boundaries have boosted the
prospects of the Hawke gov-
ernment increasing its ma-
jority at the next federal elec-
tion.

Hayden rebuffed
FOREIGN Minister Bill
Hayden told an international
disarmament conference in
Geneva, that unless the
United States showed a genu-
ine commitment to the limita-
tion of nuclear arms, Austra-
lia’s commitment to US bases
in Australia might have to be
reviewed. Asked to comment,
Prime Minister Bob Hawke
tersely said: “The question (of
a review) does not arise.”
Fewer jobless
THERE was good news from
the employment front. In
July, unemployment in Aus-
tralia dropped from 9.3 per-
cent to 8.8 percent of the
workforce, the lowest figure
since November 1982. Ac-
cording to the Bureau of Stat-
istics, employment had risen
by 231,000 since July 1983
and the number of unem-
ployed people had fallen by
91,000. Even so, 628,000

THE WORLD
Defence policy
THE British Labor Party has
issued a paper Defence and
Security in Britain an-
nouncing its policy. In gov-
ernment, Labor would act on
the basis that the United
States was just as formidable a
warmonger as the Soviet
Union. A Labor regime hence
would, for instance, order the
US to pull all its nuclear
weapons out of Britain and
withdraw all American sub-
marines from British waters.
Labor would abandon the
Falkland Islands and remove
Polaris nuclear submarines
from active service. However,
it would maintain Britain’s
conventional forces at present
levels and stay in NATO for
the time being.
Gandhi’s problems
INDIA’S Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi has refuted re-
ports published in major In-
dian newspapers that, in a
speech delivered in Himachal
Pradesh state, she had linked
“a Washington-based espion-
age agency” with the eruption
of Sikh nationalist violence.
She said she had not men-
tioned any country or organ-
isation but repeated charges
that “foreign forces” were “in-
citing separatism to destabil-
ise India.”
Mugabe’s aim
PRIME Minister Robert
Mugabe told the second con-
gress of his ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union, held
in Harare, that the union
would remove from the con-
stitution the clause which
guarantees free political as-
sociation. This move would
turn Zimbabwe into another
single-party black African
state.
Grand opening
PRINCE Charles, on a four-
day tour of Papua New
Guinea, opened the country’s
new $3O million parliament
building in Port Moresby with
a speech in pidgin. The people
of Manus Island, off the
Papua New Guinea coast,
later declared Charles an her-
editary leader. About 300
overseas guests including
prime ministers Bob Hawke
of Australia, David Lange of
New Zealand and Fiji’s Ratu
Sir Kamisese Mara at-
tended the celebrations.
Anti-abortion policy
AT THE insistence of the
Vatican and the United States,
the 149-country United
Nations Conference on Popu-
lation has adopted a policy
stating that governments
should take appropriate steps
to help women avoid abor-
tions which in no way should
be promoted as a method of
family planning. Countries
which voted against the pro-
posal and for the right of
abortion included China,
Sweden and the Eastern bloc
nations.

AUSTRALIA
Aborigines: now
it is bone rights
One of the world’s great archeological treasures has been put at risk by
amendments to a law never intended to affect it. As a result, TIM DUNCAN
reports, academics must yield relics which hold a key to the continent’s pre-history.
UNBELIEVABLE as it may seem to the
international scientific community, one
of the two most valuable and best docu-
mented collections of human archeo-
logical relics in the world has been put
at risk by the Victorian government.
Amendments to archeological relics
legislation with wider than intended
effect, the subsequent inability of the
government to divorce its shaky Abor-
iginal affairs policies from its respons-
ibilities to conserve archeological relics
for posterity, and the opportunism of a
tough Victorian Aboriginal activist have
produced a tragi-comedy of which a ba-
nana republic could be proud.
At risk is the Murray Black collec-
tion of Aboriginal skeletal remains, to
be transferred under a court order from
the Department of Anatomy at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne to the Museum of
Victoria by August 23. The collection
comprises representatives of 804 skel-
etons found between 1941 and 1950
north of the River Murray between
Renmark and Swan Hill.
The collection has always been in the
hands of the university. It was formed
as a result of the work of engineer and
pastoralist Murray Black who col-
laborated with Emeritus Professor Sir
Sydney Sunderland and the late Pro-
fessor L. J. Ray, both from the Anatomy
department. According to curator Dr
Geoffrey Kenney, is the most important
of its type in the world.
The skeletons have been put at
roughly 10,000 to 14,000 years old. The
collection is of immense scientific inter-
est because very few other human re-
mains of such antiquity are so complete.
Dr Alan Thorne, a paleoanthropologist
from the Australian National Univer-
sity in Canberra, says the collection
underpins increasing awareness that the
links between Australia and Asia go
back perhaps up to 40,000 years.
Even though the university did the
basic documentation of the collection,
even though the university gave it un-
paralleled curatorial attention and even
though the university reserved the col-
lection exclusively for scholarship,
Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service’s Jim Berg: wants relics reburied


amendments to the Archeological and
Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act
which received royal assent on May 16
this year put the custodians in breach of
the law simply through being in pos-
session of remains without the per-
mission of the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Planning and Environment.
The result was that Supreme Court
injunctions were served within two days
on Professor of Anatomy Graeme Ryan
and the Dean of Medicine, Professor
David Penington, by an inspector under
the Act the executive officer of the
Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Jim
Berg. These were followed up by an in-
junction served on the Vice-Chancellor,
Professor David Caro.
The Secretary of the Victorian De-
partment of Planning and Environ-
ment, David Yencken, freely admitted
to The Bulletin that the amendments to
the legislation were not designed to ap-
ply to university scholarly collections
but rather to prohibit sale of Aboriginal
human remains on the open market.
Nevertheless, Berg demanded that the
Black collection be removed and de-
posited at the museum forthwith.
Caro was unaware of the legislation
until Berg arrived at his office. There
was no letter of intent and no reasons
were given as to why the collection
extremely fragile should be removed.
When he asked to see the collection,
Berg was refused; when he asked to re-
move it, he was also refused. Caro’s re-
sponse was to seek permission to con-
tinue to hold the collection a course
available to him under the amended act.
But Yencken refused permission and
Berg went ahead with his court proceed-
ings. The university had Berg’s costs
awarded against it.
An agreement between Caro and
Yencken that the collection would be
handed over in three months was made
redundant when Mr Justice Gobbo or-
dered that it be handed over by August
23.
Events took an even more bizarre
twist when Berg trumpeted after the
hearing that he hoped the collection
would be re-buried where it had been
found.
Berg had been empowered to seize
archeological relics under an Act
changed as a result of his failing to hold
onto seized marketed human remains
last year. But, as an inspector holding a
formal government post under an Act
designed to conserve archeological
relics, he was instrumental in removing
relics from a safe repository and said
publicly that he wanted them re-buried
which, in archeological terms, would
be tantamount to their destruction.
The silence from the Cain Govern-
ment and the responsible minister of
Planning and Environment, Evan
Walker, was deafening.
Far from cooling fears that the gov-
ernment’s custodianship of irreplace-
able archeological relics was now sub-
ject to whims of urban Aboriginal
fashion, it appointed Berg to a commit-
tee to advise Walker and to another to
advise the museum and made no pro-
nouncement on whether the Black col-
lection might suffer from the rigors of
transfer or indeed whether the museum
would receive extra funding to ensure
housing the collection at an appropri-
ately high standard.
Academics tried to force the issue.
Thorne alerted the international com-
munity when he was in New York at an
exhibition of human fossils.
The international journal Science
published an article titled “Extinction
threatens Australian anthropology.”
Australian archeologists received mes-
sages of support from organisations in-
cluding the National Science Founda-
tion in the US and its Smithsonian Insti-
tution.
As a result of the court decision
Thorne had to return to the Museum of
Victoria material he had dug up,
donated to the museum and then bor-
rowed back so he could work on it.
Other scholars, some of them from the
US and some from China, found that
they could not look at the material as it
was suddenly being packed up.
And where is it going? Only as late as
last week did the government decide
that it would allow a 12-month cooling-
off period so experts could evaluate the
Black collection to decide which bits of
it should be re-buried. Meanwhile, it
will go into the museum which thus still
does not have formal permission to
hang on to it.
Dr Barry Wilson, Director of Nat-
ural History and Anthropology of the
museum, said its facilities were quite ad-
equate to house the collection. He
added later that, while the museum had
floorspace, it did not have climate-con-
trolled floorspace which is what the
collection has enjoyed since first place
with the university. Wilson says that
such floorspace will not be available for
“a year or two.”
Wilson says that scholarly access will
still be available but others are not so
sure. Dr Peter Brown, an archeologist at
the University of New England, says
that Aborigines in Melbourne are print-
ing articles in their community news-
papers advocating complete control.


The university has been unable to
take advantage of recent advances in
archeological dating technology. Berg’s
arrival at the vice-chancellor’s office re-
sulted in abrupt termination of the uni-
versity research program.
“The point must be made that with
none of the collection do we have pre-
cise dating,” says Ryan. “We’ve not
done radio-carbon dating on this ma-
terial because too much of it might have
been damaged. You’d lose a leg bone on
each skeleton and you’d lose a great
deal from each skull. But, over the last
year, new methods have allowed us to
think of using milligram amounts. We
were about to go down that track but
now we can’t.”
One of the researchers who was to be
involved in that project is an American,
Dr Milford Wolpoff, an archeologist at
the University of Michigan. Wolpoff
had planned to study the Coobool
Creek series of skulls in the collection to
address the question of whether Austra-
lian Aborigines might be derived from
two separate migrations of Indonesian
and south Asian peoples some 40,000
years ago. The intermediate age of the
Coobool relics offer the opportunity to
test that theory.
Such relics now could fall under the
control of modern Aborigines, some de-
scended in part from whites, who may
have very little connection with the
relics but quite proud of the political
significance of their control and totally
untrained in archeology.
Why should modern day Aborigines,
from a base in an Aboriginal legal ser-
vice, be regarded as legitimate moral
guardians of remains whose connec-
tions to the modern day are still to be
proved?
Yencken says that the removal de-
cision was taken because the collecion
would then be on neutral territory.
Why a university should be defined
as somehow prejudiced territory is not
obvious and why a museum should be
regarded as “state custody” whereas a
state-owned, -administered and -di-
rected university may not be is equally
unclear.
Perhaps The Bulletin’s experience in
researching this story provides a clue.
While officers of the ministry and of
the museum were extremely helpful,
they felt unable to talk freely. By con-
trast, academics spoke their minds.
With the Black collection in the hands
of the museum, it also will be in the
hands of a sub-committee formally re-
sponsible to the museum council and
soon to receive powers delegated from
it. That committee will have both policy
and steering powers and will be
composed overwhelmingly of Aborigi-
nes whose connection with the material
is as tenuous as that of any Aborigine in
Victoria.
Behind the bureaucratic curtain, re-
search on the remains is by no means a
guaranteed exercise. Berg is on that
committee.
He was happy to tell The Bulletin
how he had confronted and beaten the
“establishment” in the person of Caro.
As Berg sees it, the study of old
bones has done nothing for the Abor-
igines: it has not changed the history
books and it has not given more to eat.
But his line is not very convincing as
pre-history is based on bones and sites
and pre-history has been fundamental
in changing attitudes to Aborigines.'
Other influences may be at work.
Archeologists bluntly deny the view
of urban Aborigines that Aborigines
were always in Australia and who are
not happy with historians referring to
them as the country’s first immigrants,
not happy with even slight cracks to the
mythology upon which some base
claims to land rights.
Australian archeology is under
threat. The Victorian Government has
been stalling on land rights and, in the
absence of moves on that front, seems
unable to control cowboys within its cli-
entele groups. □
THE LIBERALS
Howard de facto
leader of
the opposition
By RICHARD FARMER
IF EVIDENCE was needed that John
Howard has become de facto leader of
the opposition, then deposed Special
Minister of State Mick Young recently
gave it. At his press conference after
standing aside from the ministry,
Young did not have to mention the
name of Liberal leader Andrew Pea-
cock. It was John Howard’s attacks on
him that Young found necessary to try
to laugh off. For while Peacock was
talking loftily about morality in govern-
ment, Howard was homing in on the
matters of fact. Having taken the
trouble to obtain a copy of the forms
normally filled in for unaccompanied
baggage, Howard was able to make a
compelling case that Young must have
made two false statements in his declar-
ation.
When parliament resumes next week
the attack on Young will continue. The
tactical cleverness of the Howard ap-
proach is that telling points can be
made, irrespective of what the inquiry
by Michael Black, QC, finds about any
attempt to fill in a second form. Howard
John Howard: his questions are most feared by the government
argues that if Young answered “No” to
the question as to whether he was im-
porting goods on behalf of any other
person, he was lying. If he answered
“Yes” to this question he was required
to describe the goods but had failed to
do so.
If Young answered “No” to the
question as to whether the baggage con-
tained goods intended as gifts, he made,
consciously or otherwise, an untrue
statement. If he answered “Yes” he was
required to describe the goods, which he
did not do.
In his attacks on Young, the deputy
Liberal leader has continued another of
his themes which is making him the
most feared opposition spokesman.
Other Liberal and National Party mem-
bers have concentrated their attacks on
ministers while probing for a weak link.
Howard brings everything back to
Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
The reasoning is simple. Hawke is
such a dominating personality with such
popularity, that attacking his underlings
does not hurt. The electorate might
think an individual decision is wrong.
But Liberal research indicates that
Hawke escapes the criticism and is
looked on as the people’s saviour by
altering such decisions as the initial one
on means testing pensions.
Howard wants the opposition to
change its strategy and to concentrate
attacks on Hawke himself. Hence his
continual references in the Young affair
to the Prime Minister being party to a
cover up. In the Howard version of
events, Hawke is vacillating and vulner-
able when the pressure is on. He is a
prime minister who cannot act without
the approval and support of the centre
left faction. “Mr Hawke’s failure to act


by the government
with propriety by refusing to sack Mr
Young once again over his latest indis-
cretion shows that the Prime Minister
regards integrity and principle as sec-
ondary to the numbers and Mr
Hawke does not have the numbers,”
was how Howard put it in a speech to
the NSW Council of his party.
In the months leading up to the elec-
tion, Howard will continue the attacks
on Hawke personally. As shadow
treasurer he will also lead the opposi-
tion attacks on Treasurer Paul Keating’s
budget. That will not be an easy task.
An economy growing strongly, with un-
employment and inflation falling, is not
an easy one to criticise. The Howard
line will be to try to persuade voters that
interest rates under Keating are far too
high.
In recent weeks he has made several
statements pointing to an increase in
real interest rates under Labor. Interest
rates have not fallen as quickly as the
inflation rate and Howard will blame
that on the failure to control the budget
deficit.
A courageous attempt, some might
think, after the concentration the gov-
ernment has given to the deficit of $9.6
billion it claims to have inherited. But
Howard does seem to have lived down
the allegation that he was a spendthrift
treasurer in the final stages of the Fraser
Government. Labor’s refusal to make
public the information which would
have allowed a comparable early esti-
mate of this year’s deficit to be made has
certainly added considerably to How-
ard’s claim that the $9.6 billion figure
was a myth used dishonestly to discredit
him.
Earlier this year, Howard was stung
by criticism from a colleague, Wilson
PUBLIC OPINION
Wran slumps
to his equal
lowest rating
CONTINUAL adverse publicity ap-
pears to be having its effect on NSW
Premier Neville Wran’s popularity.
During July, support for the ALP in
NSW was down 1 percent to 47 percent
while Liberal-National Party support
was up 2 percent to 45 percent, the
Morgan Gallup Poll finds. If an election
had been held, it would have been de-
cided on the preferences of the minor
parties.
Wran’s approval rating was down 4
percent to 38 percent while 51 percent
disapproved of the way he was handling
his job. This is the equal lowest Wran’s
approval rating has gone in a Morgan
Gallup Poll. He reached the same level
in August 1982.
Nick Greiner’s approval rating as
Leader of the Opposition was up 3 per-
cent to 52 percent.
These findings came from interview-
ing 1449 electors throughout New South
Wales in July. Electors were asked
which party would receive their first
preference “if a State election were be-
ing held today?” Of the electors sur-
veyed, 8 percent didn’t state their pref-
erence.

Tuckey (member for O’Connor, WA)
that he was running dead in criticising
the government. Tuckey seemed to be
implying that Howard was looking to
his own prospects of becoming leader
after this election rather than ensuring
the best possible result at that election.
Such a charge is groundless as a
glance at the list of statements and
speeches made by Howard this year
shows 123 of them up to the end of
July. And that does not count the in-
numerable radio and television appear-
ances he has made as well. Howard is a
politician always available to the press.
Even as treasurer his phone number re-
mained listed in the Sydney telephone
book. Over the Christmas holiday break
he did not go away because of his belief
that January was a good month to gain
publicity for the cause because there
were so few politicians for the press to
talk to.
Howard has perhaps been a little re-
luctant to go in boots and all because of
sensitivity to a charge of trying to de-
pose his leader. He was embarrassed
early in the year by reports that there
would be an attempt to get rid of Pea-
cock who was then, as now, languishing
badly in the opinion polls. Now that the
election is close and a leadership change
impractical, the restraint of not wanting
to embarrass Peacock is removed.
One reason for Howard’s resurrec-
tion from being the discredited treasurer
in a discredited government is the ca-
pacity of himself and his staff to re-
search the subjects on which he talks.
His private secretary, Dr Gerard Hen-
derson, might have got his doctorate
from La Trobe but he had considerable
experience in the Department of Em-
ployment and Industrial Relations.
Henderson was responsible for How-
ard’s conversion to a more free-market
approach to industrial relations.
Howard’s senior adviser, Michael
Baume, brings Howard a wonderful mix
of talents. A Federal MP until Labor’s
victory last year, Baume is ensured of a
Senate seat after the election. Baume is
a former journalist and a stockbroker
who has a wonderful turn of phrase.
Watch out for the attacks to come on
Hawke for not taking firm action to stop
the industrial lawlessness of the Build-
ers’ Laborers’ Federation. Hawke will
be described as playing Chamberlain in
a 1984 version of appeasement. □
DISCRIMINATION
New federal
Act comes
under fire
By FIA CUMMING
THE FEDERAL Sex Discrimination
Act which came into effect on August 1
is attracting a new round of serious
criticism. This time the attacks come not
from feminists who want a tougher law
or conservatives who see a threat to
their values but from members of the
legal fraternity who regard the Act as at
best problematic and at worst a legal
mess.
The many loopholes in the Act which
protect bastions of sexism are known.
But the legal flaws are likely to cause
more expense and inconvenience to
those attempting to use the Act and
those who find themselves unwittingly
in breach of it.
The problems lie in only a few of the
Act’s 116 sections but they are key sec-
tions. A leading female lawyer with ex-
tensive experience of state anti-dis-
crimination laws said “From a lawyer’s
point of view, I’d be worried. There’s a
lot of it (the Act) that unnerves me.”
The interesting clause is Section 5(2).
It says that discrimination occurs if a
person is made to comply with some-
thing that a “substantially higher pro-
portion of persons of the opposite sex”
can comply with but the person cannot.
It is indirect discrimination, involving
something that appears neutral but in
practice disadvantages one sex.
Similar provisions are included in
the anti-discrimination laws of New
South Wales, Victoria and South Aus-
tralia. But they have been used rarely.
In view of the wide publicity given to
the federal Act and its national applica-
tion, some lawyers tip it will attract
more and more complex cases including
direct discrimination.
Obvious examples of indirect dis-
crimination under Section 5(2) are re-
strictions on height and weight of em-
ployees, as women generally are smaller
and lighter. Three Vietnamese women
have taken a test case under the NSW
Anti-Discrimination Act against Aus-
tralia Post, which rules that mail sorters
must have a certain weight to height
ratio. They filed their case on grounds
of both race and sex but it is still
unresolved.
Another test case involved a woman
dismissed at the age of 59 after long ser-
vice. Her retrenchment pay was cal-
culated on the basis that she would re-
ceive the pension the next year and was
therefore far lower than the payout
given to long-serving men aged 60 who
were dismissed at the same time.
What worries lawyers is that Section
5(2) may cover more subtle forms of al-
leged discrimination. The terms are so
vague that they could cover any situa-
tion in which women are less competi-
tive in their present circumstances.
The Office of the Status of Women,
within the Department of Prime Minis-
ter and Cabinet, believes the Act, unlike
the state discrimination laws, covers age
discrimination. This means, for ex-
ample, that an employer is guilty of dis-
crimination if he (or she) requires ap-
prentices to finish their training before
they are 23 because (the office argues)
women may take a year off to have a
child and be older at a given stage of
their course.
The same argument on time off for
childbirth and child-raising can be ex-
tended to many similar situations. Just
where the line can or should be drawn
will not be known until it is defined by


Senator Susan Ryan: no plans yet to overhaul controversial law
industrial courts and commissions.
The NSW Teachers Federation is
preparing a test case against the Educa-
tion Department on the grounds of in-
direct discrimination. The federation
claims the department’s policy giving
greater promotions to teachers who
work in country areas discriminates
against women teachers who are likely
to be less mobile than men.
The question then arises as to
whether a man who chooses to stay in
one place for the sake of his spouse’s
career could file a complaint of indirect
discrimination. The answer is probably
no, because his decision is not a func-
tion of his sex and is not shared by a
higher proportion of males.
Section 5(2) will provide hours, if not
years, of legal debate. One official of the
Human Rights Commission admitted:
“I tend to wait for things to come up
and then fit them into the Act. Others
tell me it’s extremely difficult to think of
these examples when you are drafting
an Act.”
On a practical level, lawyers also are
concerned by Section 10. It states that,
while a person may take action under
either a state or federal law, a complaint
may not be made under the federal law
if the same complaint has been lodged
at a state level.
But the converse does not apply. So
the probable effect will be that com-
plainants wanting to increase their
chances of success will file first under
the federal law, then under state law if
they are unsuccessful. Apart from the
double-dipping aspect, there are doubts
about the Human Rights Commission’s
ability to cope with a flood of com-
plaints which previously would have
been lodged with state authorities.
The implications of Sections 51 and
52 are more complicated and raise more
profound legal questions. These sec-
tions deal with how complaints are to be
handled.
First, a complaint is lodged with the
Human Rights Commission which then
refers it to Sex Discrimination Commis-
sioner Pamela O’Neill, who attempts to
conciliate it. If conciliation fails, the
commissioner refers the complaint back
to the commission to determine it.
As well as being circular, thi-s process
is regarded as unsound legally. It makes
the commission both the administering
body and the judicial body, raising
questions of objectivity. The commis-
sion has made some initial determina-
tion about whether a complaint has sub-
stance, then is supposed to judge it.
When the NSW Anti-Discrimination
Act came into effect in 1977, a similar
situation occurred. There was a counsel-
lor for equal opportunity plus the Anti-
Discrimination Board for research,
community relations and judicial func-
tions.
After a year, the board admitted it
was running into allegations of bias and
a new structure was found. This created
the Equal Opportunity Tribunal as a
separate judicial body hearing com-
plaints referred by the board. Officials
in NSW are surprised that this lesson
was not incorporated in the new federal
structure.
After the Human Rights Commis-
sion has heard a complaint, further diffi-
culties arise. Under Section 81(2) of the
Act, the commission’s ruling is not
binding. In other words, there is no
punishment for an offender.
There is also no avenue for the re-
spondent to appeal if the commission’s
finding is unfavorable. Major organisa-
tions or government bodies prefer to ap-
peal but will not be able to do so. One
expert on discrimination law says the
federal Act encourages the defendant
simply to ignore the commission’s
ruling, which means that the complaint
process benefits neither side.
However, there is a further appeal
available to the complainant. The com-
mission or the complainant may take
the case to the Federal Court, which can
then make “whatever order it thinks fit.”
In its original form, Section 82 stated
that a determination by the commission
was a prima facie case before the court
but this was deleted, presumably under
pressure from the Opposition in the
Senate. The result is that when the case
goes to the court, it is de novo, which
means the complainant must go through
the whole argument again from scratch.
Dame Roma Mitchell retires as
chairman of the Human Rights Com-
mission in December and is expected to
be replaced by a judge from Supreme
Court level. The new chairman is ex-
pected to make the commission’s pro-
ceedings more legalistic so the process
of taking a complaint through to the
Federal Court will be extremely lengthy,
trying, tiring and expensive for the com-
plainant and respondent.
Finally, reference to the Federal
Court has other hidden drawbacks. The
commission, having administered the
complaint, is likely to be fairly sympath-
etic. It is inclined that way by its experi-
ence of discrimination cases. The Feder-
al Court has no such background. Lead-
ing lawyers feel there may well be wild
variations between the rulings of the
commission and the court which will


create uncertainty and resentment
among all involved.
Reports that the Act is about to be
revamped are circulating already in
NSW legal circles but are being denied
by the office of the minister in charge,
Senator Susan Ryan. Minor changes
will be made in the coming session of
parliament when the review of the Hu-
man Rights Commission is considered
but Ryan’s staff say there are no plans as
yet for the overhaul.
However, they do admit that, like all
legislation, the Act will be watched care-
fully and amended if necessary after
about a year. Given the array of loose
ends spied already by the legal frater-
nity, the amendments cannot come too
soon. □
ELECTIONS
Redistribution
strengthens
federal Labor
By RICHARD FARMER
LABOR’S HOLD on the federal gov-
ernment has been strengthened con-
siderably by electoral boundaries rec-
ommended by the state redistribution
committees. It would take a swing of 3.6
percent for the Liberal and National
parties to regain office, compared with
their loss by 2.2 percent in March last
year. The difference results from the
likely new boundaries producing a sit-
uation in which just over 50 percent of
the two-party preferred vote would be
needed to win government. In most re-
cent elections, Labor needed about 51.5
percent to win and their conservative
opponents only 48.5 percent.
The coalition parties have expressed
unhappiness with the recommended
boundaries but substantial changes
seem unlikely before the Electoral Com-
mission makes a final determination.
The principle of one man/one vote
which the recommendations encompass
is hard to dispute.
That explains why the opposition
parties are basing their challenges on
what they believe to be a lack of com-
munity of interest in some of the
proposed electorates.
Based on the way Australians voted
in 1983, Labor would win 90 seats to the
Liberal and National parties’ 58 if the
final boundaries aligned with those
proposed. The government’s majority
25 in the present 125-seat House of Rep-
resentatives would rise to 32 in the
new House of 148 seats.

The opposition parties have done
worst in NSW. There, nine seats are to
be created and one Riverina abol-
ished. Six of the nine can be classified
as safe Labor: Lindsay, Fowler,
Greenway, Dobell, Charlton and Mort.
Gilmore and Darling are marginal
Labor on 1983 figures. The new seat of
Page would be safe for the Nationals.
In the Sydney metropolitan area,
only the seat of Reid is unchanged but
most of the variations are minor. The
Labor Party’s only real complaint is that
the seat of Calare which they narrowly
won last year would become safe for the
Nationals.
For the first time since federation,
the cities of Bathurst and Lithgow have
been split. To even things up, Paterson
which was a safe National seat
would marginally favor Labor.
But spare a thought for whomever
becomes the member for Darling, to oc-
cupy nearly half of the state. Travelling
from the River Murray to the Queens-
land border is a burden and a half. The
only community of interest in that is
that all the voters are a long way from
anywhere.
While the distances are not nearly so


huge, the member for
the new Tasmanian seat
of Truganini would also
be representing a large
proportion of the state.
Such large elector-
ates are the result of
switching the 10 percent
tolerance of population
differences from rural
areas to the fastest-
growing areas, which
tend to be in the outer
suburbs of the major
cities.
Tasmania would, on
1983 election figures, re-
main a Liberal bastion
although the position
of shadow Immigration
minister Michael Hodg-
man, in Denison, is
slightly weakened. On
the 1980 election result,
Labor would win it.
Labor’s worst result
from the redistribution
has come in Queens-
land where four of the
five new seats favor
the Liberal and National parties. The
Liberals would pick up three, with the
Nationals getting Nicklin.
Whether the theoretical distribution
of 1983 votes means anything after the
Liberal Party rout at the latest state poll
remains to be seen and the Nationals
are sure to be running hard to increase
their gains at the expense of the coali-
tion partner.
On the figures, the National Party
would have to defeat their Liberal col-
leagues to make any gains in Victoria.
The Nationals expected that one of the
six extra seats would become theirs but,
unless the commission overrules the re-
distribution committee, that will not be
the case. The Liberals expect to pick up
one seat and Labor five.
In South Australia and Western Aus-
tralia, the extra seats should split
equally on the 1983 figures between
Labor and non-Labor. The proposed
boundary changes don’t make any real
difference in the Australian Capital Ter-
ritory. And in the Northern Territory
with only one member to be elected
there was, naturally, no need for a redis-
tribution.
For Opposition leader Andrew Pea-
cock, the net result of the redistributions
is terrible. His task will be even harder
come December, when the election is
likely to be held, than he thought when
he became leader that it would be.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke can at
least be thankful to his suspended min-
isterial colleague Mick Young for a job
well done. Young’s changes to the elec-
toral laws have considerably increased
Labor chances of a comfortable win. □
QUEENSLAND
Labor turmoil
looming
after poll defeat
Wayne Goss: not a leadership candidate yet
By DENIS REINHARDT
A MAJOR shake-up in the Labor
Party’s front bench seems certain after
the party’s demoralising defeat in the
Stafford by-election on August 4.
The Liberal victory in Stafford, a
mid-metropolitan Brisbane seat, by for-
mer incumbent Terry Gygar, is being
promoted by Liberals as the first step to
reviving the coalition which crumbled a
year ago leading to their rout at the
October 22 general election.
While these re-marriage overtures re-
main one-sided, it is Labor that has
stumbled badly in losing the seat left
vacant by the death of party president
Dr Dennis Murphy.
Ironically, his October margin over
Gygar of 39 votes was matched exactly
this time in Gygar’s primary vote lead
over his National Party opponent, al-
lowing Gygar to win on National pref-
erences.
Labor at first claimed victory in
Stafford on a 19 percent drift of Liberal
preferences but absentee and electoral
visitor votes changed the situation.
Final counting showed a swing of
just under 4 percent against Labor
proof that Queensland Labor, nearing
its fourth decade out of office, could
overturn conventional wisdom that op-
position parties don’t lose seats mid-
term.
At home in Rockhampton, Leader of
the Opposition Keith Wright took two
phone calls urging him not to resign.
One was from predecessor Tom Burns
and the other from potential successor
Wayne Goss, a 33-year-old Brisbane
lawyer.
Both men assured Wright of their
backing, despite the obvious failure of
the Wright bandwagon which had lifted
Labor to 32 seats in the 82-seat Legisla-
tive Assembly last year. Burns and Goss
warned Wright that he had to get tough.
Goss rejects those in the party
branches who are saying that, after one
parliamentary session as police spokes-
man, he has shown the mettle and pub-
lic presence of a party leader in the style
of South Australian Premier John
Bannon. “If Keith resigns I’m not a can-
didate. There would be other candi-
dates,” Goss said.
However, he is unwilling to rule out
an eventual run for the leadership: “I’m
not prepared to predict that far ahead,”
he told The Bulletin.
Wright returned to Brisbane last
week a confused man, caught by a
mood of desperation within his in-
creasingly factionalised caucus.
“It’s very disturbing for us because
it’s one of the best campaigns on the
ground we’ve run,” he told The Bulletin.
“We had an excellent candidate.
There were no mistakes made and no
one criticised us.
“The image of the party has a ques-
tion mark on it.
“I believe the perception of the party
and I stress the party overall is
negative.”
The centre left faction of caucus,
which includes Goss and several of the
younger, newer members who backed
federal intervention is urging a front-
bench spill.
Wright appears to favor easing out
some of the dead wood.
He said: “It’s time we got honest
with ourselves as to where we’re going
because I don’t want to be leader of the
opposition after 1985.
“I’ve got nothing to lose. It’s time I
belled the cat. I can upset some people
so what. I’ve only got one chance to
be premier and that’s the next time
around because I don’t want to be lead-
er of the opposition again. I will not
stand as leader of the opposition if we
don’t win the next election.
“So I’ve got no alternative now but
to be completely introspective and, if
necessary, to be ruthless to get tough
on myself and on everybody.
“And it’s time that people within the
parliamentary party either shape up or
ship out. That’s my call - we shape up
or we ship out.” □

How to get
rid of
pre-loved junk
By GAIL SHAW
IN RESEARCHING this article, I
acquired an electric drill, an artist’s eas-
el, a large box of oil paints, two terra-
cotta chimney pots and a set of 12 differ-
ent cake and tartlet tins. For someone
whose idea of cooking is a takeaway
chicken, the latter was obviously a com-
pulsive purchase. But for $2.50, their fu-
ture is assured. They’ll go into my next
garage sale. At $5.
The garage sale, like takeaway chick-
en, was invented in America. In that
Babylon of consumerism, flogging your
cast-offs to the neighbors is a way of life.
It’s become so popular in parts of Cali-
fornia that city ordinances have been
passed limiting the number of garage
sales to one a household, a month.
In Australia, domestic goods from
tartlet tins to walnut lowboys and vinyl
sets of Travel Scrabble are changing
hands at a vigorous rate. The garage sale
is proliferating and while several local
councils concede that you should get
permission to hold a sale in a residential
area, there are no restrictions, to date,
on legitimate, clean-out, family-affair
garage sales. These sales reflect the lim-
ited opportunities for making money
through trade-in. You can, of course,
advertise in the paper the bunk beds the
kids have grown out of, but why not
stick them in a garage sale along with all
the other pre-loved possessions lurking
on top of the wardrobe or under the
house. Or as one garage sale holder put
it “all the junk we have in the room the
kids call Hell.”
It’s hard to resist the bargains of a
garage sale and it’s heartening to note
that the stigma once attached to second-
hand goods doesn’t apply to the garage
sale. Garage sales transcend socio-econ-
omic barriers you’re just as likely to
find one in Toorak as you are in Tempe.
A recent sale in one of Sydney’s sil-
vertail suburbs looked like a big auction
without the lot numbers.
You don’t need a garage to hold a
garage sale, but it helps, particularly,
when it rains. Most are amateur events
but one I know of in Sydney’s Eastern
Suburbs is sufficiently well organised to
accept Bankcard.
While every sale is different there are
marked similarities. Each one is an altar
to obsolescence stacked with objects
that have outlived their usefulness at
least in their owner’s eyes. And there are
plenty of reminders of failed intent: the
set of LP language courses, the knitting
machine that needed the patience of
Mother Teresa to operate, the exercise
bicycle that never got you anywhere
except to the chiropractor.
A sure sign that the garage sale has
arrived is the handy advice now being
offered in women’s magazines as to how
to organise one. Local and daily news-
papers also advertise forthcoming sales.
But the usual advertising media for a
garage sale is a large crudely lettered
sign tacked to a nearby telegraph pole.
On the curving road known as the
“Bilgola Bends” on Sydney’s northen
beaches they “buy” consecutive poles
taking advantage of a captive audience.
There are the personal ads: “Happy
Birthday, Michele” and “Welcome
Home, Rod.” There are lost and founds
and then there are the garage sales
which currently offer all sorts of bits and
pieces including one cryptic proposition
which simply reads “Drum Kit. Suit
Pro.”
An affluent Sydney couple put their
sign on a large canvas banner pos-
itioned so that it catches the attention of
travellers on a nearby bus route. For the
past couple of years this particular sale
has provided pocket money for the
couple’s annual overseas trip.
While garage sales have proliferated
in Australia, in England the concept is
virtually unknown.
Apart from a dearth of garages,
Anglo-Saxon sensibilities are still
recovering from the impact of war-time
rationing. It’s a memory which sees
England’s stateliest housekeepers still
saving the butter wrappers.
Councils willing, the garage sale will
continue to be an on-going event in
Australia. Look around, maybe you’re
sitting on a small fortune. There’s that
old settee the dog starting eating; and
the boxed collection of Mario Lanza’s
greatest hits. And look! There in the
back of the kitchen cupboard. A set of
cake and tartlet tins. Some fool’s bound
to buy those! □

Rialto is now leasing. More than
27,000m-’ is already committed and
further areas will be ready for
occupation before the end of
the year.
The time to have initial
discussions with the sole leasing
agents is now. While the builders are
still hard at work. You’ll have an
excellent choice of floor areas. And,
possibly, even make considerable
savings on fit-out costs.
Australia’s new landmark is, not
surprisingly, attracting considerable
interest. For instance, its sensitive
blending of history and the future is
just one of the benefits the develop-
ment offers Melbourne. Without it,
the Rialto and Winfield buildings
would not now be undergoing a
transformation which will give them
a new lease of life as Melbourne’s
grandest hotel - Menzies-at-Rialto.
And then there’s the range and
adaptability of the floor areas, the
advanced systems and facilities, the
convenience of the building and its
uniqueness in so many different
aspects. All these make Rialto a very
desirable proposition.
Now is the best time to discuss
your requirements with the agents,
if you would like to know more or if
you would care to visit the new Rialto
Marketing Centre, where you will be
given a comprehensive presentation
on Rialto please phone sole leasing
agents, Richard Ellis or Jones Lang

Bulletin/Qantas Businesswoman of the Year
Women in the big money
The search has begun for The Bulletin -Qantas Business Woman of the Year. In
keeping with this , GLENNYS BELL reports the progress of women into
managerial positions.
WHO ARE Australia’s $lOO,OOO-a-year
women?
Until a few years ago, no one would
have bothered to ask that question.
Women were thought of not as big mon-
eymakers but rather as beneficiaries.
Today, it is different. Women are
running their own businesses and have
become millionaires in the process. A
few are reaping salaries in the six-figure
bracket. They are numbered among the
655 women whose taxable income was
more than $lOO,OOO in 1981-82, the
latest figures available.
Of these, there were eight women in
the non-provisional-tax area whose
salaries, including directors’ fees, com-
missions and bonuses, made them
$lOO,OOO-a-year executives.
Clustered beneath them were 67
women with salaries between $50,000
and $lOO,OOO, while there were another
255 with earnings between $40,000 and
$50,000.
Overall, there were 9405 women
whose taxable income from all sources
was between $40,000 and $lOO,OOO.
They included women who owned their
own companies or were partners with
their husbands; professional women
such as lawyers, doctors and architects,
on their own or in partnership; and
women whose income was derived pri-
marily from investments or family com-
panies.
Many of them are women who have
been nominated for The Bulletin-Qantas
Business Woman of the Year or whose
names are likely to appear in nomina-
tions for the award for 1985, which
opens this week.
In the fashion area they include the
1981 winner, Carla Zampatti, Prue
Acton, designer of the Australian Olym-
pic team uniforms, and Adele Weiss,
designer of Westpac’s uniforms. There
is also Lorraine St Clair, manufacturer
and distributor of 1928 Jewellery.
In retailing, there is Barbara Slayter
of Barbara’s House and Garden and
Gerd Kastengren, importer and retailer
of Scandinavian Ikea furniture.
There have been top women from
merchant banking and finance, inclu-
ding Jillian Broadbent, of BT Australia,
and Edith van Dommelen, of Trade
Credits Ltd. In the commission area
there have been Kath Dalling, with
multi-million dollar insurance sales;
Dorothy Rosewell, top real estate agent;
and Rosemary Moore and Diana Rose,
executives with Field Enterprises, a di-
rect book-selling company, who were
earning $BO,OOO a year as far back as
1980. In the computer industry there is
an increasing number of success stories,

among them the 1984 Bulletin-Q antas
Business Woman of the Year, Hinke
Haisma.
Compared with a decade ago,
women have made dramatic impact in
the business world and the big money
stakes but they are still far from a match
for men.
In the $lOO,OOO and over bracket,
there are 2525 men and 296 of them are
salary earners in the non-provisional-
tax section. In the taxable income range
of $40,000 to $lOO,OOO there are nearly
50,000 and of these 22,550 are salary
earners.
Among women salary earners, those
in the public sector appear to be the
trend setters. In the federal public ser-
vice there are three female deputy
secretaries, whose salaries are more
than $60,000 a year. Helen Williams in
Education and Ann Kern in Health are
the equivalent of general managers in
business.
They oversee departments respon-
sible for million-dollar budgets and
huge staffs and have policy and decision
making functions.
On the state level, there are Pat
O’Shane, the first woman to head a gov-
ernment department in Australia, head
of the NSW Aboriginal Affairs Depart-
ment, and Pamela Grant, director of
NSW’s State Lotteries.
There is also Dr Rhonda Mclver, a
businesswoman who is also president of
NSW’s Metropolitan Water Sewerage
and Drainage Board on a part-time
basis.
There are few women with similar
responsiblities or salaries in the private
corporate sector. This is reflected in the
small numbers eligible for appointment
to the thousands of federal and state
authorities and boards in the country.
Since Labor took office in March
1983 more than 100 women most of
them from academic or non-commer-
cial life have been appointed to bod-
ies such as the Advanced Education
Council, the Australia Council and the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
The day has yet to come when a woman
is appointed to the board of the Reserve
Bank.
Dr Anne Summers, director of the
Office of the Status of Women, said the
criteria required for some boards are
difficult for women to meet. “They ex-
pect a female Rod Carnegie.”
Eventually, there may be female
business barons and industry tycoons,
the federal government’s affirmative ac-
tion policy may provide the stimulus if
companies introduce equal opportunity
employment programs with the same
committment as Esso and G. J. Coles.
Unlike the majority of large compan-
ies in Australia, neither waited for out-
side pressure. Esso took on Joan Ford
as an equal employment officer in 1980.
Since then, the number of women em-
ployed has gone from 200 to 409 17
percent of the staff.
The most significant change has been
in the managerial/professional level,
where the number of women has in-
creased from 30 to 118. Among them are
geologists, engineers, accountants, law-
yers, a doctor and computer analysts.
Even in the trades area there has been a
change, with 11 female apprentices em-
ployed.
The first year provided difficulty in
some areas, as Ford explained. “There
were significant changes as women
moved into areas where they had never
been before. It required awareness, edu-
cation, sympathy and work.” It also
required the backing of top manage-
ment. Five years later, Ford reports,
everyone managers, supervisors and
employees is more comfortable with
the concept.
At G. J. Coles there was similar com-
mitment. Some time ago, managing di-
rector Brian Quinn recognised that a

company which employed 50,000
women out of its staff of 79,000 and
which relied primarily on female cus-
tomers had to change its attitudes and
promote women into senior manage-
ment.
In 1983 a steering committee was set
up to introduce equal opportunity em-
ployment practices and to help women
up the promotional ladder by providing
management courses.
A few years ago, not even the
smallest Coles store had a female man-
ager. Today, a woman manages a K-
mart and others are Coles store man-
agers or section managers responsible
for turnovers of millions of dollars.
There are more than 100 women in
management position.
But there are problems. Recently, the
company advertised for trainee man-
agers, the executives of the future. Only
10 percent of the applicants were
women.
Deborah Marr, the assistant director
of Sydney University’s Appointments
Board, is not surprised at the limited
ambitions and expectations of young
women. One of her objectives is to raise
the awareness of girls about career op-
portunities. The university has been
holding conferences on opportunities
for careers in mathematics and .science.
Marr finds many female
undergraduates flock to cer-
tain kinds of courses, not be-
cause of career opportunities
but because of vague appeal.
“They bolt in to any course
with ‘bio’ in front of it be-
cause they are fascinated by
the body, not because they
want to be biochemists. And
they bolt into the computer
sciences but their expectations
are low. They think of be-
coming programmers; the
men think of becoming
systems analysts.”
Women are still on the
lowest level of the manage-
ment structure, according to a
comprehensive study being
carried out by Dr Leonie Still,
a senior lecturer at the NSW
Institute of Technology. She
selected 182 major companies
in Australia, based on their
listings on the Sydney Stock
Exchange according to assets,
number of employees, indus-
try dominance and turnover.
Women made up 30 percent of the
workforce in the top companies but
only 3 percent of them held manage-
ment positions.
Women make up nearly 45 percent
of the Australian workforce as a whole
with two-thirds clumped in the clerical,
sales and services area and fewer than 3
percent in administrative or managerial

positions. There are only 0.4 percent of
women in the workforce earning more
than $50,000 a year.
Of the 3 percent of women Still sur-
veyed in management positions, most
were at the lower end of the scale in
terms of power and money. Sixty per-
cent were described as supervisors while
the remainder were included in man-
agement. Still found women
were paid less in managerial
positions. At junior levels it
came to about $2OOO a year
less; at senior levels, the
difference was about $lO,OOO.
There were only seven
women directors. Still asked
the companies why so few.
“Most replied that the women
lacked the qualifications or
experience or were only just
being admitted to manage-
ment positions,” she said. “A
few said honestly that it was
because they had conservative
boards or were in male-
dominated industries.”
On the basis of her study,
Still has reservations about
the prospects for women in
management. “Women are
moving in but at the lower
levels. I think there will be a
bulge there, with women not
going up the management lad-
der at the same rate as men.”
Most of the women in her
survey had been promoted within the
company while the men were divided
between those promoted from within
and those who joined from outside. The
women were being given management
courses with the company to improve
their skills but few were sent to outside
business administration courses.

face is failing to plan for the long term.
Still believes women are promoted by
working hard and proving themselves.
This probably works against them. As
she sees it, men don’t work as hard but
always have their eyes on the next step.
“It’s part of women’s need for approval.
They feel insecure and they’re grateful
for promotion and then they work to
prove the person who took the risk was
justified. They expect natural justice to
reward them for working hard. Thing’s
don’t work like that. It’s the men who
get promoted.”
Professor Di Yerbury, now general
manager of the Australia Council after
several years with the Australia Gradu-
ate School of Management at the Uni-
versity of NSW, believes the status of
women has improved slightly. ‘‘Clearly,
there are a lot of talented women who
have made it and many who have the
potential, so there is no reason why they
should not succeed in equal proportion
with the men.”
There are barriers to overcome; atti-
tudes from birth, the social conditioning
of men and women about male and fe-
male stereotypes and about women’s
roles and abilities.
Yerbury believes social changes will
take so long to come about that institu-
tional changes such as legislation are
required. But she also believes men are
begining to rethink their own roles and
stereotypes.
“Values are changing among men as
well as women on what is fair of an or-
ganisation to expect of them in terms of
the effect on their personal life and fam-
ily. They’re weighing up the trade-offs.
The aspects which worry women about
the corporate world may be undergoing
change.”
Still believes women, too, will have
to change in their attitudes. There are a
lot of women gaining degrees in busi-
ness administration but many of them
are being channelled into “soft” areas
personnel is one example and not
recognising the dangers. “They are not
going into line management, into the
areas which lead to top executive pos-
itions,” she said. “A lot of them haven’t
planned their careers but have taken a
random rather than systematic ap-
proach.”
When Deborah Marr talks to school-
girls about career planning, she empha-
sises that they are going to support
themselves for the rest of their lives. It
surprises them because it is not how
they think. “They still think in terms of
doing something until they are 26 and
then they stop thinking. In my day it
was 25, so I suppose we’ve pushed it
back a year.” □

HISTORY
How a PoW survived The Bomb
Hiroshima after the bomb: in the foreground, what was to become the Dome of Peace
When the Americans dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945,
EDWARD SA WYER was a prisoner-of-war working in the city's dockyards.
Now, 39 years later, he gives a graphic account of that terrible day.
THE DOOR is kicked open
and the guard shouts
“Speedo! Tenko!” Then he
runs the length of the wooden
hut hitting his stick against the
poles supporting the 80 bunk
beds. It is 6am and I am
jarred back into the misery of
another day as a prisoner-of-
war of the Japanese. The
guard is over 40 and feeble-
minded and his uniform is too
long for his stubby frame, so
we call him “Dopey,” but his
efforts are being reinforced by
the vicious sergeant standing
in the doorway looking for an
excuse to use his long flat stick
tapered like a sword.
I lever myself wearily on to
an elbow and unroll the green
drill trousers I have used for a
pillow and drag them over the
long, dingy-white underpants,
then tuck in the khaki shirt I
have slept in to keep off the
fleas. I pull on the tabis
(Japanese rubber boots with
toe space for the big toe sep-
arated from the rest of the
foot) and roll up the strip of
woven straw matting, all that
A reminder of horror: the Dome of Peace today

separates emaciated hips from
the wooden planked bed.
Every day begins in the
same way and after three-and-
a-half years there is an apa-
thetic acceptance of the rude
awakenings, the gnawing
hunger, the disease and ill-
health, even the beatings.
The morning air is fresh,
the sky clear with the promise
of a hot day as the sun comes
up behind the hills which sur-
round the prison camp. The
camp commandant comes out
of the administration build-
ing, turns and salutes the
Rising Sun flag hanging limp
on the pole above, then he
faces the assembled company
of PoWs Americans, Aus-
tralians, British, Chinese,
Dutch, Indians and Malay-
ans. With eyes front, we are
ordered to bow from the
waist. He salutes, then walks
up and down the lines with his
retinue and returns to the
building.
We wait apprehensively
for what comes next as the
sergeant medical orderly takes


over. He has a hard, square-jawed face
and he is the most hated man in the
camp. We call him “Septic.” Walking
slowly down the lines, he peers through
his metal-rimmed spectacles for any
signs of weakness. He stops before a
rangy, raw-boned man who is swaying
slightly in his efforts to stand upright.
The orderly looks up closely and asks in
quiet, solicitous tones what is wrong.
The man speaks, holding his
stomach. Septic takes a step back, then
punches him in the midriff. The man
doubles up and his knees buckle. Then
the medic with the red cross on his
sleeve becomes a raving sadist. Scream-
ing accusations of lying and laziness, he
kicks the prostrate man time after time.
An ominous hush descends as we
listen to the sickening thuds. There is a
loud click of a cocked machine-gun and
all eyes turn to the watchtower where
the muzzle is aiming down at us. When
Septic has had his fun, he calls the guard
and the unconscious victim is dragged
by the heels into a hut.
We are then issued with our midday
meal, which comes in bentos (wooden
boxes about 20cm x 10cm x scm deep)
packed with brown rice, a few soya
beans and radishes and two slivers of
sun-dried fish the size of small sardines.
Chopsticks are wedged in under the
sliding lid. Thus equipped, we set out in
open lorries, 20 men and two armed
guards to each, for a day’s hard labor in
a coal mine, an iron foundry, digging up
yams and other vegetables or unloading
cargo on the docks. We never see our
Red Cross parcels. They have been
opened and the contents consumed by
our captors.
For about 30km we speed along,
bouncing and swaying over pot-holed
winding roads through the hills, stop-
ping to off-load men until we reach the
docks at the delta of the Ota River. I
jump down and a Japanese hancho
(foreman) points me to 5000 tonnes of
rusting freighter tied up at the wharf. I
know it well. For the past two days I
have been unloading its sickly-smelling
cargo of brown sugar, war booty from
the Dutch East India Company. There
are eight of us, enough for two gangs
four below, four above storing the
bags in the adjacent warehouse. We toss
a coin to see who goes below to work
the first two loads. I lose and go aboard
with Keith, Bluey and Curly who is
balding all Australians. I am the only
English PoW in the ship.
We climb the metal ladder into the
stifling atmosphere of the lowest hold.
The only light comes from a dangling
electric bulb and the small patch of blue
sky seen seen through the hatch about
10 metres above. We strip to the waist
and start tugging at the heavy sacks and
all the flies which have been crawling
over the sticky hessian transfer their at-

tentions to our sweating bodies. Breath-
ing hard in the fetid air, we drag the
bags on to the loading board lowered by
the crane.
“Do not exceed 10001 b (450
kilograms),” says the notice. When four
bags have been stacked, we signal to the
PoW on deck and step back as the hook
takes up the slack on the metal chains
and the swaying load is hauled out of
the hold.
Thankful for a brief respite, we wipe
off the sweat and fill the tiny metal
bowls of the Japanese pipes with finely-
shredded tobacco, then squat, puffing
away, waiting for the board to be low-
ered again. Another four sacks are
hauled up and it is time to change
gangs. As we start to climb the ladder,
the hancho pokes his head over the
coaming of the hatch and orders us
back to work another load. We yell up
to him that we have done our stint but
he threatens us so we back down and
drag out more sacks.
Suddenly, a brilliant white light fills
every corner of the hold. Blinded by the
dazzle, we stagger backward and sprawl
on the deck as the ship is sucked down-
ward. It rocks and shakes and shudders
in the grip of some mighty force, then
rises again to lurch violently to star-
board with a loud grinding as the side
scrapes against the concrete wharf.
Large flakes of metal begin to shower
down on us from the rusty bulkheads. A
thunderous rumbling outside becomes
louder and louder.
The sea is pounding the ship and we
can hear the rigging being wrenched
from the deck by a cyclonic wind. The
electric light has gone out and we lie in
the dark, petrified, clinging to the sticky
bags while the ship is tossed around and
our ears are bombarded by an unearthly
noise that thunders on and on.
Slowly, the horrendous turbulence
begins to abate and the ship steadies
into a listing position. Through ringing
ears, I can hear Australian voices.
“Bloody hell! What is it?”
“Earthquake!”
“Typhoon, more like! That wind!”
I look up at the hatch and the blue
sky has turned leaden grey.
“What about that flash?”
“Could’ve been a bomb on the
dock.”
“I didn’t hear an explosion. Did you
hear a bang?” None of us heard an ex-
plosion, so it couldn’t have been a
bomb.
“What is it, then?”
WE SHOUT up with cupped hands to
anyone who can hear us. No answer.
The temperature in the hold has risen
dramatically and the heat is almost un-
bearable. We decide to climb out. Bluey
grasps the ladder and lets go with a yell.
The metal is too hot to handle; even the
he man who
works flat out
deserves to lie down in the
sun in Penang.

bulkheads below the waterline are warm
to the touch. We stay in our oven hold,
speculating and fearful.
Soon, we hear the patter of rain and
see large black drops falling through the
hatch. Something about them is sinister
and we move further away as the drops
become a steady downpour, soaking
and staining the bag on the loading
board. With a morbid fascination, we sit
looking at this weird black rain until it
stops almost as quickly as it started.
AFTER ALL this there is a strange
silence outside occasionally shattered
by the crack then thud of falling mason-
ry. We shout up again but hear only the
echo of our own voices, so we wait in
the sheltering gloom, feeling marooned.
A long time passes, then we hear
footsteps on the deck. We jump up and
call again. A face covered with a white
surgical mask looks down.
‘‘Matte! Matte!” he calls in Japanese,
“Wait! wait! Stay where you are.”
“What has happened?”
“Terrible danger! Fire! Many dead.
Wait!” He disappears.
We wait, none the wiser. He returns
about an hour later, this dock official,
and lowers a wicker basket on a rope.
Inside is a bottle of water and bentos of
rice balls wrapped in seaweed. The rice
is white, the first white rice we have had
Fleeing the destruction: a trainload of survivors
They dropped the bomb: the crew of the American B-29, Enola Gay
for years. It helps to pass the time as we
sit eating and listening to the sounds of
shovelling and shouting in the distance,
then more footsteps and voices on deck.
Three masked faces peer
down at us. An American
voice tells us that he is a doc-
tor and has Japanese medics
with him. He throws down
four oilskin coats and tells us
to put them on before coming
up. The ladder has cooled and
we climb into a scorched and
devastated world.
The bent crane tilts
dangerously with the driver
dead in his cabin. The ship’s
funnel is lying on its side in a
twisted heap; the listing deck
is strewn with rigging and the
bridge is shattered but below
it the ship’s bell remains,
hanging at an angle, the tar-
nished brass with the etched
lettering “Glasgow Clydeside
1912” still readable. The
guardrails on the starboard
side are caught under the lip
of the wharf, holding the ship
in its listing position, and
through the upward tilting
portside rails we can see the
river, flowing out to sea, car-
rying dozens of burnt bodies
in its current, some still cling-
ing together in pathetic
groups.
Looking up river, we see
what had been the city of
Hiroshima. For more than 3
sq km, nearly every building
has been pulverised into piles of rubble
and over all this scene of devastation
hangs a leaden pall of smoke. Far
above, the sky is still blue.
NONE of us has seen such destruction
before. When the doctor (a United
States Marine major who was taken
prisoner in the Philippines) tells us that
it was all done by one bomb, it is be-
yond our comprehension. The over-
whelming stench is real enough and we
waste no time putting on the masks, im-
pregnated with a disinfectant which
dulls the nauseating smells of burnt
flesh, acrid smoke and hot metal.
The charred body of the hancho is
near the bow where he sat supervising
and among some fallen rigging is the
body of the PoW who passed out signals
to the crane driver. We look at him,
sombrely remembering how we had
been kept below, then climb on to the
wharf to look for the other three men.
The roof of the warehouse has been
blown off, exposing iron girders. The
clock in the wall is intact with the hands
on its blackened face pointing at 8.15.
An army medical truck is parked among
the debris and civil defence workers are
trying to move the dead scattered over
the wharf. When they attempt to pick up
one, the burnt skin slides off like a
jumper peeling off a body.
Sickened, we walk toward the ware-
house where we used to wait for the
loads, seated on the ground with backs
against the wall. There we find the bod-
ies of the other PoWs. Two have
slumped forward but the third is sitting
upright, staring ahead grotesquely with


eyes slowy melting in waxen rivulets
down his red, swollen face. We stare
back in stricken silence.
“Come on,” says the major. Having
confirmed that we are the only survi-
vors, he becomes anxious. “There’s
nothing we can do, so let’s get going.”
“Where are you taking us?”
“Just get your asses out of here! Or
you’ll end up like them!”
He implies that he has seen enough
today to fear reprisals from the
Japanese survivors, so we follow him
and wait while he has a few quick words
with one of the Japanese medics who
seem to understand some English. Then
the major leads us off down the quay.
The wooden buildings which stood
inside the dock gates are piles of ash,
with the incinerated remains of guards
nearby. We hurry along, sweating under
the oilskin coats (civil defence issue)
which help to conceal our identity, past
a group of Japanese soldiers brought in
from an outlying garrison to dig for sur-
vivors among the rubble, past canted
telegraph poles with drooping, tangled
wires; past a blackened wall with a grey,
ghostly outline of a human figure who
was standing beside it when the flash
occurred. The major is quizzing us as we
go-
“ Any of you got burns from the
flash?”
“No.”
“Did you get any of the black rain on
you?”
“No.”
“Just as well. It burns, too. Leaves a
grey stain on the skin. Better have a
good wash down when you get back and
ask your MO to check you over.”
His face is cut and bloodied down
one side and he tells us of his miracu-
lous escape when the hospital in which
he was working as a PoW doctor col-
lapsed around him. He was buried
under rubble but clawed his way out to
join the rescue operations. He tells us
about two women who were entering
the hospital together when the bomb
went off. One was killed by the flash; the
other had her clothes blown off, leaving
her alive and her naked body
unmarked.
On the outskirts of the city, we pass a
square that has been turned into a medi-
cal clearing station. It is crowded with
people, waiting in queues, many burnt
and bleeding, with long strips of skin
hanging from swollen, naked bodies.
There is no hysteria or panic only
the quiet desperation of the first-aid
teams working on the injured and the
shocked, dazed stares of the onlookers.
For the first time, I feel pity and sor-
row for the Japanese.
“Oh, Jesus!” says the major, shaking
his head. “Just take a look at all that
terrible suffering. Why was it necessary,
for Chrissake? They were almost beat-

en, anyway. Why did they do it? Why?
Why?” It is a question soldiers often
ask.
Despite feelings of compassion, I
have caught the major’s anxiety about
our safety and when he takes us to an
assembly point where some army trucks
are lined up I watch nervously while he
speaks to the officer in charge. Then a
teenager soldier, toting a rifle, escorts us
to a truck. We climb in and take off the
oilskin coats and give them back to the
major who is returning to his medical
post. We cannot thank him enough for
rescuing us and, the good medico to the
end, he reminds us to get our MO to
check us over.
THE JAPANESE soldier climbs in with
us and the rear canvas flaps are laced
down. We wait for the driver, sitting in
Victims of the first atomic bomb: Hiroshima dead after the blast
numbed silence yet marvelling at our
survival among so much death and de-
struction. When the truck moves off,
twisting and turning to find a clear route
away from the flattened city, the soldier
leans across and tugs the laced flaps
apart to peer out. Through the chinks
between the canvas we can see the fa-
cade of a Christian church still stand-
ing, its Gothic arched doorway leading
only to smouldering debris.
As we climb the hills beyond, there
are stark, burnt trees, many uprooted,
devoid of any foliage.
When we reach the camp, the per-
imeter fence is flattened and one roof
has been blown off a storehouse. We are
told that a freakish wind blew up and
did the damage. No one believes us
when we tell them that it was a bomb.
WE HEAD for the water tank and
splash our bodies over and over, trying
to wash away the sights and smells of
the day, then go into the hut and flop
exhausted on our bunks. The senior
American PoW colonel comes in to see
us. The grapevine has been buzzing
since our return. We try to describe to
him the enormity of what we have seen.
When we tell him it was caused by one
bomb, he looks at us sceptically.
We tell him about the Marine major
and the colonel sends us off to see the
PoW doctor who does the best he can to
check us over. Apart from feeling emo-
tionally shattered, we are physically un-
scathed. Then the PoWs from the iron
foundry return and tell us they saw a
flash, heard the wind and felt the earth
tremor. The workers in the vegetable
fields not far from the camp were only
aware of the sudden wind and a darken-
ing of the sky. The men in the coal mine
far away in the hills knew nothing about
what had happened.
EVENING ROLL-CALL is four men
short and only Keith, Bluey, Curly and
I know the horror of their instantaneous
deaths. Then the guards call for us to
assemble on the parade ground. There is
an air of anxiety as we wait for the camp
commandant. As camp commandants
go, he is not as bad as some we have
known; he teaches in a university in civ-
ilian life and has no stomach for his job,
preferring to turn a blind eye to the ex-
cesses of Septic and his like.
Another commandant had as-
sembled us after the incendiary raid on
Tokyo when there was the whiff of de-
feat among our captors. “Japanese Im-
perial Forces fight to the death,” he had
screamed at us from his wooden box.
“Every man fight to the death. Before
we die, we kill you! You all get killed
to death. Every man killed to death.”
He left us in no doubt about his inten-
tions and we wonder what will happen
now that the end of the war is in sight.
The commandant appears with his
retinue and we bow from the waist as
usual. He salutes and orders us to stand
at ease. His manner is solemn as he
starts to speak in English.
“Today, America drop big bomb on
Hiroshima ...” His voice rises in anger
as he tells of the damage and loss of life,
then comes a note of defence. “America
would not drop bomb if Japan had big
bomb because if Japan had big bomb,
Japan would bomb San Francisco ...”
He repeats it over and over, naming
every American city he can think of and
we listen with rising anxiety eyeing
the manned machine-gun. Then, to our
intense relief, he announces that the
camp is to be evacuated and we will be
taken by train to Niigata.
I LIE ON my bunk, listening to the
other men all talking at once. Some are
jubilant, as if the war were already over;
others point out our danger from
Japanese vengeance and the risk of be-
ing caught in the crossfire of an Ameri-
can invasion. There is wild talk of
The feelings
of Edward Sawyer
EDWARD SAWYER is a fit and active
67-year-old but like most Far-East
PoWs (29,000 of 98,000 British, Austra-
lian and American prisoners did not
survive captivity), he had a long haul
back to health. Years of maltreatment
left their scars. He suffered from dysen-
tery, malaria and nervous and skin dis-
orders.
Sawyer was captured while serving
as a sergeant with an anti-aircraft bat-
tery on the island of Timor in February
1942 but it was not until 18 months later
that his family were notified that he was
still alive.
Deprived of letters from home, he
kept a diary. He addressed his entries to
his fiancee, Mary. The thought of her
waiting for him gave him the courage to
keep going under the most appalling
conditions.
He weighed 48kg when freed in 1945.
Two years of recuperation followed be-
fore he was well enough to resume work
in civilian life.
He and Mary married in July 1947
but were told that they would probably
not be able to have a family. Their only


making a break-out over the flattened
fence.
I think about the prison camp in
Niigata on the north-west coast of
Honshu where I spent a miserable win-
ter working long hours in the steel-
works. I know it is a large naval port
which could be bombed like Hiroshima
and I feel sick with a fearful uncertainty
about the immediate future.
Then it is time to board the trucks
which will transport us to the nearest
railway station. I remove one of the
planks on my bunk and feel around for
the small hidden notebook which has
been my pencilled diary for the past
three and a half years and tuck it into
my shirt along with the dog-eared
photograph of my fiancee, Mary. The
spare shirt and trousers and a battered
felt bush hat are rolled up in the straw
bedding mat and covered with a
blanket. The Japanese pipe and the
wooden tobacco box hang by string
around my neck. With all my worldly
goods, I join the others lining up at the
trucks.
Darkness is falling as we board the
train and begin the long ride north.
Listening to the rhythm of the wheels on
the track I begin to feel, after a while, a
glimmer of hope that this may be the
first leg of my journey back to freedom
the beginning of the end of years of
brutal slavery. □

child, a healthy son, was born 14 years
later.
In 1979, Edward Sawyer retired after
32 years working as a printer. His wife
had died of cancer a year earlier. As a
tribute to her, he says: “She waited for
me all those long war years and without
her care and understanding afterwards,
I know I would not have survived.
When she died in her mid 50s that was
the hardest blow of all.”
Though he knows better than most
the full horror of nuclear weapons, Saw-
yer is no unilateralist.
“I will never forget the day Hiro-
shima was bombed,” he says, “but since
then the world has learned to live with
the threat of nuclear war and only the
balance of this power has kept the peace
in Europe for nearly 40 years.
“Technology has advanced at an
alarming pace but human nature has
not changed throughout man’s history.
“Men, not weapons, make war. The
strong will always take what they can
and the weak give what they must. The
question of morality or justice arises
only when pressures are equal.
“With the world today dividing itself
into power blocks, neutrality is an illu-
sion and unilateral nuclear disarma-
ment can only lead us into slavery.” □

THE MD-80. THE TOP CHOICE FOR THE BOTTOM LINE.


;\ik.
m
For maximum profit, appeal to passengers and for return on investment, 28 airlines
around the world already have selected the quiet, fuel-efficient MD-80.
Here's why: The MD-80 flies 25% more seat miles per gallon of fuel than any older
aircraft it is replacing. The operational versatility of the MD-80 family offers
exceptional service options for airlines. And passengers consistently praise its
comfort. In independent surveys, they prefer it by more than three-to-one over
its competitors.
The traits that give the MD-80 family superior economics for airlines make it more
attractive for investors. MD-80s continue the McDonnell Douglas tradition of
quality and longevity that has made our twin-jets hold higher residual values than
competing aircraft.
The new MD-80. When we designed it, we made sure that one of its most
beautiful lines would be the bottom line—where profits are.

YOUR CHILDREN
ARE SAFEST
WHEN THEY’RE
TUCKED IN
Other wagon manufacturers may
offer you as large a load space as a Volvo.
That’s a massive two cubic metres.
But do they offer you and your
family equal safety protection?
Here at the heart of our wagon is the
cradle your children will never outgrow.
The world-famous Volvo Safety Cage.
It has roof pillars that do more than
support a neat design principle.
Compared to ordinary wagons, they
are extra brawny for extra protection.
Just before, and just after the Safety
Cage are crumple zones.
The front zone is very specialised,
having an unusually “long travel” to
absorb greater impact.
Here, for lateral protection, you get
heavy steel bars in the doors.
And here the five door locks are
probably the best “burst-proof’ design
available. A fact that can be crucial to
you should you have an accident.
Because doors that fly open can
seriously weaken the structure of a car.
Test drive the Volvo wagon and it
will become obvious its designers aren’t
all bachelors.
They’re family men, intent on prod-
ucing a safer, more solid wagon.
A wagon that recognises
kids are more valuable
than cargo.

Doctors not unanimous about smoking
DAVID M c NICOLL
DON’T THINK for a moment that doc-
tors are unanimous about stamping out
smoking. They may condemn the habit
but they have reservations about forbid-
ding smoking altogether.
At a board meeting of one of Syd-
ney’s biggest hospitals last week it was
proposed by a board member that
smoking in the hospital should be pro-
hibited.
This proposal drew immediate criti-
cism from some of the medicos. One of
them pointed out that such a ban would
mean nobody would be able to get into
the hospital’s lavatories because so
many people would be seated therein
having a surreptitious fag.
Another pointed out that certain
patients being treated for a specific
complaint got considerable assistance
and relief from smoking a cigarette.
LOTS OF reasons for sadness reading
the press these days. In New Zealand
the Prime Minister, David Lange,
stamped himself as a troglodyte by an-
nouncing that South African represen-
tation in his country must end. Coming
on top of his nuclear ship stance, it is
obvious that he plans to lead all his fel-
low troglodytes back to the caves.
Then dear old Patrick White. The
feline quip, the asinine observation,
falling from the quavering lips of the
man whose only surviving Labor god is
Gough. The worst part of his rather
loony speech was his attack on Hazel
Hawke. An unpleasant, low-down
scratch at a very decent and greatly re-
spected woman.
THE EASIEST way to lose weight is to
cut out grog for a few months. But what
a time I chose to start! On September 1,
the Champagne Information Centre
puts on a picnic to announce the win-
ners of the annual Vin de Champagne
award. Twenty-five French champagnes
will be tested by the picnickers.
That was the straight left. The right
cross is an invitation to the Beaujolais
Tasting Fair at the Hilton on Friday and
Saturday, August 24 and 25. If any of
my interested readers would care to go
they’ll be welcomed by the Beaujolais
people (10 to 7pm on the Friday, noon
to 6pm on the Saturday).
BACK IN 1961 I spent a fortnight of
my annual holidays on the set of
Cleopatra in Rome, watching that rather
disastrous movie being made. The
movie didn’t fascinate me but I found
Burton, Fisher and Taylor during Cleopatra: for Fisher the end was near
myself almost too close for comfort to
the Taylor-Fisher break-up and the Tay-
lor-Burton torrid romance. It was a hec-
tic, never-to-be-forgotten fortnight.
Burton was almost a rival to Olivier
as an actor and had a comparable voice.
He was not ruined by fame or flattery or
even booze. In my view he and Liz
ruined each other with a continuing lu-
dicrous lifestyle, bad parts in plays and
films, indifferent performances and total
lack of self-discipline.
But I was glad I saw them in New
York last year, doing their best with Pri-
vate Lives. Liz from the neck up is one
of the world’s loveliest creatures and
Burton, even near life’s fag end, exuded
a magic.
I AM reliably informed that there has
been considerable official discussion
lately as to whether Australian football
should be introduced into Sydney’s
GPS schools. Votes showed a consider-
able percentage in favor.
Aussie football seems to be creeping
inexorably across Australia. The River-
ina has been long conquered and the
arrival of the Swans has brought the
sport to a wider audience in Sydney.
If Aussie football became part of the
New South Wales school athletic cur-
riculum, there is little doubt it would, in
the long run, overwhelm rugby union.
(At this point I admit I was born in Gee-
long and went to Scotch College, Mel-
bourne.)
INTERESTING to read that Prue
Acton received some sort of an award
for the outfits she designed for our
Olympic contenders. I, like most people
to whom I have spoken, thought they
verged on the ghastly.
But I think the sharpest rapier to be
slid into Prue’s vitals was in the hands
of The Sydney Morning Herald’s colum-
nist Margaret Jones, who wrote: “Our
periodic attempts to produce a ‘nation-
al’ costume result only in such vul-
garities as the uniforms for the Austra-
lian athletes at the Olympic Games this
year. I didn’t think anything could sur-
pass the awfulness of the green and gold
of the Moscow Games in 1980 but it just
goes to show you should never under-
estimate the ingenuity of designers.”
HAVE THE new brooms at the Austra-
lian Broadcasting Corporation gone a
bit haywire?
Some of the stories I’ve been told
about the plans and the current goings-
on in Auntie’s dark cupboards seem al-
most incredible.
Some of the single, heterosexual
young women employed at the ABC are
stunned at the proposal that homosex-
ual male employees are to get “spouse”
rights for their homosexual partners.
Would it not be logical, say the girls,
for a single girl to claim similar privi-
leges for her regular boyfriend?
The Anglican Dean of Sydney,
Lance Shilton, described the proposed
benefits to de facto partners of homo-
sexuals as “absurd” and I think that’s
the right word. The proposals should be
laughed into oblivion by the Prime
Minister. □


PEOPLE
Sir William
McMahon:
taking
responsibility
for every
word
Max
Fatchen at
his
retirement
party:
laughs all
the way to
the table
Edited by Qlenda Thompson
Sir William McMahon has, at last, fin-
ished writing his memoirs. It has been a
huge job and almost certainly will make
a huge book. Originally he wanted to
cover no more than his life from the end
of the reign of Sir Robert Menzies, but
his publishers wanted rather less pons
asinorum and a lot more about his fam-
ily, his philosophy, his schooldays,
Sonia, and so on. So he started all over
again, wearing out editors the way he
still wears out opponents at squash,
swimming and cycling. They, the edi-
tors, poor brutes, struggled hard, but
Billy had his way, and: “I am personally
responsible for every single word.”
Jubilant fashion designer Prue Acton
gave Mode magazine a serve over her
prize-winning women’s team uniforms
at LA. “Send a punnet of rasberries with
whipped cream,” she said. “ Mode led
the criticism of our design. I was begin-
ning to doubt my integrity.” Mode’s edi-
tor, Sandy Symons, who wrote the article
criticising Acton’s fauna motif garments
said, “We don’t retract a word of it,” but
dispatched a congratulatory bottle of
Moet et Chandon and a florist’s basket
of rasberry flowers and berries. “Brick-
bats are bouquets in this case,” says
Symons.
South Australia’s Max Fatchen, verse-
writer in The Advertiser for 29 years, re-
tired on his 64th birthday. Retired, that
is, to do his seventh children’s book. He
says the most ridiculous thing he ever
had to do in his career was kiss a cow
it was a stand-in for a beauty queen at
the Cream Bowl Festival. While with
The News for nine years, he watched
Rupert Murdoch start in the business as
a “green” boy fresh from university in
England. Fatchen was read far and wide
he got a fan letter from Vera Lynn
who’d seen one of his poems in the
Denver Post. His colleague columnist
Des Colquhoun, said he would be missed
“fondly smithing words on the anvil of
his keyboard. He has cheered us on
hard days with so many belly-laughs
with a belly like his there could be no
other kind. He eats as hard as most jour-
nalists are supposed to drink and doc-
tors despair at his pavlova reflexes and
his cream-bun hangovers. He just
laughs all the way to the table.”
According to Antonnetta Ferraro,
mother of the Democratic vice-presi-
dential candidate, daughter Geraldine
was a very bossy and spoilt baby. When
she was a toddler Gerry’s doting father
bought her a birthday cake every
month, and surrounded her with 100
dolls, a dollhouse with electric lights
and a big pink room with bay windows.
She never learned to crawl because she
was never put on the floor. She walked
at eight months and was talking at nine
months because her mum would walk
around with her in her arms saying
things like “Good morning refrigerator,
good morning stove.” You have been
warned.
James Peterson, 1 1 / 2 , is awaiting eagerly
the warmer months and the new cricket
season. James has just won a trophy for
best all-round performance from the
Northern Suburbs, Sydney, Cricket As-
sociation. Last November, playing in
the North Sydney District D 4 grade he
took two hat-tricks in one match. At a
recent function where he received his
award officials totted up his bowling fig-
ures for last season: 98 overs, 62 maid-
ens, 82 runs and 54 wickets. That works
out at 1.52 runs a wicket. He also was
the team’s best batsman.
It’s confirmed. Swim star Lisa Curry
said she and fellow Olympic team mate
Grant Kenny would marry “probably
next year” and have babies. They plan a
special room in their house for their
medals.
Shane Hill, of Sydney, said to be the
best-ever Australian 12-year-old chess
player, is going to Buenos Aires for the
World Under 14 Cup starting on August
24. Experts say his style is “mature.”
The Greater London Council has
turned down a plea to erect a blue
plaque the normal mode of commem-
orating where the famous lived on the
former house of Thomas Crapper, the
noted Victorian sanitary engineer,
Crapper, whose autobiography, Flushed
With Pride, still sells, did the drains at
Sandringham and other royal resi-
dences. He even has his name on the
floor of Westminster Abbey on a man-
hole cover.
No fewer than 76 names from Australia
appear in the new, 1984-85, edition of
the International Who’s Who. There is
the predictable wave of politicians:
Lionel Bowen, Brian Burke, John Cain,
John Howard, Paul Keating, Susan
Ryan, Gordon Scholes; a few artists:
Judy Cassab, John Coburn, Sir William
Dargie; a few authors who were once
just journalists: Donald Horne, Bruce
Grant, Geoffrey Dutton; two, and only
two, journalists who have always been
that way: Sydney’s and Fairfax’s Max
Suich and Melbourne’s Denis Warner;


even a few judges who can still admit it:
Sir Walter Campbell, Sir Guy Green,
Michael Kirby, Leonard King, Sir
Anthony Mason, Dame Roma Mitchell.
But the Chief Justice of NSW, Sir
Laurence Street not unlike the late Sir
Charles Lloyd Jones, who always de-
scribed himself as a draper gives his
profession as plain “lawyer.”
If you spend much time at the movies
these days you could be forgiven for
thinking that Gallipoli was a place
where the Turks were attacked by a
bunch of fresh-faced young fellers who
spent more time as sprinters in the Kim-
berleys. In Canberra on August 20, at
the opening of the Australian War
Memorial’s Gallipoli gallery, about 250
old Digs, most of them in their 80s, will
represent the remaining evidence that
life was a bit more severe. For instance:
Leslie Shipman Lambert and Louis Sep-
timus Lambert, now of Melbourne, were
brothers in the 6th Field Ambulance,
who had the job of tending people such
as Bill King, of Tewantin, Qld. King was
severely wounded in the head,
evacuated, patched up, sent back to
cop 21 wounds four days after his sec-
ond landing. Sam Thompson, of
Camden, NSW, was mentioned in dis-
patches in 1915 and again in World War
11. There was a feeling that somehow
they all had something in common ...
and, on a hospital ship on the way
home, Bill King met an officer named
Gilbert Dyett, who later became Sir Gil-
bert, and they agreed to form something
called the Returned Soldiers’ Associa-
tion. And that, children, is how the RSL
got started.
At conferences, people are supposed to
listen to the speakers. Not so at a recent
convention in Hobart, where as far as
the males were concerned, Christine
Mahon needed to be seen rather than
heard. To understate it, perhaps, Chris
is gorgeous. She is not unaccustomed to
public speaking herself because she runs
Celebrity Speakers, the agency which
will line up (at a nice fee, of course) a
top-notch speaker for conventions, din-
ners or whatever. (Some, however, draw
the line at prawn nights). Her stable in-
cludes spoofer Campbell McComas,
economist Neville Norman and grizzled
polly Fred Daly. As she delivers her own
spiel, it begins to sink in that she is no
mean speaker herself. Yet, she con-
fesses, the first time she spoke in public
she was so nervous she riveted her eyes
on just one person in the audience and
didn’t dare glance away in case she for-
got her lines. “That man,” Christine re-
called, “kept phoning me and phoning
me. Within a year we were married.”
Prof Jeff McWhirter knows all about
learning problems two of his five chil-
dren were diagnosed as learning dis-
abled. He had worked for years with
otherwise bright children who found it
hard to read and write when his eldest
son’s problem was spotted. Now 23, the
boy has completed a history degree at
Arizona State University and has been
accepted to study post-graduate law.
McWhirter is in Australia on a
Fulbright scholarship to lecture and do
research in Sydney and Perth.

Eric Butler, the evil genie, is out of his lamp again
PHILLIP ADAMS
WE LIVE in an era of ingenious eu-
phemism. Confronted with post-war
prejudices about reffos, Canberra came
up with New Australians. In an attempt
at camouflage, conscription became Na-
tional Service. Because we don’t like to
think about kicking the bucket, Nation-
al Mutual and AMP talk about life in-
surance. In the United States, Jerry
Falwell’s noisy minority of fundamen-
talist crackpots market themselves as
the Moral Majority and an organisation
determined to deny rights to a lengthen-
ing list of people calls itself the League
of Rights.
I’ve been friendly with Andrew Pea-
cock for around 20 years ever since he
struck me as being someone for whom
the tag Liberal wasn’t deceptive pack-
aging. (A confession; I even wrote him
a speech which he gave a run at the Na-
tional Press Club.) But now I fear that
Andrew may be losing his way as the
neanderthals in his party make more
and more of the running, knuckles drag-
ging on the ground. Case in point:
Andrew tells us that he will have
nothing to do with the League of Rights.
Yet, in the same breath, he admits that
they are “on a parallel course.” Frankly,
it would be harder to think of a more
dangerous parallel.
Let us look, briefly, at the record of
its leader Eric D. Butler. A one-time
member of the Melbourne Synod of the
Anglican church, Butler sees almost
everything on Earth as an aspect of a
colossal Jewish conspiracy.
Salk polio vaccine is a Jewish plot.
(The Christian way to treat polio is, of
course, chiropractic.) He also believes
that the Jewish conspiracy is behind the
“savage suppression” of the so-called
Hoxley cancer cure. Mr Hoxley, a citi-
zen of Dallas, Texas, inherited this cure
from his grandfather who discovered it
by watching a stallion eat certain weeds.
We could dismiss Butler as an eccen-
tric. But Butler commands our attention
because of the way he has been man-
ipulating racism for decades. If he is
not enthusing over apartheid, he’s
orchestrating the campaign against Ab-
original land rights, stirring up fears
about Asian immigration or, most con-
sistent of all, publishing his paranoid
fantasies about Jews.
His League of Rights is giving plat-
form space to John Bennett, the
Melburnian who insists the Holocaust
was a Jewish propaganda trick. In But-
ler’s journal, New Times, he’s continu-
ally painting pictures of the Judaic jug-
gernaut. Thus “most of the key figures
behind subversion in South Africa are
Jews.” “At the risk of being called anti-
Semitic, we must ask the question why
so many Jewish millionaires have been
attracted to socialism.” And that’s the
more recent Butler, the smoothy seeking
political consensus.
We must never forget that Eric But-
ler is the author of The International
Jew, described by a prominent Catholic
spokesman as “a childish exhibition of
anti-Semitism at its worse.” Like
Hitler’s publicist Jules Streicher, Butler
enthusiastically promoted that notori-
ous forgery The Protocols of the Learned
Elders of Zion, the fountainhead of most
modern anti-Semitism.
As Ken Gott reported in his book on
Butler, Voices of Hate, “he operates a
book shop which has distributed this
and other inflammatory material about
the Jewish community; here, among
other horrors, you can find booklets
which attempt to revive the medieval
legends of Jewish ritual murder of
Christian children. Mr Butler’s book
shop is a relic of Hitler’s Germany.”
(Currently on sale at the Heritage book
shop ... books called Debunking the
Genocide Myth and Anne Frank’s Diary
A Hoax.
In 1936, there were many groups in
Australia who believed we should pro-
vide refuge for the growing number of
Jews fleeing Hitler. The reaction of But-
ler’s New Times was to launch a cam-
paign against Jewish refugees which
was to last for some years. “We have no
animus against Jews as Jews,” said the
paper, “but that does not blind us to
their failings. The Jew more than any-
one else tends to be a monopolist. For
that reason as well as for their subvers-
ive activities communism, another
form of centralised monopoly, was
founded and is carried on mainly by
Jews the Jews were driven out of Ger-
many.” For the rest of the 30s, New
Times ran a pro-Axis line, deriving its


arguments from the writings of that well
known democrat, Dr Goebbels.
Butler liked to suggest that Winston
Churchill and his ancestors had been
tools of the Jews. “Some say that that
family tradition has been maintained,”
he wrote. “Churchill has many Jewish
financiers as friends.” In the same spirit,
New Times hailed the Nazi-Soviet pact
as a sign that “the power of internation-
al finance (ie, the Jews) may soon be
crushed.”
With the outbreak of war, Butler’s
pro-facist views had to be soft-pedalled.
But Butler went on to write The In-
ternational Jew which Gott describes as
“the vilest anti-Semitism book ever
issued in Australia.” It is also the most
imaginative.
We are told, among other things, that
the Jews via Rasputin controlled the
Russian royal family (page 105) while
they also organised the Bolshevik revol-
ution. Remarkably, the Jews also con-
trolled the Nazi movement (pages 86
and 87) while Hitler himself was Jewish
being a bastard son of Baron
Rothschild (page 88).
The Jews are also in control of world
capitalism, run the US Federal Reserve
Bank, ran the Nazi Luftwaffe and
founded the Jesuit order.
These days, Butler is strident about
Aborigines and Asians but it wasn’t so
long ago that he wrote: “Australians
have, no doubt, noticed with concern
the number of Jewish ‘refugees’ brought
to Australia since the conclusion of
World War II.”
It would seem that one of the few
aspects of Australian life that Butler
wholeheartedly supported was the
White Australia Policy. Although given
his rapturous endorsement of South Af-
rica’s apartheid, it wasn’t white enough.
Consequently he published The Danger-
ous Myth of Racial Equality by Mrs D.
Watts which said, among other aston-
ishing things, that “the Nazis treated the
Jews as though they were a human dis-
ease. Therefore, the reactionaries can-
not stop short of treating them as
though they are sacred cows.” Getting
up a head of steam, Watts also holds the
blacks responsible for their own
Sharpeville massacre. “In the negro, the
savage sleeps lightly and is quickly
aroused. Violence, to him, is not the fi-
nal, desperate expression of unbearable
exasperation but a pleasurable excite-
ment. Blood rites move him to ecstasy.
‘Blood, blood, we want blood,’ negro
women had chanted during riots that
had occurred a short time ago ... Why
do the democratic press, British and
American newscasters, the UNO and
the nations of the British Common-
wealth band together to make such a
song and dance about apartheid? The
explanation seems to be that the real
aim is to eliminate the white race.”
I could fill The Bulletin from cover to
cover with documented accounts of
Butler’s beliefs and tactics. Now the
man who should, at worst, have been a
marginal jotting in Australian political
history has emerged centre stage as a
strategist of racism orchestrating the
crescendo of ill-informed hostility to the
land rights movement. He’s joyfully
manipulating the anti-Asian anxieties
released, like some evil genie, as a result
of the enthusiastic lamp-rubbing of
Geoff Blainey.
Eric Butler, Australia’s Oswald
Mosley, has long since infiltrated the
National Party. It would be a tragedy if
the Liberal Party allowed his malignant
influence to spread through its organisa-
tion and hence through the Australian
body politic. It’s not good enough for
Andrew to say that he’ll have nothing to
do with the League while conceding that
they might be “on parallel paths.” He
must oppose Butler’s politics of hatred,
racism and paranoia.
Whitlam once spoke with detestation
of “Kerr’s cur.” Unless Andrew de-
nounces the loathsome demogogy of the
League of Rights, he may be remem-
bered as “Butler’s butler.” □

Bridgestone Potenza
Bridgestone Potenza is the current pinnacle of
Bridgestone road tyre design for the driver who demands the
ultimate in no compromise ultra high performance.
Potenza was developed with race bred technology and
hard won experience in international racing and rallying.
Displaying outstanding performance capabilities
Bridgestone Potenza is V speed rated (for speeds in excess of
210km/h) delivering precise cornering, handling and
braking on all road surfaces, limpet-like grip in the wet,

COVER STORY
Our Olympic heroes:
the start of a comeback
Australia did not have many heroes at the Olympics, but the few gold medals were
won in great style and we made a big comeback in athletics and swimming. Our
disappointments were in areas such as hockey and equestrian events. Meanwhile,
New Zealand starred with a hatful of golds, as LENORE NICK LIN reports:
CARL LEWIS of the United States won
four gold medals on land and lan Fer-
guson of New Zealand won three gold
medals on water.
The Flying Kiwi won one gold in
each of the kayak singles, pairs and
fours and helped boost New Zealand’s
gold medal count to eight double that
of Australia’s on the second-last day of
the Olympics.
It was the Olympics where you could
win a gold medal and sulk as you stood
on the winner’s dais and listened to
your country’s national anthem. For the
200 m American backstroker Rick Carey
winning was not enough. He had
wanted to smash the world record but
didn’t. He stared into the water and
shook his head in dejection. Carey’s
parents had plunged him into swim-
ming when he was 10 because he was
such a sore loser and they wanted him
to learn how to lose. Instead he became
a sore winner.
It was the Olympics where heroes
were replaced by superstars, where
races sometimes had the flavor of exhi-
bition runs. Who could touch the Am-
erican giants of track and field “King”
Carl Lewis or Edwin “Holy” Moses?
Lewis, as he had promised, won four
gold medals emulating Jesse Owens’ ac-
complishment of four gold medals in
the 1936 Games in Berlin. The man who
collects crystal for a hobby collected
gold for the long jump, the 100 m, the
200 m and the 4 x 100 m relay.
Lewis is the best athlete in the world.
He’s also a dude; flashy, cat-like, remote
and sexually ambiguous. As a child he
stayed at home with his sister Carol
also an outstanding athlete and
played with dolls. He’s probably the
only male star of track and field who
uses an eyebrow pencil and a
powderpuff.
Moses hadn’t lost a 400 m hurdles
since he won the Olympic gold medal at
Montreal in 1976. He lowered the world
record to 48.02 seconds last year and
went into the Olympics with a streak of
105 consecutive victories behind him.
No one looked like overtaking the man
with the giant, effortless stride.
After the race he shook hands with
77-year-old Bob Tisdall of Nambour,
Queensland who won the event at the
Los Angeles Olympics in 1932. Tisdall,
who was a member of the Irish team,
ran a time of 51.7. It was a world record
but was disallowed because he knocked
over the last hurdle. (Knocking over
hurdles is not penalised now.)
Moses has a degree in physics and he
approaches his training scientifically
using a computer to record workouts
Koala and kangaroo triumphant: Australia’s gold-medal-winning 4000m teams pursuit cycling foursome


Australia’s team on parade at the opening ceremony: not too much attention, standing to or paying
and heart beats. Tisdall trained by run-
ning around a country greyhound track
in Ireland and after arriving in Los
Angeles spent a week in bed smoking
his pipe and reading Edgar Wallace.
Tisdall, a guest of the Olympic Com-
mittee, said: “Moses is a fine fellow but
these are very different Olympics. We
used to do 15 strides between hurdles;
Moses and the other big shots now do it
in 13. But sport is big business today
and the fun goes out of it when it is no
longer sport. You’ve got to be a bit of a
masochist to succeed in sport these
days.”
It was the Olympics where the quest
for gold often seemed overshadowed by
the quest for the green of American dol-
lars. Once they took your medals back if
they discovered you made money out of
your sport. In these days of what Moses
calls “enlightened amateurism,” athletes
can be paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars and yet remain amateurs. Moses
earned $457,000 last year and expects to
double that amount this year.
And nobody gets paid more than the
Olympic Federation itself. The Ameri-
can Broadcasting Corporation paid
$225 million for the rights to cover the
1984 Games and has won the auction
for the rights to the 1988 Winter Olym-
pics in Calgary, Canada, with a bid of
' $309 million.
The current Olympics proved big
ratings winners on television. Everyone
in America wanted to watch Mary-Lou
and Carl and Ed and the marathon run-
ner from the land-down-under.
McDonalds of hamburger fame, Coca-
Cola and Budweiser were happy to chip
in $500,000 a minute for the best spots.
Australians Jon Sieben and Glynis
Nunn no sooner had gold medals hang-
ing round their necks than they started
asking SSOOO for interviews. Sieben,
whose win over world champion
Michael Gross in the 200 m butterfly was
one of the biggest upsets in the Games,
asked for not only SSOOO but also a Syd-
ney/Los Angeles airticket.
Sieben got the money he asked for
and Nunn got enough to keep her in
pavlovas for the rest of her life. (It was
after eating a breakfast of pavlova her
favorite pre-race nourishment that
Nunn won the gruelling, two-day,
seven-event heptathlon. She ran the fi-
nal 800 m the last event in the compe-
tition just fast enough to win from the
American favorite Jackie Joyner.)
But Australians are only beginners
when it comes to making deals. Alberto
Salazar earns around $500,000 a year
for promoting an iron supplement. He
gets more money for promoting Nike
running shoes. Runner Mary Decker,
Moses, triple jumper Willie Banks and
Lewis also promote Nike.
The Athletics Congress says it’s all
quite legal as long as the runners, jump-
ers, swimmers and the rest put the
money into an approved trust fund.
Lewis receives as much as $4500 just for
showing up at a track. Agents say that
the money-making potential of a gold
medal can range from $50,000 to $1 mil-
lion depending on how the athlete is
packaged.
It was the Olympics where the boy-
cott by Russia and the Eastern bloc
countries robbed competition of much
of its drama. The American women’s
basketball team romped to the easiest of
victories. No team came closer than 28
points in the game. The Russians would
have: they have the best basketball team
in the world. Romania came cheered
mightily and gratefully on the colorful
Hollywoodian opening day and its

Germany and won the gold medal
presence made the women’s gymnastics
one of the most keenly-fought events in
the Olympics.
In swimming, despite the presence of
the German albatross, Michael Gross,
and some gutsy Australians the US team
claimed not only most of the gold but
also most of the silver. In the 100 m
women’s freestyle Carrie Steinseifer and
Nancy Hogshead, both of the United
States, touched together and came away
with a gold medal apiece.
At the swimming pool the Star
Spangled Banner seemed never to stop
playing. Most people thought it would
be the turn of Advance Australia Fair at
the end of the 100 m men’s freestyle final
but nobody warned Australian Mark
Stockwell that the starter from Panama
was a quick-draw specialist. Stockwell,
a member of a not-mean-enough Mean
Machine, came away with two silver
medals and a reputation for good
sportsmanship.
The East German women were
missed sorely in track and field. But the
Americans won everywhere. They rode
their $40,000 high-tech bikes to victory
in the cycling (except in the 4000 m
teams pursuit, where Australia won its
first gold medal) and they took most of
the gold and silver in the sailing and
equestrian events. Their male gymnasts,


Weightlifter Dean Lukin: won the gold and then turned his thoughts to fishing
who had never won a medal before,
won gold.
Some coaches explained the Ameri-
can successes as a reaction to “the frus-
tration of not being able to compete at
Moscow.” Swimmers such as Rowdy
Gaines, who were set for gold at Mos-
cow, knew that Los Angeles would be
their last chance. With the home crowd
chanting U-S-A and the flags waving
and the planes writing USA in the sky,
they swam, ran and pedalled faster than
just about anyone else.
It was a Games where Australia re-
asserted itself as one of the world’s top
swimming nations. The swimmers won
12 medals, (one gold, five silver, six
bronze) the most since 1960. The swim-
mers were a happy team and well
managed. The athletes, most of whom
were from Victoria, were less well-
managed and not always happy al-
though there were some smiling excep-
tions. Gael Martin, with a bronze medal
safely under her belt from the shot put,
qualified for the final of the discus with
an effortless first throw. “Now why did I
do that?” she grinned afterwards. “I
wanted to qualify but I also wanted to
be in the stands tomorrow to sit and
watch.” Martin had lost 4kg since the
shot put. “It’s great I don’t have to eat
any more I only have two meals a
day.” In the final, looking a lightweight
among the other throwers, she came
eighth.
In track and field, Australians
reached more finals than they had for 20
years. As well as winning the
heptathlon, Glynis Nunn reached the fi-
nals in both the long jump and hurdles.
In the final of the men’s 400 m relay
the Australians led after the first two
laps Darren Clark running an ex-
tremely fast second leg of 43.86, but
faded into fourth place. “We gave it our
best shot,” they said afterwards. Giving
it your best shot became the most over-
worked cliche of the Games.
Patricia Dench divorced mother of
twins certainly gave her best shot and
won Australia’s first-ever shooting
medal, a bronze in the match pistol
event.
“It’s been a very sad Olympics for
me,” said Rick Mitchell after his poor
anchor-leg run in the relay. (He had
wanted to run the individual 400 m as
well as the relay, and was troubled with
injuries.) “I sacrificed such a lot sold
my furniture, to get some money, gave
up my pedigree dogs because I couldn’t
afford to feed them. I sometimes wonder
if it’s been worth it.”
Grant Kenny had no doubts that it
had all been worth it. In the Kayak-2
1000 m he and Barry Kelly paddled to
a bronze medal after a telephone con-
versation the night before with their
coach in Australia. “We had a new race
plan we stuck with it and it paid off,”
said Kenny whose glamor boy image in
the media as with Carl Lewis has
provoked jealousy among other ath-
letes. The canoeing events took place at
Lake Casitas, more than 100 km from
Hollywood.
While both the yachting and eques-
trian teams failed to live up to expecta-
tions (the yachtsmen got a bronze
medal in the Tornado event, the eques-
trians none), the biggest disappointment
came from the hockey teams. The men
were expected to win gold and the
women went into their final match
against the Netherlands with the chance
of gold. In the round robin series, if they
beat the Netherlands by two or more
goals the gold medal was theirs. If they
beat them by a goal, or tied with them,
they won the silver. Instead they lost by
two goals and, tired and dispirited,
ended up losing the bronze as well, in a
penalty-stroke shootout against the Am-
ericans. Tears flowed.
Tears also flowed among the men
players following their match against
Pakistan. In a day when everything
went wrong the team that was rated the
best in the world was beaten 1-0. It was
their first loss in two years and 34 tour-
naments. Two days later they lost to
Britain 3-2 and missed out on the
bronze. It was little consolation for cap-
tain Ric Charlesworth that in Britain he
was being described as one of the most
outstandingly brilliant hockey players
in the world and the Los Angeles was
tipping that he might be the first Olym-
pic hockey player to become Prime
Minister of Australia.
It was an Olympics where a
weightlifter called Dean Lukin showed
that you could take time off to go fishing
six months a year, in fact and still
win a gold medal in the super-heavy-
weight division.
Lukin lifted a total of 412.5 kg to give
Australia its first gold medal in the
sport. “That bar weighed as much as the
biggest tuna I’ve ever caught,” he said.
Lukin’s mighty lift rated not one second

on American television. The big fellow
made the mistake of not having stars
and stripes on his costume.
Lukin has thigh muscles as big as the
Olgas and looked like a big Russian
bear who had been woken out of hiber-
nation and was none too pleased about
it. With the gold medal safely around
his neck he was all smiles. In the clean
and jerk he lifted 240 kg, an Australian
and Commonwealth record. “I thought
it was all over after the snatches,” he
said. “I’d never done 240 kg in training
but there it was and up she went. A
month ago I cleaned 245 km and missed
the lift. There was no point in going on,
but I would’ve attempted it had I
needed to.” The absence of Russian
bears didn’t worry Lukin. Asked about
the boycott he said: “Nobody remem-
bers four years ago that Americans
weren’t there and nobody will remem-
ber four years from now who wasn’t
here.” Robert Kabbas also scored in the
weightlifting a silver in the light-
heavyweight division.
Gary Honey, assisted by pain-killing
drugs, won a courageous silver medal
for a best-ever long-jump of 8.24 metres.
Darren Clark rounded the final turn in
the 400 m thinking he would win the
gold but older and faster legs passed
him and he finished fourth. “I made my
run too early,” said the 18-year-old with
the small gold ear-ring in his left ear. He
reckoned it was a good training run for
the 1988 Olympics.
Meanwhile on television, where the
commentators were not so much sports
reporters as cheerleaders, psychologists
debated earnestly whether the American
cheering was genuine patriotism or ugly
chauvinism. Americans mock the train-
ing tactics of the East Germans but in
many sports they follow the same route.
Six of the American women’s volley-
ball team had worked with coach Arie
Silenger for six years, training eight
hours a day, six days a week. Most of
them left university to train with him.
None is married, none has a job. In the
end China got the gold medal and the
Silenger girls a tearful silver.
Sixteen-year-old Mary Lou Retton,
the little gymnast with a million teeth,
left home and friends and school at 14
to go to the training camp of Romanian
Bela Karolyi who had trained Ro-
manian superstar Nadia Comaneci.
Retton won a gold medal in the all-
round competition but to her surprise
and chagrin was beaten in the individ-
ual events by Ecaterina Szabo of Ro-
mania.
Not all the stars were American.
Germany’s Gross, the Albatross, was
the most feared of the swimmers. He
won two gold medals and two silver.
Gross chose not to enter the 400 m
freestyle, an event he would have been
expected to win, because “Salnikov and
Women’s hockey: West Germany (red) and Australia fight out a 2-all draw
Lodziewski are not here therefore the
winner of the 400 freestyle will not be
the best man.” Salnikov is the Soviet
world record holder and Lodziewski the
East German champion.
For the tall, skinny, stern-faced Ger-
man, who drives a Porsche and doesn’t
believe in high-mileage training, win-
ning is not everything. “I only expect to
go fast,” he said. “Sometimes I win.”
The bare-footed Zola Budd and her
clash in the 3000 m with the American
champion Mary Decker was one of the
most eagerly anticipated events in track
and field and provided the Olympics
with its greatest drama. There was enor-
mous curiosity about the 18-year-old
South African farm girl who now runs
for England and the London Daily
Mail.
It quickly turned to animosity when
Decker tripped on Budd’s flying bare
feet and fell. To the sound of the
crowd’s boos, Budd came seventh. The
whose-fault debate continues to rage.
Carlos Lopez of Portugal put the re-
sult of the marathon beyond debate as
he entered the stadium and strode out
the last lap as if completing a 10,000 m
race.
Australia’s world championship win-
ner Robert de Castella hung on to run a
game fifth.
Had he won the race de Castella, ac-
cording to track and field expert Mike
Agostini, would have become Austra-
lia’s first millionaire amateur athlete.
His courageous run should help as-
sure good sales in an ambitious Ameri-
can publishing venture.
An American publishing firm
Decalon, plans to publish a gold-em-
bossed, leather-bound, limited-edition
biography of de Castella which will sell
at $lOOO for each authographed copy.
Only 1000 copies will be printed and the
plates are to be destroyed on comple-
tion of the print.
A less lavish version will later be
published for general sale.
De Castella will get a 10-percent
share of this potential million-dollar
venture of which his agents, Inter-
national Management Group, would
take their usual cut of anything from 10
to 25 percent.
Had de Castella won, the enormous
potential of the American market would
Gold, gold

kiwi gold
NEW ZEALAND won an impressive
11 medals, eight gold in Los Angeles.
Kiwi gold came to Mark Todd in the
three-day equestrian event; to the
coxless four in rowing; to Rick Sellers
and Chris Timms in Tornado-class sail-
ing and to Russell Coutts in Finn-class
sailing.
Then, four gold fell to New Zealand
in kayak events: K 1 class 500 m; K 1
1000 m; K 2 500 m and K 4 1000 m.
In boxing, Kevin Barry came back
from a knockdown to win silver and
bronze medals flew south for the coxed
four and wind-gliding events.


A 43.8 sec run by Darren Clark failed to give Australia a 400m relay medal
have opened up to him. The kind of
money available in the US is illustrated
by the fact that golfer Greg Norman re-
cently earned more than $250,000 there
in six weeks.
It was the Olympics where the
shadows of the Munich and
McDonald’s massacres were ever-pre-
sent and the possibility of terrorism was
ever-feared. Handbags, word pro-
cessors, cameras and foodboxes were
searched day after day. Neroli Fairhall
of New Zealand, a competitor in the
archery events and a paraplegic, was
lifted unceremoniously from her
wheelchair while it was searched thor-
oughly.
Later she received an apology.
Security helicopters kept constant
surveillance from the skies and sharp-
shooters watched from the tops of
buildings. At the opening ceremony
President Reagan delivered his speech
from behind bullet-proof glass. Barbed
wire topped the fences that surrounded
the Olympic villages. Robots and sniffer
dogs were kept at the ready.
But no bombs went off and the only
risk of murder was at the boxing arena,
where Koreans and Germans and Aus-
tralians all cried foul. The South
Korean delegation threatened to leave
town.
“All the Americans win,” said
President Kim Seung Youn of the South
Korean Amateur Boxing Federation. “I
think sometimes they lose and they still
Robert de Castella: a courageous fifth in
the marathon in the oppressive heat and
smog of Los Angeles
win.” When the American boxer Steve
McCrory of Detroit defeated Peter
Ayesu of Malawi, the Malawi coach
said of the judging: “When you’re fight-
ing an American it’s always 5-0.”
Australian sportswriters frothed at
the mouth when lightweight Renato
Cornett and flyweight Jeff Fenech both
won split-points decisions from the five
judges but had the results overturned by
the jury. “The way the boxing has been
judged, why don’t they just write names
on pieces of paper and make a selec-
tion?” growled Sydney Sun sports edi-
tor Bill Casey.
A couple of steroid-taking
weightlifters got busted, Bomber the
bald eagle gave his life for his country
and British runner Steve Ovett went
into hospital wheezing and with chest
pains (“not caused by smog,” everyone
said) but there were remarkably few
casualties.
The terrible traffic jams didn’t ma-
terialise, the smog was no worse than
usual and the 2 million visitors pre-
dicted failed to show. Tourism was
quieter than usual, business at Dis-
neyland was down by 20 percent, tickets
were available, 7000 hotel rooms were
empty and “gouging,” as the Americans
call price-hiking, failed to materialise.
The car rental people who lifted their
prices in the first couple of days had to
bring them down again. The Los
Angelinos did as they were told and
caught buses for just about the first time
in their lives.
Just about everybody had a good
time. The sun shone and the home team
won ... and won ... and won. Could
any American ask for more? □

The WF is worst in the hotel busi-
ness. It is becoming difficult to put your
head down under $lOO a night. I mean,
I’m damned if I want my bathroom
filled with exotic soaps made in Paris
and exquisite packages of bath salts,
shampoos and unguents. I have never
used one of their free shower caps. Then
there’s the television, usually complete
with a closed circuit device that will
provide a blue movie. Don’t need it.
Then there’s the refrigerator filled
with liquor at off-the-graph prices.
Hilton hotels even have a frightful auto-
matic device: select a bottle and it regis-
ters instantly on your bill downstairs.
Now it is fearfully trendy to have a
telephone right beside the dunny. The
Savoy started it years ago in London.
Now every hotel has a guilt complex if
there is no bathroom telephone. I have
never had the urge to speak to someone
on the telephone while sitting on the
more. The dream of the 80s is “Every
room equipped with two baths.”
Then my wife and I stayed at
Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. That’s the
place where the male waiters are
dressed like Charlton Heston in Ben
Hur and the females like vestal virgins
in mini-skirts. Our room boasted a four-
poster bed as big as a squash court. The
posts were Doric columns and we had a
mirror on the ceiling. Now that was WF
in excelsis. Innocent creature that I am
I’ve never been able to see the point of a
mirror on the ceiling and I’m damned if
I want to pay for it.
There is also a Ceasar’s Palace at
Lake Tahoe. When I was there it
claimed it was the only gambling casino
in the world that had a full-size aero-
plane hanging from the ceiling. It did,
too; a beautiful Beechcraft. It came as
news to me that Julius flew a plane.
More recently I have been in Asia.
The American system has taken over
completely. Go to the Shangri La or any
of the big hotels and every way you
turn, at every corner there is a member
of the staff saying: “Good morning sir.”
“Have a happy day, sir.” I swear they
are all lined up every morning and
warned: “Any member of the staff who
fails to wish a guest a happy day is fired,
OK?”
The Beverly Wilsh'ire in Los Angeles
gives you a bottle of French champagne
plus a sweet personal message from the
manager. When you get your bill you
realise it is not a problem to toss in that
little extra.
The Royal Orchid in Bangkok is
equally charming. Now there’s a whop-
per. It has been open only 18 months. It
has 750 rooms and a staff of 780. There
are so many on the staff you have scored
38 “Good mornings” before you reach
the breakfast table.
When you enter your room you find
a bowl of tropical fruit, plus the sweet
message from the manager. A table is
laid for you to start eating and fair
dinkum there is a finger bowl with an
orchid floating in it. There are fresh
roses in the bowls, an orchid on your
pillow and a chocolate to eat before you
go to sleep.
The notepaper is embossed with your
name in gold across the top and you get
the most divine white dressing gown for
your personal use.
An incredible Woo Factor is the con-
trol panel beside your bed. You can
turn on or off all the lights individually
or throw everything with a master
switch. The control panel also com-
mands the TV and the radio. I did stay
at a hotel last year where there was also
a switch which controlled the curtains,
so that you could open and close them
as if you were at Her Majesty’s, but
travel is blurring the mind and I can’t
remember where.
Next door to the Royal Orchid is the
Oriental, much famed right back to the
1870 s. It has suites named after authors
who have stayed there Joseph
Conrad, Graham Greene, James A.
Michener, Somerset Maugham. They
have four-poster beds in teak, 300-year-
old Oriental ceramics, silk on the walls
and they tend to twine fresh orchids,
roses and jasmine around the bannis-
ters. Prices start around $2OO a day and
move quite briskly towards $lOOO.
I think I will start a hotel which will
advertise: “We offer a superbly comfort-
able bed, a light which actually provides
sufficient illumination to read, a shower
that works without any mysterious
plumbing, carpet on the floor ... no re-
frigerator, no television, bring your own
shower cap.” □

THE ARTS
Still a lack of common sense
along the operatic axis
The rivalry between the Victorian State Opera and the Australian Opera seems to
be cooling a little. But JOHN CARGHER asks: Why do we need two competing
companies doing essentially the same thing?
WHY THE Victoria State Opera and
the Sydney-based Australian Opera
continue to compete instead of sup-
plementing each other remains a mys-
tery but no federal government or spon-
sored body has managed to suppress the
interstate rivalry. The VSO’s choice of
Verdi’s Paris grand opera Don Carlos to
open its season, for all its virtues, shows
that common sense is still lacking.
All right, Victoria now has a com-
pany with a theatre in which it (and the
Australian Opera) can stage opera of an
international standard. The production
of Don Carlos proves that. How it re-
lates to any kind of long-term policy is
another matter.
Bricks have stopped flying between
the VSO and the Australian Opera since
Sir Rupert Hamer was appointed chair-
man in Melbourne and Patrick Veitch
restrained Charles Berg in Sydney. But
there is still no attempt to cement the
previously flying objects into a policy
which will make the best use of our op-
eratic dollar.
Sydneysiders might remember that
“their” opera would fold very quickly
without the contributions of taxpayers
in other states. What happens in Mel-
bourne could prove to be either costly
or beneficial to the harbor city.
Comments about the new Melbourne
State Theatre have been guarded and
bets have been hedged. Perhaps the
press has learned a lesson from all the
nonsense that was written about the
Melbourne Concert Hall when it
opened.
Concert halls can be “tuned” for
different types of music (and Mel-
bourne’s has) while opera houses leave
little room for adjustment. Acoustically,
the new State Theatre is as close to per-
fect as any new theatre can be in this age
of super-sensitive sound critics. The one
minor imbalance has been praised as an
asset by some writers: The orchestra pit
is slightly over-resonant; it produces
superb clarity but could drown singers
under careless conductors.
The seating is comfortable, though
cramped in the no-aisle European man-
In Don Carlos, Kenneth Collins and Joan Carden: fine singing in a long evening
ner, but the stage facilities are world-
class by any standards and the VSO has
chosen not only to extend them to the
full but also to operate them quite un-
necessarily in full view of the audience
after the curtain rises on each scene. Ap-
parently Verdi wrote scenery as well as
music.
Much else remains blessedly invis-
ible, of course. There are in the wings
three areas totalling double the space of
the huge stage but no production using
these facilities in full will fit into the sar-
dine tin of the Sydney Opera House
something no Australian company
should ignore.
Though I have come to praise the
VSO Don Carlos, I can only bury its sel-
ection for the opening of the new
theatre. Its failing is the very grandness
which Paris demanded of Verdi and got
in one scene only. (The-then obliga-
tory ballet quite rightly has been
dropped.)
Don Carlos is really an intimate op-
era, concerned with personal relation-
ships. Of its eight scenes, seven should
be staged in an area a quarter the size of
the State Theatre. Even that superb pro-
ducer John Copley could not establish
rapport between puppets separated by
vast spaces and six gigantic movable
pillars made of most realistic bricks. (So
that’s what happened to them.)
If the scenery was designed to show
off the theatre, Kristian Fredrikson’s
costumes were built for the singers.
They are lavish and as beautiful as any-
thing he has done for the Australian Op-
era. And the singers are worthy of their
finery.
The opera is sung in English good
enough to make the impossible plot
understandable. Elizabeth de Valois
loves Don Carlos, the son of King
Philip II of Spain, but has to marry the
father for political reasons. (In love
duets, the Don calls her “mother” and


In Faust, from the good to the ridiculous: a crucified Christ “taking off like a Boeing 747”
she calls him “son.”) Princess Eboli also
loves Carlos and betrays them.
This is a good plot for an intimate
opera but a side issue in a spectacle
which demands political demonstra-
tions, the burning at the stake of heretics
and a lot of nonsense about Spain’s oc-
cupation of Flanders, not to mention
dead emperors who give shelter to their
grandsons in their tombs.
There are umpteen versions of Don
Carlos and none of them makes sense.
Musical director Richard Divall has
drawn on many sources and any failings
are historically correct. The only criti-
cism which can be made is the choice of
Don Carlos as such. Even great music
and fine singing in this opera make for a
long, rather than exciting, evening.
Divall’s casting, as always, is almost
flawless and the playing of the Mel-
bourne Elizabethan Orchestra makes
some of the conducting during the re-
cent AO season look pretty poor.
Surprisingly enough, the clearest
English diction comes from the Ger-
man, Philip of Arend Baumann, a fine-
looking figure with a big if dry voice. It
was a stroke of genius to have an even
bigger voice, Noel Mangin’s, for the
small key part of the Grand Inquisitor.
Joan Carden was in excellent form, yet
Verdi gave the best aria to Eboli and
Rachel Gettler exploited it to the full.
Tenors who can sing Carlos are hard to
find and Kenneth Collins is as good as
most major theatres can find.
The sum of the first real international
opera staged in Melbourne (thanks to
the new theatre) was thus a good
example of the kind of thing the AO has
been giving us for years. But do we need
two competing companies to do the
same thing?
There is hope of compromise in the
balance of the VSO season. Handel’s
Julius Caesar will be staged in conjunc-
tion with the South Australian State Op-
era; a Magic Flute is promised with cos-
tumes borrowed from the AO and scen-
ery designed for the new theatre; and
the Faust just staged at least has some of
the originality of last year’s Rigoletto,
which remains an impressive achieve-
ment even after seeing the now-famous
“mafia” version from London on tele-
vision.
The Faust is the same miniature Prin-
cess Theatre version produced by
Anthony Besch in 1981, which did not
cost a fraction of the $500,000 said to
have been spent on Don Carlos. Its
major fault now is that Besch rejects the
use of a false proscenium to fit the de-
signs, which range from good (Faust’s
study) to the ridiculous church scene
and its crucified Christ taking off like a
Boeing 747.
Besch and his designer, John
Stoddart, have transplanted the familiar
story into the 19th century. What more
appropriate than pacts with the devil in
the romantic era? People thus garbed
believed the things Gounod conjures
up before our eyes and Divall is a con-
vincing advocate for Gounod and
Mephistopheles as well.
Even more convincing is the out-
standing cast and there are those who
believe rightly that singing comes first,
be the theatre old or new. Marilyn
Richardson’s Marguerite soars to the
vocal stratosphere more convincingly
than any 747 and John Pickering has the
right French timbre and looks for an
ideal Faust. Perhaps Geoffrey Chard is a
lightweight Mephisto but he sings
faultlessly and acts well. Suzanne
Johnstone makes a real person of the
insipid Siebel and sings her music with
assurance and beauty. Only lan Cousins
seems miscast, as Valentin; it needs a
bigger man to lead an army and to curse
Marguerite with conviction.
The medal tally: a gold to the theatre
and a well-earned silver to the singers.
A bronze may be awarded to the VSO,
AO and Australia Council managers if
they ever finish the race. □


FILMS
Flying in
the face
of escapism
By SANDRA HALL
Rod Zuanic (left) as Steve In Fast Talking: getting the point in class
ESCAPISM may be the flavor of the
month any month but plenty of
film-makers continue to gamble on the
notion that teenagers also have a taste
for gritty reality.
Disaffected youth has become a bit
of an obsession with Australian direc-
tors who have gone in for laconic, hard-
nosed films on the subject with no-non-
sense titles such as Going Down, Fight-
ing Back and Moving Out (the number
of present participles being a fair indi-
cation of the amount of restless energy
involved here).
The latest is Fast Talking (the gram-
matical shift from participle to gerund
does nothing to diminish the energy
level), written and directed by Ken
Cameron who has travelled this way be-
fore with two lively short films Out OJ
It and Temperament Unsuited one the
story of unemployed kids trying to ex-
tract some fun out of life, the other
about a young schoolteacher at odds
with the system. And Fast Talking
brings both themes together.
Its equivocal hero, Steve (Rod
Zuanic) is in his last year of school, the
despair of his teachers and his alcoholic
father and a matter of indifference to his
mother who has left home for life with a
man who hates children. Big brother A 1
(Gary Cook) is a drugs pusher who uses
Steve to sell marijuana to his school-
mates and presses him to take on her-
oin, as well, and Steve’s headmaster is
determined to get him expelled before
he can sit for his exams at the end of the
year.
Prospects, then, are bleak for Steve
although not for the audience, since
Cameron has the right touch for this
sort of thing. There is no wringing of
hands, no lamenting over the heart-
lessness of illiberal adults. Life is tough
and slightly ridiculous for young
and old.
Even the middle-aged bully boy of a
headmaster (Denis Moore) seems to be
driven by nothing more sinister than
chronic exasperation. He has been
pushing people around for so long that
he has almost forgotten he is doing it.
As for Steve’s father (Peter Hehir), he
has simply given up. The mist occasion-
ally clears long enough for him to notice
what’s happening but he’d rather drift,
sustained only by the hope that one of
the sad-looking greyhounds he keeps in
the backyard will one day win some-
thing.
Steve, on the other hand, survives by
moving and talking fast. A skinny
little survivor with a pinched face and
an idea for every situation, he weaves
and dodges through life gambling on
other people’s inertia. He is not exactly
likeable but he is understandable and
Cameron is both inventive and knowl-
edgeable enough about kids to keep his
adventures hovering on the edge of
comedy.
Steve has two great friends Moose,
who lumbers along behind him doing
Frank Spencer impersonations and
laughing at everything that happens;
and Sharon, the class glamor girl, who
likes Steve because he is as audacious as
she is. Chris Truswell and Toni Allaylis
are new to films, as is Zuanic, and they
work together so naturally and with
such rapport that they don’t seem to be
acting.
Cameron has been equally smart in
choosing actors to play the only two
wholly sympathetic adults. Steve Bisley,
as a mechanic who helps Steve build
himself a motorbike, and Tracy Mann,
as a teacher who cares more for the kids
than for the school routine, bring some
necessary strength to these parts which
seem slightly underwritten given the
soundness of the rest of the script.
It is set in Sydney in the suburbs on
the edge of Botany Bay and Cameron,
who has filmed in the area before (when
making Out Of It), makes spectacular
use of the picturesque bleakness of the
landscapes. Market gardens, factory
silos and windy beaches are set against
a background sprawl of red roofs,
broken up by surreal-looking stretches
of industrial wilderness. Steve is chased
through a forest of wastepaper stacks
standing ready for pulping in the near-
by paper mill and, while no symbolism
is meant, the scene helps to enhance the
strong sense of place which is helping to
form Cameron’s signature as a director.
His last film, Monkey Grip, had it
nobody else has made Melbourne look
as interesting and Fast Talking con-
firms his talent for catching the chancy
rhythms of life on the edge.
MEANWHILE, the escapist films of the
week conjure up two fantasy figures
who present revealing portraits of fe-
male self-reliance in collision with mas-
culine expectations. One is a mermaid,
the other is Supergirl and they combine
their formidable talents for taking
charge with a sweet-natured simplicity.
The mermaid is the heroine of
Splash, the romantic comedy from
Disney’s new production company
Touchstone directed by Ron Howard
of television’s Happy Days, and already
it has charmed the American box-office
along with critics who seem to have
found its fey improbabilities a welcome
relief from other adolescent fantasies
cloned from Porky’s and Flashdance.
Perhaps the males have also re-
sponded to Daryl Hannah, as the mer-
maid, marrying qualities of the super-
human with Galatea’s urge to please.
She and her lover (Tom Hanks) meet
when she saves him from drowning and,
while he subsequently shows his love for
her by buying her half of Blooming-
dales, the deciding factor in their rela-
tionship proves to be that she can swim
and he can’t.
Supergirl (produced by Superman’s
old firm, Alexander and Ilya Salkind) is
equally meek until driven to be other-
wise. In her Clark Kent persona, she’s a
schoolgirl; when she’s wearing her red
and blue suit, she’s tactful. Rescuing her
boyfriend from Faye Dunaway, for in-
stance, she does not scoop him up in her
arms and fly off with him a la Superman
with Lois Lane: she’s considerate
enough of masculine pride to take the
chair he’s sitting in, as well. □

A well-worn
path down
memory lane
By BRIAN HOAD
THE PAUCITY of new Australian
plays has much to do with the simple
fact that, in these days of materialistic
self-interest, writers have a better
chance of paying off their mortgages by
working in film or television even
radio. Bob Herbert’s The Girl With the
Odd Colored Eyes may have been the
theatrical flop of this year’s Sydney Fes-
tival but it turned up again on ABC-FM
the other night. If script-writers were
required to serve their apprenticeships
in the more demanding area of theatre,
the standard of film and television
could be improved no end.
Still, subsidised Australian theatres
are required to keep up local content in
their programming; and so the path
down memory lane becomes in-
creasingly well-worn.
Another revival of David William-
son’s Don’s Party (1971) at Perth’s
resuscitated Playhouse will be followed
by another revival of Peter Kenna’s A
Hard God (1973). Don’s Party has just
been taken around North Queensland
by the New Moon company. William-
son’s hardiest perennial, The Remor-
alists (1971) is coming up again at
Melbourne’s Playbox. Nimrod’s recent
revival of Ron Blair’s Christian Brothers
(1975) in Sydney will be followed by an-
other from the Melbourne Theatre
Company.
Many such revivals are geared to
texts being studied in the schools. Such
large captive audiences are good for the
box-office. For the second year running,
Sydney’s Phillip Street Theatre recently
revived Richard Beynon’s The Shifting
Heart from 1957 (Let’s discuss mi-
grants!). It was preceded by a revival of
Robert Merritt’s The Cake Man from
1975. (Let’s discuss Aborigines!)
Stray from this well-worn path and
you are liable to come a cropper.
Nimrod recently revived Jack Hibberd’s
A Toast to Melba (1976). This brash,
knockabout biography is hardly the
stuff for serious study in schools. But it’s
a splendid example of a past era of larri-
kin theatre. Nimrod hoped it would
exert its old magic again. It didn’t.
Tastes change.
Now the School of Drama at the
University of NSW has decided to help
White-faced Reg Livermore and friend in an earlier Rocky Horror Show: it’s coming back
in these reassessments. It came to realise
that in the theatrical hurly-burly of a
decade and more ago some “important
works” all too easily were overlooked
and forgotten. It has decided to give
them rough-and-ready productions on
campus, for the benefit of the theatre
trade, in the hope that some may be
taken up again.
Alex Buzo’s complex study of Aus-
tralia’s most interesting governor, Mac-
quarie, was premiered by the Mel-
bourne Theatre Company in 1972
and that was that.
For a start, the original production
failed to come to proper grips with
Buzo’s novel structure: the events in
Sydney between 1810 and 1822 are
acted out on a central stage; on one side
is the Colonial Office in London ruled
over by Lord Bathurst; on the other is
the office of a lecturer in history at a
modern university.
The dialogue flows freely through
these three worlds to give (on paper at
least) a many-faceted portrait of a ben-
evolent and liberal-minded man dedi-
cated to the public good and so forced
to fight a losing battle against the con-
servative powers of self-interest. Toler-
ant and trusting to a fault, Macquarie
achieved a great deal, yet was defeated
in the end by refusing to fight his enem-
ies with their own devious weapons of
intrigue.
In 1972, a time of idealism which was
about to sweep the Whitlam Govern-
ment into power (and when theatre was
in light-hearted larrikin mood) the un-
comfortable questions raised in Mac-
quarie were hardly guaranteed to appeal
to public taste. And yet a similar scen-
ario was soon to be played out on the
stage of Australian politics. Buzo has
chosen to emphasise this fact in a re-
working of the text. He shouldn’t have
bothered. The prophetic original was
more eloquent and resounds potently in
a new era where the remaining shreds of
idealism continue to be eroded by ex-
pediency.
It is certainly rich stuff for student
study. And if only the education author-
ities would set it as a text, even the ex-
pedient Sydney Theatre Company
might give Macquarie the professional
production it deserves.
Winds of change swept the world in
1973. In London, New Zealand’s
Richard O’Brien and Australia’s Jim
Sharman captured the new mood in the
cynically outrageous musical, The
Rocky Horror Show, a sort of celebra-
tion of innocence and idealism lost. In
Perth, Dorothy Hewett looked back to
Hair with bitter-sweet nostalgia and
came up with her rock opera, Catspaw.
Cat, the counter-cultural hero, drops
out of the “wrecker’s yard” of modern
society and heads off into the desert in
search of God. A time machine arrives
to disgorge a motley collection of Aus-
tralian heroes Mary Gilmore, Daisy
Bates, Nellie Melba, Mo Macackie and
Wylie, the Aboriginal tracker who led
Edward John Eyre around the barren
coast of the Great Australian Bight.
They are caricatured as fools in rough
vaudevillean manner. And Cat limps
home from the “dead heart” to the
“wrecker’s yard,” his loss of innocent
idealism confirmed.
The themes of Catspaw are probably
incomprehensible to the younger gener-
ations of the brave new world. Its ech-
oes of Hair and its outburst of larrikin
vaudeville are theatrically out of
fashion.
Anyway, The Rocky Horror Show is
about to be given yet another revival
starting at Sydney’s Theatre Royal on
August 22. □


NOT ALL PEUGEOTS WORK 9 TO 5
The Peugeot STI is a
beautifully mannered Monday
to Friday car.
It’s luxurious, safe and very
comfortable.
But on Saturday, all it
needs is a set of race stickers.
And you could rally the
Simpson or the Snowy.
That’s because the STI is a
Peugeot.
And for decades Peugeots
have made cars so tough, the
name is legend.
YourSTl's suspension
smoothes over Pitt Street
potholes because it’s
engineered to swallow Swahili
creek beds.
The steering won’t panic at
the sight of a wet expressway
because it’s designed to control
skids in Moroccan mud.
When you’re in a hurry to
make a meeting the STl’s 2.2
litre engine will get you from the
lights to 100 in just 10.5
seconds.
When you have to brake in
a hurry to miss the neighbour’s
cat you'll stop fast and true
because the four wheel disc
brakes were specified to avoid
the odd aardvark or armadillo.
If this ad makes you want
to leap into an STI and win the
African Rally Championship,
you're a few months too late.
The STI is the current
African Rally Champion.
However, your local
Peugeot dealer will let you take
a brand new STI for a test drive.
And you won’t have to
drive far to find potholes, wet
expressways or traffic lights.
Call your nearest Peugeot
dealer. Or write for a free
brochure.

BOOKS
Interviews in
need of more
direction
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
35 mm Dreams: Conversations
with Five Directors, by Sue
Mathews. Penguin, $9.95.
CREATIVE PEOPLE are always being
asked by journalists, post-graduate stu-
dents and the simply inquisitive to ex-
plain themselves what they think they
are doing and why and how, why they
write fiction instead of poetry, why they
use acrylic paint, why they make a
piano sound like a harpischord. The key
question is always: what are you trying
to say? Only a few people feel flattered
by this. Most would have hoped that
what they devised had spoken for itself
and for them.
Film directors, though often en-
throned as gods in the pop pantheon, do
not fit into the category of creative art-
ists because whatever they achieve de-
pends too much on factors other than
talent. If one group of workers is most
vulnerable to modifications from all
sides, it is film directors.
In this book the author has gone
ahead with an arrangement of solemn
questions, luckily sometimes eliciting
less solemn answers. It is not the fault of
the five Australians under examination
that they have been elevated on what is
really a quite flimsy base. There is no
evidence that they have overweening
opinions of themselves.
The directors who did not agree to
an interview (Bruce Beresford is a no-
table absentee, whether by his own
choice we don’t know, and Stephen
Wallace) might have been more interest-
ing than a couple of those included. The
subjects are Fred Schepisi, Gillian Arm-
strong, Peter Weir, John Duigan and
George Miller.
Sue Mathews softens them up, sever-
ally, with this kind of question: Did you
go to the movies much as a kid? Was
pop music important to you? Were you
much aware of American culture? From
then on, her questions show no pattern.
For instance: Were there difficulties for
you as a woman working with the crew?
Do you look through the camera much
yourself? What sort of a relationship
did you have with your investors? What
were the gaps between your vision and
the final product?
As Hermann Goering might have
said, when we hear the word “vision,”
we reach for our gun.
It is hard to decide at whom this
book is directed. Not to your occasional
moviegoer, nor even to the one who has
a once-a-fortnight habit and very likely
not to the one who watches films on
television. Perhaps it is meant for stu-
dents of film or for those working in
films or even for critics, although these
may think that Australian directors
have not had enough work experience
(we know it’s not their fault) to have
anything very interesting to say.
A book by Joseph Gelmis, The Film
Director As Superstar, published by Peli-
can in 1974, does the question and
answer thing not with five directors but
with 16. The best-known names are
those of Brian De Palma, Lindsay An-
derson, Bernardo Bertolucci, Milos
Forman, Roman Polanski, Francis
Coppola, Arthur Penn, Mike Nichols,
IT IS something of a surprise that there
are enough early manuscripts in Austra-
lia to justify a 240-page book from the
prestige British publisher, Thames and
Hudson.
Medieval and Renaissance Illuminated
Manuscripts in Australian Collections , by
Margaret Manion and Vera Vines, both
of the Fine Arts Department of Mel-
bourne University, has just been pub-
lished at $6O.
Vines says that Australia has a “sur-
prisingly representative” collection,
which came mainly from the haphazard
enthusiasms and generosity of collectors
such as David Mitchell and Charles
Nicholson in the 19th century and, into
the 20th, James Hackett and Richard
Crouch.
Most manuscripts are in national or
state libraries and galleries but there are
a few in private hands. Given the fragility
of the works and the attitudes of li-
brarians, the public sees them rarely.
Although many manuscripts are in in-
stitutions, Vines said the world store was
“surprisingly mobile,” with sales at
Sotheby’s twice a year. Friends of the
Adelaide, Baillieu and Fisher libraries
have raised money for acquisitions in re-
cent years but large-scale benefactors are
few. Shown above is a bearded saint in-
side a 14th-century Tuscan version of the

The format of these two books is much
the same not astonishing since Peli-
can and Penguin are siblings.
But the Gelmis people have changed
the tone of film-making and that com-
paratively lately. Among them, they
made Dr Strangelove, Catch-22, If Last
Tango In Paris, Rosemary’s Baby,
Taking Off, The Godfather, Apocalypse
Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bonnie
And Clyde and A Clockwork Orange, to
name a few. Before they made the big
films, they learned how by making the
little ones. That is the stage Australian
film directors are at.
If 35 mm Dreams were a novel, its
most interesting parts would be about
the effect of filming on somebody who
comes to it with no entertainment back-
ground.
When Gillian Armstrong was direct-
ing Starstruck (a film that Australia did
not care for but Britain and America
liked) the two young stars Jo
Kennedy and Ross O’Donovan, as
Jackie and Angus Mullens went to
her and told her that “nobody said how
boring it would be” and how awful it
was to get up at 6.30 every morning.
Now, that’s a challenge.
To discuss the photographic angles
of the rock in Picnic At Hanging Rock is
simply to invite boredom. □
The strange
odyssey
of Ulysses
By LARRY WRITER
Sylvia Beach In the doorway of 8 rue de I’Odeon, Paris.
Sylvia Beach And The Lost
Generation, by Noel Riley
Fitch. Souvenir, $29.95.
THE STORY of Sylvia Beach and her
Paris bookshop, Shakespeare and Com-
pany, is that of how a raw young Ameri-
can with little money and less experi-
ence published single-handed the
banned Ulysses of James Joyce, the
most controversial (some say the most
influential) novel of the century.
Beach’s labors on Joyce’s behalf are
detailed in Noel Riley Fitch’s highly
readable, often moving, biography. The
author spent 10 years seeking out the
survivors of what Gertrude Stein
dubbed un generation perdu and comb-
ing the official papers of the dead.
The result is a book whose detail and
insight ensure its place alongside The
Autobiography Of Alice B. Toklas and
Malcolm Cowley’s Exile’s Return as a
true account of that fabled time Paris
in the 20s that Archibald MacLeish
called “the greatest
period of literary and
artistic innovation since
the renaissance.”
Late in 1919, Beach
(then 32) opened Paris’
first English-language
bookshop at 8 rue
Dupuytre. Behind the
storefront there and
later in the rue de
L’Odeon, she met such
writers as Joyce,
Hemingway, Stein, Ezra
Pound, Fitzgerald,
Gide, Valery, Dos
Passos and Wilder.
Fitch’s exhaustive
work celebrates Shake-
speare and Company as
a meeting place, refuge,
lending library, club-
house, post office,
money exchange and
reading room for the
famous and the soon-to-
be-famous. Within two
years of its opening, it
was being called “the
cradle of American
post-war literature.”
If not quite that,
Shakespeare and Com-
pany was, in its day,
certainly the most
famous literary land-
mark in Paris and the
best-known bookshop in the world.
Beach was one of this century’s first
generation of liberated women.
She left the security of a well-off New
Jersey home her father was pastor to
Woodrow Wilson to travel Europe
and work for the Red Cross in World
War I, distributing pyjamas to Serbian
troops. After the war, she studied
French poetry in Paris. She bobbed her
hair, chain-smoked, lived alone and was
a dedicated and demanding proprietor
of her little shop.
Her strength and spirit were sorely
tested in her relationship with the iras-
cible, impossible Joyce already
afflicted by the glaucoma that would
plague the rest of his days. Joyce had
spent seven years writing Ulysses, only
to see its pre-publication excerpts
banned in the United States and Britain
for explicit sexual content.
In 1921, the despairing writer met the
bookshop owner. Beach recalled the oc-
casion: “It occurred to me that some-
thing might be done and I asked,
‘Would you let Shakespeare and Com-
pany have the honor of bringing out
your UlyssesT He accepted at once but,
even as he did, it occurred to me that he
was being rash to entrust his great work
to such a funny little publisher.”
Fitch’s account of what Beach let
herself in for is compulsive reading for
anyone interested in publishing and
books and certainly will be valued by all
those who have wrestled their way
through Joyce’s enormous work.
Beach had no idea how to proceed.
The challenge was great, the chances of
failure greater. She decided that, having
no money, she should seek up-front
subscription money for the book from
her friends and sent to influential
readers and writers all over the world a
prospectus announcing the imminent
publication of Ulysses.
Supporters of Shakespeare and
Company including Pound and
Hemingway helped hawk subscrip-
tions and the target of 500 advance or-
ders soon was reached. Subscribers in-
cluded Winston Churchill, T. E.
Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw, as
well as major literary critics of America
and Britain.
With sufficient money to cover the
printing and posting of a first edition,
Beach commissioned printer Maurice
Darantiere of Dijon. The price for each
copy for the first run would be $11.50,
expensive at the time. To those who
complained, the publisher countered:
“Considering the seven years Joyce had
spent on the book and the loss of his
eyesight, it doesn’t seem to me to be as
dear as all that!”
The presses began to roll. Proofs
were sent to Joyce for correction. How-
ever, the author considered proof-read-
ing a “creative act” and made thou


sands of changes and additions. When
Darantiere finally received the “cor-
rected” proofs, Ulysses was one-third as
big again.
The printer reminded Beach that
corrections cost money. She replied test-
ily that Darantiere’s job was to print;
Mr Joyce’s was to write.
Fitch tells how, on Beach’s death, the
London Guardian obituary declared
that Ulysses became the sort of book it
was largely due to her insistence on
Joyce’s indefinite right to alter the
proofs. “It was in the exercise of this
right that the peculiarities of Joyce’s
prose style reached their novel flower-
ing.”
Another headache was finding reli-
able typists to copy Joyce’s almost il-
legible manuscripts. By mistake or well-
meaning design whole passages were
changed, deleted or re-positioned in the
text by typists of varying degrees of lit-
eracy. One typist’s husband, outraged
by what he discovered his wife typing,
flung a sheaf of pages into the family
fire.
Compounding all this was that
Darantiere’s compositors spoke no
English. No surprise, then, that the first
edition was littered with typographical
errors “at least six a page,” rued the
beleaguered publisher.
By April 1922, though, the first
edition of Ulysses was stacked in the
back room of Shakespeare and Com-
pany which at once became less a li-
brary than a shipping and mailing
depot. Joyce himself deigned to glue
labels on the brown paper packages and
even carried his book in bundles to the
post office for mailing to subscribers.
With the second edition, work in the
tiny bookshop became even more hec-
tic. Joyce’s demands on his publisher
became even more exacting. He took
over Beach’s life as well as her book-
shop. Admirers of Joyce may well be
miffed by Fitch’s generally unsympa-
thetic portrait of their hero but the au-
thor did accept favors and demand ser-
vices as if he were not a human being
but a religious cause. It was, he be-
lieved, a privilege to devote one’s life to
his genius.
The Beach-Joyce partnership ended,
fairly acrimoniously, in the mid-1930s
when Ulysses was at last ruled by courts
to be fit to read and then published by
the giant Random House. Shakespeare
and Company had presided over 11
editions of the book by then - in all,
28,000 copies.
With the Joyce connection severed,
other authors including D. H.
Lawrence, with his Lady Chatterley’s
Lover asked Beach to publish their
books. She always declined, saying that
she was a one-book publisher. In truth,
Ulysses had all but broken her spirit
not to mention her bank balance. □
BOOK BULLETIN
George at the top
by Patricia Rolfe
GEORGE JOHNSTON’S novel My
Brother Jack may be the most popular
postwar Australian novel. This came
out of the competition organised by
Australian Book Review and Julie
Copeland’s ABC radio program First
Edition to find the best-liked novels of
the past 40 years.
Ruth Park’s Harp in the South also
polled well. Patrick White had more
titles nominated than any other writer;
the most popular were Voss and Tree of
Man. Shirley Hazzard’s Transit of Venus
and Xavier Herbert’s Poor Fellow My
Country were listed often.
One of the contest winners was fulfil-
ling his promise to himself to spend the
bonus years of retirement reading Aus-
tralian literature. Another related his
reading to stages in his own life: reading
Randolph Stow’s Midnite to his young
children, reading White because his
children were “doing” him and now,
with the child to whom he read Midnite
demonstrating at Pine Gap, catching up
on Transit of Venus.
THERE HAVE BEEN 27 biographies
of Daniel Mannix. Why do another?
Peter Ryan of Melbourne University
Press believes the fact that the new one,
sub-titled The Quality of Leadership, is
by B. A. Santamaria is reason enough.
Santamaria may have been closer to the
noted Catholic Archbishop of Mel-
bourne in Mannix’s last years than any-
one else.
The biography is cradle to grave.
There may be greater interest (in Mel-
bourne still, if no longer in Sydney) in
Gore Vidal: tackling Abraham Lincoin
AUSTRAL INTERNATIONAL
Santamaria’s account of the 1950 s
Labor split and its aftermath than in
other events of Mannix’s long life.
Santamaria sees a philosophical chasm
between the two cities. He suggests that
Pope Pius XII went against his own
teachings when he sided with the pro-
clerical Cardinal Gilroy of Sydney
against Mannix who wanted to give a
greater role to the laity.
A HANDSOME gift book which will
miss the Christmas market here is Nar-
cissus, a signed, limited edition of
poems by expatriate Peter Porter with
illustrations by Arthur Boyd, coming
from British publisher Seeker and
Warburg next February at about $6O.
Since Peter Grose became managing
director of Seekers some years ago,
more Australian names have appeared
on their lists. Grose was a Sydney jour-
nalist and set up the British literary
agency Curtis Brown in Sydney in 1968.
Grose reports that this year Seekers
will publish Randolph Stow, Germaine
Greer, Barbara Ker Wilson and William
Marshall and has bought in Brian
McFarlane’s Words and Images: Austra-
lian Novels Into Film, published here by
Heinemann, and lan McNeill’s The
Team: Australian Army Advisers in Viet-
nam, 1962-1972, published here by Uni-
versity of Queensland Press. “Which,”
Grose adds, “for one middle-sized Lon-
don publisher, aint a bad record.”
AMERICAN writer Gore Vidal has
never been afraid of large themes and
has been at his most convincing, with
Burr and 1876, in novels based on his-
tory. His next book, from Heinemann in
October, tackles Abraham Lincoln
whom Vidal regards as America’s
greatest president but whom, Vidal
believes, he has tackled without rever-
ence or liking.
“Isn’t 90 percent of what is written
now about schoolteachers on sabbatical
committing adultery?” he demanded of
an interviewer while in the US from his
home in Italy to promote the book.
“I love Mary McCarthy’s long list of
what you cannot write about in a novel:
there are no sunsets, no revolutions, no
murders, no kings, no intrigues. It
leaves to the junk writers all the great,
Tolstoyan themes. The serious writers
are writing little books that tell of their
sad lives, of their capacities as victims.
If all literature is by victims, for victims,
about victims, you are not going to
change anything.” □

JOHN FICARA—Newsweek
Ashford rejoices in victory: The whole range of emotions
THE OLYMPICS
The Glory of
Los Angeles
Fans and athletes prove their mettle
in a week of surprises of the spirit.
By PETE AXTHELM
On very special occasions, there appears a quality in sport
that defies all plans and diagrams. Wrap it in a flag and it shines
forth on its own; play an anthem, any anthem, and it bursts into
its own proud song. Even when the melody becomes one of
wrenching heartbreak, as it did Friday night for Mary Decker,
the athlete’s quest is a moving celebration of the potential of the
human spirit. That is the glory of the Los Angeles Olympics.
If the first week of the Games was dominated by surprise that
they could be held smoothly and without incident, the closing
week was given to surprises of the spirit. Here was Evelyn
Ashford, usually private to the point of being reclusive, sprint-
ing to gold and flashing her whole range of emotions. Fans and
athletes alike demonstrated that in the mood kindled in L.A.,
they could not merely endure but overcome.
At some events, the bullying “U.S. A.” chants of the crowds
while Americans crushed overmatched opponents continued
to be oppressive. But at tennis, a “demonstration” addition to
the Games, top-seeded American pro Kathy Horvath was
understandably annoyed when a portion of the crowd began
rooting noisily for her Yugoslav rival Sabrina Goles. An
astonished Goles responded by upsetting Horvath.
The athletes whose images were dented most were those
whose course through the Olympics had been most carefully
charted by promoters and packagers. Zola Budd’s bare feet had
carried her from South Africa to Great Britain and on to the
Games, with the world’s hustlers and chroniclers at her heels.
The shy teen-ager not only administered the blow that de-
stroyed the Decker dream, but then in her own anguish failed to
place. Master self-promoter Carl Lewis did get his medals —all
four of them to match Jesse Owens’s standard. But with his
arrogant attitude, Lewis turned victory into antiheroism.
The best news was that victory no longer had to be red, white
and blue. Brazil gave the Games the middle-distance sensation
Joaquim Cruz, the most wondrously powerful newcomer since
Cuba’s Alberto Juantorena stormed Montreal in 1976. But
unlike propaganda-spewing Juantorena, the engaging Cruz
was no narrow chauvinist. When hometown officials offered
him a triumphant welcome back in Brasilia, he politely suggest-
ed that they spend the money to improve pathetic local track
facilities. And if Ronald Reagan’s “Win some for the Gipper”
pep talk to the Americans was a jingoistic low point, there was
nothing but charm in a report from women’s 400-meter hurdler
Nawal El Moutawakel, winner of the first Moroccan gold ever.
King Hassan II called, she said as her smile lit the room. “His
Excellency told me there is great joy in Morocco. ”
Such moments will live on, even as the movie-set pastel paint
fades from the Coliseum portals. The personality of these
Games is the people of Los Angeles, the people of America.
When the athletes of the world finally elbowed their way into the
act, the surprise of the spirit was complete.


The Games’ Stunning Finish
Speed, grace and power add up to a kind of immortality in 10s and even 4.65.
And so the road to L.A. forked rather
dramatically, and the king and queen
of the Games headed toward their distinct
destinies. Carl Lewis played it safe —much
too safe, in the opinion of those who booed
his decision to pass on four successive long-
jump attempts —and did indeed reach his
personal goal of four gold medals. In purely
athletic terms, his performance was terrific;
as spectacles go, it was short on drama —at
least until the world record-toppling 4xloo
relay on Saturday night. Mary Decker, on
the other hand, finished her only event in
the Coliseum infield, screaming in anger
and agony, the tragic heroine of the 1984
Olympics.
So now we can say about this Olympics
what has been said about every other: it was
the perfect 10 of times, it was the 4.6 of
times. Although the organizers planned a
tearful “Auld Lang Syne” for Sunday’s
grand finale, no one left Los Angeles hum-
ming “Is That All There Is?” In an attempt
to keep up with last week’s dizzying denoue-
ment, spectators hauled battery-powered
TV sets to the women’s hoops final so they
could keep tabs on volleyball—or caught a
fleeting glimpse of the pole-vault prelimi-
naries as they rushed off, clutching their
Sam the Eagle seat cushions, to watch the
boxing quarterfinals. “I Need One Closing
Ceremony,” said the sign held aloft by an
anxious ticket seeker in jampacked Exposi-
tion Park; and the most natural response
was, “So does everybody else —and quickly,
please.” Like Carl Lewis running in the 200,
the audience somehow felt a bit drained
by the Olympic experience as the Games
stampeded to a stunning conclusion.
Debate over Decker’s 3,000-meter race
(box) will afford these Games a kind of
immortality that, given the pleasant but
predictable atmosphere of L.A., they might
not otherwise have enjoyed. The compari-
sons with 1972, when American hope Jim
Ryun was run down in a 1,500-meter event,
are easy but not always instructive. For one
thing, Ryun’s demise came in a preliminary
heat, while Decker fell during the fort-
night’s single-most-anticipated moment.
But more important, Ryun was undone
by an unknown Ghanaian, while Decker
fell victim—or so she said—to a barefoot
18-year-old runner who was already the
most controversial character on the Olym-
pic stage.

‘I Should’ve Pushed Her 9
RON KUNTZ —UPI
AP
Collision course: Decker goes down,
writhing in pain and anger
The nuances of the incident will be long debated, the fingers of
blame pointed by the purists and the prejudiced. But the searing
memory is less technical than visual: with about 1,300 meters to
go in the 3,000, Zola Budd was on the outside, tiny and barefoot
and strangely vulnerable despite her vast reputation; Mary
Decker was on the inside, holding her ground. Legs brushed,
spikes hit a bare Achilles’ tendon, a little girl lurched inward and
suddenly Decker was plunging, clawing desperately at the air.
All she grasped as she fell was the number off Zola’s back.
Like most great and awful Olympic events, this one had both
immediate emotion and historical impact. Budd, who slept
every night under a Decker poster as she grew up running in
South Africa, showed horror when her idol went down and
finished the race in tears. When she approached Decker mo-
ments later, Mary waved her off: “Don’t bother.” Zola looked
crushed as she boarded a bus to leave, and a British official
pleaded forlornly, “I hope they don’t blame Zola.”
Decker was one of the thousands who did. But in the end
there were arguments on both sides. Decker had slowed her
pace. Edging past her, Budd cut a bit too sharply —there is an
unwritten rule that Budd should have maintained one stride of
leeway. Budd moved from lane two into Decker’s lane one.
Still, Decker had room to maneuver and apparently tried to
retake the lead by passing on the left. Their feet tangled.
Decker spiked Budd, leaving her left tendon bruised and
bleeding. Decker tumbled and was out of the race; Budd was
slowed to a seventh-place finish.
“I should’ve pushed her,” an en-
raged Decker said afterward. For
others, perhaps the proper response is
to grieve for both those champions,
save a tear or two for Zola —and re-
member that some of the most memo-
rable Olympic moments will always
be the might-have-beens.

coal.
In the Latrobe Valley
in Victoria, Australia, is one of
the world's richest deposits of
brown coal.
Used principally for the
generation of electricity for the
State of Victoria, the coal has
significant potential for a wide
range of other applications.
The State Government has
recently announced policies
and strategies to improve the
business environment for in-
dustry and to work with private
industry to foster development
of coal-based industries.
Now, 5 million tonnes of
brown coal per year can be
supplied for industry by the
Coal Corporation of Victoria
from a major new open cut
operated by the State Elec-
tricity Commission.
This coal is probably the
lowest cost, high purity or-
ganic carbon feedstock avail-
able in commercial guantities
in the world.

try disowned by the Olympic Family in
1970. Her personal views on apartheid are
unknown, but whatever they are, they are
the property of the London newspaper that
brought her to Great Britain and then hus-
tled her through the citizenship process so
she could run free—and, not incidentally,
lend her name to a regularly published
“Olympic Diary.” She is fast, but she is also
a front runner with little international expe-
rience. In the months leading up to their
confrontation, Decker frequently said that
it would be “interesting” to see how Budd
handled the pressure and the heavy traffic.
Grassy Infield: It was. As soon as the
pistol sounded, Decker grabbed the lead
and Budd settled into a spot just off the
American’s right shoulder. With a little
more than three laps to go, Budd made a
somewhat tentative move for the lead and
wound up hovering a dangerous half step in
front of Decker. Contact occurred almost
immediately. Budd looked distressed, but it
was Mary who peeled off grotesquely and
then tumbled onto the grassy infield. “I
don’t think there was any question that she
was in the wrong,” Decker said after being
carried off the track in the huge arms of her
fiance, British discus thrower Richard
Slaney. The officials at first agreed, and
Budd—who eventually finished a badly
beaten seventh behind Romania’s Mari-
cica Puica—was disqualified under Feder-
ation Rule 141 (“Any competitor jostling,
running across or obstructing . . . ”). But
20 minutes later an appeals jury reversed
the decision, and Decker’s gallant quest
ended in the Offical Bizzare Incident of the
1984 Games.
Lewis, despite his complaints about the
scheduling and a sore left leg, never seemed
in danger of botching his carefully con-
structed plan. He won the 100-meter dash in
9.99, the 200 in an Olympic record 19.8,
easily took the long jump with a leap of 28
feet one-quarter inch, then
cruised home to victory as
the anchor man in Satur-
day’s 4xloo relay final.
The only suprise was that he
left with a somewhat tar-
nished image; by passing on
jumping turns and post-event interviews—
and by allowing his manager, Joe Douglas,
to publicly drool over the prospect of
the lucrative endorsement contracts —Carl
came off, in what was to have been his finest
hour, as the ultimate Legend in His Own
Mind. “He’s dug himself into a hole,” ob-
served fellow jumper Larry Myricks. “He
kind of stands off and tries to be different,
like a celebrity. And now lots of people want
to see him get beat.”
Memorable: But if U.S. athletes ungra-
ciously dominated certain events in the
opening days, this was the week that com-
petitors from around the world weighed in
with some of the Games’ most memorable
performances. Zhou Jihong won China’s

first-ever gold medal in women’s platform
diving, beating out American favorites Mi-
chele Mitchell and Wendy Wyland. The
hard-stroking Australian crew managed to
hold off their New Zealand and American
rivals to win an upset victory in the men’s
eights. World-record holder Anisoara Cus-
mir Stanciu of Romania took the women’s
long jump with a leap of 22 feet 10 inches,
and Britain’s Tessa Sanderson uncorked an
Olympic-record heave of 228 feet 2 inches.
Yugoslavia edged the incredibly hunkish
U.S. team in water polo. And fast-closing
Joaquim Cruz of Brazil won the 800 me-
MITCHELL B. REIBEL
Cruz ahead of the pack: The Brazilian took the 800 meter, setting a new Olympic record
ter —the race of the meet for hard-core track
fans —by beating Britain’s Sebastian Coe
and America’s Earl Jones in the Olympic
record time of 1:43.
But no one added more to the interna-
tional flavor than decathlete Daley Thomp-
son (following story), the son of a Nigerian
father and a Scottish mother who runs for
Great Britain even though he’s been living
lately in southern California. Untroubled
by the hot days and suddenly cool evenings,
Thompson, 26, ran away from archrival
Jurgen Hingsen of West Germany to be-
come the first man to win back-to-back
since America’s Bob Mathias accomplished
the feat in 1948 and ’52.
Still, the host American athletes fur-
nished an ample supply of golden moments.
The victory-stand tears of 100-meter queen
Evelyn Ashford were a case in point, but so
were the joyous smiles of newcomers like
400-meter man Alonzo Babers, hurdler
Benita Fitzgerald-Brown and triple gold
medalist Valerie Brisco-Hooks, who set
Olympic records at 400 meters (48.83) and
200 meters (21.81), and as a member of the
4x400-meter relay team (3:18.29). “I guess
this proves you can come back from any-
thing, even a baby,” said Brisco-Hooks,
who was 40 pounds overweight after giving
birth to her son, Alvin, two years ago. “But,
really, I’m still lifting my knees wrong, still
learning how to compete.” The same could
not be said for diving champion Greg Lou-
ganis, who reached a personal apex in the
springboard competition, scoring more 9s
and 10s than all his competitors combined.
Said his coach, Ron O’Brien, “Greg is oper-
ating as close to perfection as any athlete
you’re bound to see at the Games.”
Boos: Perhaps, but the U.S. boxing team
was almost as flawless; 11 of its 12 members
made it into the medal rounds, and in the
end 9, including the highly touted Mark
Breland, survived a mind-boggling number
of matches to get the gold. They also sur-
vived a seemingly equal number of judging
and coaching controversies; in one hotly
disputed bout, Angelo Musone of Italy had
his win over America’s Henry Tillman set
aside by a review panel, a decision that
elicited a chorus of boos from fans who
thought that Musone had clearly prevailed.
But no one lorded over their rivals more
obviously than America’s basketball teams.
The women overwhelmed their opponents
by an average victory margin of 32 points
during the tournament and trounced South
Korea 85-55 in their suspenseless final. The
men’s final promised to be —and was —so
one-sided that only about three-quarters of
the L.A. Forum’s seats were filled as coach
Bobby Knight directed his collection of
college all-stars to a 96-65 victory over
Spain. At the postgame press conference in
which Spanish coach Antonio Diaz-Miguel
praised “the ability for colored players to
play basketball”—and then, struggling with
an idiom, added, “It is clear as consomme
soup that the U.S. is at least 50 years ahead of
all other basketball programs. ’ ’
Smog Alert: As the Games wore on, the
Olympic city became something less than
the perfect place it had been in week one.
One problem was that Angelenos, no longer
able to resist the temptation, sneaked back
into their Mercedeses and Ferraris, causing
rush-hour traffic to reach normally horren-
dous pre-Olympic levels. The ultimate
crunch probably came on Wednesday,
when the 92,000 spectators heading for the
semifinal soccer matches met commuter
traffic head-on, causing congestion to
spread from the Pasadena to the Santa
Monica and San Diego freeways. This, in
turn, helped bring back the pollution that,
for a while, existed only in the minds of
visiting Soviet journalists. As a first-stage
smog alert went out, mini-ambulances
toured the venues, and indeed found oxygen
in demand: several women on the Dutch
field-hockey team had to stop playing be-
cause of debilitating chest pains, and six
equestrian spectators were felled by a com-
bination of heat and hydrocarbons.
There were mixed reviews for the several
new Olympic events introduced in these
Games. The nonmedal baseball tourna-
ment, won by Japan, was well attended and
entertaining—as were the stiffly theatrical
synchronized-swimming events dominated
by Americans Candy Costie and Tracie
Ruiz. But the rhythmic gymnastics compe-
tition suffered from numerous technical
glitches and gaffes. One problem was that
the ventilation system at UCLA’s Pauley
Pavilion played havoc with the streamers
the athletes use in their signature rou-
tine. The British delegation demanded ac-
tion, but a high-ranking Olympic official
responded by paraphrasing Avery Brun-
dage: the air conditioning must remain on,
she said. “We will not sweat.” Maybe that
breakdown was a signal that it was indeed
time for the Games to conclude. As
the bumper sticker spotted on Wilshire
Boulevard said: “Welcome to California—
Now Go Home.”

Thai s First Class has long been considered one of
the best in the air.
Things have changed. Now its even better.
Take your seat. Totally new in design, it has improved
back support and reclines further. The footrest extension is
now fully padded. And when extended the seat is more like
a bed than ever before.
Lunch and dinner have always been a gourmet
experience for our First Class passengers.
Now breakfast is, too.
With freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh eggs
cooked any way you like them, right there on the plane.
Caviar is yours for the asking. And what goes better
with the best caviar than the best champagne, vintage Dom
Perignon, no less.
The wine list is equally impressive. Superb French
wines specially selected in that country by Thai.
In keeping with this new standard of excellence, Thai
are introducing elegant new table and glassware to go with it.
Other little luxuries include, smart complimentary
toilet kits, more comfortable electronic headsets, and new
sleeping shades and comfort socks. Of course, Thai s .
renowned Royal Orchid Service is as good as it
ever was, nobody could improve on that.
And as a memento, we give every
Royal First Class passenger a beautiful,
limited edition print of one of six
orchid paintings, specially commis-
sioned from a well-known artist.

A Gold for Cheek
Britain’s Daley Thompson may or may not be the greatest
athlete in the world. He certainly must rank, however, as the
most impish. When Thompson won the grueling two-day Olym-
pic decathlon last week, he celebrated in characteristic style.
Before taking his victory lap, he donned a powder-blue T shirt
emblazoned with the message, “Thanks, Americans, for a Good
Games and a Great Time.” Across the back, though, was the
question, “But What About the TV Coverage?”—a cheeky
reference to earlier charges that ABC had focused too heavily on
U.S. athletes. Moments later, as the Coliseum loudspeakers
blared “God Save the Queen” during the medal ceremony, the
laid-back Thompson simply whistled along.
In between Olympics, the decathlon mostly stays buried in the
agate-type obscurity of the sports pages. But last week, through
equal measures of athletic prowess and personal flamboyance,
the 26-year-old Thompson once again yanked the event back to
center stage. With a total of 8,797 points, Thompson duplicated
his victory in the U.S.-boycotted 1980 Games in Moscow and
joined Bob Mathias as the only athlete to win two Olympic
decathlon championships. And though his total score fell 1 point
short of the world record held by archrival Jurgen Hingsen of
West Germany, officials said that when his performance is
computed on newly adopted tables, Thompson will also surpass
that mark. “The last couple of
days,” he said later, “I’ve had the
biggest buzz of my life. It’s made
this lonely event worthwhile.”
There was nothing shy or retir-
ing about the way Thompson han-
dled the hoopla surrounding the
competition. At a press conference
before the event, he said, “I under-
stand [Hingsen] has promised the
German people he’ll bring the gold
medal home.” Then he dead-
panned, “That means he’ll either
steal mine or do another event.”
For British viewers, many of whom
stayed up far into the night to
watch each day’s results, the off-
track performance was vintage
Thompson. Two years ago, for in-
Hingsen heaving , Thompson win-
ning:‘The last couple of days, I’ve
had the biggest buzz of my life ’

stance, he stunned his countrymen by uttering an expletive
undeleted on TV when presented with a trophy as the BBC’s
Sports Personality of the Year. Says Robert Mortimer, one of
Thompson’s first coaches, “He doesn’t always do the
expected.”
Except on the track. Thompson came into the competition
having beaten Hingsen seven straight times in head-to-head
contests. He had also won every decathlon he finished in the last
six years. True to form, Thompson got off to a fast start in the first
day’s events, equaling or surpassing personal bests in the 100
meters, long jump and shot put before knocking off for a lunch of
chicken and chips. (Thompson’s long jump of 26 feet 3L> inches
would have been good enough for fifth place in the open competi-
tion won by Carl Lewis.) By the end of the first five events,
Thompson had built up what appeared to be a formidable 114-
point lead over Hingsen. All the while, Thompson seemed to be
the picture of relaxation, laughing and joking with the other
competitors.
Flipping Out: On the second day, Thompson suddenly looked
vulnerable. The 6-foot-6% Hingsen started out by edging him in
the high hurdles. Then Thompson had two abysmal throws in
the discus; only a respectable toss on his final attempt allowed
him to preserve his lead, which had dwindled to a mere 32 points.
In prospect, most handicappers had expected the next event, the
pole vault, to be pivotal—and it was. Just as the four-hour event
was about to get under way, Hingsen started feeling dizzy and
sick, and he threw up in the tunnel
leading to the dressing room. He
eventually managed only a lacklus-
ter 14 feet 9, far below his best of 16
feet three-quarters of an inch.
Thompson soared over 16 feet 4%
on his first attempt —and did a dol-
phinlike flip in the pit in exultation.
“The pole vault kind of sorted it
out,” said Thompson. “It
was all over but the shout-
ing.” In fact, just before
the start of the final event,
the 1,500 meters, Hingsen
was already offering his hand to
Thompson in congratulations.
In the aftermath of his victory,
Thompson predicted that he would
be around for the 1988 Games in
Seoul. He admitted, however, that
with his commercial value at an all-
time high, it might be difficult to
preserve his amateur standing. Still,
some friends insisted that such con-
siderations would not weigh that
heavily on him. “If there is money to
be made, he’ll make sure he gets the
market price, but that’s not why he’s
competing,” says Graeme Fell, a
teammate of Thompson’s on the
Newham and Essex Beagles Athlet-
ic Club. “He competes because it’s
his life and he enjoys it.” Thompson
has said as much. “There’s nothing
I’d rather do,” he told Runner’s
World magazine. “I wouldn’t like to
be an astronaut or playboy or any-
thing else —being out here on the
track is fine. ” For many of those who
delighted in his breezy heroics last
week, nothing could be finer.
BILL HEWITT with MARTIN KASINDORF


After the Games, Cash
Medals bring celebrity and the chance to get rich.
Hi! I’m Carl Lewis!
They’ve been waiting years for this,
these young athletes who have sacrificed so
much, suffered through the bitter disap-
pointment of the 1980 Olympic boycott,
invested so much blood and sweat for the
proud moment when they can stand up
and say . . .
You know, performance on the athletic
field and performance by a life-insurance
company have a lot in common . . .
It is one of the ironies of amateur sports:
you train your whole life to do
something better than anyone
else in the world, but no one
actually pays you for it; in-
stead, you become a celebrity
and get paid just because of
who you are. No one knows
just how much a gold medal in
one of the glamour sports is
worth to the recipient who
chooses to take advantage of
it, but a figure frequently
encountered is upward of
$500,000 a year. That is the
base figure for swimmers
Rowdy Gaines and Steve
Lundquist cited by their
agent, Parkes Brittain of Ad-
vantage International Agency.
It is also not terribly far
from the income of hurdler
Edwin Moses, who gave a de-
tailed accounting of his
finances last spring to dem-
onstrate to young athletes
that they could get rich
staying in training. Moses,
who won his first Olympic
gold medal in 1976, made
$457,500 last year, and he
expects to make between
$600,000 and $900,000 after
this year’s gold.
No one can predict the fu-
ture earnings of the six mem-
bers of the American men’s
basketball team who have
been drafted by NBA teams.
They would be rich anyway,
but they’ll probably be even
richer now; minutes after Mi-
chael Jordan executed a beau-
tiful base-line stuff in the
men’s victory over Canada,
the phone began ringing in
the living room of Jonathan
Kovler, operating officer of
Jordan’s future team, the Chi-
cago Bulls. Six friends called
Kovler with the same mes-
sage: “That shot’s going to
cost you $10,000.”
It isn’t easy being No. 1. But
there’s one mutual fund that has been No. 1
longer than any other. . .
Some of the boos that Lewis endured
last week, when he settled for a gold medal
in the long jump without trying to break
the world’s record, might have been rooted
in the feeling that anyone getting paid as
much as he is ought to put in a full after-
noon’s work. The temptation is to blame a
degenerate age, but if anything, ethical
standards have been improving. Arguably,
one of the greatest heroes of the 20th
BART BARTHOLOMEW— BLACK STAR
Moses, hurdling for the greater glory of Kodak: The gold medal ensures a raise from last year’s $457,500
century, Charles Lindbergh, astonished his
countrymen in the United States when he
turned down commercial offers that in
1927 dollars totaled the astounding figure
of $5 million; but at the same time Sen.
Charles Curtis, soon to be vice president of
the United States (under President Herbert
Hoover), appeared in advertisements with
a message for his fellow citizens about
Lucky Strike cigarettes; and the makers of
Beautyrest mattresses were proud to print
a testimonial from that well-known society
woman from New York, Mrs. Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.
You know, we woman athletes have spe-
cial nutritional needs . . .


If three runners —Lewis, Moses and dis-
tance runner Mary Decker —were already
well known and making money, there is
one obvious reason: everyone in America
has a pair of sneakers, and the urge to
possess the brand that covers 100
meters in a 10th of a second less than
its rival is shared even by those who
wear theirs only to go up on the roof
and clean out the gutters. A lot is at
stake, and the shoe companies as
well as the athletes play for keeps.
Moses’s long-term contract with
Adidas may eventually net him as
much as $2.5 million, but to collect
he may have to run in the
next Olympics, when he will be 32;
asked if he plans to compete in 1988,
Moses replied, “Unfortunately, I
might have to.”
Tragedy: Decker’s agent, Drew
Mearns, sought to protect her value
by signing advertisers to contracts
before the Olympics, in case she
didn’t do as well as hoped—a strate-
gy that may well have paid off when
she crossed legs with Zola Budd,
went down and was unable to finish
in the 3,000-meter race late last
week. Still, her tragedy will obvious-
ly have financial repercussions. Ac-
cording to Mearns, it will cost Decker
“hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
Swimmers also have some natural tie-
ins, enumerated by agent Brittain as
“watch companies, hair- and skin-care
companies, swimming-accesssory compa-
nies and of course pool companies.” The
swim-gear manufacturers, accustomed to a
new crop of heroes every four years, have
had to wait eight years since Americans
last competed in the Olympics and are said
to be especially hungry for new talent.
Gaines and Lundquist between them have
had contacts with 300 companies over the
last nine months—with three product af-
filiations lined up last week —so that it
Andersen-Schiess at the finish: They’ll remember her
DAVID MADISON— DUOMO
seemed only natural for Gaines to quip,
apropos of his exuberant clenched-fist vic-
tory salute after winning the 100-meter
freestyle race, that he was showing off his
assets for the benefit of underarm-deodor-
ant manufacturers.
Few people foresaw that the male gym-
nasts would become stars and no one is
sure of their value. They suffer from the
obvious disadvantage of not using any
equipment that can be mass-marketed.
“The fact that Peter Vidmar wears a cer-
tain gym outfit is fine,” muses his lawyer,
Wally Wolf. “But how many families do
you know who have parallel bars in their
living rooms?” If you can’t sell equipment,
though, you sell excellence, in the
hope that some of the luster of your
achievements will rub off on your
employer’s tires or vitamins. That’s
the approach Wolf is taking to the
marketing of Vidmar and his other
major client, star diver Greg Lou-
ganis, of whom he modestly asserts
that “these boys represent all that is
good on the human scene . . .” —a
quality that “could translate into
any range of product: food, auto-
mobiles, you name it.” Here, the
important quality is credibility. Sid
Craig, the Hollywood agent who
represents gymnast Mitch Gaylord,
was delighted to get three calls in
one day last week from television
series seeking Gaylord’s appearance
and even more delighted that they
wanted him not as an actor but as
himself.
Ironically, the little-girl qualities
in Mary Lou Retton that made her
such a popular television figure are
said to detract from her advertising
credibility. No one who looks as if she
might not quite reach the gas pedal is going
to make big money as a spokesperson for a
car company. On the other hand, a gifted
promoter can see opportunities that more
literal-minded folk might miss. Burly Jeff
Blatnick, for example, might easily have
been just another forgettable American
wrestler, except for the fact that he had

medalist Carl Lewis—and
he’s every bit as hard-driv-
ing as his client. “Carl is not
cold and calculating and
seeking a billion dollars,”
says Douglas, a former high-
school math teacher who
negotiates personal appear-
ances, endorsement con-
tracts and book deals for the
track star. “ I’m the one who’s cold and
calculating and seeking a billion dollars.”
Even the ebullient Douglas admits he’s
not quite scoring in that league yet. But he
does project that Lewis’s income, after four
gold medals, “definitely will be in seven
digits” by 1985. “Seven or eight,” he says.
Douglas, who assembled “Team Lewis”
with two attorneys and two accountants in
1981, says he’s talking with two major oil
companies, a soft-drink manufacturer and
a credit-card firm about commercials and
appearances. Already, he has Lewis doing
posters for Sales Corp. of America. He put
together a billboard-and-TV-spot arrange-
ment with Nike shoes and promotional
deals with Fuji film and Xerox in Japan. He
is also dickering with Houston sculptor
Robert Pack to market a “limited edition”
$5,000 bronze sculpture of Lewis, and
hopes to land a movie contract for his
champion as well. Coming into the Games,
Lewis had been collecting up to $ 15,000 per

America care about Greco-Roman wres-
tling,” says advertising executive George
Lois, “. . . yet somebody smart, with the
right product, is going to take advantage of
that nice, strong kid.”
Daphne Jongejans, the 19-year-old
Dutch diver, didn’t even have to win to get
noticed. The TV exposure she got without
getting close to a medal was enough to
touch off a stampede of sorts among film
directors, modeling agents and talent
scouts possibly interested in her services.
At the UCLA offices of the Netherlands
Olympic Committee (NOC), staffers sud-
denly found themselves fielding a bewil-
dering barrage of offers in the wake of
Daphne’s dazzling appearance. “Blake Ed-
wards called and asked her to do a screen
test,” said one NOC official. “Nothing is
firm yet, but many people have been asking
for her in the last two days. The phones,
literally, have not stopped ringing.” Others
saw great possibilities in Gabriela Ander-
sen-Schiess, the Swiss marathoner who
looked as if she barely made it alive to
the finish. “Everybody’s going to re-
member her,” said one shoe company ex-
ecutive confidently. “She can run 20 more
times this year for $5,000 apiece in appear-
ance money.”
Millionaire: Not all the athletes at Los
Angeles necessarily need the money that
badly. Massive Dinko (Dean) Lukin, who
won the super heavyweight weightlifting
competition, is already a millionaire tuna
fisherman back in Australia. And, of
course, there are those whom nobody is
likely to remember anyway, like Joe Var-
gas, the 28-year-old industrial-real-estate
broker who played on the surprising U.S.
water-polo team. Vargas will go back to

Swimmer Nancy Hogshead has a year and

she plans to go to law school. “Then,” she

compared to that which
awaits the Abbagnale broth-
ers, Giuseppe and Carmine, of
Capua, Italy, who won a gold

his praise for them with

track-meet appearance; that price is ex-
pected to climb after the Olympics.
Yet Douglas has still not scored the real
jackpot—an exclusive contract to repre-
sent one particular prestige corporation —
and some professional deal makers wonder
whether he isn’t playing beyond his skills,
They tend to scoff at his hyperbole: Doug-
las boasted at one point that Lewis would
make as much money as Michael Jackson,
And they note an occasional lapse in exper-
tise. He says, for example: “We are looking
for something along the lines of the en-
dorsement deal Bruce Jenner had with
Wheaties—is that Kellogg’s?—or the deal
O. J. Simpson had with Avis.” In fact,
Wheaties are made by General Mills and
Simpson tries harder for Hertz. Douglas
protests, however, that he’s at least as
professional as some of the more famous
player reps, and that, unlike them, he
doesn’t demand a 25 percent cut. (He
won’t say just what his percentage is, ex-
cept that it’s less.) “I don’t think it takes
a Hollywood wheeler-dealer to handle a
superstar in track and field,” he says.
Douglas himself ran competitively at
Texas Christian University but admits he
was no worldbeater. Coaching part time
while teaching and running his track club,
Douglas was introduced to Lewis in 1980
by IJniversity of Houston track coach Tom
Tellez. He was able to turn to sports man-
agement full time only in June 1983 but has
prospered mightily since then, handling
not only Carl’s sister, long jumper Carol
Lewis, but also sprinter Kirk Baptiste and
800-meter man Johnny Gray. His leading
client has been so grateful for his handling,
meanwhile, that he gave Douglas a $ 14,000
Mitsubishi coupe last December.
The biggest hurdle in Douglas’s quest for
contracts may be his client’s growing image
problem. There were boos from the crowd
when Lewis won his second gold medal last
week with only two of six permitted long
jumps—and without appearing to make a
serious challenge to the old Olympic record
set by Bob Beamon —ostensibly to avoid
the risk of injury. Reporters have com-
plained, moreover, that Douglas keeps
Lewis aloof and apart and attempts to
manage the news by allowing his star to
shine on TV only in the major markets and
demanding that publications pay for pho-
tos. Last week, New York Times sports
columnist Dave Anderson dubbed Lewis
“Copyright Carl,” noting that he has taken
to copyrighting portrait photos in his own
name. (Although the editors said they did
not pay a fee, Time magazine ran a copy-
right when it put a pre-Olympic photo of
Lewis on last week’s cover.) And other
writers have begun describing him as
“arrogant.”
At his first press conference since the
Games began, Lewis declared in exempla-
ry “Chariots of Fire” fashion that he’s not
running for the money: “I compete only for
myself, my country, and all the glory goes
to God.” But if Douglas continues to play
so openly to mammon, even the glory of
four golds may be tarnished.

WORLD AFFAIRS
Fighting the Mines of August
An international task force sets off to sweep some treacherous Mideast waters.
The giant C-5 jet transports roared off
the airstrip at Norfolk, Va., and 200
American servicemen were bound for the
Middle East to contend with an unknown
enemy. Their mission was not a difficult
one: to help the Egyptian government
sweep mines that have damaged at least 16
ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez. Yet
as the airlift headed for its first stop in
Spain last week, the mood around Wash-
ington was tinged with anxiety. “Even
though there is no stated threat, we don’t
know precisely what forces we may
be dealing with,” said Pentagon spokes-
man Michael Burch. “We don’t know
who might be wanting to disrupt our as-
sistance effort.”
The U.S. troops, accompanied by four
RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters, were
scheduled to arrive in the Gulf of Suez late
this week. There they are to join an inter-
national task force consisting of British,
French, Egyptian, Saudi and North Yeme-
ni vessels —and perhaps even a mine
sweeper from the Soviet Union. Egypt has
also asked Italy to join in. Operating off
the helicopter carrier Shreveport, the U.S.
choppers will tow hydrofoil sleds and cable
rigs equipped to find and destroy acoustic,
magnetic or pressure-sensitive mines. The
helicopters hover well above the water,
safe from any underwater explosions, and
U.S. officials emphasized that no Ameri-
can surface craft would be directly in-
volved in the minesweeping. Washington
also stressed that U.S. forces will make no
effort to prevent anyone from sowing new
mines. But it refused to divulge the precise
timing and location of the operations for
fear of inviting a terrorist attack.
While the mission was designed as a
demonstration of American support for
Egypt, it also thrust the Reagan adminis-
tration into some rather choppy political
waters. Sending troops abroad is seldom
good politics during an election year. The
expedition to the Gulf of Suez may be
particularly unpopular because of the ad-
ministration’s past difficulties in the Mid-
dle East. A group called Islamic Holy
War—the same terrorist organization that
took credit for the Marine massacre at the
Beirut airport last year—claimed that it
had sowed the mines. Iran first endorsed
and then denounced the mining (box). And
the Americans advanced cautiously to-
ward Egyptian waters. The helicopters lin-
gered briefly in Spain for final assembly
and testing. They could have been flown
directly to Cairo; instead, they were to
make their way to the mine fields aboard
the Shreveport, a 10-day journey by sea.
Naval officials insisted that it was far more
convenient to operate the choppers off a
mother ship where routine maintenance
could be performed. But the craft can also
be operated from unprepared land sites
and could have been deployed much faster.
But given the murky nature of the terror-
ists, it seemed the wiser part of valor to
move gingerly. There was growing evidence
that Iran and Libya were responsible for the
mines. According to sources in Egypt, a
team of American mine-warfare experts re-


[?]BOHLSSON— NEWSWEEK
covered three mines that appeared to be of
Iranian make—though Washington nei-
ther confirmed nor denied the report. Last
week Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
declared that both Iran and Libya may be
responsible for the mining. Mubarak said he
would close the Suez Canal to any country
proven to be responsible for the mining.
Some Iranian exiles speculated that the
conflicting statements about the mines from
Iran indicated that its Islamic goverment
was locked in a power struggle between
extremists and more moderate forces. In
Paris former Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani Sadr insisted that Iranian extremists
were to blame —though he conceded that
the extremists may not be the only sponsors
of the mining. “But Iran helps,” he said.
“Iran has lots of power to help terrorists; it
has money and other means to support ter-
rorists efficiently.” Fie also cited Iran’s
conflicting statements as evidence that the
regime is divided by deep ideological differ-
ences. But some U.S. officials were con-
vinced it was Libya acting alone.
Off the Shelf: The fact was that almost
anyone could have sown the mines. Mines
are relatively easy to acquire on the world
arms market, and they are not very diffi-
cult to assemble from scratch. “Mines
could be homemade,” says one U.S. Navy
expert. “You could go to Radio Shack,
probably, and get something” to serve as a
triggering device.
The motives of whoever planted the
mines remained unclear. If the Iranians
were responsible, some experts theorized
that Islamic extremists within the govern-
ment may be trying to frighten tankers from
taking on Iraqi oil. “If it is the Iranians,
what they are saying to the Iraqis is, ‘Look,
you are interfering with our exports from
Kharg Island —we can also interfere with
your oil if it is going through the Suez
Canal’,” said Adm. Sir James Eberle, direc-
tor of Britain’s Royal Institute of Interna-
tional Affairs and a mine-warfare expert.
Eberle said Iran could also be warning the
Saudis that any oil shipped through the Red
Sea will be vulnerable if they continue to
support Iraq.
For its part, the Iranians accused the
United States and Israel of sowing the
mines. The Iranian Foreign Ministry
charged that the two governments had en-
tered into a “new conspiracy” to discredit
Teheran. The Iranians said that any at-
tempt to blame them for the minings was a
reflection of the “U.S. and Israeli defeat” in
Lebanon. “It was clear that in order to
retaliate for their defeats and failure of their
political and military schemes in the Per-
sian Gulf, they would resort to such a
move,” the ministry said.
A sense of confusion —and intimida-
tion —pervaded the Suez Gulf port of Ras
Shukhair. Newsweek spoke by radio with
the skipper of the Big Orange XII, a small
oil-service vessel that had been disabled by
an explosion. U.S. Navy officials inspected
the ship, said Capt. Barry J. Bromby, and
concluded that “the explosion was caused
by a substantial underwater device.” The
blast, which occurred three miles off Ras
Shukhair, caused extensive damage to the
ship’s engine room, navigational equipment
and propeller shaft, but no one was serious-
ly injured. As Bromby described the inci-
dent, a strange voice interrupted the open
radio conversation. It was the skipper of the
Norwegian yacht Colona, who complained
that Egyptian authorities had not warned
him of the danger in the area. Last week a
Polish cargo ship struck a mine at the
mouth of the Red Sea.
Magnetic: The immediate problem, if no
mines have yet been recovered, is to discov-
er what kind of mines are bobbing beneath
the water. “The first thing they have got to
do is try to recover one mine,” said Eberle.
“This may give them evidence about the
origin of the mines and how they operate.”
The mines could be of several varieties: old-
fashioned impact mines; more modern
magnetic charges, which explode when
their sensors pick up the magnetic field of a
ship’s hull; acoustic mines, which are trig-
gered by the sound of a ship’s propeller, and
pressure-sensitive mines, which respond to
changes in water pressure when ships pass
on the surface.
At first the choppers will look for mine
fields by towing an array of sideways-scan-
ning sonar devices that produce a ping when


U.S. mine sweepers in Norfolk:‘We don’t know who might be waiting to disrupt our effort’
UPI
they find a metallic object underwater. At
that point divers will go down to see what
the sweepers are up against. If the device is
moored, it can be ripped up with sweep
wires. The mines will then bob to the sur-
face, where they can be detonated by sharp-
shooters in the helicopters. Bottom mines
can be set off either by a magnetic field
generated through electrode cables or by an
MK-104 acoustic generator, which dupli-
cates the sound of a large ship propeller.
American experts speculated that the
mines could have been manufactured by
someone with only a limited knowledge of
underwater explosive effects, principally
because the explosions had caused relative-
ly little damage. “They may not have put
in enough explosive or have set them to go
off too far away from the hulls,” said one
U.S. Navy expert. “Or they may have laid
them in places where the con-
cussion is muffled.” Some
experts speculated that the
mines were simply loaded
aboard a merchant ship and
then indiscriminately dumped
overboard. The Navy could
not rule out the possibility that
the mines had been equipped
with timing devices that
turned them on and off or with
counters that activated them
only after a certain number of
ships had passed overhead.
If the mines are resting on
the bottom, they could be set to
start working anytime over the
next several months. And that
could prove highly embarrass-
ing if the Navy were to sweep
the area and declare it safe,
only to have more ships hit by
explosions days or weeks later. It could also
prove bloody. This month some 110,000
Egyptians will join the annual Islamic pil-
grimage to the holy sites of Saudi Arabia —
and 25,000 of them are expected to travel
through the now very treacherous waters of
the Gulf of Suez and the northern Red Sea.

An Iranian Power Struggle?
At one point, the mystery of who mined the Red Sea seemed to
be solved last week. On the same day that the American ships
and helicopters embarked on their slow journey to the Mideast
waters, the Iranian state radio reported that the mines had been
planted by a terrorist group called Islamic Holy War. It went on
to proclaim with glee that “all the arro-
gant powers are helpless, unable to save
dozens of ships facing destruction in the
Gulf of Suez and Red Sea every day.”
But then Iran’s Prime Minister Mir Hus-
sein Moussavi denied that his country
had abetted the mining, and Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini himself savaged the
radio reports. “Mining some place
means an innocent group would be anni-
hilated,” he said, according to the offi-
cial Iranian news agency. “How could
we support something which is against
Islam and against reason?”
Still, the suspicion lingered that Iran
was very much involved—-and that its
contradictory statements on the mining
were evidence of a growing power strug-
gle within the country’s Islamic revo-
lutionary government. Speaking from
exile in Paris, former President Abolhas-
san Bani Sadr contended that the 84-
year-old Khomeini had suffered a seri-
ous heart attack last month. According
to Bani Sadr—a vehement opponent of
Khomeini:‘Against Islam and reason ’
AP
Khomeini —Iran’s Council of Experts met to chart new policies
for the future in the event of the Ayatollah’s death. The council
chose the relatively moderate Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri
as Khomeini’s successor, Bani Sadr said.
Khomeini survived; but Bani Sadr believes that he is still a
very sick man. “The post-Khomeini era started a month ago,” he
told Newsweek. “For the moment,” he said, somewhat self-
servingly, “those in the regime with a tendency toward peace
and moderation are in the ascendancy.”
Those extremists who remain in posi-
tions of power are particularly opposed
to overtures to the West, and that, said
Bani Sadr, “is why they multiply their
acts of sabotage to torpedo the initiatives
of the moderates.” But other Iranian
exiles disagreed with Bani Sadr’s theo-
ries. Some believed that the mining had
been the work of Takfir wal Hijra (Re-
pentance and Holy Flight), an Egyptian-
based group of Islamic fundamentalists.
The group may be supported by Libya’s
Col. Muammar Kaddafi, who has sel-
dom lost a chance to embarrass the
Egyptian government. Egyptian De-
fense Minister Abdel-Halim Abu-Gha-
zala said his country would “retaliate in
any way we think proper.” If the Egyp-
tians do take military action, whoever
planted the mines may have accom-
plished a major objective—widening the
conflict in the Middle East.

SOUTHEAST ASIA
Should Everyone Be Scared?
By LARRY ROHTER
Asian Regional Editor
With great fanfare, China recently cele-
brated the 30th anniversary of its
declaration of “the five principles of peace-
ful coexistence” —a policy of mutual non-
aggression and noninterference aimed at
winning friends throughout Asia. At the
same time, American Secretary of State
George Shultz was visiting Southeast Asia
and was told by a Malaysian Foreign Minis-
try official that China remains “a threat to
the region” and that U.S. support for Chi-
na’s economic and military mod-
ernization program could encour-
age Peking to “revert to the
policies of hegemony.”
To Shultz, such comments
must have sounded like a variation
on a familiar theme. On previous
visits to Asia, he has met worried
opposition to the U.S. policy of
encouraging Japan to play a great-
er role in the defense of Asia. The
Japanese have voiced anxieties
about the Soviet military buildup
in East Asia. And they worry that
the United States might agree to a
negotiated settlement of Soviet
SS-20 missile deployments in Eu-
rope that would enable the Krem-
lin to transfer weapons into Asia.
Thailand, the “frontline” state in
the conflict in Cambodia, worries
about Vietnam’s power and has
been pressing Washington to pro-
vide it with advanced weapons.
Many American officials are in-
clined to scoff at Asian expres-
sions of anxiety; they regard them
as mere political rhetoric aimed at
domestic audiences or attempts to
obtain more American support.
“There may be some notion that
says the bleaker the security pic-
ture, the more the U.S. will focus
on this part of the world,” says one
veteran diplomat in Southeast
Asia. “What better way to get the
attention of the United States?”
Japan-Bashing: The behavior of
Southeast Asian governments en-
courages that viewpoint. Malay-
sian and Indonesian leaders score
political points at home when they
talk of the threat of a newly aggres-
sive China, and Philippine Presi-
dent Ferdinand Marcos has not
hesitated to engage in Japan-bash-
ing when his support has lagged.
But the governments of the region,
especially the six that make up the
Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), are motivated
by more than short-term political
gain. The stunning economic
growth that they have achieved
has increased their sense of being attractive
“targets of opportunity” and has made
them feel more vulnerable. This sense of
insecurity has been fed both by a U.S.
“swing” strategy that spreads American
naval power thin and by the massive Soviet
naval and air buildup—which Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew calls “the
most significant development since the
American withdrawal from Vietnam.”
Since that withdrawal, the Soviet Union
Japanese helicopter during drill: Playing a greater role
YAMAGUCHI—GAMMA-LIAISON
Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia: Power politics
JEAN-CLAUDE LABBE—GAMMA-LIAISON
has gained the use of naval and air facilities
at former American bases in Vietnam. That
has enabled Moscow to extend its power to
the South China Sea. In Northeast Asia, the
Soviets have fortified the Kuril Islands,
which they seized from Japan at the end of
World War 11, and have installed MiG-21
and MiG-23 fighters there. Since 1977, 147
SS-20 missiles, each equipped with three
150-kiloton nuclear warheads, have also
been deployed in Soviet East Asia.
While the Russians have avoided direct
military confrontations in the area, they
have been willing, even eager, to wield their
newfound power as a political club. On a
trip through Southeast Asia last year, Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Kapitsa
warned that as long as ASEAN
supports anti-Vietnam forces in
Cambodia, Vietnam reserves the
right to support communist insur-
gencies in ASEAN. “We didn’t
like that one bit,” says a Foreign
Ministry official in Singapore.
“For the Soviets to come here and
say such things means we have to
take their words rather seriously.”
Vulnerability: In a somewhat
ironic twist, the Reagan adminis-
tration’s warnings of Soviet mili-
tary expansion may actually con-
tribute to East Asia’s feeling of
vulnerability. “If America finds it
difficult to handle the Soviets, I
doubt whether ASEAN can do
very much more,” says Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Moha-
mad. The result is an ASEAN that
shies away from the slightest men-
tion of developing collective secu-
rity ties and does its utmost to keep
a low profile. “We are at pains to
assure we do not form a military
alliance,” says Mahathir. “We do
not want to attract hostility from
other people.”
No wonder George Shultz
shows signs of exasperation. Some
of the same countries that were
critical of American policies in
Vietnam 15 years ago are now
urging the United States to beef up
its military presence in East Asia.
But American policy has also un-
dergone a similar twist. In order to
strengthen alliances that were
held together by fear of China dur-
ing the ’6os, the Reagan adminis-
tration is now attempting to per-
suade ASEAN’s leaders that
China is a far more benign force
than their own history and experi-
ence will allow them to accept.
Until the United States and its
Asian allies can meet halfway
on this sticky point, American
relations with both Southeast
Asia and China —not to mention
Washington’s efforts to mobilize
the region to address the basic So-
viet threat —are bound to suffer.


EUROPE
'The People Who Never Give Up'
American GI’s converging on a protester near Mutlangen: Will more radical demonstrators cause nasty trouble in the season ahead?
The peace movement is in disarray, but diehards are still at the barricades.
It was, above all, a sharply focused strug-
gle that drew hundreds of thousands of
Europeans into the streets for a single
purpose: to prevent the deployment of
American-made Pershing II and cruise mis-
siles. But after the first shipments of those
missiles were installed in Britain and West
Germany last autumn, the European peace
movement seemed to dissipate with amaz-
ing rapidity. Demonstrations, referendums
and court cases against the nuclear weapons
no longer seemed to excite the public; inter-
necine squabbles broke out among the lead-
ers of the major peace groups; the press
followed swiftly with obituaries of the anti-
nuclear campaign. But is the peace move-
ment really dead—or just dormant?
Without question, vast numbers of people
throughout Europe remain unhappy about
the arms race in general and the new Per-
shings and cruises in particular. Those peo-
ple may no longer be spilling out into the
streets, but many are redirecting their ener-
gies into party politics. If for no other reason
than that, American officials are not ready
to write off the antinuclear campaign alto-
gether. “The movement is in disarray,” says
one U.S. official in Washington, “but it
hasn’t lost much of its determination.”
As the protest leaders transform them-
selves to professional “peace politicians,”
however, they run the risk of boring their
colorful, volatile constituencies. A few of
the more stubborn activists still believe in
head-on confrontations with soldiers and
missiles. These people were once the shock
troops of the mass movement —but now
that the masses seem to be gone, the move-
ment is “down to its hard-core elements,”
said one U.S. official. “These are the people
who never give up.”
Diehards: The two most enduring out-
posts of the antimissile movement are the
ongoing demonstrations at the Greenham
Common Air Base in Britain and at the U.S.
airfield in Mutlangen, West Germany. Last
week, Newsweek’s Donna Foote went to
Greenham Common and Maks Westerman
visited Mutlangen. They described similar
scenes of diehards maintaining lonely vigils,
hoping to keep some symbolic resistance to
the missiles alive.
Day after day at Greenham Common,
soldiers and activists play a strange cat-and-
mouse game. In a typical scene one evening
last week, a line of green U.S. Army trucks
returned to the base after routine exer-
cises—and a small band of women scram-
bled to the road to try to bar their entry. A
few trucks whizzed past before the demon-
strators could block them; “You’re out of
luck, women,” a GI shouted. But the wom-
en managed to throw themselves in front of
one truck. When it stopped, they hurled
eggshells filled with a messy concoction of
paint and glue at it. The driver shifted into
reverse and roared away. The women
hugged, kissed and chanted a peace song.
“It’s another victory,” shouted Sarah Hip-
person, an ex-magistrate who has lived at
Greenham for 17 months. “They have their
games to play and we spoil them.”
For nearly three years now, the women of
Greenham Common have been tying up
traffic and making trouble for the American
soldiers. At the moment no more than 50 of
them live in little encampments near the
gates of the base. There were times when
there were hundreds: women of every age
and background camping together. Men

“TATTERSALLS CHOSE
PERKIN ELMER COMPUTERS BECAUSE
WE COULDN’T AFFORD TO GAMBLE:’
Gunther Rothleitner. Peputy General Manager-Qperatlons, Tattersalls.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how Australia's largest lottery,
Tattersalls, and Perkin-Elmer Computers work
together.
Consider a lottery with a weekly investment
of as much as $8,000,000 with the bulk of this
investment happening at lunchtime every Friday!
Suddenly, 1,250 transactions a minute are
taking place at Tattersalls agents in Victoria,
Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory
Not to worry.
Tattersal Is’ new computer system, based
around five Perkin-Elmer computers, can handle
up to 13,000 transactions a minute!
And it can handle all these transactions with
absolute security, because the system is fail-safe.
it has to be that way. Because if this computer
system was to go down, nearly a million people
would know about it instantly!
Tattersa I Is chose their new system after the
most careful study and analysis.
Reliability, performance and economy of
setting up were paramount.
And the more Tattersal is studied the figures
the more Perkin-Elmer’s numbers came out right.
Around the world, computer systems like
the one Tattersal Is has installed are increasingly
being based around Perkin-Elmer computers.
For a number of reasons.
As the company that pioneered the 32-bit
minicomputer, Perkin-Elmer is an acknowledged
information industry leader, with a reputation for
hardware reliability which is second to none.
And because all Perkin-Elmer eguipment is
upwardly compatible, conversion problems
when upgrading are eliminated.
But it wi 11 be some ti me before Tattersal Is
has to upgrade.
Because with 900 terminals on-line when
the system is completed at the end of ’B4, it will
still havea long way to go to reach its maximum
of 2,000 on-line terminals.
Naturally, with these Kinds of figures,
Tattersalls couldn't afford to gamble on their
computer system.

A West German peace march: The numbers are dwindling
AP
were always banned from living at Green-
ham; the protest leaders are ardent femi-
nists (a number of them lesbians) as much as
they are pacifists. The oddity of the little
community—and its fierce persistence—
have attracted international attention. “To
many people,” says Msgr. Bruce Kent,
leader of the Campaign for Nuclear Disar-
mament (CND) in Britain, “Greenham is
seen as a symbol of determination.”
A ‘Miracle 9 : At one time, many residents
of the surrounding district of Newbury
seemed to tolerate the permanent demon-
stration in their midst, but now the local
folks have soured on the camp. The protest-
ers still remain optimistic. They predict a
“miracle” in September; they have invited
10 million women from around the world to
visit Greenham at the time of the autumn
NATO exercises. They undoubtedly are ex-
pecting a bit too much. But it would be
wrong to dismiss the Greenham movement
out of hand. Just two months ago, 200,000
demonstrators paralyzed London to protest
Ronald Reagan’s visit. A great number of
those people were women, and pacifists,
and many of them might well decide to rally
again at the feminist camp.
A year ago, hundreds of demonstrators
descended on the tiny town of Mutlangen,
West Germany, to attend classes in the fine
art of “nonviolent resistance”—and to
mount a blockade of the nearby American
missile base. After their protest
failed to stop the delivery of
Pershing II missiles, some
demonstrators gave up and
went home. But a tiny band
stayed on. Like their sisters at
Greenham, the Mutlangen die-
hards set up a permanent
watch over the base. Their
numbers steadily diminished,
but during the past year the
activists did accomplish one
goal. There has never yet been a
day when there wasn’t at least
one person maintaining a
round-the-clock vigil at the
gate to the base.
Over time, the Mutlangen
demonstrators have learned to
be rather clever about disrupt-
ing military activities. Last
week, 10 demonstrators turned
a nighttime maneuver of the
Eighth Infantry Division into a
hopeless case of gridlock. Posi-
tioning themselves on a road
winding up Rosenstein moun-
tain some 10 miles from Mut-
langen, the protesters caused a
two-hour delay for a dozen
American military vehicles.
“You have no right to use Ger-
man roads to prepare for war,”
shouted one demonstrator. An
American MP took a different
view. Hissing “Don’t give me
that bullshit,” he refused to
stop his jeep, forcing the demonstrators to
jump to the side of the road. That was a
violation of military guidelines. The pro-
testers called it an “act of war.” And a five-
year-old boy—who has traveled to many a
demonstration with his activist mother—
burst into tears.
The Mutlangen campers have managed
to attract some support from nearby local
townspeople. The city council of Heilbronn
has gone so far as to declare the Pershings—
not the demonstrators —“undesirable” and
called for the missiles’ withdrawal. But
there are also citizens who dislike having a
permanent contingent of professional dem-
onstrators for neighbors. “There are still
plenty of people,” said Wilfried Schmidt,
one of the protesters, “who tell us that we
deserve to be shot or gassed.”
Boring: As in Britain, big demonstrations
in West Germany are scheduled to start up
again in the autumn. In late September,
peace-movement leaders are hoping to cre-
ate a “human net” connecting several mili-
tary installations in the state of Hesse. It
would take 110,000 protesters to close that
net, and many specialists doubt that the
movement can muster such numbers any
longer. Even the Mutlangen group believes
the time for mass demonstrations is over.
“Such protests have lost their novelty,” said
Rudiger Muller, one of the core group. “Be-
sides, they are boring... I’d feel rather silly
holding hands for hours on end.”
Muller and others are busy practicing
what they call the demonstration of the
future: “maneuver obstructing.” A group of
thousands of activists plans to disrupt large-
scale NATO exercises at the end of Septem-
ber. From five camps, they will fan out to
change and destroy military road signs, illu-
minate nightly camouflage positions, cut
communications cables and seal explosion
shafts with concrete. Those are not the
kinds of tactics that large numbers of West
Germans will approve of. But whether the
“institutionalized” disarmament advocates
in the opposition parties approve or not, the
frustrated remnants of last year’s demon-
strations seem to be turning more radical —
and they could cause some nasty trouble in
the name of the “peace movement” in the
season ahead.

V 6 power,
just part of the pleasure
of real grand touring.
Nissan 300ZX.
m
In the history of motoring, few cars, if any,
have captured the imagination quite as vividly as the
timeless Z-cars.
From its inception in 1969, this classic marque
has provided a unique blend of performance and
style, comfort and safety.
Now, Nissan proudly introduce the 300ZX.
Its styling is reassuringly familiar yet it is
sufficiently re-styled to reduce drag to a co-efficient
of a mere 0.31. But it’s beneath these sleek exterior
lines where the real advancements lie.
The most radical change is the introduction of
the brilliant new VG 30E V 6 engine. Of oversquare
design, the 60° bank angle and pentroof combustion
chambers combine to make this lightweight
powerhouse capable of producing a remarkable
balance of power (124 kW @ 5,200 rpm DIN) and
torque (241 Nm @ 3,600 rpm DIN). Yet, for all this
output, efficient economy can be realised thanks to
the introduction of Nissan’s highly advanced ECCS
(Electronic Concentrated Control System). With
silicon chip electronics the ECCS system monitors not
only fuel flow but temperature, mixture, spark and
other critical engine functions. Such sophisticated
technology takes 300ZX to the forefront of
automotive development.
On the inside, 300ZX belies its sports tradition
because, here, the number one priority is comfort -
comfort unimaginable in most performance cars
and unrivalled in most sedans.
In front of you spreads a truly comprehensive
array of analogue instruments: simple, easy to read,
unobtrusive.
Throughout the interior, from the plush velour
seats to the thick-pile carpet, the cockpit is warm,
opulent and extremely quiet. So quiet, in fact, that the
4-speaker AM/FM digital radio
cassette delivers virtuoso
performance at even the lowest
volumes.
Of course, air conditioning
is fully integrated. And, for open-roof traditionalists,
the T-bar roof panels can be simply and quickly lifted
out and stowed in the rear boot space.
The Nissan 300ZX is the epitome of the grand
touring car. Whether you prefer the 5-speed manual
or the new 4-speed automatic, you can be assured of
many years enjoyable motoring in a stylish, supremely
comfortable, high performance thoroughbred.

SOVIET UNION
The Leningrad Syndrome
For American tourists weary of the Sovi-
et Union’s bland food, bleak architec-
ture and bad manners, Leningrad still offers
a faded mix of Venetian design and Parisian
charm. But to be an American in Leningrad
these days is not what it used to be. Over the
past few months thugs have beaten up the
American vice consul, six plainclothes and
uniformed policemen have attacked a U.S.
Marine and Leningrad police have detained
a visiting scholar without letting him make
the usual call to the American Consulate.
Fed up with the way the Soviets have dis-
missed all protests over the incidents, the
State Department issued an unprecedented
travel advisory last week. Americans, it
warned, can no longer count on the authori-
ties in Leningrad to act as respectable hosts.
No one is sure what lies behind the Lenin-
grad syndrome. The KGB has always kept a
xenophobic eye on foreigners who meet So-
viet dissidents, and some Americans have
crossed that line. Diplomats in Moscow
point to the acerbic state of U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions. A recent Pravda article accused West-
ern military attaches of escalating their
espionage in Leningrad. The city bosses,
following the hard line of their former party
leader, Grigory Romanov, seem to be re-
sponding with extra zeal. “There is really
anti-American fanaticism here now,” said a
Western diplomat in Moscow. “It’s possible
that the Leningraders have overreacted. ”
The latest flare-up was the
beating of Marine Sgt. Ronald
Campbell, 22—the third as-
sault on an American in four
months. According to his ac-
count, after finishing guard
duty at the U.S. Consulate one
night early this month, he
had two mixed drinks and went
for a walk. At about 3 a.m.,
two cars —one a police vehi-
cle—pulled up. Three uni-
formed policemen and three
plainclothesmen burst out and
began to pummel him. Then
they trundled him olf to a local
jail and held him for two hours.
The government daily Izvestia later charged
that Campbell had been drunk and that he
had tried to stop passing cars, “throwing
rocks at them and shouting abuse. ” The U. S.
Embassy said the Soviet story was “not
accurate, accordingto our information.”
Ambudi: For Ronald Harms, the 3 5-year-
old U.S. vice consul in Leningrad, who
picked up Campbell at the police station, the
incident was an unpleasant replay. Last
April, as Harms emerged from a cafe where
he had lunched with a Soviet dissident, a
group of Russians came up, punched him
several times and knocked him down. In
June an unknown assailant ambushed An-
drew Espinosa, an exchange student who
Espinosa: A victim
COURTESY ANDREW ESPINOSA
had met with refuseniks, and
knocked him out —leaving him
with a concussion.
Other Americans in Lenin-
grad have had to run a gantlet of
Soviet hassles. Late last month
local police detained an Ameri-
can professor who had been on
his way to meet a Soviet scholar.
The police held him for two
hours and informed him that,
under a new Soviet law, they did
not have to grant foreigners ac-
cess to consular officials unless
they were being deported.
Exasperation: In response to
U.S. protests, Moscow has de-
nied that it has done anything
wrong. The exasperated State
Department, citing “approxi-
mately a dozen cases of flagrant
harassment” in recent months,
accused the Kremlin of flout-
ing the consular agreement be-
tween the two countries. Last week’s travel
warning marked the first time the United
States has cautioned its citizens that they
may face official mistreatment in the Soviet
Union. Izvestia complained that Washing-
ton’s warning was designed to “scare Ameri-
cans away from traveling to the U.S.S.R.”
Despite the advisory, U.S. Embassy person-
nel are still traveling to Leningrad on official
business, and tour groups are trekking
through the Hermitage, the Admiralty and
the Peter and Paul Fortress. But if the mug-
gery doesn’t stop, the city that Peter the
Great built as a window to the West is going
to look like a rather nasty tourist trap.
STEVEN SH ABAD with DEBBIE SEWARD in Moscow
Moscow’s Fighting Flattop
The spy pictures were grainy and dim. But a computer
enhanced them, and when they turned up in Jane’s Defence
Weekly last week, they put Moscow’s challenge to American
naval supremacy on a new keel. There in dry dock, a new Soviet
aircraft carrier lay like a
dissected whale, its par-
tially completed stem and
stern resting side by side.
The photos were taken by
a military satellite fly-
ing over the Nikolayev
444 shipyard on the Black
Sea. Jane’s didn’t say how
it had gotten them. But
the pictures showed that
when the 75,000-ton flat-
top Kremlin is launched,
it will be the longest
fighting ship in the world,
measuring 1,105 feet. It
will be capable of carry-
ing 75 aircraft, including
MiG-23 Flogger fighters,

AP
counter-air fighters and advanced early-warning electronic-
surveillance aircraft.
The Soviets appear intent on building from four to eight of the
Kremlin-class carriers—reflecting a radical new tack in Soviet
naval strategy. The Russians have traditionally shied away from
a fleet centered around supercarriers because the large ships
are expensive, vulnerable and difficult to deploy through
the strategic bottlenecks
between Soviet ports and
the open seas. But con-
flicts dating back to the
Korean and Vietnam wars
have shown the power of
carrier-based aircraft to
project military strength
in regional hot spots far
from home. The new Sovi-
et flattops may eventually
be able to challenge the
U.S. Navy’s carrier battle
groups. Admiral of the
Fleet Sergei Gorshkov,
commander of the Soviet
Navy, has speeded up
work on the Kremlin. It
should be ready for sea
trials in 1988.

IVOR Introduces
some high profit lines
The quicker retailers operate
scanning equipment, the quicker their
profits rise.
Because put simply, NCR scanning
equipment linked to RO.S. terminals
avoids human error, which can account
for substantial loss of profit in supermarket
chains today.
And the customers like it because
scanning is fast, the queues are shorter
and move more quickly they know there
are no mistakes, and they can instantly
check the price that’s brightly displayed.
More than that, they also get an
itemised print-out of their purchases and
the prices.
You can gain all these benefits now,
plus many others with or without an in-
store computer; and when you talk to us
you’ll realise that NCR scanning equip-
ment leads the world not only because
it’s the best, but also because
it’s surprisingly inexpensive.
More than that, NCR also
provides data processing centres and

A Great August Tax Debate
Fritz in Philadelphia: The challenger pressed his issue—but does talk of higher taxes lead to the Election Day graveyard?
Mondale’s charges disrupt Reagan’s vacation —but the campaign has just begun.
Ronald Reagan was supposed to have a
quiet August sabbatical on the ranch
before the bustle of his second nomination
and the political battles of September. In-
stead, the president found himself sparring
with reporters last week —and taking to the
defensive just days before the Republican
Convention. His main problem was Walter
Mondale, whose complaints about Reagan’s
“secret plan” to raise taxes were carrying
more clout than Republican strategists had
ever imagined. Reagan’s own political trus-
tees seemed afflicted with the August dol-
drums —setting the stage for some careless
campaign talk that left one senior Reagan
adviser admitting that “we’re paying the
price for being pretty disorganized.” Said
another: “I’m glad this isn’t October.”
Reagan himself tried to close the first
debate of Campaign ’B4 once and for all.
“Walter Mondale is not telling the truth,”
the president told reporters testily. “I’ve said
it before, and I will say it again and no matter
how many of you try to put in a hedging line,
we have no plans for nor will I allow any
plans for a tax increase. Period.” But about
two hours later, after a lunch with his boss,
Vice President George Bush went off the
ranch on the tax issue. Prodded by questions
on the apparent need for revenue increases to
staunch the deficit, Bush said, “I would
think that any president would keep his
options open.” Is Reagan keeping his tax
options open? “Sure, I’d say so,” Bush re-
plied. Economists—and even some Repub-
lican moderates —credited Bush with a vic-
tory for candor at the expense of political
On the ranch: No secret plan — ‘period’

prudence. But Reagan’s political strategists
were furious at the vice president’s free-
lance politics.
The Reagan camp moved quickly to close
ranks behind the president’s no-tax pledge.
Testifying on Capitol Hill, Treasury Secre-
tary Donald Regan reiterated about a half-
dozen times, “There are no plans for tax
increases in 1985 by this administration.”
Regan upped the ante in a television inter-
view the next morning: ruling out tax in-
creases all through a Reagan second term.
When the questions persisted, the treasury
secretary joked, “Would you like to try for
the year 2000?”
Despite Regan’s jocular tone, the admin-
istration was clearly trading postelection
flexibility for short-run tactical advantage.
Both in 1982 and this year, Reagan has
agreed to compromise tax-increase pack-
ages—the so-called revenue, enhancers.
Now some GOP legislators worry that the
president may find himself in an untenable
position. Senate Finance Committee chair-
man Robert Dole complains that the presi-
dent “has to leave a little window” open for
the possibility of a tax increase if Congress


balks at his plans to cut spending. On Wall
Street, bond markets sensitive to interest
rates might also grow alarmed over the vehe-
mence of Reagan’s ax-the-tax rhetoric.
But politically the president’s advisers
still believe they have the upper hand. “It’s
great to say that the responsible thing to do is
raise taxes,” said a senior Reagan adviser,
“but that’s a political graveyard. The candi-
dates who have pledged to raise taxes in
recent years have all lost their asses.” The
administration will also soon be arguing that
the deficit dilemma is not as dire as Mondale
claims. In its midyear economic forecast,
scheduled for release this week, Reagan’s
forecasters project the 1989 deficit at about
Keeping the pressure on: ‘What are you going to cut? When are you going to cut it?’
MARLETTE— CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
$163 billion. That’s almost exactly $lOO
billion less than the deficit predicted by the
Congressional Budget Office. The differ-
ence is largely due to far more optimistic
administration predictions of economic
growth and the decline in interest rates.
Economic forecasts five years in advance
tend to be about as accurate as divining rods,
but these vastly differing numbers will pro-
vide more grist for the tax debate.
Sly Grin: Even before the administration’s
forecast leaked out, Mondale was lambast-
ing Reagan’s economic assumptions. With a
sly grin, Mondale asked union members in
Philadelphia, “You’ve heard the story of
Pinocchio? You know why his nose kept
getting longer all the time? Let’s see if [the
Reagan forecast] is an honest, solid reflec-
tion of the facts or what you might call a
Pinocchio projection of the future.” It was
all part of a performance designed to keep
pressure on Reagan. Speaking to cheering
farmers in Asheville, N.C., Mondale taunt-
ed the president, “What are you going to cut?
When are you going to cut it? And when are
you going to raise taxes?” In perhaps his best
line of the week, Mondale proposed a “sev-
enth debate” —between Reagan and Bush,
“to see who’s telling the truth about taxes. ”
Mondale and his top advisers were gleeful
over how quickly they were dictating the
political agenda for a popular incumbent
president. The Republicans are “painting
themselves into a corner—furiously,” said
senior strategist Richard Leone. To the
Mondale camp, the tax issue has become a
test of the credibility of both candidates. So
far the Mondale truth-about-taxes gambit
seems to be working, but the real risks are
still ahead. How will voters react later in the
campaign when they learn exactly how
much a Democratic administration is apt to
cost them? The answer may not be long in
coming: Mondale is close to a final decision
on the shape of his revised tax and budget
proposals. The president is already bran-
dishing scare figures that the Mondale plan
will cost the average taxpayer 51,500.
“There’s no way it doesn’t come right out
of the hide of the middle-class worker,”
claimed one Reagan aide. “Once we get that
message across, his fun and games are over.”
But during his three-day foray last week
into Ohio, Pennsylvania, Alabama and the
Carolinas, Mondale displayed an exuber-
ance that was so often lacking during the
debilitating primary campaign. The trip was
part of a monthlong plan for test-marketing
Fritz. The Mondale high command calcu-
lates that, at best, the Democratic ticket can
count on winning 160 electoral votes in the
industrial states of the Northeast and Mid-
west —leaving them more than 100 electoral
votes short of a majority. For the next few
weeks, Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro will
crisscross the country searching for the
missing pieces on their victory map. In their
wake, campaign polltaker Peter Hart will
conduct exhaustive surveys to measure their
impact and shape their travel schedules for
the fall campaign.
Ferraro spent the week in Washing-
ton taking advantage of a new forum
for vice presidential candidates —
televised debates on the House floor.
But there were signs that the Ferraro
honeymoon may soon be over. Re-
publicans grew increasingly bold in
attacking Ferraro’s liberal voting re-
cord and her questionable use of a
loophole on congressional disclosure
forms to shield her husband’s business
interests from public scrutiny. Fer-
raro has promised to reveal all the
family’s finances next week, but
House Republicans may still try to
prompt an investigation by the ethics
committee. GOP members of a House
subcommittee even voted against al-
lowing Ferraro to use the franking
privilege to answer the thousands of
letters she’s received from well-wish-
ers. Meanwhile, her campaign was a
profile in chaos. The candidate’s
schedule changed almost hourly.
Once known for her accessibility, Fer-
raro now avoids impromptu conver-
sations with the press.
Reagan polls show that the intense
interest in Ferraro’s candidacy has
not yet solidified into firm support.
These same surveys demonstrate that
the San Francisco convention is fad-
ing into memory and that Reagan
once again leads Mondale by 10 to 12
percentage points. The information
is, of course, self-serving, as is the Reaganite
claim that most voters were too busy watch-
ing the Olympics to notice last week’s tax
controversy. In just a week, Reagan himself
will go for the gold with a prime-time ac-
ceptance speech. The latest draft argues
that the prophets of gloom said his 1981 tax

Questions for ‘Senator Clean '
Mark O. Hatfield has long been regard-
ed as theU.S. Senate’s Mr. Clean —an
officeholder who adheres to the highest
principles in his work and private life. But
last week, early in his apparently routine re-
election campaign, the Oregon Republican
found himself the subject of tough newspa-
per stories and a preliminary Justice Depart-
ment investigation. At issue: some $40,000
paid to his wife, Antoinette, a Washington
real-estate agent, by a shadowy Greek
businessman.
The entrepreneur, Hatfield’s friend Basil
Tsakos, paid Antoinette in installments dur-
ing 1982 and 1983 —at the same time the
senator was promoting a multibillion-dollar
trans-African pipeline proposed by a Tsa-
kos-led consortium. Hatfield argued that
the pipeline, which would extend from Saudi
Arabia across Africa to Cameroon
and the Atlantic Ocean, would enable
the Saudis to export oil to the West
without shipping it through the in-
creasingly vulnerable Persian Gulf.
Hatfield gave a dinner in the Senate
dining room at which Tsakos was in-
troduced to Energy Secretary Donald
P. Hodel. And Hatfield praised the
project to Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
Right-of-way: Hatfield, the chair-
man of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, also wrote to Tsakos on
committee stationery endorsing the
pipeline for its “profound and poten-
tially beneficial impacts on this coun-
try’s energy and foreign policies.”
Sources who have worked with Tsa-
kos say such letters were valuable to
the entrepreneur, who flashed them as
evidence of high-level interest in his
projects. The same month Hatfield
wrote the letter, Tsakos gave Antoi-
nette her final payment of $lO,OOO.
Hatfield also conveyed his support to
Sudan’s President Jaafar Nimeiry,
who reached a right-of-way agree-
ment with Tsakos’s firm last month.
Hatfield insists that the $40,000 was
related to his wife’s “independent” real-
estate business. “There was not, is not and
never will be any connection between her
real-estate dealings and my senatorial re-
sponsibilities, including my support for a
trans-African pipeline,” hesaid. Tsakos also
denies any connection. Initially, Hatfield
told reporters that his wife had been paid for
helping to find and renovate a two-bedroom
apartment in the Watergate complex that
Tsakos bought for $520,000 in November
1981. However, David Yerkes, whose apart-
ment Tsakos purchased, told The New York
Times that Antoinette Hatfield had no in-
volvement in the sale. In fact, the payments
to Mrs. Hatfield didn’t begin until mid-
-1982. In an interview with The Washington
Post, Hatfield offered new details. He said
his wife had been paid $15,000 for showing
Tsakos a number of apartments, $ 15,000 for
providing Tsakos’s wife with decorating ad-
vice and $lO,OOO for counseling the busi-
nessman on investment properties.
Hatfield listed the payments on his Sen-
ate financial-disclosure statement. Still, the
Senate Ethics Committee, which, accord-
ing to Hatfield, only last month found “that
there were no facts to suggest any improper
conduct or improper payments,” is now
“reviewing” the matter. According to
Newsweek sources, former Tsakos asso-
ciates have disputed Hatfield’s version of the
payments in interviews with committee in-
vestigators. Washington attorney Carl Shi-
pley, who resigned as president of the pipe-
line company, said that he warned Hatfield
last year against involvement with Tsakos.
Specifically, Shipley told the senator that “I
The Hatfields: A deal with a shadowy Greek?
NALTCHAYAN— THE WASHINGTON POST
was getting out,” he said, adding: “I just
didn’t like the way things were shaping up.”
A number of former government officials
associated with the Tsakos project also with-
drew their support. Hatfield has acknowl-
edged that he confronted Tsakos with alle-
gations of his shady dealings, but said that
the businessman denied them.
The bad publicity comes as Hatfield is
running for a fourth term against state Sen.
Margie Hendriksen. But already the con-
flict-of-interest question has emerged as a
potent issue. “It is unfortunate that Senator
Hatfield does not seem to see there is an issue
of impropriety here,” Hendriksen said. Hat-
field didn’t need to be reminded that propri-
ety counts in politics; old lessons were espe-
cially vivid last week —on the 10th
anniversary of Richard Nixon’s resignation.

WORLD BUSINESS
A Debacle in World Trade
U.S. goods ready for export: Trying to stimulate business overseas
BLACK STAR
GE and Sears cut their losses from trying to imitate Japan’s trading firms.
They came on the scene in the typical
American fashion: bold and boastful.
And there seemed little reason why they
shouldn’t succeed. But today, just two
years after Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Gen-
eral Electric set up trading companies that
they said would help invigorate U.S. ex-
ports, the talk is of cutting the losses. Two
weeks ago, Newsweek learned, the presi-
dent of the General Electric Trading Co.
(GETC) sent a memo to his employees
telling them that the subsidiary was under-
going “restructuring” and that it would
move “away from its export thrust.” Two
days later, 150 employees—one-tenth of
the work force—were laid off at Sears
World Trade, and the parent company
seemingly has abandoned most of its gran-
diose plan.
The failure of these two ventures to come
even close to their expectations quashes one
of America’s most ambitious, and costly,
efforts to stimulate exports. In 1982, when
U.S. interest in Japanese business practices
was at a peak, some Americans figured that
trading companies modeled on the mighty
Japanese traders, the sogo shosha, could
help small and medium-size manufacturers
sell their goods abroad. Congress took up
legislation to remove some restrictions on
such U.S. ventures. And within weeks of
each other, Sears and GE announced plans
to invest millions of dollars in their own full-
scale trading companies.
The n'eed for such an effort was never
greater. The value of American exports
peakedbackin 1981 at s224billion, and then
fell by more than 10 percent over the next
two years (chart) as the dollar soared to
record levels, making U.S. goods more ex-
pensive. And although the trend is now back
on the upswing, exports are not expected to
reach 1981 levels again until at least next
year. All the while, imports have kept on
pouring in, resulting in a U.S. trade deficit
that has fallen through the floor. After six
years of steady deficits in the $4O billion
range, the deficit grew to nearly s7obillion in
1983andthis year could top $ 120 billion.
Dollar Problems: Despite the
need, the Americans couldn’t
have started their trading-com-
pany experiment at a worse
time. The industrialized world
was deep in its most severe re-
cession since the’3os. The glob-
al debt crisis forced many devel-
oping nations to slash imports
to conserve the hard currency
needed to service foreign loans.
But without question, the big-
gest factor working against
U.S. exporters has been the
strength of the dollar. Three
years of steep rises against al-
most every other currency have
priced many American goods
out of the market.
Stathakis: Failure
BERNARD GOTFRYD— NEWSWEEK
U.S. exports are held back by
more than simple economics, how-
ever. If there is such a thing as an
exporting mentality, few Americans have
it. The size of the U.S. market offers ample
opportunity for growth without having to
look abroad. And because doing business
overseas involves added costs and risks,
says Stephen Blank of Multinational Strat-
egies, a New York-based research and
consulting firm, Americans have tradition-
ally demanded higher returns from their
foreign operations. “We become risk-
avoiders in regard to doing business over-
seas,” says Blank.
Nowhere was that more true
than at Sears World Trade. The
company had set out to create a
trading organization that of-
fered a full range of services.
The company also planned to
otfer consulting and financing
help to its clients. Rather than
build such a company from
scratch, Sears World Trade ac-
quired several companies and
entered into joint ventures with
others. The parent company’s
executives were told to expect
up to $6O million in losses in the
first three years, but the top
brass quickly lost their resolve.

more surprising. The company, America’s
fourth largest exporter with $3.6 billion in
foreign sales last year, seemed well placed
to expand its international business by pig-
gybacking non-GE products onto its ex-
port network. GETC president George
Stathakis predicted two years ago that by
1987 his company would have annual rev-
enues of $2 billion, with up to 75 percent of
that coming from sales of non-GE goods.
But when GETC dropped its commitment
to the export business at the end of last
month, the company had yet to sign up a
single outside client.
High Tech: Despite the poor showing of
the two most ambitious trading companies,
American firms continue to enter the fray.
Honeywell Inc., a manufacturer of comput-
ers and electronics, established Honeywell
High-Tech Trading Inc. at the start of the
year to specialize in the overseas marketing
of its high-technology products and those of
noncompeting companies. So far the com-
pany has signed up eight clients.
After the miscalculations at Sears and
GE, it is unlikely that anyone will soon try
to operate on their scale. For now, the
strength of the dollar and continued eco-
nomic sluggishness would make such a full-
blown effort foolhardy. Sooner or later,
those economic realities will change. But
unless U.S. exporters begin to work harder
for foreign markets, there will be little need
for an American version of the sogo shosha.

Zapping the Mailman
Pony Express, meet Luke Skywalker. Known variously as
Easy Link, Quik-Comm or Zap Mail, electronic mail service is
speeding its way into the $8 billion “time-sensitive mail” mar-
ket —perhaps forever altering America’s vision of the mailbox.
The technology for sending computer-to-computer messages
through telephone wires has been around for years, but until
recently it was employed almost exclusively by large corpora-
tions. But as more people work in professions requiring instant
information and as more homes and offices acquire desk-top
computers, mailboxes will increasingly be replaced by computer
terminals. Some 440,000 clients, sending 50 million messages a
year, now use some form of electronic mail service; by the end of
the decade, according to a study by the Yankee Group, Ameri-
cans will be zapping 1 billion messages to each other each year.
The growth of this market is yielding some unlikely competi-
tors. Companies as diverse as ITT, General Electric and
COAST TO COAST IN MINUTES
Telecommunications companies and courier services may soon replace the friendly
neighborhood postman as they start offering electronic mail services. Text and graphics
can be sent quickly from coast to coast via telephone lines and satellites.
CHRISTOPH BLUMRICH— NWESWEEK
GTE are being joined by MCI and Federal Express, which are
zeroing in on the consumer market:
■ Federal Express plans to spend $1.2 billion over the next 10
years to perfect and expand its Zap Mail service. Now available
only in major cities such as New York, Washington and San
Francisco, Zap Mail will broaden its network to 41 cities this
month; in September, Federal Express will launch a national
advertising blitz and open service in cities all over the United
States. For $35 per five-page document, a company courier will
pick up the message, take it to a base station for transmittal via
facsimile machine over long-distance telephone lines and hand-
delivery to its destination in two hours or less. Neither the sender
nor the recipient needs a computer to use the service. The
company also plans to launch two space satellites in early 198 Bto
make its electronic mail service more efficient and competitive
over the long term. Despite start-up costs of $lOO million,
analysts predict Zap Mail will turn a profit by the end of 1985.
■ General Electric Information Services has announced plans to
invest $2OO million this year to expand its global network,
including improvements in Quik-Comm, its electronic mail
service. The service is now used by more than 500 major compa-
nies, most spending between $75 and $l2O per month for usage.
■ Western Union will invest $ 115 million this year in Easy Link.
The service, which has enlisted 65,000 subscribers, transmits
more than 2 million messages a month through telephone lines
either to a receiver computer or to a Western Union office.
■ MCI invested $4O million last fall in MCI Mail, which enables
consumers with personal computers, telex machines, word
processors or electronic typewriters equipped with a modem (a
telecommunications device) to send messages to anyone in the
country who owns similar equipment. The service is cheap:
there is no subscription fee and customers pay only a dollar to
send five double-spaced pages. And it’s fast, taking seconds for
a message to reach the recipient, no matter where he’s located.
But MCI Mail can only send text (Zap Mail, using facsimile
machines, can also send graphics) and leaves computer-shy
senders out in the cold.
To broaden the appeal
of MCI Mail, the com-
pany established “post-
al centers” in 17 cit-
ies around the country
which serve as distribu-
tion centers for electron-
ic messages that are re-
printed on paper for
delivery. And since 65
percent of the nation’s
first-class mail is com-
posed of bills being sent
or paid, MCI plans to
start an electronic bill-
ing and payment service
for subscribers next year
that, predicts MCI, will
be cheaper than using the U.S. Postal Service.
As long as electronic messages are sent computer-to-comput-
er, MCI Mail’s price and efficiency will undoubtedly keep it the
electronic mail service of preference for individual consumers.
But Federal Express has busted open the market by offering
door-to-door, rather than terminal-originated, service; and ana-
lysts suggest that the company may not have any real competi-
tors in that market for at least two or three years.
All this zapping leaves the Postal Service dizzy. The service
made its own foray into the electronic-mail market in 1982 with
a service called ECOM. But it botched the marketing and design
of the system so badly that the service’s board of governors
ordered that the venture be turned over to the private sector. In
time, the friendly neighborhood mailman may find himself
going the way of the pony express.

What should you
expect from a
working partnership
with Hewlett-Packard?
"To keep up with
the costs of running
a packaging business
these days, you have to
keep up with technology.
At Visy Board we have
established a national
network of Hewlett-
Packard personal and
business computers to
help us manage more
efficiently."
Kevin Bamford, General Manager,
Visy Board
Visy Board's integrated system
of HP3OOO computers throughout
Australia provides uniform
financial reporting information for
their 13 autonomous plants. Their
many HP personal computers
provide both local processing and
interfacing to the central computers
for costing orders, estimating
and quoting.
Four HP3ooo's allow Visy
Board to analyse sales, market by
market, and study segment usage.
There is a complete run down of
the history on customer accounts
’'ffffHjj lljlll I
and an analysis of the cost of
each job.
With Hewlett-Packard
systems, outstanding debtors
have been reduced because of
the speed at which customers
can now be invoiced. Hewlett-
Packard computers allow direct
invoicing at the time of delivery,
hence shaving down the time
factor between delivery and
payment. Computerised
machine scheduling has led to
significant reductions in wastage
of raw materials and stock-
holding of paper.
It's been easy for Visy Board
to develop this and other
programs in-house, as they are
constantly kept in touch with the
latest program developments
from Hewlett-Packard.
Increased productivity hasn't
been confined to computer
programming. On the factory
floor each shift can now provide
up to date information on order
progress through the factory.
Computerised shop floor control
systems are now becoming an
integrated part of the manu-
facturing network. These advances
lead to increased productivity,
customer service and direct control
of the manufacturing process.
And when it came to the
America's Cup Visy Board backed
its confidence in Hewlett-Packard
by equipping its challenger with
Hewlett-Packard personal
computers from Damar
Management Systems, Geelong.

Techniques to Help Bones Heal Faster
Broken bones are painful and debilitating and can take a long
time to heal. To stimulate the mending process for hard-to-
heal bones, such as the tibia (the larger of the two bones in the
lower leg) and the small scaphoid in the hand, several compa-
nies are producing electrical devices that help induce the
calcifying, or hardening, necessary for bones to mend. The
firms say the results are so promising that the devices eventually
may be used on less troublesome fractures, too. Doctors have
known for more than a century that stimulation from electrical
impulses or vibrations could promote healing, but only recently
has much serious attention been paid to developing products
that take advantage of the phenomenon.
Physio-Stim, manufactured by American Medical Electron-
ics, Inc., of Dallas, Texas, is a “non-
invasive” device, meaning it is
placed around the limb instead of
being implanted under the skin. The
portable device consists of two units,
a transducer that fits over the
injured area and a rechargeable bat-
tery pack that hangs from the shoul-
der. The transducer emits low-level
electromagnetic pulses that cannot
be felt by the patient.
The transducers come in sizes
that will fit everything from a slen-
der wrist to a wide calf, and they can
be placed over a cast or directly on
the skin. The patient wears the de-
vice day or night for about eight
hours a day, for four to six months.
The unit has a digital display that
shows patients how long they have
worn the device that day and when
the battery is weakening. When pre-
Physio-Stim: Mending fractures electrically
scribed by a physician, the Physio-Stim is rented for a one-time
fee of $2,600, regardless of how long it is used. It is available now
in Canada and soon will be in Europe, and awaits full approval
in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. The
company plans eventually to make a single-unit model.
Another company, BGS Medical Corp. of Englewood,
Colo., is producing an “invasive,” or implanted, device that
makes direct contact with the injured bone. Use of the Osteo-
Stim 2000 requires two operations, one to implant the unit and
one to remove it several months later. It consists of a small
electrode connected to a lithium-iodine battery. The electrode
is inserted into the bone and steadily gives off a minute electrical
current. Once the bone is finally healed, the battery is removed,
but the electrode remains imbedded
in the bone.
Doctors experimenting with the
OsteoStim also are using it to help
heal ligaments and tendons, particu-
larly the Achilles’ tendon, and to
help speed difficult fusions of the
spine. The device’s $1,495 price is
added to the cost of surgery. And
because the OsteoStim must be sur-
gically implanted, there is a small
risk of infection. BGS Medical
Corp., a subsidiary of the Australian
medical-products company Nucle-
us Ltd., also produces a noninvasive
device, its model 3000, which is simi-
lar to the Physio-Stim. Both prod-
ucts are being sold in parts of West-
ern Europe, Asia and in Canada, and
the model 2000 has received the full
approval from the FDA to be mar-
keted in the United States.
Spray Without Chemicals
Since the environmental hazards of
fluorocarbon-propelled aerosols came to
light in the late 19705, inventors have
cast about for substitutes. Many manu-
facturers switched to hydrocarbon-pro-
pelled sprays, which don’t harm the
environment but are highly flammable.
Others turned to mechanical pumps,
such as trigger sprays, but these require a
good deal of effort to use and often per-
form poorly as the level of liquid falls in
the container. Recently, two companies,
one Dutch, one American, have come up
with nonchemical sprayers that are effi-
cient and safe.
Airspray International 8.V., of the
Netherlands, has begun marketing spray
cans based on a cap-and-valve system
that functions much like a bicycle pump.
The cap is fitted with a cylindrical plung-
er that is pumped up and down several
times inside a small plastic chamber. The
action builds air pressure inside the can,
which provides the propelling force. The
pressure—and contents —are released
by depressing a conventional pushbut-
ton on top of the can.
The Twist-N-Mist, an
aerosol spray developed
by CIDCO Group, Inc.
of Aurora, Colo., is a de-
vice that functions much
as a syringe does. A
quarter turn of its twist
top draws the liquid in-
side the can into a rub-
ber bladder. Another
quarter turn in the op-
posite direction builds
air pressure around the
bladder. When a but-
ton on top of the can
is pushed, the pressure
forces the liquid out.
Airspray cans: No danger
Because neither product uses chemi-
cals, both could be used on refillable or
disposable containers. Airspray Interna-
tional is manufacturing its spray can at
plants in several European countries.
Products using the de-
vice are already on the
shelves in Western Eu-
rope. The Dutch firm
plans to begin full-scale
marketing in the United
States by September.
CIDCO is franchising
the molds for its sprayer,
and its first products
should go on the market
in the United States late
this year. Both products
are comparable in cost
with traditional aerosol
spray mechanisms.

THE BULLETIN
NEIGHBORHOOD
A sleight-of-hand answer to
the Pacific nuclear conundrum
Test firing of a missile at the US Army’s Kwajalein missile range will not be affected by the nuclear-free-zone proposals
Proposals for a nuclear-free zone in the south-west Pacific are likely to emerge
from the coming meeting of the South Pacific Forum. STUART INDER explains
how it will allow passage of US nuclear warships.
PRIME MINISTER David Lange’s as-
sertion that New Zealand will stand
firm on its policy of banning nuclear
ships from using its ports will make it
virtually inevitable that the South Pa-
cific will be declared a nuclear-free
zone.
But nuclear ships would not be
banned from crossing the zone or from
calling at South Pacific ports.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke can now
expect to emerge from this year’s meet-
ing of the South Pacific Forum, opening
in Tuvalu on August 27, with a commit-
ment in principle to a form of nuclear-
free zone and the setting up of a work-
ing committee from the member states
to go over details for further action.
Lange’s assurance was made last
week in Port Moresby, where he was at-
tending the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Regional Meeting. Its
effect will be to bring the nuclear issue
into focus and enable Australia’s nu-
clear-free zone proposals, which do not
include banning of nuclear warships, to
be seen by the South Pacific states as
politically attainable.
Any ban on nuclear warships using
South Pacific ports can now be recog-
nised as a separate ANZUS issue and
not one that in itself is likely to prevent
establishment of the South Pacific as a
nuclear-free zone.
The distinction is crucial. Because
that wasn’t fully appreciated 10 years
ago, the first serious bid to establish a
nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific
failed. What happened then illuminates
the reason for the current swift develop-
ments towards the zone. The failed bid
began at the start of 1975, when Bill
(now Sir Wallace) Rowling’s New Zea-
land Labor Government announced
that it would press for such a zone.
It was on Rowling’s initiative that
New Zealand won support for it that
year from the South Pacific Forum.
From the forum he took it into the
United Nations, co-sponsored by Fiji,
and the United Nations General As-
sembly passed a revolution on it that
December which invited the Pacific
states to pursue the matter with United
Nations assistance.
But that was the fateful December
when both the Rowling and Whitlam
governments lost office. The new con-
servative leaders, Muldoon and Fraser,
moved to stop any further development.
It was shelved by the forum, and it
did not surface there again until last
year when it was reintroduced by the
Hawke Government in a different form.
What was not known in 1975 was the
degree to which Rowling and Whitlam
failed to see eye-to-eye on the proposal.
Whitlam declined Rowling’s invitation
for Australia to co-sponsor the resol


ution in the United Nations, or even ac-
tively lobby for it.
He told Rowling that the plan would
disadvantage US strategic interests and
security in the South Pacific and “pose
problems for ANZUS.” The US was bit-
terly opposed to the zone.
According to Greg Fry, post-doc-
toral fellow at the Strategic and Defence
Studies Centre at the Australian
National University, Canberra, who has
made a careful study of the nuclear-free
zone Pacific concept, the New Zealand
plan failed because it was open-ended,
it did not clearly spell out what was be-
ing opposed and thus it aroused sus-
picion.
The US was particularly fearful
about the possibilities of it banning the
transit of US warships and aircraft
through the Pacific, both north and
south of the equator.
Says Fry, “America’s strong opposi-
tion sealed its fate ... and Australia’s
lack of support in 1975 was a primary
obstacle to the development of the con-
cept.”
So it was a complete turnaround
when at the forum meeting in Canberra
US missile-tracking equipment in the Marshalls
last August, Australia introduced the
concept and New Zealand failed to be
supportive. Muldoon said he didn’t
think it would get very far.
But the forum agreed that Australia
should be allowed to follow through by
supplying more detailed information on
the plan over the next 12 months.
Bill Hayden’s Foreign Affairs De-
partment has made good use of its op-
portunities these past 12 months and the
islands well understand the thinking be-
hind Australia’s plan and are thus ready
for the next step at the Tuvalu meeting.
The advent of the New Zealand Labor
Government has been a very timely
bonus for Australia, focusing attention
on the issues at just the right time.
The difficulty is in getting a defini-
tion of just what “nuclear free” means
and in fixing boundaries.
Australia has had the advantage of
studying the scope and success of the
Latin-American nuclear weapons-free
zone, which provides the only precedent
for a nuclear weapons-free zone in a
populated area, Fry says.
Under the Treaty of Tlatelolco,
signed in 1967 by nearly ail Central and
South American states, the signatories
undertake to “prohibit and prevent in
their respective territories” the testing,
use, manufacture, production, acquisi-
tion, storage, installation, deployment
and any form of possession of any nu-
clear weapons.
But the treaty does not seek to pro-
hibit transit of nuclear weapons through
the zone, including port calls of nuclear
armed ships. Weapons-related facilities
such as communications surveillance
are not affected.
It is in fact moderate, and it is what
Australia has proposed to the South Pa-
cific, with the addition of a convention
banning dumping and storage of nu-
clear wastes in the region. The region is
described as being the south-west Pa-
cific, which cannot refer to American
territories north of the equator.
The forum members who will debate
this concept in Tuvalu are either
on or south of the equator. Be-
sides Australia and New Zea-
land, they are Papua New
Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu, Nauru, Kiribati,
Tuvalu, Tonga, Western Samoa,
Niue and the Cook Islands.
In none of these countries, in-
cluding Australia, are there any
weapons installations or nuclear
storage, or dumps, or deploy-
ment. For the purposes of such a
treaty, the South Pacific is al-
ready nuclear free, with one no-
table exception.
The aim of the plan is not to
change an existing situation but
to put obstacles in the way of fu-
ture nuclear development. This
particularly is meant to apply to the no-
table exception, which of course is the
French testing at Moruroa. The
proposed zone would include French
Polynesia, but it could not legally em-
brace those islands because France
would certainly not agree to it.
The issue of nuclear ships in port
would be a matter for the individual
signatories of the South Pacific nuclear-
free zone. In addition to New Zealand,
only Vanuatu now bans them.
If there were no concerted move to
ban port calls, and this seems most un-
likely, the US will not attempt to oppose
establishment of the proposed zone as it
did so strongly in 1975.
But it can be expected to take a close
interest in the possible widening of the
zone to take in American interests north
of the equator. The US has nuclear
capabilities and storage on Guam and
reserves the right to do what it wants in
nearby Northern Marianas. These are
US territories.
It is also responsible for, and will
continue to be responsible for, the de-
fence of the United Nations trust ter-
ritories shortly expected to become
autonomous the Marshall Islands,
Palau and the Federated States of
Micronesia. These three states are ex-
pected to join the forum.
In fact, there is nothing nuclear in
either Palau or Micronesia and thus
they could sign such a treaty if the US
agreed.
In the Marshall Islands, Kwajalein is
an important US missile testing and
communications range on land leased
from the Marshall Islanders. But as the
Australian plan does not prohibit mis-
sile testing, this too would depend on
US reaction.
In the meantime, the forum’s reac-
tion at its Tuvalu meeting is likely to be
“better half a loaf than no bread” and to
opt for the Australian plan. □

Growing fears
of US withdrawal
from ANZUS
By ANTHONY HILL
CANBERRA sources believe it is high-
ly likely that the United States will with-
draw from the ANZUS Treaty if New
Zealand does not back down in its op-
position to the entry of nuclear powered
and armed warships to its ports.
So far, Prime Minister Bob Hawke
has said only that ANZUS may have to
be “reappraised” if the dispute is not
resolved. Privately,' there is a growing
conviction that the United States is
serious and that it will pull out of the
treaty rather than allow New Zealand to
set a precedent which could be taken up
by some NATO countries as well as
Japan.
Under the terms of ANZUS, any
party may withdraw on 12 months’ no-
tice. This extreme option, with all its im-
plications for Australian domestic and
international politics, is still some time
away.
The infant New Zealand Lange Gov-
ernment will continue to come under
pressure subtle and not so subtle. Un-
like Australia, there is a substantial
body of opinion within New Zealand
that, if it comes to it, ANZUS can be
dispensed with. This view cuts across
the political spectrum. There is a strong
feeling favoring a form of neutrality


based on the Swiss model. Prime Minis-
ter David Lange is now talking of “re-
understanding” ANZUS and Lange, at
least in his own country, does not stand
alone.
At present, Australia is at one with
the US in urging Lange to reach some
form of compromise and keep ANZUS
intact. Hawke and Lange held talks in
Port Moresby last week and may be ex-
pected to do so again at'the South Pa-
cific Forum in Tuvalu.
Up to now, says Lange, Hawke has
given a “careful, measured, unthreaten-
ing exposition” of Australia’s position.
It is another matter whether the US will
be so diplomatic on an issue where it
sees its international credibility at stake.
Lange plans to visit the United
Nations General Assembly in New
York next month, at about the same
time as Foreign Minister Hayden. At
this stage it is uncertain whether they
will also see Secretary of State George
Shultz. But Shultz, without too much re-
gard for the niceties, made his attitude
plain at Jakarta, Canberra and the
ANZUS conference in Wellington last
month.
If New Zealand were to deny access,
so could Japan which at present turns a
Nelsonian “blind eye” and asks no
questions about nuclear armaments.
More importantly, so could Norway,
Greece, Spain and Holland all NATO
countries. □
Federation of Labor’s Ken Davis:
claimed “real poverty is developing”
NEW ZEALAND
Unions restive
as devaluation
hits home
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALANDERS’ post-election
euphoria faded rapidly the morning
they discovered that petrol would cost
an extra 16.5 c a litre, a bigger rise even
than during the first oil shock a decade
ago. That was the first sharp conse-
quence of devaluation which pushed up
the cost of imported crude oil from
SNZ44 a barrel to $59. With petrol now
costing 87.5 c a litre (and the prospect
that next year it could rise to the even
dollar) the average New Zealander will
have to set aside another 500 of his de-
preciating dollars a year to run his car.
The decision to increase the petrol price
so steeply was in a sense inevitable, yet
it has disturbed the tenuous accord with
the trade unions established when the
dollar was devalued 20 percent in the
week after the election.
The unions promised then to exercise
wage restraint in return for the imposi-
tion of a three months’ price freeze.
That was intended to provide a breath-
ing space for the Labor Government to
hold its economic summit, formulate a
prices and incomes policy, and prepare
a budget. The strategy was modelled on
the highly successful Hawke model. Yet
the circumstances in which Bob Hawke
achieved his accord are vastly different
from those in which the Lange Govern-
ment is operating. New Zealand has
had a wage freeze for more than two
years, and wage-earners have had to be
content with an $B-a-week cost-of-living
adjustment in that period ordered last
April.
Hawke had the advantage, too, of
going to his economic summit with all
the preliminary work on an accord with
the trade unions already accomplished.
In New Zealand, the petrol price in-
crease has brought to the surface some
underlying tensions between the gov-
ernment and the unions. Both state and
private sector unions have warned the
government they are not prepared to
carry the financial burden resulting
from devaluation. The powerful Feder-
ation of Labor has demanded a general
wage order before Christmas. Its secre-
tary, Ken Douglas, said: “The effect of
the wage freeze has been to screw down
living standards to such an extent that
real poverty is developing.”
The problem for the Lange Govern-
ment is that while in opposition it
strongly criticised the Muldoon
administration for allowing living stan-
dards to fall. Now, with the Reserve
Bank predicting that incomes will fall 4
percent in real terms next year, its
chances of refusing a wage increase
seem increasingly remote. Finance Min-
ister Roger Douglas said last week that
the need to improve New Zealand’s in-
ternational competitiveness ruled out
“any significant wage increase for some
considerable time.” He said that an-
other wage and price spiral would make
any improvement in the employment
situation impossible.
Labor has never made any secret that
its top economic priority is to reduce the
number of those on the dole (about
65,000 at present). After the fall in un-
employment this year, it believes an-
other 35,000 new jobs can be created
next year. That would make a sharp
dent in the dole queues. The Labor ar-
gument is that those in jobs should
tighten their belts a notch or two to en-
sure that those without jobs can get one.
But that’s thin gruel for union lead-
ers to feed their troops. It has done
nothing to stifle the debate about de-
valuation. Even in the labor movement,
some question whether New Zealand
needed to depreciate so heavily. Their
doubts are accentuated by the apparent
ease with which speculators ac-
cumulated large profits from the devalu-
ation.
The Reserve Bank says it has found
no breaches of the regulations. That
however does not soothe those who, like
the Labor Party president, and new MP
for Sydenham, Jim Anderton, believe
that Labor should have penalised the
currency profiteers. The Federation of
Labor’s Ken Douglas has also expressed
dissatisfaction with the government’s at-
titude: “I want to say it’s not a satisfac-
tory answer to the Federation to be told
now that no rules were broken, that they
were playing the rules. That’s exactly
the point of this ... election. The elec-
tion process was to elect people who
were going to change those rules, be-
cause it is those rules that deny us a
living wage.”
Labor ministers have been dropping
dark hints that soon other sectors of the
community may have to make sacrifices
to help restore economic health.
But with the unions displaying in-
creasing concern about the apparently
Friedmanite policies being followed by
the new government, they are asking
what direction the economic summit
may take. The president of the Public
Service Association, Colin Hicks, put it
bluntly: “If there is to be consensus gov-
ernment, then the voice of wage and sal-
ary earners must have equal status with
other sectors of the community, some of
whom care little about contributing to
the economic good and a lot about
taking an unearned share of the econ-
omic cake.” □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Profits from African diamonds
will boost Bridge’s span
Bridge Oil does not live by black gold and gas alone, as DA VID HASELHURST
reports. The Australian company is looking towards a healthy return from its joint
diamond-mining venture in Guinea in West Africa.
THE FIRST diamonds from Bridge Oil
Ltd’s African venture will be offered for
sale next month and the expected sale
price will exceed greatly the estimates
set in earlier feasibility studies.
The diamond project now in its
fourth month of operation is produ-
cing stones averaging twice the size of
early expectations. If this trend is main-
tained, Bridge’s profits in 1984-85 could
be boosted by as much as $lO million
above recent optimistic forecasts.
This is the reason for the recent
strength in Bridge’s share price, which
was the subject of press speculation last
week concerning takeover possibilities.
The biggest stone recovered so far
weighed 65 carats. More than a third of
the stones produced weigh more than 3
carats and the average size at 1.1 carats
is above double the expected size of 0.57
carats. Eighty-five percent of the stones
are gem quality.
Bridge chairman Robert Strauss ad-
mitted cautiously last week that the joint
venture partners expected to get “mark-
edly more” than the $lB5 a carat av-
erage projected in the feasibility study.
Off-setting that to some extent, is the
fact that uneven bedrock conditions
have increased the amount of over-bur-
den to be shifted so that initial mining is
achieving only 60 to 80 percent of an
anticipated recovery grade of 0.5 carats
a cubic metre. Nevertheless, the higher
quality stones should more than make
up for that factor.
Bridge Oil became involved in this
now promising diamond project
through Swiss connections in 1981. It is
only in the past 12 months that investors
have begun to appreciate its potential,
having valued Bridge previously simply
on its extensive oil and gas holdings in
South Australia and Queensland.
Bridge holds a 79.2 percent interest
in Aredor Holdings Ltd, a Swiss-based
company in which the World Bank
holds 11.3 percent, independent dia-
mond dealer Jack Lunzer’s Industrial
Diamond Company 5 percent and others
the balance. Aredor has a 50 percent in-
terest in a joint venture with the govern-
Bridge chairman Robert Strauss: discounted suggestions of a new share issue
ment of Guinea in West Africa over a
23,000 sq km prospecting lease.
Work within a 50 sq km portion of
the lease has proved up sufficient re-
serves to support a 16-year mining pro-
gram with a planned initial throughput
of 400,000 cubic metres a year. Bridge
has an effective equity of 39.6 percent.
Mining began at the end of March,
using a dragline to strip overburden
averaging 2m above diamondiferous
gravel beds averaging 0.6 m thick. But
because of undulations in the bedrock,
the gravels vary in thickness from 0.2 m
to 2m thick. That has resulted in more
waste material being put through the
wash plant than anticipated, thus lower-
ing the head-grade.
Strauss told The Bulletin , however,
that the plant was now “working like a
Swiss watch.”
In a recent comprehensive study on
Bridge undertaken by resources analyst
Dr lan Story for the broking house
Meares and Philips Ltd, it was estimated
that Bridge would boost earnings from
an expected net of $8.2 million in 1984
to $37.1 million in the 1984-85 year. The
Bulletin obtained a copy of the study
from one of the institutions to which it
was mailed this month.
That profit includes an initial share
of $6.2 million from Aredor but the esti-
mate is based on a diamond price of
only around SUS2OO a carat.
The study points out that the project
profit is geared heavily to the prices
received for diamonds. The high sensi-
tivity is shown below:

The Story paper says: “It is still too
early to place a value on a sustainable
grade of diamond but a preliminary
valuation indicates that the diamonds
could be worth SUS3S4/carat, com-
pared with an expected valuation in the
vicinity of SUS2OO/carat.”
Based on receiving only the more
modest price for its share of diamond
production, Bridge’s earnings per share
would rise from an estimated 6.7 c in
1984 to 30.6 c in the current year, with a
sixth of the earnings from diamonds
and the rest from oil and gas. On its
present share price of $2.65 it carries a
price-earnings multiple of 8.5.
The broker’s estimates for Bridge’s
earnings in the latest year and the next
four years are:
1984 1985 1986 1987 1988
Cooper/Surat (sm) 8.2 30.9 32.8 37.9 39.1
Aredor (sm) - 6.2 11.6 13.8 17.8
Total (sm) 8.2 37.1 44.4 51.7 56.9
EPS (cents) 6.7 30.6 36.3 42.5 46.6
The earnings per share figure is
based on maintaining issued capital at
123 million shares. Strauss discounted
suggestions last week that Bridge was
planning a new share issue.
The company’s capital commitments
for its share of the Cooper Basin liquids
scheme, its $lBB million purchase a year
ago of 15 percent of Santos and its in-
vestment in the diamond project have
been covered with loan facilities and a
Swiss franc denominated convertible
note issue made last year with a coupon
of only 4.75 percent. Since Bridge’s
share of diamond sales will be
earned out of Switzerland, it
has an effective hedge against
currency fluctuations.
Bridge has taken full in-
surance cover on its diamond
investment in Guinea where
the junta which replaced
President Toure following his
death in March is continuing
the pro-Western investment
policies followed since 1975.
Guinea has foreign debts
totalling SUSI.S billion and
depends on resource export
industries for foreign ex-
change, particularly the US-
owned Halco bauxite mine
which provides 80 percent of
the country’s foreign ex-
change earnings.
In the case of the diamond
project, only funds to pay
mine workers and services are
brought into Guinea. All the
sales revenue accrues in
Switzerland.
The broker’s earnings pro-
jections are much in line with
projections given by Strauss
to a meeting of the Securities
Institute in Sydney last year,
in which he assumed no further explora-
tion success for the group before 1990.
Yet Bridge, with an annual exploration
budget of $7 million plus 77 percent of
Project Oil Exploration Ltd following a
recent takeover offer, has above average
opportunities to carry a “blue sky” el-
ement in its share price.
Strauss also suggested to the meeting
of analysts that a maiden dividend of
about 40 percent of net earnings would
be paid in 1984-85. Pitched at a prob-
able 13.5 c, that puts Bridge on a
dividend yield of 5 percent at current
prices. □
PRIMARY INDUSTRY
Bitter market
realities face the
sugar industry
By DENIS REINHARDT
AUSTRALIA’S sugar industry, based
in Queensland and northern NSW, is
bracing itself for a bitter international
price free-for-all which threatens the
survival of half of it.
With the collapse of International
Sugar Agreement (ISA) talks in Geneva
in June, followed by only moderate
price gains in a new Commonwealth-
Queensland agreement regulating dom-
estic pricing, the four main industry
groups have pooled resources in a little-
publicised think-tank. However, fast-
emerging divisions within the sugar in-
dustry may cloud development of a


comprehensive survival plan.
One of the most deeply
affected industry groups, the
Co-operative Sugar Millers
Association, representing nine
of Australia’s 33 mills, blames
the industry and government
for its plight.
“We’ve been in a legisla-
tive cocoon for the past 60
years and now we’re faced
with the harsh reality of the
open market,” says general
secretary Graham Robinson
who was deputy common-
wealth statistician before
joining the association.
The industry’s feather bed
is very expensive for the Aus-
tralian consumer who takes 20
per cent of the 3.5-million-
tonne annual production.
Under the new five-year
agreement, the domestic share
is priced for all capital cities
at $5OB a tonne. The inter-
national spot market for the
same grade has just drifted be-
low $2OO a tonne. Imports are
banned but the remainder of
our production is sold at
prices as low as or prospec-
tively lower than that.
The crunch will come
when the European and
Russian beet sugar harvests
come on the world market
after September.
Australia blames highly
subsidised European Economic Com-
munity sugar exports, negligible until a
few years ago, for the collapse of the
ISA. Another factor is that social pro-
ducers in underdeveloped countries will
keep selling while the export value de-
frays real costs.
The economic dries in the Australian
industry are arguing not only for more
aggressive marketing but also that pro-
duction costs must realistically match
world values if growers and mills are to
survive probably three years of price
slashing.
At Babinda, one of the co-operative
mills which have not diversified in
good times because of shareholders’
preoccupations with dividends is in
deep trouble.
“At this stage, we’re hopeful they’ll
pull through,” says Robinson.
But already in the wings is a buyer
the astute Cairns-based North Queens-
land Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd,
which is just rounding off a $90.2 mil-
lion contract for naval patrol boats.
Says NQEA managing director Don
Fry, convinced of a long-term future for
sugar: “The mills have to be far more
efficient. There’s too much labor and
not enough technology.”
Fry instances an NQEA-invented
Graham Robinson: Facing “the harsh reality of the open market”
power system fed by bagasse (cane pulp
remnants) which would slash mills’ gen-
erating costs.
Mills are interested in buying, says
Fry, but most don’t have capital re-
Australia’s coastal sugar belt which runs
from northern NSW to north of Cairns
serves with which to pay for
up-dating.
The sugar industry is one
of Australia’s most tightly
regulated. The latest mill clo-
sure was 30 years ago.
Growers are told where, when
and how much to plant.
Millers must sell through a
central marketing authority,
the Queensland Sugar Board.
(NSW’s 180,000 tonne raw
sugar production is marketed
by Queensland under the
commonwealth-Queensland
agreement.)
“We’ve set up a group
from the four industry associ-
ations to see whether that
structure is still appropriate,”
says Norm Dillman, general
secretary of the Australian
Sugar Producers Association
which is struggling for con-
sensus with Robinson’s as-
sociation, the Queensland
Cane Growers’ Council and
the proprietory millers. Con-
sensus will be difficult to
achieve.
While agreeing that an in-
ternational brawl is under
way some in the industry see
no reason to change a half-
century of production habits
and marketing.
“I guess we can’t rely on
our reputations as efficient
producers any longer,” says
Dillman, “but also we can’t say that
some mills will go.” Referring to Robin-
son’s charge of years of feather bedding,
he says: “I can’t see that it’s a valid
point.”
The answer to the crisis may well be
some form of Commonwealth interven-
tion to help the industry restructure,
Dillman foreshadows. “At this stage, we
haven’t asked the Commonwealth for
anything specific.” But growers do have
votes in key federal seats which went
Labor last year.
Eric White, deputy chairman of the
Queensland Sugar Board and a key ad-
viser to the Queensland cabinet on
sugar matters, says: “I’m still optimis-
tic; I’m not a doom-and-gloom man.
“We’ve already chopped a lot of
people out of the industry and, com-
paratively, we do produce the best sugar
in the world.
“Our marketing is the best because
we’re a single-seller organisation.
“We’ve had price fights for years, so
what’s the difference now?” says White.
The difference, argue the co-opera-
tive millers, is to adopt the view that the
breakdown of international marketing
agreements is not a great disaster but
“an opportunity to ensure that only the
most efficient survive.” □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Coal fuels Meekatharra run
AN OLD favorite in this column,
Meekatharra Minerals Ltd, has had the
most spectacular run on the boards in
August up from a low of 37c at the
beginning of the month to touch 85c last
Friday.
At first glance, it looks as though we
might have missed the boat but I can see
more in them before the end of
November. So many investors are
locked into this stock at prices closer to
$2. (They peaked in 1983 at $2.70.)
High hopes were built on the possi-
bility that Meekatharra’s Wintinna coal
deposits on the Archaringa Basin, 600
km north of Port Augusta, would be the
chosen fuel for South Australia’s next
major power station.
But a committee set up under the
chairmanship of mining consultant
Doug Stewart failed to recommend any
of the four South Australian deposits
considered when it delivered its report
in April.
It appears that the committee con-
sidered out-of-date data in some aspects
of its inquiry.
The deposits considered included
three of low-grade brown coal held sep-
arately by CSR, Western Mining and the
Electricity Trust of South Australia plus
Meekatharra’s Wintinna where gross re-
serves exceed 10 billion tonnes of Per-
mian sub-bituminous black steaming
coal.
In any event, the South Australian
government has set up another “future
energy action committee” and invited
Meekatharra to once again submit pro-
posals once again for the long-term sup-
ply of coal for electricity generation.
On the strength of that, last week,
Meekatharra shares began to move.
Meekatharra is one of four proponents
invited to submit a proposal by
November 19, 1984, to supply a new
base load power station of up to 1000
mW.
Meekatharra strengthened its hand
more than somewhat last week when it
announced that the gigantic Japanese
engineering and construction group
Kumagai Gumi Company would earn a
25 percent interest in the Wintinna pro-
ject by putting up $5 million for the
necessary studies and work to bring it to
final feasibility.
The agreement provides that
Kumagai (NSW) Pty Ltd will be princi-
pal contractor and the Japanese group
will arrange all funding for develop-
ment and commissioning of a mine
estimated at $3OO million. Kumagai is
one of Japan’s biggest power station
builders and is building the 4280 mW
Castle Peak power station in Hong
Kong. It is also in charge of the $l4O
million re-development of the Adelaide
railway station site in joint venture with
the SA government.
Meekatharra Minerals has on issue
15.75 million shares of which 40 percent
are held by chairman Don O’Callaghan.
Meanwhile, Western Mining’s brown
coal deposit at Kingston in the south-
eastern corner of SA has come under
fire from district farmers concerned
about the likely consequences on their
underground water supplies. The Adel-
aide News of July 12 quotes Liberal op-
position leader Olsen as saying that
he would not support any indenture bill
for development of the Kingston de-
posits.
Two Democrats in the upper house
Messrs Gilfillan and Milne have
also said they would oppose any inden-
ture, which effectively would block de-
velopment.
MEANWHILE, the Spectaculor hears
from Kalgoorlie that the first assays will
be out this week from a drilling pro-
gram started by Cord Holdings on the
ground immediately adjoining Bill
Powell’s find, over which it acquired an
option exerciseable at $25 million last
week.
I hear that one hole is running at
nearly a third of an ounce/tonne over
23m from a depth of only 10m.
I believe that Powell finally got tied
up with Cord Holdings instead of the
Flash Jacks from the big companies be-
cause he talks the same language as
Cord director Eddie Mutzig, retired
Kalgoorlie butcher and veteran pros-
pector.

WILDCAT
Santos headhunters make their mark
WILDCAT’S spies in Adelaide whisper
that the board of Santos Ltd is about to
offer the managing directorship to lan
Webber now managing director of
Mayne Nickless.
Webber is understood to be the front
runner on a short list of three for the top
seat at Santos.
Santos has been without a full-time
chief executive since Des Wittwer re-
signed last December. Wittwer, a for-
mer chief of BHP’s oil and gas division,
held the managing director’s position
for only 18 months.
Santos chairman Alex Carmichael
stepped in as acting chief executive and
appointed two head-hunting firms
Boyden Associates and Egon Zehnder In-
ternational to look for a replacement.
Webber is a mechanical engineering
graduate from Adelaide University. He
joined Chrysler in 1956, worked for it
around the world before returning to
the Adelaide plant in 1974. With the
name change to Mitsubishi Motors Aus-
tralia Ltd he was appointed managing
director of that firm in October 1980.
Fourteen months later, he was head-
hunted away to Melbourne to Mayne
Nickless.
The remaining two candidates said
to be on the short list are: Ross Adler,
deputy managing director of Australian
Paper Manufacturers Ltd and John
Shubert, an engineer and production
executive with Esso Australia.
Land of legends
QUEENSLANDERS are nothing if not
excessive in their enthusiasm for the
sunshine state. So many of them have
the Muhammad Ali syndrome every-
thing is the biggest, the greatest and the
best.
Alderman Les Duthie for 72 years
“Of course, we could always lend
you the money to get you up to
the required level!”
a stalwart of Rockhampton and the
Capricornia Coast got the ears of a
party of visiting southern journalists last
week to remind them that the district
had 20 percent of Australia’s beef herd,
the world’s largest aluminium smelter,
Australia’s biggest coal mines and
produced more sunflower seeds than
anywhere else in Australia.
“I hope I don’t sound parochial, but
I mean to be,” he said unashamedly.
Several hundred kilometres north
and a day earlier, on Hamilton Island in
the Whitsunday Passage, resort host
Steve Terry proclaimed the new swim-
ming pool to be the largest in the
southern hemisphere.
He pointed to the water-level “swim-
up” bar and added they would soon be
installing for the aquatic drinkers stools
in the pool.
Far south on the Gold Coast, the bus
driver taking the now weary and statis-
tic-stricken party from Coolangatta air-
port to Surfers drew attention to a sign
pointing left off the road. It said: “Land
of Legends.”
He said: “That’s where we keep the
world’s third-largest doll collection.
Only the Queen and the late John
Wayne had bigger collections.”
Nevertheless, the enthusiasm that
runs from top to bottom in Queensland
must contribute something to that
State’s extraordinary growth in the tour-
ism business.
David Jull, former Liberal MHR and
now deputy general manager of the
Queensland Tourist and Travel Corpora-
tion, said that five years ago NSW regis-
tered seven million more “bed nights”
from travellers than did Queensland.
Wall Street and the presidential election
SYDNEY BROKER Bill Edwards of
Roach Tilley Grice and Co has been
plotting a graph that shows a relation-
ship between presidential elections in
the United States and Wall Street stock
prices.
In the past four presidential elec-
tions, since 1967, the market has peaked
either on or just after the election.
Fundamental analysts remain cyni-
cal, says Edwards, but it’s there on the
chart.
The chart plots the course of the New
York Stock Exchange composite com-
mon stock index an index that covers
a broader range of stocks than the
widely quoted Dow Jones. On or just
after presidential elections, the index
has peaked in 1968, 1972, 1976 and
1980.
Does it suggest we are headed for an-
other peak this November?
The accompanying chart also plots
the course of the Australian Stock Ex-
changes’ all-ordinaries share price in-
dex and pinpoints its position at each of
the latest seven federal elections. That
chart does not show any relationship
between our elections and the local
market but it does show the Austra-
lian all-ords moving broadly in line
with Wall Street.

The lead was down to 700,000 bed
nights a year and, in 18 months,
Queensland reckons it will pass NSW as
the leading tourist state in Australia.
Sir Frank Moore, chairman of the
corporation since it was established five
years ago, pointed out that Australians
last year spent $1.6 billion overseas and
another $1 billion getting there.
“We no longer have a captive dom-
estic tourist market,” he said, particular-
ly since international airfares have be-
come so much cheaper than domestic
fares. Although Queensland was re-
sponsible for 75 percent of all the
growth in domestic tourism last year,
they see major growth in the future
coming from opening the doors to over-
seas airline operators and cut price
charter tours. Premier Sir Joh Bjelke
Petersen added his bit when he pointed
out that only four overseas airlines plus
Qantas flew into Brisbane five years ago.
Now nine plus Qantas fly some 34
scheduled services a week into Bris-
bane, Townsville and Cairns.
But, said Sir Joh, another 26 airlines
wanted to come in here but were being
held up by bureaucrats in Canberra.
When and if they do get in, they will
not want to see the kind of “Oz service”
that Moore hopes has been left in the
past. He once took a party of southern
business men to a restaurant in a prov-
incial centre. The waiter struggled man-
fully with the wine cork, whipped it out
with a flourish, sprayed three of the
guests and beaming broadly said:
“Gotcha!” □

Lend Lease in new high ground
by Russell Lander
IN THE stampede of the bulls last week
several leading industrial stocks were
propelled to new peaks, examples being
AW A, Boral, Burns Philp, Dunlop
Olympic, Edwards Dunlop, John Fairfax,
Herald & Weekly Times, Industrial
Equity, Lend Lease and Tooth & Com-
pany, with units in Stockland Trust
Westfield Trust, General Property Trust,
and lEL Property Trust also entering
new high ground.
The Bridge Data weekly price and
volume chart on Lend Lease Corpora-
tion shows the climb out of the 1982
trough when the stock was fetching
around $2.50 adjusted for issues to re-
cent levels of $5.30. The general market
downturn in May broke Lend Lease’s
primary uptrend, as was the case with
most industrial stocks, but the stock has
retrieved its dignity.
The breakout from the neat rectangle
points to a new upside objective of
around $5.75.

THE MODEST FARMER
Sugar - sweet and sour
by Bert Kelly
FRED HAS a bee in his bonnet about
selling his sheep-wheat farm down here
so that he can go to Queensland to grow
sugar. I warned him that sugar prices
were very low, so the industry was very
sick at the moment, but he insisted that
this was the right time to buy in. “I
know it is your usual practice to buy
cattle when they are dear and sell them
when they are cheap but that is what has
kept you poor, Bert,” he said nastily,
“Wheat farms are selling well just now
and sugar land is sure to be cheap be-
cause sugar prices are down, so I am
going to have a look. Besides, it is lovely
and warm up there and wet and cold
down here. And they have that wonder-
ful Uncle Sir Joh as their Premier so we
wouldn’t have to contend with the
creeping socialism that troubles us here.
You can stay home, but I’m off.”
So to Queensland we went. Getting
away was easier than it used to be when
we had to sneak past the bank where the
banker always seemed to be looking out
of his window. But both Fred and I have
sons to run our places so the banker let
us go without much fuss and without
much money, either!
We called in on Eccles in his ivory
tower in Canberra as we drove north.
Eccles does not know much about
sugar-growing but, of course, that did
not prevent him telling us how the in-
dustry should conduct its affairs.
Ignorance has never been a barrier to
eloquence with Eccles. He told us that,
in recent years, the sugar industry has
been receiving very little if any sub-
sidy from consumers or governments
and has been in a fiercely competitive
export market bedevilled by heavily
subsidised EEC sugar. “But watch out,
Fred,” Eccles warned, “the industry is
controlled by the Queensland Govern-
ment in a way a wheat farmer like you
may not be able to understand.” But
Fred and I knew that he was talking
nonsense because everyone is aware
that Queensland is the last bastion
against socialism.
When we reached the sugar country,
Fred went to see a land agent to give
him the good news that he was in the
market to buy a sugar cane farm ex-
pecting that the agent would be all over
him. But it wasn’t like that at all.
The first question the agent asked
was not whether Fred had enough
money but whether he was a fit and
proper person, good enough to be al-
lowed into the industry. This rather
staggered Fred. He has always had a
suspicion that farmers are more virtu-
ous than other people but he did not
realise that you had to demonstrate your
virtue before you were allowed to start
growing sugar. Evidently, with sugar,
virtue is not something you accumulate
as you get poorer by farming but you
have to have it to start.
Having cast this shadow on Fred’s
character, the agent warned him that,
even if he were as virtuous as Sir Joh
himself, there was little chance of his
being able to get his hands on an “en-
titlement” to grow sugar. Evidently, en-
titlements are a refined way of referring
to quotas. They are given out very
sparingly; only 16 since 1964.
It is no good having a farm unless
you can get an entitlement and these are
allotted by people already in the indus-
try. It seems that the sugar cane can of
worms hardly turns at all. Just how sick
would the wheat industry be now if it
had stayed in the same locations and in
the same shape over the past 20 years?
But, evidently, they hate change in the
sugar industry.
Then the agent warned Fred that,
even if his character were of the
required high standard and if he were
fortunate to know someone high up in
the industry hierarchy and so got him-
self an entitlement, he should not de-
lude himself that he could do what he
liked on his own farm.
Evidently, a cane farmer is only al-
lowed to grow cane on certain parts of
his farm and an inspector comes round
to make sure he is not using any other
land on the sly. So rotating his crop
around his farm to make the best use of
its fertility, as we do with wheat, is not
allowed. And everything has to be done
as the inspector orders; you are not al-
lowed to cut your cane quicker than the
sugar mill and its inspector permit and,
as we will see next week, the sugar mills
also hate having their feather beds dis-
turbed.
While this sad recital was in pro-
gress, I watched Fred’s enthusiasm
evaporating. The sugar industry evi-
dently hates change but this does not
surprise me. Eccles always warns me
that all people even farmers - who
get themselves comfortably settled on
feather beds hate having to turn over,
particularly to let others join them there.
Now that sugar prices are so low,
sugar growers would no doubt appreci-
ate having more feathers in their mat-
tress. All the same, I think they would
be better off without it. □

PIERPONT
A unique opening for a scribe
THE ENTIRE POPULATION of
Reedy’s (2414, by Pierpont’s estimate)
turned out last Saturday, together with
100-odd visitors, for a unique event
the opening of their gold mine.
Such functions normally are per-
formed by Prince Charles or, at least,
the local politician. The Reedy’s open-
ing was unique because it was per-
formed by Pierpont which shows that,
although the chaps who run Reedy’s
may lack political dedication,
their literary taste is excellent.
In his old age, Pierpont is
warmed by the thought that he
may have been the only scribe
in Australia’s history to de-
clare a gold mine open.
Reedy’s is owned by
Metana Minerals NL and
both the mine and its owner
have an erratic history. It oc-
curred to Pierpont while re-
searching his speech that
Reedy’s and Metana provide
a neat illustration of what
gold mining is all about in
Australia today.
The Reedy’s gold project is
40 kilometres south of
Meekatharra. Imagine a spot
down and left a bit from the
centre of Western Australia
and you’ve got the neighbor-
hood.
Gold was first discovered
at Reedy’s in 1900 and was
worked intermittently until
1935 when the Western
Mining subsidiary Triton Gold
Mines took it over. Triton
closed the mine in 1948 but it
has become economic again
thanks to higher gold prices.
Reedy’s is typical of the
sort of gold mine being
opened in Australia today.
Like most of them, it is a
reworking of an old mine. Also like
most of them, it is a low-grade open cut.
Triton mined about 750,000 tonnes
of ore at an average grade of 9.7 grams.
The ore left today is not continuous,
being in four main deposits. In the prin-
cipal one the Rand Metana reckons
that it has just over a million tonnes of
measured, indicated and inferred ore
averaging about four grams. In the
others, named South Emu, North Triton
and Burnakura, are about another
600,000 tons of inferred and indicated,
averaging just over four grams.
In addition there is a high probabil-
ity that further exploration will uncover
more ore in the ground now held by
Metana.
To the layman, the mine is an un-
impressive sight. It is an oblong hole in
the ground where bulldozers scrape
away at crumbling, pale soil. At four
grams, the gold concentration is too fine
to be visible to the naked eye and if
Pierpont did not know it was a gold
mine he would have guessed it to be a
Metana director Peter Ingram standing on the Reedy’s mine. The
earth shown here is ore from which Metana is getting around
three grams of gold per tonne.
clay quarry or even a routine excavation
for two or three local swimming pools.
The ore is put through a mill and
then the gold is extracted by the carbon-
in-pulp process which Pierpont has
never yet fully understood.
What he can understand are the
numbers. The total cost of treating a
tonne of ore, including amortisation of
plant and equipment, comes to $25 a
tonne. The revenue is around $55 a
tonne, so the profit per tonne is $3O.
Metana plans to treat 200,000 tonnes of
ore a year, giving an annual profit of $6
million. Even if you allow for some
mine dilution and a slightly lower gold
price, they would still appear to be
headed for annual profits of around $5
million. This will be highly welcome to
Metana, a company which has made
good after a shaky start in life.
Metana was a child of the late
Poseidon boom. Its prospectus was
issued on November 18, 1970. To give
you a reference point, that was when
Frank Robertson and Tom Nestel were
buying Kathleen Investments
with their ears back an exer-
cise which came to a ghastly
halt three months later with
the collapse of Mineral Se-
curities.
Metana had a professor of
accountancy as chairman and
two potential mines, neither
of them within 1000 miles of
Reedy’s. The first was a cop-
per deposit at Cloncurry and
the second, euphoniously
named Blue Mud Bay, was in
the Northern Territory and
either a bauxite mine or a
manganese mine or possibly
both.
Solicitors to the issue were
Wilde & Pieterse who only
seven days earlier on
November 11, 1970 had
launched a memorable com-
pany called Antimony Nickel
NL.
Metana managed to avoid
the horrible fate of Antimony
Nickel, which was delisted,
never to return, after an orgy
of short selling and cornering
had left it in total shambles.
But, even with a professor
of accountancy in charge,
Metana’s financial record was
dismal and it switched into
property through Archean In-
vestments after a couple of
years. It later sold its interest to Adel-
aide Holdings.
After this desultory start, Metana got
moving in 1978 when it came under
the control of those two talented pros-
pectors, Graeme Hutton and Peter
Ingram.
After trying several prospects, they
became a small miner by developing a
gold prospect at Nullagine. This pro-
vided a vital cash flow for the company
which enabled it to invest in developing
Reedy’s.
Now Metana is up and running and,
if all goes well, will bring another two or


three gold shows on stream in the next
few years.
It warms the cockles of Pierpont’s
sour old heart to see a genuine small
exploration company struggle through
and become a legitimate medium-
weight mining company.
It proves that, despite all the dread-
ful things that happen in small mining
companies some accidental and some
not quite a well-run operation can
still win through.
Metana is not alone. A few small ex-
ploration companies are in the process
of becoming gold miners.
Gold is almost the only mineral
which can put a small company on its
feet. Minerals such as iron and bauxite
have to be mined on iarge scale by gi-
gantic companies to be economic. The
tungsten market is tricky and quotas
have been imposed on tin. Gold, in con-
trast, does not require enormous invest-
ment to mine and has an easily access-
ible international market.
As this literary magazine pointed out
a couple of issues ago, small and large
companies are starting gold mines
throughout Australia. This has led to
speculation that Treasurer Paul Keating
will impose a tax on gold in the forth-
coming federal budget.
Pierpont sincerely hopes that
Keating will not. The existing mines
mostly have a large enough gap between
their break-even price and the world
gold price to survive a tax but it would
throttle some developing mines. It
would also tend to shorten the lives of
existing mines as the marginal ore
toward the end of a mine’s life became
uneconomic.
If the Australian gold industry is al-
lowed to develop, more contractors and
miners will be employed and more
supplies will be bought and the govern-
ment will collect taxes from these
sources anyway. □
CHESS
Going by the book
by Terrey Shaw
IF YOU HAVE been thinking of
writing a book on your favorite open-
ing, sit on your hands for a while. There
is no surer way to torpedo your chess
career.
Such a work telegraphs your punches
to prospective opponents. In the 19605,
Scottish international master David
Levy wrote a book on the Sicilian. He
promptly lost an embarrassingly short
game to Spassky by following one of his
main variations and has hardly been
seen in tournaments since.
The same fate has befallen US
grandmaster Pal Benko. His career has
been on a slide since he challenged fate
by publishing his Benko Gambit.
Well, why not write about a particu-
lar opening and then promptly give up
playing it? This would cause a frus-
trated gnashing of teeth by your next
few opponents, who probably would
have sat up half the previous night
thumbing through your missive, trying
to work out which of your recom-
mended variations had the most holes
in it.
The flaw with this approach is that it
conflicts with a primary motive in pub-
lishing the book: making money. There
is no better way to promote sales than
by beating people with your opening.
Play the St George has gone from rags to
riches since Miles beat Karpov with that
defence (1. P-K4 P-QR 3!?) at Birming-
ham in 1980.
The latest grandmaster to succumb
to temptation is England’s John Nunn
who, shortly before playing Viktor
Korchnoi earler this year, burst into
print with The Benoni for the Tourna-
ment Player.
A Korchnoi scalp probably would
have boosted sales by several thousand
but the Soviet defector is not one to be
caught napping. Korchnoi can read
English quite well these days and ob-
viously had done his homework. He
used only four minutes for his first 19
moves and demonstrated clearly, from
the diagram position, that this previous-
ly unclear line actually is untenable for
black.
Nunn does have one small consola-
tion for being hoist with his own petard:
to earn the victory, Korchnoi at least
had to shell out for a copy of the book,

INTELLIGENCER
Airport counter-attractions
OUR MOLE in the airline in-
dustry has come up with an
exchange of letters that indi-
cates the need for some coun-
ter-intelligence. The first ex-
tract is from Ansett, the reply
from the Department of Avi-
ation’s airport planners.
Re: Darwin International
Airport Redevelopment
Check-In Counters
We refer to our last Terminal
Working Group Meeting of
the 28th June 1984 pertaining
to the above development
when we vigorously attacked
the current planning of the
check-in counter areas.
We have analysed our
counter length of 25000
metres, this provides 12
check-in positions consisting
of 8 Ansett, 2 Northern T. Air-
lines and 2 Airlines of W.A.
The 8 Ansett positions
amount to 17000 metres long,
this being the case we are un-
able to see how T.A.A. can
justify their counter require-
ment of 25 metres when we re-
quire 17000 metres to provide
the same level of service.
Assuming the above can be
achieved, together with the
Qantas counter of 10500
metres we believe the above
could be the appropriate
action.
R. WARBURTON
manager building projects
THIS Department is intrigued
by your stated requirement
for 25 kilometres of counter,
as expressed in your letter.
Adding to this Qantas’ re-
quirement for 10.5 kilometres
of counter (as expressed ...)
Gold Coast Bulletin,
August 2
The Australian,
July 26
and the TAA requirement for
25 meters, it is evident that
considerable re-planning of
the terminal will be necessary
to accommodate the 35.525
kilometres of counter now
required by the airlines.
In accordance with current
policy, this Department
agrees to your request and
will ask DHC to vary its ter-
minal design accordingly. We
must comment, however, that
the 1000:1 disparity between
Ansett and TAA counters
would seem to put TAA at a
significant commercial disad-
vantage.
We are also somewhat con-
cerned that the length of
counter will be difficult to
staff, given that the population
of Darwin is only 60,000
people. It would appear that
adequate staffing of the Ansett
and Qantas counters will
mean that everyone in Darwin
will be too busy working for
the airlines to travel any-
where.
In order to accommodate
the new terminal, the airport
Master Plan will be revised.
The terminal will now be
aligned with the Stuart high-
way, extending approximately
to Humpty Doo. Negotiations
have commenced with RAAF
to accommodate future exten-
sions of the terminal by a
northwards extension of the
recently approved Tindal de-
velopment, enabling the
building to serve Darwin and
Katherine at the same time.
Thank you once again for
your letter.

ADVOCATES of penal re-
form in Australia might con-
sider the photograph above,
which illustrates how the
Islamic legal system works.
The man is Ran Nyak who
was found guilty of stealing
an iron gate in Khartoum.
Under Sudanese law, any
theft of goods worth more
than £lOO Sudanese (about
$46) is punishable by public
amputation of the right hand.
The gate was valued at
$155 so, after six months’jail,
the sentence was carried out
in front of 3000 spectators.
He was drugged and felt
no pain when the hand was
cut off by knife. If he repeated
the offence, he could lose the
left foot as well.

THE bottom right animal on
this rare 1593 atlas cover in
the State Library of NSW car-

what is thought to be Europe’s
first impression of a kangaroo
(even though it resembles a
camel to some viewers). This
image has been used to sup-
port the claim that the Por-
tuguese discovered Australia.
But library experts say that it
is doubtless the result of 16th
century forays to New
Guinea, found by Portuguese
Jorge de Meneses in 1526.
Like many other early ex-
plorers, he performed the feat:
by mistake having overshot j
his intended destination in the :
Moluccas. New Guinea has j

JOURNALISTIC nepotism
rules in the Prime Minister’s
press office.
The “look after our mates”
attitude adopted by Bob
Hawke’s press officers sur-
faced when Stuart Inder, The
Bulletin’s eminent Pacific
affairs correspondent, applied
for a seat on the Prime Minis-
ter’s plane flying to remote
Tuvalu poorly serviced by
routine flights for the South
Pacific Forum this month.
Inder, a former editor of
the respected Pacific Islands
Monthly, is Australia’s fore-
most journalistic expert on the
Pacific. His knowledge and
experience are so highly re-
garded that officials of the
Foreign Affairs and Prime
Minister’s departments de-
cided he should be invited to
accompany Hawke to Tuvalu.
But press officers had
different ideas. They decided
that it was more important to
make sure that journalists
working in the Parliament
House press gallery did not
miss out. We wonder if
Hawke is aware that his press
office is more concerned to
look after the press gallery
club than to help ensure that
the public gets the most in-
formed and intelligent report
possible of the Prime Minis-
ter’s efforts at the forum.
Inder, of course, will be at
the forum thanks to the
New Zealand government
which has kindly provided
him with a seat on one of its
planes going to Tuvalu.
Wrong plane off to battle
Darwin Advertiser, August 2
THE Battle of Britain 1984 is
raging in the pages of the Brit-
ish press. With the proposal
by British civil aviation au-
thorities to hand over some of
British Airways’ routes to
British Caledonian, the two
airlines and the smaller Brit-
ish Midlands are all waging
advertising warfare the length
and breadth of Britain.
Pulling out all the stops on
emotion, B-Cal is running full
page ads with the headline:
“Forty years ago Britain
needed both the Spitfire and
the Hurricane. Now we need
both British Caledonian and
British Airways.”
Good, stirring, patriotic
stuff. But aviation buffs have
noted that, while the Hurri-
cane depicted is a Hurricane,
the alleged Spitfire is a Spite-
ful. This was a later
Supermarine development of
the famed fighter, only few of
which were flown.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
SOMETIMES a choice appears so
difficult that you wonder whether
it is advantageous to be given one.
Look at the illustration. Black has
just rolled a double 4. What’s the
play?
There might appear to be sev-
eral playable options from a be-
ginner’s point of view.
Black can run with his back
men to join his other two on Wl2
but if he does he is almost admit-
ting defeat. Black will have four
men out all on Wl2 and it
will take him four rolls to get them
home. White, on the other hand,
will be home in two rolls and as it
is his roll (after Black has gone to
Wl2) he is effectively three rolls
ahead. This means he will have
taken off five or six men before
Black starts to bear off. Try it and
see.
Black could stay where he is
on W 4, move both men on Wl2 to
89, one home to B 5 and one to
cover the blot B 6 to 82. This is
the play of a real novice, a player
who doesn’t really know what he’s
doing. The move to cover the blot
is wasted.
Another possibility would be
to move both back men out to WB,
then the two men from Wl2 to 89.
This is better than moving the first
two right up to Wl2 but it is still a
weak play. It is weak because the
move is making a race out of the
game and you get into a race only
if you are equal or almost equal at
the starting grid not a lap and a
half behind.
The best play is to move both
men from Wl2 to 85. It gives
Black the chance of a hit yet it is
also a “fast” play. If he rolls a big
double next he can still run but by
staying put now he doesn’t give
White a free hand.

Opening lead queen of
clubs.
ONE OF declarer’s best weapons
is the hold-up play in no-trump.
But when to hold up is a problem
declarer has to solve for himself.
Consider this deal where West
leads the club queen against three
no-trump. Should declarer win
with dummy’s ace or should he
play the eight?
It is not hard to prove that
taking the ace is the right play.
Probably the best way to demon-
strate this is by assuming that
declarer plays the eight from
dummy. In that case, East over-
takes the queen with the king, re-
turns the three of clubs and South
goes down one, losing four club
tricks and the ace of spades.
But if South plays the ace of
clubs at trick one, he makes the
contract regardless of how the
East-West cards are divided. All
he has to do to score nine tricks is
force out the ace of spades. His 9-
6-5-2 of clubs, in conjunction with
dummy’s A-8, make it impossible
for the enemy to cash more than
three club tricks and possibly
only two, depending on how their
clubs are divided.
This conclusion is based on the
assumption that West’s queen of
clubs lead indicates he also has the
jack but not the king. Once this is
granted, it no longer matters
whether West led from a four-card
suit or even a three-card suit.
If West has only three or four
clubs, East-West can never score
more than three club tricks and a
spade. If West has five clubs, the
defenders are in equally bad
shape. East cannot salvage the sit-
uation by dropping his king on the
ace at trick one, nor can he accom-
plish anything worthwhile by
playing his three on the ace (there-
by blocking the suit).
As happens so often, the out-
come depends on what declarer
does or does not do at trick one.

You can’t disguise the truth. One
look at the sleek, streamlined profile of
the Mitsubishi Starion Turbo and you
know this car is more than a superb
sports coupe.
A closer inspection reveals why.
Underthe bonnet, Mitsubishi’s legendary
turbocharged powerpack and electronic
fuel injection give the kind of stunning
performance that make Starion Turbo
one of the fastest Japanese production
cars available in Australia today.
And if that doesn’t make the point,
maybe this will.
This year in a national series of
production car races the Starion Turbos
are proving to be true racing thorough-
breds. Which is, indeed, unfortunate
news for some of the world’s highly rated
sports cars. They’ve failed to live up to
their reputations while at the same time
the Starion Turbos have been out there,
busily building one.
The Mitsubishi Starion Turbo.
For value and high performance it’s a
winner, no matter which way you look at it.
