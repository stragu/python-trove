What Mercedes-Benz
has learned from7s years
of cheating the wind.
A Mercedes-Benz saloon sweeps through
the stormy night along a rainswept highway.
Inside the car, stereo music muffles the
rhythmic slap-slap-slap of the wipers and
everything is normal.
But outside the car, everything is not normal.
The rain is heavy, but the side windows
remain oddly unstreaked.
The surface of the drivers outside mirror is
almost free of swirling water.
Sheets of rain should be streaming down and
over the rear window glass, but they aren’t.
Enough grime is kicked up as the car whisks
along to cake the tail lights. But the tail lights
still glow ruby red.
Something strange and wonderful and
aerodynamic is happening to this
Mercedes-Benz.


It is happening by design.
The Mercedes-Benz 4 S Class’ is one of the
most aerodynamically pure four-door saloons.
Its drag co-efficient eclipses many exotic
sports cars and coupes in sheer wind-cheating
efficiency a crucial feat, when every gain of
10 percent in aerodynamic efficiency can yield
a gain of three to four percent in fuel economy.
But for Mercedes-Benz engineers, it is only
step one in the exploitation of aerodynamics.
They look beyond the numbers- game of low
drag co-efficients, to the way a moving car and
the moving air around it interact. They use the
flow of on-rushing air, as it passes over and
around the car, to perform vital extra functions.
In brief, they put aerodynamics to work.
Extending the science of cheating the wind to
include the idea of harnessing the wind.
As that Mercedes-Benz saloon forges ahead
through the storm, aerodynamic science is
being used to sluice rainwater away from its
side and rear window glass.
The shell of its outside mirror has been
aerodynamically shaped to help conduct
swirling rain and slush away from the mirror
surface itself.
The tail light lenses are deeply ribbed to
resemble washboards: not a styling trick but an
aerodynamic art, meant to keep the recessed
grooves clean by sheltering them from the
vortices of airborne water (and mud and slush)
in the car’s slipstream.
Wet weather or dry, aerodynamics helps to
exert a constant downforce on the front axle of
a Mercedes-Benz as it moves along
countering a natural tendency of the front end
to “lift” as speeds rise and more firmly bonding
the tyres to the road.
The car’s body side configuration is
aerodynamically critical. Correct shaping can
help resist the sudden force of violent
sidewinds, invisible blows that could jar a car
off its true path.
A Mercedes-Benz utilizes aerodynamics to
continuously cool specific heat-sensitive
electronic components under its hood. To feed
fresh air into the cabin while silently extracting
stale air. To prevent irritating drafts and
pressure imbalances in the occupants’ ears by
maintaining a constant level of cabin air
pressure at all speeds. To draw exhaust gases
away into the airstream behind the car.
A Mercedes-Benz also employs
aerodynamic science to help calm its driver’s
nerves. Even the outside mirror is shaped to
generate minimal wind noise; if the driver
experiences an almost eerie absence of wind
buffeting and howling as he drives along,
credit the presence of rigorous aerodynamic
detailing.
Mercedes-Benz believes that cheating the
wind in the cause of more fuel-efficient driving
is good. But Mercedes-Benz believes that both
cheating the wind in the cause of fuel effic-
iency and harnessing the wind
in the cause of driving efficiency
is better.
And that is the difference
between aerodynamics and
Mercedes-Benz aerodynamics.
Engineered like
no other car.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Skeletal remains
As an American anthropologist en-
gaged in the scientific study of the skel-
etal remains of prehistoric populations
in Asia, I am deeply troubled by efforts
of a few native Australians and their
misguided political representatives to
bury and thereby destroy the irreplace-
able skeletal record of ancient peoples
of Australia.
Skeletons of prehistoric men and
women are not the property of any pol-
itical or ethnic group, since they belong
to human beings everywhere as the
documentation of the unique and com-
plex biological history of our species.
Such precious scientific materials must
be kept available for study by scholars
trained in human skeletal biology and
archaeology for, as new scientific ques-
tions emerge, it becomes necessary to
re-examine these data.
Human osteological collections have
the value of a research library of books:
to bury these materials and withdraw
them from any further study finds paral-
lels in book-burning and vandalism of
uncivilised proportions.
Australian archaeology and anthro-
pology is under threat in Victoria and
the world is watching to see if reason or
tragic consequences will result from the
action of the courts.
Australian men and women of sci-
ence and the public at large are urged to
join the international community of
scholars in opposing legislation that
would bring an end to anthropology in
their country.

Hunting comparisons
I am writing as a concerned Australian
bowhunter. I have purchased a copy of
The Bulletin (September 18) in which
was published an article by Brian
Jackman, “The bow is back with a ven-
geance.” By the text of the story, I can
see that the author has no knowledge or
even went to the trouble to find out any
details of bowhunting other than what
he saw from one instance or from what
he was told.
The bow and arrow is one of the
most deadly weapons in the hands of
the right person. I was a rifle-shooter for
many years till I took up the challenge
of the bow and arrow and I know, like
many hundreds of other devoted bow-
hunters, that a rifle doesn’t always
give a clean kill. A hit from a bullet on
impact blows tissues and bone to pieces
leaving an animal in a lot of pain and,
if not shot through the heart or brain,
will live for hours in agony.
A seminar in the United States last
year, attended by five surgeons who are
bowhunters, came up with the same
conclusion that a razor-sharp
broadhead collapses the lung and the
only pain felt is that of yourself having
the wind knocked out of you. Some ani-
mals have been shot through the chest
and never felt the arrow go through and
keep feeding till the body is drained of
the blood then collapse dead.
If a broadhead fails to get a killing
shot, the wound would heal up in a few
days. A bullet wound with a rifle, if not
a killing shot, leaves the animal in a lot
of pain to die a slow death of lead pois-
oning.
I am not one-sided, as it may seem,
“Hurry, dear - I think standards of taste are being broken down”

but I have had the experience of both
types of hunting and that is why I am
writing.
The story by Brian Jackman will or
has already put bowhunting backwards
in Australia.
In Australia, we also hunt buffalo by
the code of ethics put down by the Aus-
tralian Bowhunting Association and
that is a bow with draw weight of 651 b
(about 29.5 kg) or more and have a letter
of competence from your state control-
ler; also a back-up man with a high-
powered rifle in case of emergencies.
No buffalo shot by a bowhunter has had
to experience the alternative because of
the proximity of the shot, 25 to 30
metres. At this distance, a bowhunter
can place an arrow within centimetres
of a good quick killing shot. I have seen
a goat shot at 180 metres that never felt
anything. It went straight down, a shot
through the lungs. A buffalo usually
goes down within 20 seconds if both
lungs are collapsed.

The killing system
I read with interest Brian Jackman’s
article on bowhunting in Africa. While I
marvel at the technological improve-
ments to a primitive weapon, I can see
no sense in this barbaric “sport” es-
pecially when no use is made of the ani-
mal after it is dead. Inflicting hideous
wounds on animals with stainless steel
arrows in the name of sport suggests
that European hunters have psychologi-
cal abnormalities and confused egos.
Bowhunting was developed among
Africans as a means of obtaining food
and latterly as a means of silently
poaching elephants for their ivory, in
such places as Tsavo National Park in
Kenya. It may be of interest to some
readers to know that the Waliangulu
(referred to in the article as the ‘Wata,’
for reasons best known only to the au-
thor) painted their arrows with a black
tar-like substance refined from the latex
of the Acokanthera bush. This plant
contains a toxic glycocide known as
“ouabain” to which there was no known
antidote. The lethal effect was caused by
coagulation of the blood and constric-
tion of the heart muscle tissue.
Ouabain (a word derived from the
Somali name “ouabaio” for the plant)
was very poorly absorbed by the lining
of the intestines and was therefore said
to be orally non-toxic. This phenom-
enon explained why the drug was al-
ways delivered intra-muscularly. Most
African arrow poisons contained car-
diotoxic substances that had immediate
effect on the heart, terminating in
serious incapacitation and eventual
death.
It is ironic to think that ouabain’s
constructive (or destructive) properties


depended greatly on its administrative
dose. When given in large doses, it
forced the victim’s heart into a state of
fibrillation that caused eventual death.
In the case of a man or an animal of
similar weight, this was only a matter of
about half-an-hour (much longer for an
elephant!). Ouabain given under medi-
cal supervision in small doses, like other
cardiac glycocides, had the effect of
stimulating the contractive forces of a
heart suffering congestive failure. This
enabled the heart to expel blood into the
arteries more effectively.

Community arts
Brian Hoad’s blinkered and very hostile
attack on the Sidetrack Theatre Com-
pany’s production of Day-to-Day (B,
August 14) appears to be more an attack
on the current minister, Mr Cohen, than
on the company. Further, Mr Hoad’s
remark that major theatre companies
will be “horrified to learn that the sinis-
ter (sic) forces of community arts have
found a flagbearer” is in itself both an
obvious misinterpretation of the aims of
both the community arts movement and
the Sidetrack Theatre Company.
Community arts and community
theatre do not have flagships and
flagbearers; rather, both movements
aim to provide opportunities for every-
one to have some involvement with arts
practice even for people as
“gormless” as Mr Hoad considers
office-workers. His choice of Flexitime
as a more apt description of office-
workers only indicates that he prefers
theatre which reinforces the worst
stereotypes rather than exploring the
complexities of daily experience.
I enjoyed the introduction and it has
been extremely well received in other
sections of the press. While disagreeing
with Mr Hoad’s review, I would defend
forever his right to conclusions about
community theatre as a whole based on
his feelings about one production.
The major, well-funded flagship
theatre companies of which Mr Hoad is
enamored all are renowned for having
the occasional (some would say fre-
quent) flop. Certainly, the right to ex-
periment (and even to fail) is essential
to the development of theatre. That
many very important theatre pieces
were panned in their opening seasons is
well known to all theatre historians.
Is it that Brian Hoad has again ex-
hibited his concern that the one small
and elite group of self-appointed judges
of cultural quality are having to give
way to a new era, that of cultural
democracy? This, might I add, is not the
expense of quality or excellence
rather, it enhances the scope within
which these judgments are made.
So we ordinary people keep on en-
joying what we do, regardless of the
Brian Hoads of this world. Perhaps in
time we will begin to do so without be-
ing harangued for it or even have the
opportunity to develop shows about our
so-called boring lives that critics will
find attractive. Perhaps not. One thing is
clear, however: We don’t need single-
minded pedants like Brian Hoad to tell
us whether or not he likes it.

The blacl
Below is the pride of the fleet, the Rover Vanden Plas.
Behind the name is a tradition of excellence and elegance which has graced the
likes of Rolls-Royce, Daimler and Jaguar
The Rover Vanden Plas sits well in this company
The paint finish is outstanding, with a depth and lustre which draws the eye as
surely as a moth to a flame.
Equipment which would normally be available
only as an option is, of course, standard.
Automatic transmission, electrically operated sunroof, windows, door mirrors
(complete with electric demisters) and aerial.
Alloy wheels, headlamp power wash and rear window wash/wiper. Indeed, the
Rover Vanden Plas offers no options nor has need to.
Inside, the Vanden Plas influence becomes more apparent.
The seats are faced in Connolly leather, with door panels and fascia inserts
beautifully finished in burled walnut.
The appointments extend to shag pile footwell carpets, front and rear
headrests, a quality radio/cassette system, superb air-conditioning and a trip
computer.

For your peace of mind, the Rover Vanden Plas affords rare safety and security
of investment.
In the year of its launch, the Rover won the Don Safety Award for “the most
significant contribution to vehicle and road safety.’

“If anyone asks, you hit him in the forehead ”
economics” (B, September 25), needs
reminding that there is an underprivi-
leged ethnic minority in Australia called
Australians and that they have needs,
too.
West’s “doublespeak”: “Every three
or four migrants that come in generate
demand for one extra dwelling . . .
whether they have a job or not, they will
be looking for housing...” is only too
true and, translated into plain English,
could imply: “We are creating a hous-
ing crisis but it’s very good for land-
lords, property owners and investors. If
they profit from public taxes, via social
security payments, so much the better.
If it means that young Australians have
even less chance of finding a job or ever
owning a home, we couldn’t care less.”
The average sum of $5OOO imported
capital per migrant is hardly likely to
create jobs through demand for new
dwellings and certainly not more jobs
than migrants.
Mr West knows the price of every-
thing and the value of nothing. Just as a
kangaroo’s carcass, a block in the
Daintree and a forest of woodchips all
have their price, so does your Australian
passport. It’s $5OOO, no matter how long
your family has been in the country.

Thank you
In reply to R. C. Slessor’s letter “What’s
in a name” (B, September 25), may I say
thank you! I was delighted to see our
name in The Bulletin. As to “reaching
new heights of absurdity” in the naming
of the band, Oscar Wilde said it all:
“There is only one thing in the world
worse than being talked about, and that
is not being talked about.”

Disregard for feelings
R. C. Slessor expressed some dismay
over the unfortunate choice of “The
Cockroaches” as a name for a musical
group likely to frequent restaurants.
However, the writer’s lighthearted
suggestion that an appropriate name to
be considered for this group might be
“The Retarded Mongols” shows in its
thoughtlessness a disregard for the feel-
ings of fellow human beings who by a
twist of fate have different facial charac-
teristics and may be intellectually dis-
abled. Including them among “lice” and
“maggots” must do a great deal for the
families and friends of people with
Downs Syndrome.
I hope that both The Bulletin and R.
C. Slessor make an effort to understand
the problems of persons with intellec-
tual disability and how you might have
contributed to them.

Back to basics
In his powerful piece on Lib gloom (B,
September 11), Tim Duncan says hard
heads “are not sure that business neces-
sarily provides a better training for poli-
tics ..
Have the Libs lost faith, then, in the
article of faith that sustained them
through the Ming era and beyond: that
the men to run the country are men who
“can meet a payroll”?
I can still hear that tenet being pro-
nounced in ringing tones by Ming stal-
wart Alan Fairhall, himself a meeter of
payrolls before entering parliament,
when exhorting us hicks to vote for his
mob from a soapbox (remember those
days?) under Townsville’s Tree of
Knowledge; once the city’s Hyde Park
Corner but now, alas, long gone.
Gone, along with faith in free enter-
prise, free speech, individual rights, a
minimum of government interference, a
belief in justice, an insistence on honor,
honesty and integrity on the part of
public figures whether elected, ap-
pointed or uniformed which all true
Libs if not their Country Party cousins
once believed in and, to some extent,
practised.
Perhaps they should get back to these
basics?

might reduce a smoker’s sperm count by
half conclusions which Dr Conway
herself admits should be treated with
caution.
Dr Conway confesses that a dose-re-
sponse relationship has not been estab-
lished. Social drinking, diet and coffee
consumption, she said, are other factors
which may be responsible for reduced
fertility in men but Dr Conway makes
no mention of other potentially con-
founding factors such as genetic dis-
position, family history, previous
illness and perhaps even tight jeans.
Nor does the doctor point out that
her sample is obviously self-selected
men who for one reason or another
donated sperm to her Artificial Insemi-
nation Unit. Over two years, she sur-
veyed only 119 men, of whom one quar-
ter smoked.
One could ask whether her subjects
were prompted to donate sperm to guar-
antee their own immortality or through
concern about their own fertility.
Either way, the sample cannot be
considered representative of Australian
men and, in particular, Australian male
smokers.

Speculator’s test
I share with P. Lichtwark (B, September
4) an envy of Speculator’s dramatic suc-
cess as a share trader but see that the
time has come for a better method of
assessing his profits.
When a share is recommended in his
column it is possible that demand in the
share will push the price up making it
impossible for the reader to buy at the
same price as Speculator.
A much fairer way to judge his skill
as an investment adviser would be to
base his results on the share prices avail-
able in stockmarkets following publica-
tion of his weekly recommendation
(that is, share prices that are actually
available to the reader taking Specula-
tor’s advice.
Unless his trading is analysed in this
manner the results are meaningless.
How about it, Speculator?

Science and technology
A major reason Australia is floundering
is because most of our politicians,
senior bureaucrats, union bosses and
newspaper and magazine editors and
journalists have been educated in the
humanities stream at school and univer-
sity.
Consequently, many of these people
know as much about scientific research
and industrial technology as cavemen.
I believe Barry Jones, the Federal
Minister for Science and Technology,
would concur with this observation.

The Briese affair
Senator Austin Lewis (B, September 18)
has drawn attention in the Senate to the
anti-Liberal slant in your articles on the
Briese-Murphy affair in your edition of
September 4 and well he might; I go
further and add “pro-Labor, anti-Briese
slant.”
How three out of six can constitute a
majority is beyond me, unless the state-
ment is qualified “by the use of the
chairman’s casting vote.” Further, how
can you justify the statement “notwith-
standing that the committee would not
recall him (Briese) to be cross-examined
on his credit by Murphy’s counsel”
without adding that Murphy refused to
be called at all?
The flat claim that “Murphy cannot,
in accordance with the constitution, be
impeached . . . unless his behaviour has

been proved in a court of law” cannot
be absolute as there is considerable de-
bate on the point. Perhaps the Officious
Bystander would care to indicate what
court of law? In any case, there would
appear to be many examples of what
could be (proved) misbehaviour that
would not necessarily have to go before
a court of law.
Although untrained in law, I can
read and I can think. Let me then refer
to Section 72 of the constitution which
states, inter alia, that justices of the High
Court shall not be removed except “on
the ground of proved misbehaviour or
incapacity” ... and then to Section 44
which states, inter alia, that any person
shall be incapable of “sitting as a sena-
tor or a member” who has been “con-
victed and is under sentence or subject
to be sentenced for any offence punish-
able under the law of the common-
wealth or of a state by imprisonment for
one year or longer.” Unless we assume
that the founders of our nation were
fools or didn’t know what they were do-
ing, it follows that they were careful to
ensure that the conduct required of the
judiciary would be of the highest order
well above that acceptable for sena-
tors and members of parliament, thus
reflecting the product of the elective
process as being subject to more human
frailty.
Finally, in your edition of September
18, you report that “for relaxation, he
(Temby) plays tennis and indulges in a
little light fiction reading” and that “for
relaxation, he (Briese) likes to ... play a
game of tennis (he is a mediocre player)
or listen to classical music.” Why the
bracketed “he is a mediocre player” un-
less to carry the connotation of medioc-
rity into Briese as a person? It was an
unnecessary interpolation in what
seemed an integrated presentation of
the man.

In the midst of Asia’s largest city, and a business
environment which appears to be in perpetual motion,
Hilton has created a tranquil oasis.
In Shinjuku centre a skyscraper city within a
city is a new hotel of quiet distinction. Within its
38-storeys are 858 guest rooms and suites, four
restaurants and three cocktail bars.
A business centre provides a comprehensive array of
services to keep you prepared, informed and in touch.
The top three executive floors feature separate
check-in, bar lounge, snack service and concierge.
Fitness facilities include sauna, gymnasium, indoor
swimming pool and tennis court.
All this and more you’ll find in the new Tokyo Hilton
International. But, above all, you’ll find tranquility,
and an experience that is, in every way, something
more than first class.

Saw’s pronouncements
While 1 have a lot of sympathy for Ron
Saw’s feelings about the Australian pro-
nunciation of Los Angelus as Los
Angeleez, Nicker-agg-ewer for
NicarAHGWA, etc, his analogy be-
tween schedule/shedule and school/
shule just doesn’t hold water.
The former area of city/country pro-
nunciations relates to a localised accent,
the latter to an area called phonetics.
English (or Australian) is not a phonetic
language unlike, for example, Span-
ish or Italian. I wish it were. At the risk
of throwing a cliche into the argument,
how does Mr Saw expect us to pro-
nounce “through,” “though,” “bough,”
“thought,” “trough,” etc, etc? Is he ad-
vocating that all these words be pro-
nounced in the same manner? I agree


“Sorry, he doesn't do toasters”
with him ideologically but, practically
and historically, it’ll be a hard law to
enforce.

some little horrors such as “Monday

as “Y’never done it like that,” it’s oright,

Air Pacific
Claims in your magazine (B, October
2) that the Prime Minister and hence the
federal government were backing
Ansett in preference to the national air-
line Qantas in a commercial dealing
with the Fiji government are totally in-
accurate.
I wish to make it quite clear that the
federal government has no position on
which company should take part in the
exercise, concerning the future of Air
Pacific, with the Fiji government.
For the record, the question of the
future of Air Pacific was raised with the
Prime Minister by the Prime Minister of
Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, during
Mr Hawke’s visit to Fiji following the
South Pacific Forum in Tuvalu. It was
raised against the background of an
offer of assistance by Air New Zealand,
and also of expressions of interest by
Ansett.
It was in that context that is, an
Australian airline in competition with
an airline from another country that
the Prime Minister indicated his sup-
port for the Australian company.
The Fiji Prime Minister did not men-
tion Qantas in the brief discussion and,
indeed, Qantas had not become
involved in the matter at the time.
Qantas has since held discussions
with Air Pacific and has sent a team to
Fiji to put proposals to help overcome
problems facing the airline.
The Prime Minister made it clear in
conversation with Ratu Mara on Sep-
tember 26 that now both Australian car-
riers had expressed interest in providing
assistance to Air Pacific, the Australian
government had only one interest; that
was that an Australian enterprise should
be successful.
The Prime Minister also spoke to the
chairman of Qantas and advised of the
government’s support for Qantas devel-
oping proposals to assist Air Pacific.
The Australian government, of
course, will not intervene to promote
one Australian company above the
other, as the choice between the propo-
sals is now properly a commercial de-
cision for consideration by the Fiji gov-
ernment.
KIM BEAZLEY
Minister for A Nation
Canberra
The impression that Mr Hawke was
supporting Ansett over Qantas was con-
veyed, mistakenly, by the story’s head-
line. Editor
Listen to Lincoln
It never ceases to amaze me that there
are governments and individuals work-
ing with and within governments who
are seemingly hell-bent on a course of
destruction of the most vital section of
the economy the small business.
Abraham Lincoln said: “You cannot
bring about prosperity by discouraging
thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak
by weakening the strong. You cannot
help the wage earner by pulling down
the wage payer. You cannot further the
brotherhood of man by encouraging
class hatred. You cannot help the poor
by destroying the rich. You cannot keep
out of trouble by spending more than
you earn. You cannot build character
and courage by taking away man’s in-
itiative and independence. You cannot
help man permanently by doing for
them what they could and should do for
themselves.”
Yet today the exact opposite seems
to be the course of our socialist govern-
ments and our small-1 liberals.
It would seem to me that if govern-
ments looked hard at what Lincoln had
to say and carried out the consequences
of such a line of thinking, we today
might be experiencing the economic re-
vival that is talked about but which no
one seems to be able to locate.

When you buy something
by Pierre Cardin,
you’re not buying his name.
Y>u’re buying his eye.
Everything by Pierre Cardin
bears his name.
Either discreetly displayed as
part of the design.
Or even more discreetly tucked
away where no one can see it.
It doesn’t really matter.
Yau’re not paying for the name
of this great designer; you’re paying
for his eye.
(And yes, as you can see, he does
have two of them.)
It’s apparent in everything he
does.
Yet how can one man’s talent
continually renew and refresh itself
over 40 years?
After all, he has won the world’s
major fashion awards in every decade
since 1950.
As recently as 1983, he carried
off the gold Thimble for Paris’ most
creative collection.
(It was his third.)
Perhaps the answer lies in the
immense span of his interests.
He is so much more than a
fashion designer.
He designs cars and planes.
He owns Maxim’s in Paris, argu-
ably the world’s greatest restaurant.
He brought a Russian rock show
from Moscow to Paris.
And so it goes on.
And because he stays in such
close touch with so many aspects
of life, his designs are always
contemporary while always retaining
that classic Cardin simplicity of eye.
The result is that anything at all
that bears the Cardin name is highly
distinctive.
And that should be obvious even
to someone with almost no eye at all.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Packer statement
SYDNEY-based Australian
business leader Kerry Packer,
46, said he was meant to be
the “Goanna” mentioned in a
National Times report on al-
leged findings of the Costigan
royal commission. In a de-
tailed statement, Packer
refuted all accusations against
him.
Mrs Hawke on TV
HAZEL Hawke, wife of the
Prime Minister, told a Sydney
television interviewer that her
husband had broken down
and wept at a Canberra press
conference because of the ner-
vous strain caused by the her-
oin addiction of their daugh-
ter Rosslyn and her husband.
New action on judge
IN A new development of the
alleged Morgan Ryan immi-
gration-racket case, Judge
John Murray Foord of the
NSW District Court was
stood aside for the second
time. The move preceded
by a dramatic night flight by
NSW Attorney-General Paul
Landa to his federal counter-
part, Senator Evans, in Can-
berra was made (Landa told
the NSW parliament) after he
had received certain “ma-
terial” from the Chief Judge
of the NSW District Court,
Judge Anthony Staunton.
Labor split
MRS Jean Melzer, a former
Victorian Labor senator and
ex-secretary of the state ALP

AUSTRALIA
Packer and the new McCarthyism
-a bill of rights is needed
Kerry Packer's stirring defence of his reputation highlighted the threat to justice in
Australia of the new McCarthyism. Here Trevor Kennedy, Editor-in-Chief o/The
Bulletin, discusses the excesses of the Costigan royal commission and the pressing
need for a bill of rights.
IT WAS The Bulletin which first pub-
lished, with appropriate evidence, some
of the astonishing happenings within
the Ship Painters and Dockers Union
which led to the establishment of the
Costigan commission. It was also this
publication which elevated the debate
on organised crime in this country to
the status of a national issue by publish-
ing material gathered by Bob Bottom.
We also were the first really to
expose the extent of the drug
trade based in Griffith, in
articles by Malcolm Turnbull.
Nothing much has
changed at The Bulletin. I still
have editorial control of The
Bulletin. Malcolm Turnbull is
now the general legal counsel
at Australian Consolidated
Press. We still have a deep
and abiding hatred of corrup-
tion, crime and drugs in all
their forms. Most important,
though, is the fact that this
magazine’s stand on all these
issues has happened with the
active support and encourage-
ment of our proprietor who
leads the publication’s
aspirational endeavor to build
a better Australia.
Queer then, isn’t it, that
this same fellow is none other
than Kerry Packer who sud-
denly finds himself at the
centre of the most bizarre ar-
ray of accusations ranging
through drugs, pornography
and complicity in murder?
This farrago of fictions,
which supposedly emanates
from documents which ap-
pear to have been leaked sys-
tematically by an insider of
the Costigan royal commis-
sion, had reached a point
where a man had been tried
and convicted by his accusers
who then allowed a whisper-
ing campaign of monstrous
proportions to gather momentum in all
corners of Australia.
There is no doubt that Packer’s inno-
cence of these crazy allegations
ultimately will be established in the
defamation courts.
But how good is a system which al-
lows such a massive injustice to occur?
How good is a royal commission which
disregards all basic principles of jus-
Kerry Packer: confronted allegations against him
CENTRAL PRESS
tice? How good is a royal commission
which cannot effectively keep its own
documents secure? Will Frank
Costigan, by linking respectable and in-
nocent people to these dark areas,
simply make the villains more respect-
able?
On this latter point, there are politi-
cians who also have something to
answer for. When Andrew Peacock calls
Bob Hawke a friend and an
associate of criminals, Pea-
cock not only mucks about
with the reputation of politi-
cians but elevates the crimi-
nals to a new level.
One of the alarming things
is that it is not only politicians
in Australia but supposedly
intelligent businessmen and
academics coupled with a
compliant press, particularly
the Sydney-based Fairfax me-
dia which has been pre-
pared to co-operate in these
campaigns of vilification.
John Fairfax and Sons Ltd,
publisher of The National
Times , has defended itself on
the basis that the original code
name for the Packer case sum-
mary Squirrel was
changed to Goanna so that
Packer could not be identi-
fied. That is pious claptrap.
Everyone who had followed
the Costigan commission and
Packer’s appearances before it
immediately recognised
Packer as the Goanna. Senior
Fairfax executives have pri-
vately conceded as much.
There is no doubt that all is
not well in many areas of gov-
ernment and law enforcement
in Australia, notably in New
South Wales. In some of the
charges that have floated
about there has been some
truth.
But, if a McCarthyist hys-


Royal commissioner Frank Costigan: documents from his inquiry went out of control
teria is not to emerge, cool heads are
needed.
Forget Packer for a moment and
look at what Neville Wran has had to
endure. Apart from the (Street) royal
commission which he had to go
through, there has been a campaign of
slur and innuendo almost without pre-
cedent against the NSW Premier by
supposedly intelligent people.
I can recall at one stage last year be-
ing told at four successive functions the
various circumstances under which
Wran had been divorced from his wife
Jill something about which there has
never been an iota of truth. The amaz-
ing thing is that the chief executive of a
major corporation told me how he, per-
sonally, knew the judge who had
granted the divorce. The businessman
had at no stage applied any intellectual
rigor to this baseless gossip. Had he
thought it through at all, he should rap-
idly have reached the conclusion of how
impossible it would be for a Premier to
get divorced in secret particularly one
who is very happily married.
As Packer said in his statement last
week: “The Australian tradition of dis-
respect for tall poppies is an important
antidote to humbug. But it should not
degenerate into an orgy of suspicion, al-
legation and innuendo at the end of
which anyone who has achieved any-
thing in his life will be presumed a
crook.”
This problem has reached epidemic
proportions in Australia.
It is only during such an epidemic
that the excesses which have occurred
could occur.
Can anyone, for one moment, im-
agine the outcry in Britain or the United
States if a commission conducted itself
as the Costigan royal commission has?
The disappointing thing about Aus-
tralia is that the entire legal fraternity
ignored the massive breaches of civil
liberties which have been going on for
months at the hands of this commission.
Some privately have been critical but
not one person or civil liberties group at
any stage emerged to defend the great
traditions of justice.
Kerry Packer is a very important
Australian but greater and more import-
ant issues than his reputation are at
stake in this debate. By his courageous
and eloquent statement, Packer may
have turned the tide against the new
McCarthyism of which the Costigan
royal commission is a part.
Packer has said openly what many
have thought about Costigan but been
afraid to say. Just as critics of Senator
Joseph McCarthy were described as
“friends of communists,” so anyone
who stands in Costigan’s way is auto-
matically a “protector of criminals.”
Costigan may not be dishonest but he is
misguided. He has sacrificed the
liberties of Australians on the altar of
his own zealotry.
Packer has ably defended himself.
His rebuttal of the charges against him
is a devastating indictment of the
people who formulated them. Packer’s
vindication needs to be more than an
acceptance that the charges against him
were false: it requires changes to our
law so that the miscarriage of justice
that has occurred can never happen
again.
The government should now look
very seriously at a Constitutional Bill of
Human Rights which will prevent any
future royal commissioner from deny-
ing civil liberties the way Costigan has.
Parliament must not assume that, once
Costigan has gone, the problem will not
recur.
Costigan is a mere symptom of the
disease and the erroneous path he has
charted will be followed by others un-
less there are strong constitutional bar-
riers erected in the way. □


THE ALP
Executive victory
starts right’s body
building program
The ALP federal executive meeting in Canberra: new power for the right
By RICHARD FARMER
POWER in the Labor Party has
switched significantly to the right after
an almost complete victory at the feder-
al executive by Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and his allies. The executive last
week intervened in the
Victorian and Queensland
branches in a way that curbs
the influence of the Socialist
Left. The upshot is that the
right wing forces that support
Hawke, and which already
control the federal party and
New South Wales, will extend
its power into the next two
biggest states as well.
In Victoria, three right-
wing unions which have been
out of the Labor Party since
the split of 1955 will be re-
affiliated immediately. The
cries of anguish from the So-
cialist Left controllers in Vic-
toria at the decision are a rec-
ognition by them that their
grip on the state has been
loosened. Next year when a
fourth union, the Clerks, re-
joins the Labor fold the right
wing faction will replace the
Socialist Left as the largest in
the branch.
While the decision of the
federal executive about re-
affiliation in Victoria has
received all the publicity, the
move in Queensland is every
bit as significant. There the
national body has decided to change the
party rules to give the moderate Austra-
lian Workers Union a bigger say. A pro-
vision placing a ceiling on the number
of delegates from any one union that
can be sent to state council meetings
will be removed. The extra delegates
from the AWU in future will be enough
to topple the unholy alliance between
left and the “old-guard” right which has
resulted in the party presidency being
held by the Socialist Left.
For Hawke the federal executive de-
cisions could hardly have been better.
He has had as a major objective since
Neville Wran and Bob Hawke at the executive meeting
gaining power 18 months ago the
strengthening of his own right wing fac-
tion. The reverses the right suffered in
the recent pre-selection ballots in Vic-
toria simply strengthened his resolve
that changes had to be made. Now they
have been and Hawke is well on the way
to seeing the Socialist Left’s influence
reduced at state levels in the same way
as it already has been at the federal one.
Not only has the executive changed
the power structure in Queensland and
Victoria, the decision on reaffiliation of
unions has given as well the encourage-
ment the right needs to assert itself in
South Australia, Western Australia and
Tasmania. Moves will now be made in
those three states to have returned
unions which left the Labor Party 19
years ago. The decision on Victoria by
the federal executive will be all the pre-
cedent that is needed and there will not
have to be a repetition of the internal
anguish which preceded last week’s 11-7
vote.
It is one of the ironies of current
Labor Party politics that it is the federal
executive which is providing the right
with the means of establishing its domi-
nance. That body for years was the
means by which the left kept the party
doctrinally pure but out of office. In
those days it was the right which was
states-righters but now the roles have
been reversed. At last Friday’s meeting
it was the left’s Senator Arthur Gietzelt
who argued that the executive was using
its powers too widely to intervene in the
affairs of what should be sov-
ereign state bodies.
Gietzelt, Minister for Vet-
erans Affairs and senior vice-
president of the party, was
concerned not only with the
Queensland and Victorian de-
cisions. He also saw his left
faction defeated on two other
important issues.
The left was unhappy that
the formula on preselections
for the election expected on
December 1 suggested by
the right-wing NSW machine
was accepted. This meant that
all sitting members were
guaranteed endorsement and
this overruled the defeat in
Victoria of right-wing back-
bencher Robert Chynoweth
for the seat of Dunkley. It
avoided also the prospect that
two Queensland moderates,
David Beddall and Len
Keogh, might miss out on
returning to Canberra.
Beddall and Keogh were
threatened with challenges for
preselection by that odd mix-
ture of left and right which is
unique to Queensland.
In NSW the acceptance of


the right’s argument that rank-and-file
ballots should not be held for sitting
members means that two right-wing
caucus members, John Mountford in
Banks and Dr Richard Klugman in
Prospect, are protected. So too is one
left-winger, Immigration minister Stew-
art West.
The other matter which saw left-wing
delegates to the federal executive
soundly defeated concerned the ad-
mission of members of the NSW Legis-
lative Council to the parliamentary cau-
cus. The left tried hard to have a de-
cision on this matter postponed but the
majority would have none of it. The up-
shot will be that from July 1 next year
the right will have a considerably in-
creased majority within the state caucus.
This will be of considerable significance
when it comes to choosing a successor
to Premier Neville Wran when he steps
down towards the end of the govern-
ment’s current four-year term.
The willingness of the federal execu-
tive to intervene in internal state matters
is unlikely to end with last week’s de-
cisions. Federal secretary Bob
McMullan is keen to press on with at-
tempts to get a uniformity in the rules of
each state branch. Such uniformity
would complete the transition of the
Labor Party from being eight individual
state and territory parties into one na-
tional body. It should also, given the
composition of the federal executive
and conference which will approve the
uniform rules, ensure that the right
maintains its new-found dominance. □

PUBLIC OPINION
Peacock still at rock bottom
OPPOSITION Leader Andrew Pea-
cock’s approval rating remained at 25
percent on the weekend after Prime
Minister Hawke wept at a press confer-
ence.
This figure, obtained by the Morgan
Gallup Poll, was recorded before Hazel
Hawke disclosed on television the ex-
tent of the heroin addiction of her
daughter and son-in-law.
Peacock’s approval rating was the
lowest for a leader of the opposition re-
corded by the Morgan Gallup Poll.
The poll found that on September
22/23 Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s ap-
proval rating was 67 percent up one
percent on the previous weekend.
Of all electors surveyed, 70 percent
(down 3 percent) said they felt Hawke
would make a better Prime Minister,
while 16 percent (up 1 percent) said
Peacock. However, of L-NP voters sur-
veyed, 48 percent (down 4 percent) said
Hawke would make the better Prime
Minister, while 35 percent (up 1 per-
cent) said Peacock and 17 percent were
undecided.

THE LEFT
Routed faction
learns a lesson
and fights back
Andrew Theophanous (left) and Gerry Hand: tall poppies lopped
By DEBORAH HOPE
AFTER its defeats at the party’s nation-
al conference in July, Labor’s left wing
is regrouping with considerable effec-
tiveness in some states.
The left emerged from that long
week in Canberra’s Lakeside Hotel
severely bruised, demoralised and bitter
that the newly-formed Centre Left fac-
tion had used its numbers to steal from
the left any hopes of victory on the issue
about which it is most self-righteous
uranium mining and export.
It since has scored morale-boosting
wins in the political and industrial
sectors of the Australian Labor Party.
One of the most important, in a practi-
cal as well as a symbolic sense, is Jack
Kidd’s comfortable victory in the con-
test for national secretary of the
Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and
Shipwrights Union against Rod Kelly
of its right-backed reform group.
The left also has scored well in pre-
selection ballots in the lead-up to the
federal election, at state conferences in
South Australia and Western Australia
where the faction is emerging as a for-
midable force and in Queensland where
the branch recently elected a left-wing
unionist as its president.
However, its defeat on the re-ad-
mission of right-wing unions to the ALP
and on the battle over pre-selections at
Labor’s national executive meeting late
last week shows that the left’s strength
continues to be at the branch and state
levels rather than federally.
Hawke and his political advisers are
only too well aware of the impact this
burgeoning influence at grass-roots
level could have on the electorate and
on pre-selections. This fear was behind
the push to re-affiliate four right-wing
unions in Victoria and also behind
Hawke’s call for 140,000 Australians to
join the Labor Party by the end of the
decade.
The striking exception to the left-
wing resurgence is in NSW where domi-
nance of the ruling machine has re-
sulted in a strong streak of defeatism in
the left-wing steering committee.
As well as being the underdog in the
Peter Baldwin: adding to the left’s
strength in economic analysis
state, the steering committee is torn by
an internal leadership battle which de-
veloped after the resignation of Jack
Ferguson as Deputy Premier and which
could be said to have lost the left his old
position. Without clear leadership, en-
meshed in its own battle and extremely
bitter about the Centre Left, the NSW
left appears to be floundering.
Adding to this defeatism are moves
which have tightened the machine’s cen-
tral control of the branch, including the
decision to hold pre-selection ballots
only in seats for which sitting members
do not nominate. Bitterness over these
moves has driven some sections of the
steering committee to believe that their
only hope is if allegations of corruption
at state level eventually drag the ma-
chine down.
After years of being absorbed in the
numbers battle, the ALP left in NSW is
beginning to form a strong group of
economic analysts. Predominant in this
group are Peter Baldwin (House of Rep-
resentatives member for Sydney), Annie
Catling (an economist who Baldwin
beat in the federal pre-selection fight)
and Martin Byrne (a former Young
Labor president who featured at the na-
tional conference in debate over foreign
banks entry to Australia).
It is in Victoria that the public profile
of the left is highest. Although no fac-
tion holds a majority in the state the
Socialist Left commands more of the
party vote than any other with about 45
percent on the floor at its conference.
They can maximise their power when
combined with the independents (11
percent) and non-aligned (6 percent)
against the 38 percent strength of
Hawke’s Labor Unity faction.
The strength of the combination was
shown in recent pre-selections in which
the left/independent coalition won 10
of the 11 contested seats. Among the
casualties were Labor unity supporters
Attorney-General Gareth Evans who
was attempting a move from the Senate
to the Reps and former Victorian cabi-
net minister Bill Landeryou.
A sitting Labor unity member, Bob
Chynoweth lost to Socialist Left mem-
ber Albert Knowles because of indepen-
dent support in the seat of Dunkley.
According to Gerry Hand, Labor
member for the safe federal seat of Mel-
bourne and a key organiser for the So-
cialist Left in state and national spheres,
the left in Victoria has consolidated
strength rather than increasing it. He
said the left had won only three pre-
selections in Victoria on its own
strength and only Dunkley had come as
a surprise.
“We didn’t do all that bloody well,”
he said. “We retained two sitting mem-
bers and beat two tall poppies.”
As is the case with most other state
parliaments, the Socialist Left is under


represented in John Cain’s government.
Only two of 18 ministers and just one
third of the state caucus have Socialist
Left allegiances. And, as with NSW, th'e
Victorian left has to contend with an old
guard including bete noire Bill
Hartley who recently lost his battle to be
on the party’s Senate ticket.
It is in South and Western Australia
where the factional lines are beginning
to tighten that the left is making the
greatest inroads and causing most con-
cern to the right.
To explain the change in South Aus-
tralia, left-wingers point to the push by
Premier Bannon and party secretary
Chris Schact to move the party right de-
spite a 30-year tradition on consensus
and sharing of the spoils of office.
The antagonism has been heightened
by Bannon’s refusal to restore the dar-
ling of the left, former attorney-general
Peter Duncan, to the ministry.
Duncan recently secured pre-selec-
tion for the new federal seat of Makin.
Schact had nominated for the position
but he withdrew before the ballot.
The addition of Duncan to the feder-
al caucus is expected to provide the left
in Canberra with a considerable shot in
the arm.
The faction in South Australia now
controls the party’s state executive and
state convention, with about 55 percent
of the vote. Most of the branch’s poli-
cies reflect this and the left believes that
it is close to winning the coveted state
secretaryship. The left’s input to the re-
spective caucuses could be boosted sub-
stantially after the next federal and
South Australian elections.
Antagonism to the national centre
left faction in South Australia almost
matches that in NSW and left-wing
members of parliament see the possibil-
ity of a coalition between left and right
to defeat the centre faction.
A broad left faction is developing for
the first time in Western Australia, re-
placing an informal socialist caucus.
Left-wing president of the Western Aus-
tralian Trades and Labor Council, Clive
Brown also is convenor of this new left
faction. The move to factions was in-
itiated by the national conference be-
cause of concern in the branch that
votes were drifting away from support
for local policies.
Left-winger Carolyn Jacobson, for-
merly of federal Finance Minister John
Dawkins’ staff, recently won pre-selec-
tion for the only new seat to be created
in Western Australia under the recent
electoral redistribution.
The broad left controls the state ad-
ministrative committee and dominates
the branch on the vexed questions of
uranium, visits by nuclear ships and for-
eign affairs. Like their colleagues in
South Australia, members of the broad
left in the west have a strong antipathy
to the centre left but this is tempered by
loyalties to its Labor members such as
Dawkins and Senator Peter Cook.
The ALP in Tasmania is dominated
by the left. It is the only state branch to
have a left-wing secretary, Eugene Alex-
ander. And left-wingers in the Queens-
land branch were encouraged recently
by the election of lan McLean of the
Australian Telecommunications Em-
ployees Association as branch presi-
dent.
With its fresh scalps on its belt, the
left has set about developing a new
strategy for the 1986 national confer-
ence. Policy development has been set
in motion in seven areas and the faction
is trying to develop better co-operation
between states.
No one on the left is suggesting that
it is any closer to the elusive goal of
dominating the conference peak
policymaker for the party but
Hawke’s men clearly will be watching
developments closely. □
POLITICS
The left awaits
its chance to
ambush Hawke
By ALAN REID
OPPOSITION leader Andrew Peacock
may need to do well at the coming gen-
eral election to avoid trouble with his
party, but Prime Minister Bob Hawke is
in the same position. There are those
within the ALP who, once Hawke’s hold
on the mass electorate has loosened,
would destroy him without hesitation.
This section of the party goes in for
doctrinal purity. It does not like
Hawke’s pragmatism or the flexible way
in which he interprets ALP policies
such as his watering down of what they
believe should be a complete ban on
uranium mining and his endorsement of
foreign banks in Australia.
The anti-Hawke elements showed
their teeth openly in the recent ALP pre-
selection ballots in Victoria, bastion of
the anti-Hawke Socialist Left. A can-
didate only had to be identified as a
Hawke Centre Unity supporter to be
marked for the chopper.
Victorian MLC Bill Landeryou, who
contested pre-selection for the new safe
ALP seat of Calwell against MHR Doc-
tor Andrew Theophanous, of the Social-
ist Left, is reputedly Hawke’s most effec-
tive numbers man in Victoria.
Landeryou’s talent for assembling num-
bers did him no good. Theophanous did
him like a dinner.
Similarly, Attorney-General Senator
Gareth Evans lost out when he went
after pre-selection for the new Victorian
seat of Jagajaga, viewed as safe for the
ALP. The Socialist Left supported
MHR Peter Staples whose Diamond
Valley seat was scrapped in the recent
electoral redistribution. Though Evans
has enjoyed national prominence com-
pared with the far lesser-known Staples,
Evans was a Hawke supporter and that
for him was lead in the saddle.
Another Hawke supporter, Bob
Chynoweth, who wanted to swap his
seat of Flinders for the safer new
Dunkley electorate, also failed. The
Dunkley ALP preselection went to the
Socialist Left’s Albert Knowles, a result
which was later reversed by the Federal
executive.
If they did nothing else, the pre-sel-
ection ballots emphasised that the anti-
Hawke group would seek to down
Hawke if it were not for the polls show-
ing that he has mass electorate support
and for the backing he receives from the
right-wing NSW party machine.
For all his weaknesses within his


own party, Hawke is, of course, in a far
stronger position overall than Peacock
is in the Liberal Party. Peacock has to
do reasonably well at the coming elec-
tion. He cannot afford the loss of other
than, say, a single Liberal seat. Any-
thing more than that would spell disas-
ter. To be completely safe he needs to
win sufficient seats to make a Liberal
win at the following election a real pos-
sibility.
Hawke starts in a strong parliamen-
tary position. With the recent electoral
redistribution now completed, he has
the equivalent of a 30-seat majority in
the House of Representatives. He could
afford to lose, say, 10 seats without there
being any real questioning by his ALP
opponents of his electoral appeal. But
once it got beyond 10 it would be mov-
ing towards the magic 16 which would
see the government replaced by a Pea-
cock-led Liberal-National Party coali-
tion. With a majority of 10 or less
Hawke would survive but there would
certainly be further Socialist Left moves
which would do nothing to make
Hawke’s next three years any easier.
Hawke has several worrying elec-
toral problems on his plate. His only
real power base is the NSW ALP ma-
chine, right wing and highly competent
but becoming suspect as the charges of
high-level corruption and the malad-
ministration of justice in that State pro-
liferate and get smellier. These charges
must affect the state government’s
standing to some degree and rub off on
the ALP machine which backs the Wran
government. It is difficult to judge
whether what these charges might prod-
uce would reduce the electoral appeal of
the Hawke-led forces.
There are other niggling things
around. For example, there is the assets
test for pensioners. Some pensioner
groups are apparently considering urg-
ing pensioners to put ALP candidates
last at the coming election. This could
matter in electorates where the contest is
close. Pensioners nowadays are a sig-
nificant section of the voting commu-
nity. Peacock has assured pensioners
that a Liberal-NP government would
withdraw the assets test legislation.
Peacock also thinks there are votes in
the organised crime issue. Though Mrs
Hazel Hawke has disclosed that the
reason the Prime Minister broke down
and cried at a news conference was that
his daughter, Rosslyn, and her husband
were addicted to heroin, Peacock is still
belting the issue. He is doing so despite
the fact that Hawke has given an assur-
ance that nobody will escape the Na-
tional Crime Authority’s attention if
there are grounds for such attention.
Peacock has apparently accepted that
Hawke’s refusal to give Frank Costigan,
QC, an extension of time to pursue in-
vestigations was a product of misjudg-
ment rather than an attempted cover-
up.
But he is keeping the issue of mis-
judment going, though organised crime
and the highly personalised emotional-
ism which surrounds it in the light of the
Prime Minister’s tears and Mrs Hawke’s
revelations make it difficult to judge
whether the issue is a plus or a minus for
Hawke. Peacock clearly regards it as a
minus for the Prime Minister.
Though both Hawke and Peacock
are under pressure to perform well at
the coming election, it is unlikely both
can do so. It is a bit like a boxing match
a drawn event is unlikely.
As the parliament moves into what
could be the final weeks of the 33rd par-
liament, both Hawke and Peacock are
aware that future events could be
shaped by their performances. However
Hawke, according to the polls, is in
a position of strength, and Peacock,
according to the same polls, at this stage
is leaning groggily on the electoral
ropes. □

DRUGS
How a politician’s
family copes with
a heroin tragedy
By BRUCE STANNARD
AMONG the scores of condemnatory
cables Andrew Peacock received fol-
lowing his uncompromising response to
Hazel Hawke’s revelation that her
daughter was seriously ill as a result of
heroin addiction was one which by its
very simplicity struck a deeply personal
and particularly painful note.
“Andrew,” it read, “I am very disap-
pointed in you as a person.” It was
signed, “sincerely, Pauline Unsworth.”
Pauline Unsworth does not need to
be reminded of the anguish and the
grief which heroin causes. Her eldest
son, 20-year-old Anthony, was found
dead in a Penang hotel room
with a puncture mark in one
arm six-and-a-half years ago.
The Malaysian coroner’s ver-
dict, “death by misadven-
ture,” could scarcely disguise
the truth. Anthony had died
as a result of an overdose.
Today, while a good many
Australians are left wondering
how it is that heroin has
managed to penetrate the very
heart of Australia’s most
prominent political family,
the Unsworths’ own story
focuses a particularly harsh
spotlight on the way in which
politicians’ unrelenting public
lives are often lived at the ex-
pense of their families. Barrie
Unsworth, a long-time close
associate of Prime Minister
Bob Hawke, former secretary
of the NSW Labor Council
and a member of the ACTU
executive and the NSW Min-
ister for Transport, shoulders
much of the blame for what
happened to his son.
“I know I’ve got to cop at
least some of the blame for
what happened to Anthony,”
he said.
“I’m still agonising over
that. I look back and now I
can see the times when I
should have been with him
school speech nights and
footy training. But I was con-
fronted with a choice. Would
I go to a political meeting or a
union meeting or would I
come home to Anthony? In-
variably, it was my family that
missed out.
“Since then, I’ve had all sorts of
people including politicians and
trades union leaders who have come
tp me with similar problems and I’ve
told them they have to weigh the choice
very carefully and give more consider-
ation to their family.
“I have four children. That my eldest
son is dead doesn’t mean I don’t have
obligations to my daughter and to my
two other sons.
“I’ve tried to change my lifestyle.
I’ve had to learn to say NO to people.
You’ve got to work out whether you’re
on a big ego trip or whether you’ve
really got a requirement to do some-
thing. When you’re younger, you fre-
quently find yourself on an ego trip
which you’re satisfying by accepting
commitments all over the place to the
detriment of your own family.
“This is not something unique to
politicians or union officials. It applies
across the board, to sporting men, to
men and women in all walks of life.”
On Monday, September 24, Mrs
Barrie and Pauline Unsworth: the pain persists
ERNIE McQUILLAN
Hawke appeared on the television pro-
gram Terry Willesee Tonight and dis-
closed that Rosslyn, 23, and her hus-
band Matt Dillon both had heroin prob-
lems. This, she said, was the reason for
the Prime Minister’s tears at a Canberra
press conference on September 20.
Mrs Hawke said she made the ap-
pearance at the couple’s request because
of innuendo which had surrounded her
elder daughter, Susan.
“My daughter and her husband have
been confronted with the fact that there
was extensive tissue degeneration and
some wastage of the lower limbs and a
shortened life expectancy to the extent
of just a few years,” she said. “And she
is a young woman anyway, with a very
young family. That, coupled with the
distress of the time in which we got that
information, was shocking ... quite
devastating.”
But, she added, she and the Prime
Minister had carried on with their pub-
lic duties.
“We fronted up at official functions
and did all the things that are
necessary,” she said, “but our
hearts were breaking. It is
pretty hard stuff to absorb and
accept on medical evidence
and somehow carry it under-
neath.”
Heroin has also touched
the family of Senator John
Button. His son David died of
a heroin overdose at the age
of 19, in May 1982. Button
declined to comment except
to say that he wished to keep
his grief “a personal and pri-
vate matter.”
Pauline Unsworth recalls
the bitterness, the anger and
the blazing rows she and her
husband had as they both
grieved for their lost son.
“Barrie’s being so busy and
away from home so much did
contribute to Anthony’s drug
problem,” she said, “but I
think we’ve both come to
terms with that now.
“I think we can both see
where mistakes were made.
People aren’t meant to lead
the sort of lives politicians
and trade union leaders and
others endure and in turn in-
flict on their families. I think
my sub-conscious understood
what was happening but I’m
afraid I was too frightened to
face it. I always had this really
scary feeling about Anthony.
“I remember going to his
room and holding his hand
and saying just that: ‘l’m
really scared for you, son.’ He
said: ‘Mum, you’ve always
taught me to care for other

one else.’ You see, that was an
admission a confession
and yet, even then, I didn’t al-
low it to sink in fully.”
These days, Barrie Uns-
worth tries to spend as much
time as possible with his fam-
ily. “Most politicians,” he said
“and I’m talking about men
and women on both sides
do burn themselves out to the
detriment of their families.
“It is an especially danger-
ous problem for members of
the national parliament. There are enor-
mous family pressures involved in going
to Canberra three and four nights a
week.
“Quite apart from the impact on the
children, you see so many marriage
break-ups in politics because of the sep-
aration and involvement outside home.
“Blaming yourself doesn’t do much
to ease the pain of loss. It doesn’t help
resolve the grief you suffer. Life is all
about choices and, looking back on my
own life, I’m glad I’ve had my involve-
ment with the trade union movement.
I’m glad I’m in politics.
“I chose to be involved in these
things, so I accept the responsibilities
that go with them. But there are things
you can do to minimise their impact on
your family. I regret very deeply that my
eldest son was 20 before I came to that
realisation.
“A lot of people who have never had
to confront drug addiction within their
own families must find it hard to believe
that such a thing can exist undetected
right under their very noses. But, believe
me, it happens. Looking back now it’s
not too hard to see things which should
have had relevance.
“A year before he died, Anthony
contracted hepatitis. Now, with the ben-
efit of hindsight, we can say with some
certainty that that was the result of dirty
needles. We should have known and yet
you tend not to want to think the worst
of your kids. You give them the benefit
of the doubt. You trust them. You hope
that they won’t let you down. It comes
as a terrible shock when you uncover
what’s really been going on.
“Strange people would ring up at all
hours. One minute the kid is in the
house and the next he’s dashing out,
only to come back in a little while.
Anthony did and we suspect now that
he was probably going out to score.
“We believe Anthony started by
smoking cannabis at school.
You can get into a lot of argu-
ments about this. People say
smoking pot doesn’t do you
any harm. Maybe it doesn’t.
But the point is that, if it leads
on to something heavier
like heroin then, obviously,
it does a great deal of harm.
“From what I can make
out, my son progressed from
cannabis to heroin and died
as a result.”
Unsworth said both he and
his wife had been appalled at
the attitude adopted by Peacock and his
deputy, John Howard, after Mrs Hawke
had gone on television to explain her
daughter Rosslyn’s addiction. “They are
parents,” he said, “and they should
realise that nobody and I don’t care
who it is is immune from the risk of
drug addiction.
“That’s how insidious this filthy busi-
ness has become in our society. And, if
it happened to their children, they
would grieve for their kids just the same
way Bob Hawke grieves for his daugh-
ter and I grieve for my son.
“Politics is a tough game and
Hawkey has never asked for any quarter
and nor has he given any. I know the
man’s mettle and, believe me, he does
not have a glass jaw. Sure, there are a
couple of things that have impacted
upon him. He is entitled to be emotional

Take a close look at the standards offered
in Australia's luxury car market.
The fact is for all their high price tags, a lot
of so-called luxury cars offer you relatively few
standard features.
Toyota Crown is one of the very few cars
offering a complete set of standards.
Crown's engineering standards include
an advanced 2.8 Super Responsive engine
with electronic fuel injection,
4 wheel disc brakes, full-frame
chassis, vehicle speed sensitised
power steering and fully independent rearsus-
pension with trailing arms.
Inside Crown pampers you with power
windows, air conditioning, moquette cloth
seating, telescopic steering column, even a
small refrigerator to keep drinks cool.
SUPER RESPONSIVE
They're all, along with many other fea-
tures far too numerous to describe here, stan-
dard on the new Toyota Crown.
Yet on some "luxury cars" such basic
standards as air conditioning and power win-
dows are add-on options at extra cost.
No matter how much you're prepared to
pay for a luxury car, you'll usually find Crown
offers a comparable list of standard luxury.
So consider Toyota Crown alongside any
luxury car you can think of. When it comes to
standard luxury, we're sure Crown will
compare very comfortably indeed.

emotional about his own child. Hawke
has shown a compassion which is un-
fortunately absent in a lot of politicians
who seem to be plastic people.
“Hawke is now demonstrated to be a
compassionate, humane person. They
are characteristics I believe a lot of Aus-
tralians are looking for. Leaving all that
aside, he is still by far the best politician
we’ve got in Australia today and people
like Peacock and Howard who try to
score off him do themselves and the pol-
itical process a great disservice.
“I’m down there in NSW parliament,
which is hardly a Sunday school picnic.
It’s expected that in politics that you
will use invective, you will argue and be
. devious, but there is a line beyond
which you should not go. No one in
politics is entitled to take advantage of a
person’s commitment to their own fam-
ily and that’s what Peacock and How-
ard in their desperation are trying to do.
“There are lessons for all of us out of
the events of the past week and it’s in-
cumbent particularly on politicians to
recognise that they’ve just got to strike a
balance. We have been watching the de-
velopment of a crisis in the life of the
leading politicians in the land. All other
politicians must therefore look in the
mirror to see whether the same
possibilities don’t exist for themselves.”
Pauline Unsworth had the final
word. “It doesn’t matter who you are
out there,” she said. “It doesn’t matter
where you’ve come from or where
you’re headed. Heroin is all-pervasive
and anyone can be caught up in it.
“It can happen to anyone, even the
daughter of a prime minister. That’s the
lesson for all Australians.” □

LAND RIGHTS
WA decision
a blow to
Aboriginal hopes
By TIM DUNCAN
THE FEDERAL government will have
to revise drastically its position on uni-
form land rights following the decision
of the Western Australian government
not to accept the recommendation of
the Seaman inquiry that Aborigines
should control mining and exploration
on land granted to them under future
WA legislation.
For Clyde Holding, federal Minister
for Aboriginal Affairs, Aboriginal con-
trol over mining on Aboriginal land has
been the central principle around which
uniform legislation would be written.
The principle was reaffirmed in a letter
to The Bulletin from the departmental
head of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles
Perkins, as recently as a month ago.
Yet there were signs in Canberra as
well as in Perth that Holding was be-
coming increasingly isolated and that
the pullback on land rights, which had
withstood all criticism since the Wood-
ward inquiry brought down its report in
1974, was now an undeniable fact. It
remains to be seen how Holding, whose
approach to his portfolio has raised the
expectations of Aboriginal communities
well beyond what an electorally sensi-
tive government could satisfy, will
handle the inevitable Aboriginal back-
lash.
What the WA government has done,
in effect, is to provide the federal gov-
ernment with a new and lower common
denominator around which to approach
land rights legislation. Over the past few
weeks, confidential and top-level dis-
cussions between senior representatives
of the mining industry, Prime Minister
Bob Hawke’s staff and Hawke himself


have been taking place. The
discussions have centred on
the idea of giving, in prin-
ciple, federal support to the
WA move to protect the
mining industry from Abor-
iginal vetoes.
It is understood that repre-
sentatives from Australia’s
largest mining houses, inclu-
ding CRA, WMC and BHP,
have been involved in the dis-
cussions with Hawke. Hold-
ing has been kept in the pic-
ture but has not been at all the
meetings. The discussions are
still at an extremely early
stage and cabinet has been un-
able to formulate a new pos-
ition on land rights despite its
addressing the issue for two
days last week.
It is understood, from
highly-placed mining industry
sources, that Hawke has been
presented with the choice of
ceding the veto rights or
facing the wrath of the mining
industry and electors.
WA Premier Brian Burke
has been arguing that the
mining industry case for
“equal rights” is now so popu-
lar in Western Australia that
all effort in Canberra should
be made to ensure that the
campaign run by the Cham-
ber of Mines of Western Aus-
tralia should cease.
Burke has been reinforced
by federal Labor members
from WA. According to a WA
party source, polls there have shown
that the land rights issue might result in
a 6 percent swing against a government
which supported the Holding prin-
ciples. Two federal seats would immedi-
ately be at risk and two more in urban
areas would be doubtful. As well,
Labor’s hopes in at least one Senate
vacancy would be in doubt.
The electoral prospects of the Burke
government also would be threatened.
It goes to the polls probably before June
next year and, with the land rights ques-
tion unresolved due to possible uniform
land rights legislation on the books in
Canberra, it would risk both a nasty
single-issue campaign and certain elec-
toral damage.
Hawke has come under great inter-
nal party pressure to facilitate some
agreement between the Australian
Labor Party and the mining industry.
His role has been to try to persuade the
industry to cease its spectacularly suc-
cessful public relations campaign in
Western Australia. The industry, feeling
that people were listening to it for the
first time in 10 years, is considering ex-
tending the campaign Australia-wide
Department head Charles Perkins: reaffirmed principle
Minister Clyde Holding
Premier Brian Burke
during the forthcoming national elec-
tion.
It is understood that the only con-
cession that would persuade the indus-
try to call off the campaign is the obvi-
ous one of the government refusing to
grant Aboriginal rights of veto over ex-
ploration or mining. Since the Burke
government has made public its inten-
tion not to grant such vetoes as part of
any state land rights package, either
uniform national land rights legislation
goes out the window or the benchmark
for uniform legislation becomes the
watered-down package.
The Canberra discussions are at an
extremely early stage and how much of
the Holding approach will survive is not
yet apparent. So far, Holding is still in
charge of the information flow. Minor
leaks of cabinet discussions last week
concerned the obvious sticking point of
the machinery required to resolve dis-
putes over sacred sites in the absence of
the automatic veto. The South Austra-
lian model, which relies more on arbi-
tration than on an automatic veto, has
suddenly been resuscitated.
However, it is unlikely that such a
model will be acceptable to
the Burke government or to
the mining industry. As the
miners see it, the South Aus-
tralian approach looks in-
teresting in principle but is
unworkable in practice. They
refer to the pre-eminent role it
gives to imaginative lawyers
acting on behalf of Aboriginal
groups and to the prejudged
nature of the bargaining
involved in such arbitration.
As the Burke government sees
it, however, there is no need
for uniform legislation.
It is remarkable how
quickly the language of the
land rights discussion has
changed. As late as February
this year, the bipartisan ap-
proach that has dominated the
issue since the Fraser govern-
ment introduced its Northern
Territory legislation in 1976
still survived. The first to
crack were the Liberals who
had brought down both the
pioneering 1976 legislation
and the landmark Pitjan-
jatjara Act in South Australia.
Then followed the Northern
Territory government which
released details of the disas-
trous decline of mineral ex-
ploration in the Territory
ascribed wholly to the 1976
legislation. The Territory ex-
perience apparently was
strongly in the minds of the
prime ministerial staff during
Canberra discussions.
Holding’s principles, formally de-
livered to parliament on December 8
last year, included these positions in
the main derived from the Woodward
inquiry:
■ Aboriginal land should be held
under inalienable freehold title.
■ Sacred sites should be protected.
■ Aborigines should control mining
on their land.
■ Aborigines should have access to
mine royalties.
■ Compensation for lost land.
“Inalienable title” has already been
changed to “secure title” in the 1984
ALP platform. Burke has flatly denied
that Aborigines should control mining
on their land, he has asserted that con-
trol of royalty payments will remain the
prerogative of the state government and
that Western Australia is not interested
in responding to general compensation
claims for dispossession. That makes
four principles out of five which West-
ern Australia does not recognise and
makes a mockery of the claim that the
states are falling into line.
It only remains for federal cabinet to
state the obvious. □


PUBLIC OPINION
Governments
hang on in
four states
THE GOVERNMENTS of South Aus-
tralia, Western Australia, Tasmania and
Queensland all would have been re-
turned with the aid of preferences in
the case of the northern state had
elections been held at the end of August,
the latest Morgan Gallup Poll finds.
Support for the Australian Labor
Party was down in SA and WA but it
was still ahead in both states, more so in
the former.
Support had increased for the ruling
National Party in Queensland, as it had
for the Liberal government of Tas-
mania.
The poll finds that the SA govern-
ment would have been returned easily
although its support was down 2 percent
to 51 and that of the Liberals up 2to 38.
The SA figures come from interview-
ing 771 electors throughout the state in
July and August. They were asked
which party would receive their first
preference “if a state election were be-
ing held today.”
Five percent did not state a pref-
erence.
The following table compares the
latest results with previous Morgan
Gallup Polls and with the November
1982 election result.

BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR
Calibre up as deadline nears
Christine Gee: adventures in business are paying off
KEVIN BROWN
June Anderson: a prisoner in the financial world
By GLENNYS BELL
THE SEARCH for the 1985 Bulletin-
Qantas Business Woman of the Year
closes on Wednesday, October 10.
There is still time to nominate the
woman who can join former award-
winners Eve Mahlab, Carla Zampatti,
Pat Lovell and Hinke Haisma as the
business woman whose achievements
rank her as an outstanding success.
Nominations received this year con-
tinue the high calibre of previous candi-
dates. They include women who have
started their own businesses, as well as
those who have reached high positions
in the corporate world.
WHEN CHRISTINE GEE and her
partner Goronwy Price started Austra-
lian Himalayan Expeditions, in 1975,
the travel industry was not very interest-
ed. “Everyone thought we were just a
couple of hippies,” says Gee. Not so
today. Many in the industry want to be
associated with the adventure travel
company with a yearly turnover of $4.5
million.
The company has firmly established
its trek record in Australia. It took 10
people to Mount Everest in its first year.
Now it offers camping in Mongolia,
cycling tours of China and Japan, surf
and sun in the Maldives, as well as bal-
looning, horse-riding, rafting and
mountain climbing everything from
Everest to a weekend in the Australian
countryside. Between 6000 and 7000
people a year take adventure holidays
with Australian Himalayan Expedi-
tions.
Gee and Price themselves took the
first adventurers on holiday; today, they
have 25 full-time employees and 100
tour leaders who work up to nine
months a year. The company’s annual
growth has been about 30 percent and it
is looking to new frontiers.
First on the list is the American mar-
ket. Gee has spent the past year travel-
ling across the United States and in-
vestigating the possibilities of challeng-
ing Americans on their own ground by
offering them adventure holidays both
at home and abroad.
The company has been represented
in the US but will open an office in Cali-
fornia next January.
Gee says: “There’s a great interest
particularly in our camel outback sa-
fari, sailing on the Whitsunday Passage
or holidaying on the Great Barrier Reef.
What we had to do was work out the
costs from the American side and see
whether it would fit into our budget.”
She expects about 2000 Americans to
take adventure holidays worldwide with
the company next year and predicts a
growth rate of 30 to 40 percent. She be-
lieves the potential is unlimited.
The company this year doubled the
number of its Australian outdoor hol-
idays. It already had offices or represen-
tatives in all Australian capitals in Port
Moresby, Auckland, Singapore and
Hong Kong and an office in Nepal to
ensure control over its treks in the
Himalayas. It also liaises with British
and Japanese travel companies on
Nepal treks.
It is a long way from the days when
Gee and Price were advertising a trip to
Everest on the campuses of Sydney Uni-
versity and the Australian National
University in Canberra.
Gee graduated from the ANU and
went to work in a travel agency in Can-
berra where she realised that “I didn’t
want to be an employee forever, without


any real control over my working life.”
Her meeting with Price, a Welsh
mountaineer, was a fortuitous one. They
formed a partnership to help travellers
escape the “tinted tourist bus windows”
but the two discovered that they had
more in common than travel. Their
partnership in business became one in
marriage and they have a son, Nima,
aged five.
“If you look at the stresses and
strains of modern life, the potential for
the adventure holiday is unlimited,”
says Gee. “People are seeking genuine
escapes and the conventional holidays
they are offered are often dreary and
dull.
“We offer a holiday that is good for
them.
“There is so much that is impersonal
and alienating about life that the pros-
pect of a holiday with a small group of
people, with an element of the unpre-
dictable, is challenging.”
Many of the travellers are people
who have never slept in a tent before.
Gee says: “/’m not a natural athlete; I
like to use a hair dryer; I like my com-
forts and being clean. We do say to
people, ‘lt’s not Everest after breakfast.’
In fact, we’ve just had some travel
agents on one of our Himalayan hol-
idays: They are Hilton hotel people but
even they said they felt pampered.”
About one-third of their clients each
year are renewals. “Sometimes they
start with a weekend, ballooning or
trekking, and get a taste for adventure
travel.”
AS CONTROLLER of Amatil Ltd,
June Anderson is one of Australia’s top
women financial executives. Her res-
ponsibilities include formulating group
accounting policies; consolidating ac-
counts, cash and profit budgets and
forecasting and all main board report-
ing and control of all divisional chief
accountants and group accountants.
She also sees that the company complies
with regulatory bodies such as the Tax-
ation Office and stock exchange.
Anderson was appointed controller
last year, having started her career with
BHP in Newcastle as a clerk-stenogra-
pher. She had wanted to go to university
but forces were against her in 1945
when she matriculated. It was a difficult
time for her family and many returned
servicemen were going into the un-
iversities, making it hard for her to gain
a place.
She became an accountant more or
less by chance: “The family moved to
Melbourne and we just happened to live
opposite an accountant and, because I
enjoyed figures, I started to become in-
terested,” she says.
She began with correspondence
courses and eventually joined the ac-
counting firm Wilson, Danby & Giddy

as an audit clerk, staying there from
1949 to 1955. Then she went to D. W.
Paterson Co as a secretary/accountant,
which turned out to be a turning point
in her life.
British Tobacco took that company
over in 1960 and formed a southern re-
gion office by amalgamating four print-
ing companies also acquired. Anderson
was supervisor, with accounting and
special duties with the office from 1964
to 1967 before transferring to Sydney as
assistant accountant operations for Brit-
ish Tobacco which became Amatil. She
was appointed assistant controller in
1976.
Her responsibilities had expanded
along with the company. British Tobac-
co’s assets were valued at $lB2 million
when she joined. With diversification
into companies involved in soft drinks,
snack foods, pastoral holdings, poultry
and meat, its assets have grown to $754
million.
Anderson looks back on steady pro-
gress. “It was difficult at the time I
started studying accountancy, certainly
not as common as it is now for women
... I was fortunate that everyone
encouraged me and I never encountered
any real problems as a woman,” she
says.
But she had not envisaged reaching
the position she holds: “I’ve taken
everything step by step.” She did con-
sider going into private practice at one
stage but “I’m glad I didn’t. The job I
have now is far more interesting and de-
manding than any small practice.”
Busy though she is, Anderson finds
that she is becoming more and more
involved in her profession. She is active
in the Australian Society of Account-
ants, as a member of its commerce and
industry committee.
Anderson is also a member repre-
senting Amatil at Group of 100 meet-
ings, involving accountants from the
top 100 companies in Australia. It is
predominantly, though not exclusively,
a male group.
The number of women in accounting
is increasing but Anderson was a pion-
eer the first to go into Amatil and
make headway but not the last. “The
younger women these days have much
greater ambition,” she says.
She has helped prove that women
can move up the executive ladder but
Anderson is not a great believer in the
women’s movement: “I’ve never quite
believed in women’s groups because I
think they should be part of the main
body and participate, rather than form
their own special groups,” she says.
She does, however, have one regret:
“I’m sorry I didn’t reach my position
earlier. I wish I could go back 10 years
and then maybe I would have a chance
at a directorship. Now, I’m afraid I
might be too old.” □

Sunny weather. Cloudy weather. Wet weather.
Warm weather. In fact any weather is good
weather to drink Krondorf Chablis.
If you prefer a drier white wine than riesling
look for an opportunity to try it.
Naturally Krondorf Chablis is also full bodied
and crisp, but like all authentic chablis it’s main
characteristic is dryness.
So the next time you have to order the wine
and don’t want to appear as though you came down
in the last shower, ask for KRONDORF CHABLIS

The car above is the latest
Jaguar.
In our opinion, this Jaguar is
the best Jaguar ever made.
And also represents the best
value ever offered in luxury cars.
With due regard to the
memorable Jaguars of the past,
these are not statements we make
lightly.
Life with a new Jaguar begins
at around $48,450*.
To put this price into
perspective, try to think of any
other automobile which offers
Jaguar’s level of luxury,
refinement and equipment and
doesn’t cost at least ten thousand
dollars more.
You can delete the Mercedes
280 SE which, in our opinion, is
the nearest comparable
Mercedes.
That comes in at around
$61,525**.
You can also disregard the
BMW 735 i at around $59,500**.
In fact, whatever you look at,
you’ll still find the Jaguar XJ6 is
streets ahead.
The question is, how is it
possible for the best to be made
for less?
Involvement builds better cars,
more efficiently.
Three years ago, when John
Egan took over as Chairman and
Chief Executive of Jaguar cars,
the automobile industry thought
that technology was the sole
solution to all its problems.
John Egan disagreed.
“The best, most sophisticated
machines in the world will not
make memorable cars,” he argued,
“if the men who operate them do
not have pride in what they do.”
Then, while Jaguar invested
millions in re-tooling, John Egan
began asking the people who
actually build the cars for their
thoughts on ways of making
better Jaguars.
His office was flooded with
ideas and proposals, many of
which were acted upon
immediately.
Ever since then, once a month
the staff meet with management
and continue to find better ways
of doing things.
The result, again, is best
summed up by John Egan himself.
“Productivity has doubled with
no increase - in fact a decrease -
in workforce.”
“Naturally, the
unit cost is less.”
The best Jaguar ever
made gives you the best
of everything.
While the Jaguar
XJ6 embodies
excellence of con-
struction and superb
value, its traditional
virtues should not
be overlooked
It gives you a
unique combination
of looks, perform-
ance, comfort and
peace-of-mind that
is not equalled by
other cars.
It is the only
current model to be included
among the ten most beautiful cars
of all time in a survey conducted
by “Car and Driver” magazine.
It is also considered to have
the best ride in the world.
And, in Mastercare, the best
warranty and maintenance
programme.
The Jaguar XJ6 carries a
warranty valid for two years or
40,000 km, whichever comes first.
Furthermore, Jaguar
undertakes to pay the labour and
genuine Jaguar replacement part
costs of regular maintenance as
set out in the owner’s handbook
for three years or 40,000 km.
whichever comes first.
Whether you buy a Jaguar at
$48,450,* or opt for the more luxu-
rious Jaguar Sovereign ,Vanden
Plas, or XJS-HE, the value for
money is no less apparent.
Call your nearest Jaguar
Rover dealer and arrange to test
drive the best Jaguar ever made.
It could be the best decision
you ever made.

CONSERVATION
Daintree under
threat with new
CSIRO budget
An experiment in regenerating rainforest on the Atherton Tablelands in progress
By FIA CUMMING
THE ONLY research project which can
provide precise information about
rainforest ecology essential to future
conservation attempts is being wound
down. The research group at
Atherton, behind Cairns, has
a high international reputa-
tion but is a victim of federal
budget funding cuts to the
CSIRO.
Home Affairs and En-
vironment Minister Barry
Cohen was unaware of the
cuts until told by The Bulletin.
Nonetheless, Cohen is not the
“traitor” that many ill-in-
formed conservationists be-
lieve after his announcement
that he would not move to
nominate the Daintree wilder-
ness for the World Heritage
listing without agreement
from the Queensland govern-
ment. Without solid scientific
evidence, not yet available,
the federal government prob-
ably would have lost a High
Court challenge by Queens-
land had it tried to intervene.
For the head of the
CSIRO’s Forest Research
Division, Dr Joe Landsberg,
the fate of the Atherton re-
search laboratory at a time of
maximum public interest in
rainforests is only one of the
ironies following from the budget cut.
Like the rest of CSIRO, the division is
trying to keep its expert staff despite the
3 percent drop in funds nearly 10 per-
cent in real terms and this means cut-
ting projects wherever possible. The
rainforest research at Atherton is an ex-
pensive CSIRO operation because it re-
quires tedious, painstaking field obser-
vations over many years. This is the
only way of learning how the forest
grows and, in particular, how it is
effected by disruption and the creation
of gaps such as a road.
However, the team of six scientists
CSIRO scientists studying reproduction in rainforest trees
plus support staff is regarded as the only
effective rainforest research group in
Australia and probably the best in the
world not so much because of the
quality of its work, Landsberg says, but
simply because there is nowhere else
with wet tropical rainforest, decent lab-
oratory facilities and a stable political
situation which allows continuous work
by experienced staff. As rainforests are
becoming a major international con-
cern, the CSIRO has encouraged a flow
of overseas visitors to admire the
Atherton project.
The first thing to go post-budget has
been trips to distant research plots, in
areas such as the Daintree wilderness.
Next will be staff: If a position becomes
vacant, it will not be filled. Plans to ex-
pand the laboratory have been
postponed indefinitely. This is the third
consecutive year the division has been
cut back and Landsberg says that he will
have to consider closing Atherton if it
happens once more.
The CSIRO forest division and the
Queensland department more or less
agree that representative areas of all
remaining types of rainforest must be
preserved undisturbed. The Cape Tribu-
lation to Bloomfield stretch where the
road has been built was the largest
single patch of undisturbed rainforest in
the wet tropic region.
But scientists cannot make definitive
statements on the rainforest and the
need to preserve it because they do not
have enough information. The Queens-
land department claims a certain
amount of careful logging of
certain trees does no real
harm and that the forest re-
covers quickly.
The fundamental question
in the fight against the road
from Cape Tribulation was
whether it would cause real
and permanent damage to the
surrounding rainforest. Many
conservationists say yes but
the issue is not addressed at
all by the report to the Austra-
lian Heritage Commission
which recommended World
Heritage listing for the area.
Landsberg says no one
knows. With a narrow road,
he says, the main danger is
probably mud washing off it
into the water and killing the
coral. A tarmac road would
change the immediate stretch
through the forest but it may
or may not threaten the forest
as a whole 10 or 100 years on.
The present mud road cre-
ates a continuous edge where
the conditions for plants are
modified. The canopy of foli-
age is broken so some plants
will die in the sunlight, others

A sure cure
for the problem of
information
bottleneck.
Programming backlog is the source
of the problem. Eliminate it, and you
eliminate the bottleneck.
Which is precisely what Sperry
has done with the MAPPER®
System.
With MAPPER, you work with
the computer directly. You ask
questions in plain English. And you
get immediate answers.
And if the information you get
raises other questions, you can ask
them right away. With no delay for
programming. Or reprogramming.
MAPPER is that powerful. It
allows you to manipulate information
in almost any way you want. And,
interesting to note, it can even help
your programmers become more
productive.
AN AFFORDABLE SYSTEM.
You don’t have to be a large company
to have a MAPPER System.
MAPPER can be scaled to the real
and present needs of just about any
size company. The cost of a
MAPPER System makes it practical
for even a department within a
company to own its own system.
Or you can time-share through a
MAPPER service bureau.
What you get for your money is a
whole new order of efficiency in
your day-to-day management tasks.
Because you’ll have the information
you need right at your fingertips.
Literally.
SEEING IS BELIEVING.
We’ve made some promises here
that may sound extravagant. But if
anything, our claims are on the

will prosper and the forest will be
changed. But, if the roof remains rela-
tively intact, it can be argued that the
road would not cause substantial
change particularly if traffic were
minimal and weather good.
In a court of law, Landsberg says the
arguments would be reduced to opinion
rather than information. To withstand a
High Court challenge over the use of its
powers under the World Heritage Prop-
erties Conservation Act, the federal
government would have to prove that
the road would cause irreparable dam-
age to the wilderness area which
Landsberg says would be impossible
given current scientific knowledge.
Cohen really made the government
decison on the Daintree 12 months ago
when he received legal advice from his
department and the Attorney-General’s
on this point. The advisors had been
involved with drafting the World Heri-
tage Act and preparing the successful
federal case in the High Court battle
with Tasmania over the Franklin River
dam last year. Their advice was that the
Cape Tribulation road was a quite
different matter and the federal govern-
ment would be likely to lose if
challenged by Queensland.
Cohen told The Bulletin : “We talked
it over and it’s a matter of judgment
what we think the High Court is likely
to rule. The judgment on the Franklin
was four-three it was nip and tuck,
obviously. I thought we would lose
then. But that’s been interpreted by a lot
of people as saying anything that hap-
pens in a World Heritage Area can be
prohibited. That’s nonsense.”
Cohen points out that 165 places are
on the heritage list and they include the
centre of Rome, the City of Jerusalem
and the Florida Everglades. Roads,
tourists and other activities are not con-
sidered to harm these areas.
Cohen believes an injunction from
Queensland would have arrived the
next day if he had moved to identify the
Daintree as a World Heritage area. And
had he gone to the High Court and lost,
he argues, there would have been no
hope of saving the forest from further
development or of saving other areas
possibly even more important.
Instead, Cohen proposes to work
with Queensland to develop a plan of
management for the whole wet tropics
of its north-east, including the Daintree
rainforest. He believes that the Bjelke-
Petersen government will co-operate,
tempted by federal money and help
with no strings attached.
Cohen envisaged that the plan would
specify areas for particular commercial
activities, tourism in varying degrees,
scientific research and areas to be left
untouched. A similar plan operates suc-
cessfully on the Great Barrier Reef,
under joint state and federal manage-
ment. Cohen says he has not yet had a
positive or negative response from
Queensland but expects something soon.
Assuming Queensland came to the
party, a plan of management could be
in operation in at least priority zones of
the wet tropics such as the Daintree
within two years. “I am sure that I will
get more progress within 18 months this
way than by an all-out brawl with
Queensland,” says Cohen.
While admitting that the government
wanted to avoid such an unpleasant
Last year’s Bulletin-Quelltaler Estate Award winner Gay Bilson with her state award
brawl, Cohen was emphatic that he
would have made the same decision
after the coming election.
He adds: “The people of Tasmania
did not exactly endorse the way we
handled the Franklin dam. We hold not
one seat in Tasmania and the state gov-
ernment, which was Labor for 40 years,
changed hands. With that in mind,
people (in the government) were asking
what would happen if we did the same
thing in Queensland. But imagine how
much worse it would be if we LOST the
High Court case, which was a fair bet.”
The strength of Cohen’s arguments is
reflected in caucus and cabinet having
supported his proposal unanimously.
He had discussed the issue with them at
countless meetings over the past 11
months and the only way he could get
their support was to ensure every fac-
tion that the fight for the rainforests
would continue.
If Queensland decides in favor of
World Heritage nomination, it will be at
least two years before the wet tropics
area is placed on the list. The CSIRO
Forest Research Division would like
five years or preferably 10 to establish
just how much the amazingly intricate
forest ecosystem can bear and how it
should be managed.
Cohen has not visited the Daintree
rainforest, although he had flown over it
in a VIP plane and he wants to see it at
closer range. One step Cohen could take
unilaterally to help preserve the forest
heritage is to take a guided tour with the
experts from Atherton and leave behind
a generous tip. □
RESTAURANT AWARD
The quest for
the best is
on again
THE QUEST for Australia’s best res-
taurants is under way again. For the
fourth successive year Quelltaler Estate
and The Bulletin are collaborating in
this unique contest, one in which the
nominations come not from the proud
proprietors of the restaurants but from
readers of The Bulletin. The main aim of
the awards is to provide a service for
lovers of good fine and wine to prod-
uce a national guide to good eating. So
it is essential that supporters of im-
provement in standards contribute by
nominating the restaurants they think
earn the accolade of “best.”
Awards will be made in six
categories. They are:

All readers of The Bulletin are warm-

In this issue the coupon is on page 51. It

State winners will be selected from
your choices. From the list of state win-
ners the national winners will be selec-
ted.
The national winners will be judged
by a panel headed by The Bulletin’s Cel-
larmaster, Len Evans.
The judging process will be:
From the entries submitted lists will
be drawn up of the most popular res-
taurants in the various categories. These
restaurants will be examined by Evans
or by other impartial wine and food ex-
perts.
They will visit the restaurants incog-
nito, thus ensuring that the proprietors
do not give the judges special service. In
any case, as Evans points out, a restaur-
ant can only do the best it can do.
The idea of using reader participa-
tion to produce a listing of the top res-
taurants is based on an excellent guide
produced in Britain.
Without reader participation an up-
to-date national guide to quality in res-
taurants in Australia would be a huge,
costly almost impossible undertaking.
But reader participation also is import-
ant because not even our esteemed
judges would claim to have a monopoly
on good taste.
Without your selections and com-
ments judging the best in Australia
would keep a team of tasters employed
full time simply because of the amaz-
ing number of high quality restaurants
offering a bewildering diversity of foods
that has opened throughout Australia in
recent times, often in the most unlikely
suburbs and out-of-the-way-towns and
cities.
We want nominations to come from
all parts of Australia and will rely on
better-travelled readers to break down
any tendency to state or city chauvinism
in the nominations.
Winners of the Best Restaurant
Awards will be published in The Bul-
letin on January 8, 1985.
The national winners will be pre-
sented with their awards at a dinner
hosted by Quelltaler Estate, The Bulletin
and Len Evans.
We hope you will send in thousands
of nominations and that this prestigious
award will spur restaurateurs to even
better efforts. Undoubtedly Australia’s
restaurants have improved greatly over
the past 25 years but there must always
be room for more improvement. □
CHESS
Anklebiters’ title
by Terrey Shaw
UNTIL recently chess was one of the
few remaining refuges where embattled
parents could rely on a temporary res-
pite from the worries of the world, away
from the demands of the anklebiters.
Now even this oasis is disappearing.
Some misguided officials have in-
troduced a world championship for
under-14-year-olds which has had the
unfortunate effect of encouraging
youngsters to take up the game.
This event took place in Argentina
last month. Urged on by proud fathers
and a packed spectator gallery, 18 chil-
dren from 15 countries competed.
Australia’s representative was 12-
year-old Shane Hill, a Cranbrook
schoolboy from Sydney, who got there
thanks largely to a free return ticket to
Los Angeles from Qantas. Shane fin-
ished a creditable fourth, two points be-
hind the winner, Luis Fabrega, 13, a
cool and quietly confident Spaniard.
The youngest entrant was a courageous
eight-year-old from Colombia, who ac-
tually twice refused a draw against vet-
eran grandmaster Miguel Najdorf in a
simultaneous exhibition against all
competitors.
This exciting king hunt played re-
cently against fellow Sydney junior Tim
Reilly is a good example of Shane’s
prowess.

Westpac
turns two.
Banks have never been famous for
being modern or innovative. But
during the past year, one Bank has
managed to send quite a few shockwaves
through the industry, bythesheerspeed
at which it is progressing.
That bank is Westpac, and according
to its own Managing Director, Mr. Bob
White. ‘‘We’ve been surprised at the
speed with which the merger settled
down. We expected it would take probably


3 years, but as we approach our second
birthday, I'm confident we’ve achieved
this with a great deal more speed than
would otherwise have been the case ..
This month, as Westpac celebrates
its second year of operation, Mr. White
isn’t the only one within the organisation
who is surprised at the accelerated rate
at which things have happened since the
Wales and the CBA merged in October
1982, to form Westpac.
Even people working in the most far-
flung Westpac branches have felt the
effects of the Bank’s heady progress.
Hardly a month has gone by without
some new restructure or change being
announced within the Bank, as the bene-
fits of the merger really start to flow.
What makes Westpac’s rapid progress
so surprising, is the fact that when the
newly formed Bank was launched, it had
a number of large obstacles to overcome.
It had a name which at the time, most of
the public didn’t like. There was increas-
ing competition from a whole range of
financial institutions including credit
unions, building societies, merchant
banks, cash management trusts, finance
companies and foreign owned banks
all fighting fora piece ofthecake. Andto
make the job even tougher, there were
the teething problems of the merger
itself.
Yet in spite of all these obstacles,
Westpac has somehow managed to un-
leash a barrage of innovative new pro-
ducts and services onto the market
during the past year. It has expanded its
corporate and international operations.
And most recently, introduced into Aus-
tralia the world’s first National Electronic
Banking system, thus giving its customers
instant access to their funds virtually
anywhere across the country, day or
night. According to Mr. White, this new
electronic system is a big part of West-
pac’s strategy to increase its market
share.
“We said very early in the merger, we
would be turning Westpac into a major
competitive force. We even used the
theme in our advertising ‘Now there’s
Competition’. Two years down the track
we’ve lived up to our promises by taking
advantage of newtechnological develop-
ments to increase our market share.
We’ve expanded our Handybank network,
launched a new point of sale network
called Handyway, and introduced West-
pac Master Card to give our customers a
wider and better quality range of ser-
vices ... all linked to our national elec-
tronic banking system.”
So how has Westpac been able to
accomplish all this soquickly? Mr. White
explains: .. wedecidedtosplitWestpac
virtually into two banks the wholesale
bank and the retail bank. This enabled us
to be much more innovativeand quicker
on our feet to meet the competition, and
has been the big achievement of the
second year of the merger.”
Another boost to Westpac’s perfor-
mance this year, came in the form of the
i
Bob White: “Surprised at the speed.
long-awaited deregulation of the banking
industry. With less regulation, banks like
Westpac are able to compete more ag-
gressively in the area of interest rates.
“One of the biggest benefits of deregu-
lation,’’says Mr. White, “is that it makes it
easier for us to offer a much wider range
of deposit facilities to the customer. Now
we can virtually take a deposit for any
term from one day to 10 years! And we
can pay whatever interest we choose ...
We’ve certainly not be able to do that
before.”
In response to a suggestion made by
some financial journalists a few months
ago, that despite deregulation, the banks
seemed to be slow in adjusting interest
rates, Mr. White was quick to point out
that"... if you lookatthe records, between
1890 and 1974, there were only 21
changes to our maximum overdraft rates.
Butyet in 1983alone,therehavebeen 17
changes And so far in 1984 it’s been up
and down like a yo-yo. Sothere have been
more adjustments in interest rates in the
last two years than in the entire banking
history of Australia. It’s really quite in-
credible that we could be accused of
being uncompetitive!...”
On the subject of deregulation,
Mr. White is also concerned about the
question of foreign banks coming into
Australia. Although he wholeheartedly
supports the idea, he stresses it is essen-
tial the government acts in the best
interests of Australia.
“Instead of simply granting licences
to the 5 or 6 biggest banks in the world
and ignoring the countries they come
from, we should consider who our trading
partners are. Especially those trading
relationships in the Western Pacific where
one and a half billion people live. That’s
the growth area of the future, and for
Westpac to continue expanding overseas,
we need reciprocal access ..
‘Reciprocal Access’ in bankingsimply
means that by allowing foreign banks to
operate in Australia, ourgovernmentcan
demand equal access for our banks to
operate in the foreign bank’s country as
well.
One of the reasons Westpac wants to
operate more freely overseas, is so it can
provide even more facilities to its corpor-
ate customers. Over the last 18 months,
Corporate business has been Westpac’s
fastest growing area. During this time
span, Westpac’s project finance team
managed $2O billion worth of loans for
customers, more than 80% of the total
number of loans managed in Australia.
As Australian companies expand their
operations overseas, Westpac intends to
be in a good position to service them.
Already Westpac is represented in 21
countries around the world, including
USA and Europe, and now has its sights
firmly set on the Western Pacific region.
Most of these Westpac offices are
headed by local experts who understand
the marketplace. Mr. White says this
‘local knowledge’ element is crucial be-
cause “We need people who can speak
the language, who have the contacts,
who can open up new doors for us\..”
Ona moregeneral level,onedoorthat
Mr. White is particularly keen to see
opened up is Australia’s case for an
offshore banking centre. As Mr. White
explains it.
“You can lookattheworldinthesense
of 3 main time zones. One is undoubtably
centered on New York, and London is
another one. But we are geographically
situated in the third time zone that is
currently fragmented between Hong
Kong, Singapore and Tokyo . . . and of
course, there are some reservations
about the future of Hong Kong. So I say
what about Australia!”
Regarding Westpac’s own future,
Mr. White has no doubts about in whose
hands it lies.
“Our staff, they’re the keyto Westpac’s
future... asthe Bankgrowsandchanges
so quickly, we’re going to give a lot more
emphasis to staff development. We are
doing everything possible to help our
people gain experience, and tertiary
education. Sotheywill be qualified to take
the top jobs . . . and ensure Westpac is
always in good hands.”
And how would Mr. White like Westpac
to be seen now and in the future by its
customers and the public?
“I wouldn’t like us to ever become
known as a Bank which is driven by the
profit motive. Certainly we’ve tried to
develop Westpac as the leader of the
field, as an innovative bank. And we’ve
done that. But nevertheless, it’s a bank
that is genuinely concerned about
people ... If anything, we’re driven by the
desire to service our customer’s needs
betterthan anybody else can.”


World's
First.
wm
Warwick Kent: “What the customer wants,
the customer gets.”
Amid all the fanfare and excitement
that surrounded Westpac’s launch
two years ago, a lot of big promises
were made about whatthe Bank intended
to accomplish in the future. At the time, it
seemed every Westpac press release,
advertisement and brochure was sprink-
led with such non-bank-like words as
‘competition’, ‘innovation’ and ‘imagin-
ation’. There was even talk a bout building
a whole new kind of bank to cope with the
changingtimes.
But of all these promises, perhaps the
most ambitious one was Westpac’s prom-
ise to apply sophisticated technologies to
the traditionally labour intensive business
of banking.
Because although the computerisa-
tion of the banking industry had been
steadily developing for some time, and
devices such as Automatic Teller Ma-
chines (ATM’s) were already a reality in
1982, Westpac indicated it was goingto
take the idea of Electronic Banking a big
step further than anyone had done before.
Exactly how or when thiswasgoingto
happen, remained somewhat of a mystery
right up until the early months of this
year. But in April, suddenly all was
revealed. Westpac announced it was
introducing the world’s first national
Electronic Banking System (EBS).
It was an announcement that made
news.
For here was a bank, introducing a
totally new system for its customers to do
their banking and shopping. A system

A way to shop and get cash on the spot Handyway.

that had never been applied before on a
national scale, in any othercountry inthe
world. In effect, it meant that Westpac
customers would now be able to get
access to their cash anywhere in Australia
through a vast network of electronic
delivery systems.
Mr. Bill Mclnnis, General Manager of
the Bank's Retail Financial Services
Group, explains: “These delivery systems
include the largest number of Handy-
banks (ATM’s) from coast to coast. And a
new type of electronic computer terminal
in branches, which allows a customerto
walk into any Westpac branchin Australia
and makean instanttransactionoverthe
counter, by presenting a plastic card.
Plus, there is the Handyway system
too..
Handyway isthe name for the Bank’s
new electronic funds transfer point-of-
sale network, which is currently being
installed in 1,000 Woolworths, BIG W
Discount stores, Food Plus stores and BP
service stations. It enables customersto
purchase goods and receive cash at the
same time, by withdrawing the transaction
amount directly from their bank accounts.
“It’s especially good for those times,
say late at night, when you’ve run out of
cash and might need some groceries at
the same time.” says Mr. Mclnnis. “Be-
cause participating Handyway stores
such as Food Plus are open late hours. So
the extra convenience is a big factor.”
Now that Handyway has passed the
pilot stage, two of Westpac’s retailing
partners were willing to comment on the
progress made so far. The Financial
Controller of Food Plus, Mr. Keith Perkin
says, “From our point of view, Food Plus
couples well with being first into the field
of electronic retailing. Customer accept-
ance has been very good, and we’re
looking forward to increasing business
even further through this facility.”
The Australian Manager of Woolworths
Supermarkets, Mr. Henderson, adds ..
at this early stage, where the Handyway
system is in full operation at our stores,
it’s having good acceptance. As more
terminals become available, we expect a
further increase in usage too ..
The heart of Westpac’s EBS system is
a 3 storey technological fortress in the
Sydney suburb of Ryde, called the West-
pac Data Centre. Built at a cost of nearly
$3O million, it houses supercomputers
capable of performing 11 million opera-
tions a second, and processing nearly all
the bank’stransactions. The centre links
up with about 6,000 branch computer
terminals nationwide, from remote towns
in the Gulf of Carpentaria to Tasmania.
Plus, it links up the largest network of
Handybanks in Australia (275) and all
the Handyway point-of-sale terminals.
To operate the centre, 150 technicians
and support people work in round-the-
clock shifts. Meanwhile, in every state,
special teams of service people are on
permanent call in case one of the Handy-
banks, Handyway or Electronicterminals
malfunctions. So by any standards, to
keep the EBS system 100% operational
demands a huge outlay in resources,
time and people.
Is it paying off?
Mr. Mclnnis says: “It’s certainly a big
plunge to take. But that’s not really the
point... the thing is, to be competitive to
stay competitive in the tougher environ-
ment we’re operating in today, we've got
to be different. We’vegottoofferdifferent
and better ways to service the needs of
our customers. The EBS system is un-
doubtably the best way to do that. And the
system is being well accepted. During
the last quarter alone, we had over 4
million transactions made through our
Handybank system. Customers want
more convenient ways to access their
cash, and that’s exactly what we’re trying
to give them ... All they need is a plastic
card ...”
The two cards Westpac offers are the
Westpac Card, which lets customers
draw money directly from their bank
accounts and can be used with any part
of the EBS system. And the Westpac
Master Card, which in addition to doing
everything the Westpac Card does, can
also be used internationally in 156
countries as a credit card.
Together, these two cards form the
keys to the Bank’s entire electronic
system. As more and more people use
them to access their money electronically
is the Bank concerned about being so
committed to an electronic future?
Not according to Mr. Warwick Kent,
Chief General Manager of Retail Services.
“The thing to remember is,” he says.
“Everything we’ve done has been directed
by the competitive servicing of customer’s
needs. We’re not forcing anyone to use
our new electronic systems. We are
simply offering them a bigger and better
choice. There will always be the tradi-
tional waysof doingthings if people want
that. Westpac's Electronic Banking Sys-
tem is really a caseof whatthecustomer
wants, the customer gets.”

There is a mini-TV studio in Sydney
that you’ve probably never heard
of. Yet each month it produces 9
hours of programs that include news,
current affairs, commercials, music, and
much more. Someof these programsare
then reproduced onto cassettes and
distributed at a rate of 10,000 a month to
all over Australia. A few of them are even
distributed to 22 countries around the
world including London, New York, Hong
Kong and China!
Give up?
Well here’s a clue. If you’ve ever been
into a Westpac branch and been waiting
in line to be served, you’ve probably
noticed a video machine nearby screen-
ing non-stop lifestyle images mixed with
music, interspersed with Westpac com-
mercials.
Actually what you’ve been watching is
one of the video shows produced by
Westpac’s Video Network. This network
was set up two years ago with the rather
ambitious objective of providingan inter-
nal communication system, to help link
up all the branches and operations within
the bank. No mean feat when you con-
sider Westpac is the most decentralised
business in Australia, employing4o,ooo
people in nearly 2,000 branches scattered
over 5 million square kilometres of Aust-
ralia and throughoutthe world.
But Video Network works. In fact it
works so well, that Westpac is seriously
considering marketing its wares to other
corporate clients outside the bank.
According to the manager of Video
Network, Mr. Gavin Duncombe. “The
reason so many other big corporations
are interested in our operation, is that
we’re the biggestandthefirstof itskind in
Australia. No other company has such a
highly sophisticated internal video net-
work. They look at what we’re doing, and
they say ‘Hey! We should have that too.’
In all, Video Network produces four
main programs a month. Thesecomprise
a general news program, an Insight
program for managers and senior bank
staff, a Campaign program which is
designed to introducethecurrentadver-
tising campaign. And an Australian
Review program which is specially pre-
pared for the 5,000 Westpac staff who are
stationed at the 22 Westpac officesaround
the globe.
“The Australian Review program is
like our version of Video Vegemite . . .”
chuckles Mr. Duncombe. “It gives our
people in London or wherever, a taste of
what’s going on back home. It’s full of
news, current affairs, human interest,
sport... and the arts ..
Apart from the normal scheduled
programs, Video Network also produces
special ‘one-off programs to cover a
certain theme, or to demonstrate a new
product ortechnique.
“One of the most carefully watched
programs we’ve ever produced, was a
recent one showing our bank employees
how to deal with a Hold-up. We tried to

9 hours of shows a month: “the sky's the
limit!’’
make the show as realistic as possibleto
demonstrate just how dangerous this
type of situation can be. The feedback
we’ve got from that program alone has
been tremendous ..
Of course, not every company has a
need for their own video network, even if
they could afford to run one. To instal
Westpac’s 2,000 Sony monitors and
Betamax cassette recorders, cost over
$4 million 2 years ago. And the cost of
production support equipment was about
$200,000. So a Video Network on West-
pac’s scale is a large commitment of
money, time and resources to make.
Is it paying off?
“Undoubtedly” says Duncombe. “For
starters, Westpac was originally two banks
the Wales and the CBA, and the Video
Network programs have certainly helped
to mould the two staff groups into a
cohesive team for the new bank ... And
secondly, Video is such a flexible and
responsive medium to work with, we can
put together a whole show in a matter of
days. And whisk the tapes off to their
destinations before you can say‘Westpac
the bank!’ And finally, mostpeopleprefer
to watch a message on video ratherthan
read about it in black and white. Especially
the younger people, who after all, make
up most of our viewingaudience. In fact,
70% of Westpac staff are under 30 years
old.”
The bank also, through the Video
Network conducts training programs for
its senior executives, to enable them to
handle the new communication
methods.
“One of the truly big advantages of
this Video Network”, says Duncombe, “is
that it enables staff at all levels, in all
places to know who their senior executives
are. For instance, thanks to Video Net-
work, a part-time teller working in one of
our branches in far North Queensland,
can actually become familiar with West-
pac’s managing director. She can see
what he looks like, hear how he talks ...
and that can only be a good thing.
Because there’s nothing worse than
working for an organisation as large as
Westpac, and feeling that there is abso-
lutely no contact between you and the
people at the top. We simply can’t afford
to be that impersonal these days.”
So where does the Video Network go
from here?
“Oh, we’ll keep refining our production
methods,” says Duncombe,” and keep
aiming for the highest program quality
possible. Meanwhile, we’ve got some
other big corporate clients knocking on
our door, wondering if we can do the
same for them. And that's a whole new
ballgame, a very tempting game at that.
Next year of course, Australia will ha veits
own satellite which will revolutionise
communications in the country. Natur-
ally, since Westpac is the most innovative
bank, we’ll be a part of these develop-
ments. Soitwill be quitetruetosay,asfar
as Video Network is concerned, not even
the sky is the limit!”

Jim Goldman: “A hectic game on both
sides of the fence."
What makes a successful stock-
broker give up his partner-
ship with one of Sydney’s more
prestigious firms, to run off and join a
Bank?
That’s exactly what Mr. Jim Goldman
did one month ago when he accepted a
position as Chief Manager of Westpac’s
Investment Division.
"There are many reasons I made the
switch’’ says Mr. Goldman. "But it cer-
tainly wasn’t because I wanted an easier
job. Because this whole investment bus-
iness is an extremely hectic game on
both sides of the fence. The pace doesn’t
alter much. You can be literally involved
24 hours a day, since there’s always
something happening somewhere in the
world that affects investment...”
Altogether, Mr. Goldman’s division has
about $3 billion to invest. This figure
comprises nearly $1 billion worth of
Westpac’s own superannuation funds,
$1 billion of other superannuation funds
from outside groups, and a further $1
billion of private client's money.
Thistotal amount isthen splitupinto
a large and ever expanding range of
investment options, from traditional
Commonwealth bonds, treasury bills and
blue chip industrials to high speculation
investments such as oil and mineral
exploration.
“We don't have one cent of our money
uninvested.” says Mr. Goldman. “Every
cent we manage is working for us every
day.”.
In an increasinglycompetitiveinvest-
ment environment, and with both indi-
vidual and corporate clients demanding
optimum performance, Mr. Goldman
thinks Westpac offers some very big
advantages that most of the competitors
can’t match.
“The most important advantage of
all.” he says. “Is the fact that we are
Westpac, because it means that we’ll be
still here in 40 years time when people
come back to claim their money. We're
not a foreign company who might sud-
denly close down. We’re here to stay!...
You see, there are a lot of investment
advice groups outthere run bysomevery
competent individuals. But the truth is,
their businesses can only exist as long as
that person is running it... We’ll be here
when ourcustomerscome backtodiscuss
the results as well as the promises!”
A major part of Westpac’s Investment
business involvesthe managing of super-
annuation funds. OvertheyearsWestpac
has developed such a high degree of
expertise in this field that it’s not uncom-
mon these days, forall types of organisa-
tions (including corporations, trade
unions, etc.) to come to the Bank for help.
“In one company recently.” says
Mr. Goldman, “therewasactuallyastrike
because the senior officers were unhappy
about their existing fund structure. So
our consultant went in, sat down and
talked to both sides, and designed afund
that settled the strike, and made every-
one involved much happier.”
Apart from Superannuation schemes,
Westpac offers a wide range of invest-
ment products and services to satisfy
clients. One of the latest offerings is the
Westpac Investment Plan (W.1.P.). Ac-
cording to Mr. Goldman, the W.I.P. .. is
particularly suitable for high-net-worth
people, who aren’t able to give enough
time to their investments. For instance,
busy professionals or expatriot Austral-
ians, who are working overseas and want
their investments managed automatic-
ally. Thus leaving the-time-consuming
day-to-day investment decisions to us.”
In addition to offering investors access
to the money markets (short and long
term), futures trading, stock exchange
activities and other transactions, the
Bank also offers Unit Trusts.
Although these areas can be quite
profitable for investors, Mr. Goldman is
careful to point out that his division never
claims to be able to make a fortune for
anyone. ”... but we would claim to be able
to preserve the true purchasing powerof
the money that people give us.”
Outside Mr. Goldman’s domain, but
an integral part of Westpac’s overall
investment strategy, is the Bank’s recent
acquisition of a 50% share in the large
stockbroking firm Ord Minnett Ltd. This
move enables Westpac to offer the facil-
ities of a stockbrokerthrough the Bank’s
vast branch network.
“Now any Westpac customer, any-
where in Australia can access our invest-
ment services through the branch net-
work,” says Mr. Goldman. “We’ve usually
got something for everyone.”
Part of Westpac’s 'Something for
Everyone’ philosophy, isthe introduction
of products like Club 55 (for pre-retired
and retired people)andthe Portfolio Club
(an investment service for high asset
individuals). These products, along with
many others in the pipeline, a re designed
to satisfy particular customer’s needs by
providing them with special financial
services.
According to Mr. Jim Osborne, a
manager of Westpac’s Retail Banking
division, “. . . Club 55 and the Portfolio
Club work well because they offer a
comprehensive list of benefits all together
in one package. The success of the Port-
folio Club is especially surprising, be-
cause uptill now, it has been given a very
soft-sell approach ... sotheneedforsuch
a service is definitely there.”


Phillip Adams:
"Styrene
Slivers’.’
Australia’s first bionic bank, West-
pac, is hell-bent on electronics.
Thus cash, lucre, shekels, spon-
dulic, brass, boodle, quids, wampum,
greenbacks, smackers and lolly will be
replaced by styrene slivers. What used to
be described as palm grease will only be
available in plastic.
This continues an unfortunate histor-
ical tendency ... to replace all sorts of
amusing monies with increasingly aus-
tere symbols.
In Africa, the Dinka and Shilluk tribes
of the Upper Nile used hoes as money.
Others used cattle. (“How much do you
want for your split-level kraal?” “Two bulls
and a heifer.” “That’s daylight bloody
robbery I’ll give you two heifers and a
poddy.”)
In South America, red feathers were
favoured, provoking a notorious trade in
forged parrots. In New Guinea, the Tri-
dacna-shell armlets and large stone axe
blades were the symbols of upward mo-
bility, whilstthe financiers of Fijifavoured
the teeth of the sperm whale. And in my
collection of archaeological and anthro-
pological flotsam, I’ve some Eskimo
money, in the form of little ivory fish.
But the most spectacular currency
was undoubtedly the fe or “millstone
money” of the Caroline Islands. Dirty
great stone donuts weighing half a tonne
each. Try to stick one in the slot of a
vending machine and you’d crush it flat.
It was all very bright and colorful,
adding enormous interest to one’s bank-
ing procedures. Imagine the delights of
depositing a stone donut in your savings
account and taking your change in a shell
necklace. Or how chic you’d feel at
Fanny’s or Two Faces tipping the waiter
with a couple of red feathers. Incidentally,
I wonder whether that currency of quills
was the source of the term “tickling the
kitty”.
Frankly, I’m finding it very hard to
adjust to plastic money. First of all, it’s
rectangular when currency is traditionally
round. And where it was easy to toss a
coin, it’s virtually impossible to toss
plastic money. Which makes it hard to
work out whose side ought to bat first.
And, frankly, one fears for the future of
two-up. Even ifyoudomanagetoflipyour
plastic card, it lacks the traditional and
patriotic heads and tails. Real money
always had the monarch on one side and
a marsupial on the other. And a two bob or
20<t piece was marvellousfor prisingthe
lids off paint cans, which is very difficult
with a plastic card.
Frankly, I think that progress, like
evolution, has gone farenough. My mate
Barry Jones is forever warning us about
“technological determinism” and here’s
a case of it running rampant.
I’ll concede that cows may be a bit
cumbersome for every day commerce
(although what’s wrong with a stock
cube?) but feathers and shells and stuff
like that seem perfectly reasonable. And
I bet that a society that used dirty great
stone donuts had very little trouble with
inflation. Worst of all, you can’t put a
plastic card in your Christmas pudding.
One of the great joys of childhood was
scraping off the custard and burrowing
into the pud with your spoon, looking for
thruppences. It was this exciting game
that gave Lang Hancock and Sir Roderick
Carnegie their sub-conscious desire to
be miners. Well, try that with a plastic
card. They go all soggy and runny.
And what are you going to do in Rome?
Toss your plastic money into the Trevi?

Boardroom
Revolution.
Over the last year there has
been a revolution in the board
rooms of hundreds of Aust-
ralia’s top corporations. Within the ex-
ecutive of the A.C.T.U. and down the
corridors of power in Parliament House,
the quiet revolution continues.
Every month a white envelope is
delivered to thetop three hundred people
in business, government and the Trade
Union movement. The revolution is Aust-
ralia’s first really professional corporate
video program exclusively developed
for Westpac.
Each program lasts about 40minutes
and contains a review of what’s been
happening in business around the world,
interviews with key Federal and State
Government Ministers, overseas execu-
tives and background stories in things
like rent resource tax, aboriginal land
rights, public services restructure and
the übiquitous budget deficit.
The Corporate video programmetitled
No. 1 is the brainchild of Tony Maine,
head of Marketing and Corporate Rela-
tions at Westpac. “The program provides
a private channel for the country’s de-
cision makers toexposetheirviews” he
says “in doing so it provides Westpac
with the opportunity to communicate
its views to this very important section of
the marketplace".
Maine says “The recipients of No. 1
are exactly those people who are hardest
to get at through normal media they
are too busy. No. 1 provides them with
issues of their concern, with the capacity
to watch it at their leisure”.
What Westpac has found is many in
government and business are asking to
go on the program and talk about the
issues affecting them.
“We haveenough requests from No. 1
members to make programs forthe next
six months”, say Steve Cosser, executive
producer of the program.
Cosserand his partner Greg Solomon
produce the series for Westpac and it
looks just as good as anythingyou would
see on television.
But don’t rush to your local video shop
to get a copy because No. 1 is hard to get
your hands on. “We are planning to
increase the number of people who can
receive No. 1, it’s success rests very
much on it being available to a select
group we want to continue that”, said
Maine.
So the quiet revolution continues with
Westpac taking this every innovative and
entrepreneural step in the area of cor-
porate video.

John Harris: delivering the ultimate
vehicle.

top of your desk ..
«
T
A That's how project manager
Mr. John Harris began hisexplanationof
Westpac’s latest service to corporate
customers, the Cash Management System
(CMS).
“We want CMS to be the ultimate ve-
hicle to deliver the Bank’s products . . .
the only things needed to hook it up are a
power point, a telephone and an existing
computer terminal. In fact, any type of
computerterminal will do the trick”.
If Mr. Harris gets his way, the days of
transferring funds by couriers clutching
cheques, and waiting for the banks to
open,areover Instead,thankstothenew
Westpac CMS system, a company can
transfer funds electronically, practically
anywhere in Australia where there is a
CMS link-up. It also gives the company
access to vital market information, and
enables the operator to act on this infor-
mation immediately.
"Togiveyou an exampleofwhatCMS
is capable of” says Mr. Harris, ‘‘suppose a
company suddenly finds itself with a
surplus of say $50,000 ... very late in the
afternoon. Simply by pushing a few but-
tons, on the CMS system, that company
can transfer this surplus amount into
Westpac’s overnight Money Market ac-
count and earn interest on that amount”.
“Similarly”, adds Mr. Harris, “24 hours
a day, a CMS customer can have instant
access to their financial position nation-
ally. Plusa customeralso hasaccesstoa
wide range of financial market informa-
tion including Commercial Bill rates,
foreign exchange rates, investmentrates
and comprehensive local market infor-
mation”.
“But best of all”, says Mr. Harrisquite
gleefully, “our customers can do much
morethan just lookatallthisinformation
. .. they can act on it!”
Although any type of company can
benefit from using Westpac’s CMS sys-
tem, Mr. Harris suggests that the ones
who can benefit most from it, are those
companies with high liquidity who
have large amounts of cash coming in
from outside sources.
“After all”, he says, “CMS is primarily
designed as a system to manage Cash
more effectively. Size isnotsoimportant,
it’s cash flow that counts”.
But surely otherfinancial institutions
offer a similar service? What makes CMS
so special?
“The difference is”, points out
Mr. Harris,“thatalthoughtheotherbanks
do offer a facility to transfer funds from

CMS Marketing Officer: putting CMS at Sanyo’s fingertips.
electronic system like ours. Sothey have
to maketheirtransfersthrougha number
of steps . . . but the CMS system is more
direct, more dynamic, more instantane-
ous.
“It’s considered by many experts to be
amongst the most advanced systems of
its kind in the world”.
Presently, the response to Westpac’s
CMS is growing steadily as more com-
panies realise a need for such a system.
Amongthe list of clients isSanyo Australia
who have been usingthesystemforquite
some time. According to the national
corporate accountant of Sanyo Australia,
Mr. PeterZobory. “With CMSatourfinger-
tips, we can monitor and manage our
•funds with greater control in each state,
and take advantage of the short term
money market . . . and because we’re
transferring funds electronically, we’ve
almost ceased using telegraphic transfers
and even drawing fewer cheques. For
Sanyo, CMS is definitely payingfor itself,
especially now that the fee structure is
now on a ‘User-Pays’ basis, instead of a
flat fee...”
Apart from the competitive cost struc-
ture of CMS, Westpac claims the system
can reduce a company’s costs in a
number of ways. By cutting down on the
number of telephone calls needed to
transact business, and by reducing the
man hours spent on the manual reconcil-
liation processing of accounts, the CMS
system enables companies to make
better decisions, more quickly.
The system doesn’t demand any
special hardware, (apartfrom company’s
existing equipment), so installation costs
are negligible. Plus there are the added
savings on a company's paperwork and
time.
A further development to CMS will be
the ability to offer its customers access to
the newly formed ‘Australclear’ system.
‘Austral clear’ was created by a numberof
banks, trading banks and other compan-
ies to provide a computerised central
register and safekeeping service for the
money market. Thus allowing settlements
to take place without physical delivery of
securities and virtually eliminating the
need to deliver cheques.
“Australclear must give the CMS pro-
gram a big push”, says Mr. Harris, "be-
cause once again, it gives users a more
direct way of handling their money mar-
ket transactions”.
In the future, Mr. Harris expects that
as more and more productsare linkedto
the CMS system, 'critical mass’will build
up.
“When this happens”, he says, “the
CMS system will become so valuable
from a service point of view, that no major
company will be able to afford to do
without it”.


For 9 out of every 10 people working
at Westpac, the name ‘Weiss’ means
much more than a high-fashion
designer label to be found exclusively
between the glossy pages of Harpers or
Vogue.
Because Weiss is the official (if that’s
the word) designerto Westpac’s wardrobe
department. And the Weiss wardrobe
has been so successful for Westpac over
the past two years, that it is almost
impossible to walk down a busy city
street anywhere in Australia, without
spying at least one or two Westpac staff
dressed in the familiar Weiss look.
According to Peter Weiss, this accep-
tance rate of the new wardrobe took both
he and Adele (his wife and business part-
ner) by surprise.
"In the beginning, we were thinking
we might get a 50 to 60% acceptance
rate. But now it’s over 90% and still
climbing.”
A big development in the last 12
months has been to extend the wardrobe
right through the full range of Westpac’s
staff levels. So now everyone from chauf-
feurs to tea ladies to managers can have
their own version of the Weiss look. The
operative word being ‘version’, because
as Peter Weiss says. "It’s terribly impor-
tantthat no-one everfeels like a Westpac
clone. That’s why we’ve designed the
wardrobe to give individuals a freedom of
how they can look. They can mix and
match different jackets, trousers, skirts,
shirts, jumpers . . . but yet still maintain
the overall Westpac image ...”
Peter Weiss feelsthat it’sonly been in
the last few months that both he and
Adele have been ableto stand backfora
while and objectively judge the visual
impact of the wardrobe.
"Enough time has elapsed.” he says,
"for us to really look out there and see
clearly how people are wearing it in a day
today situation ... and what stands out is
the fact that it works. People are wearing
it, they're looking good in it. And they’re
asking for more. Of course, having this
side of the business structured the way
we do, meanswealsogetautomaticfeed-
back.”
What Peter Weiss means by this, is the
fact that located on twofloors of the Weiss
building in Surry Hills, is a whole depart-
ment devoted to Westpac.
“Everything is despatched from here,
all exchanges, returns, appraisals and
complaints, all get handled from these
two floors. And we can tell from this that
Westpac’s initial decisiontogoforquality
has paid off... because two years down
the track, the percentage of returns is
a I most zilch! It is extremely rare we would
get something returned to us with a
frayed collar, a lostbutton,ordyethathas
run in the wash . . . Sure we get a few
exchanges, but it’s only human nature
that most people like to think they are a
little smallerthan they really are . .. ”
As the wardrobe moves into another
summer season, Adele Weiss hasupdated
the Westpac look a number of ways.
What Weiss had
up their sleeves.
\M
j
She says: “the important thing is,
rather than change the look, we’ve ex-
tended the look. The collars are becoming
a little smaller and there are other shape
changes too ... but beyond that, we’ve
enhanced the actual colours and fabrics
themselves, with subtle changes, and by
interweaving different textiles to make
everyone look snappier, feel better. We’ve
also added some new garments to the
range for different climatic conditions.
For instance, now we offer special wash
and wear shorts for people working in
Westpac branches up in the far north.”
But as she explains, the biggestchal-
lenge isto keep the wardrobe fashionable
and new. “We’ve gottomakesurethatno-
one ever gets bored with the wardrobe.
We’vegotto keep it highlyfashionable...
and that’s certainly an art. But to make
my job easier, Westpac has given me a
totallyfreehand ... whichmeanslcanbe
much more flexible and keep a strong
sense of style going. Which is vital,
because it’s not justclothingorauniform
(the Westpac wardrobe is never referred
to as a ‘uniform’)... To keepthis senseof
style going strong we don’t drastically
change the order of things. We don’t
tamper much with the basic fashion
platform orthe colourtheme ... wetryto
enhance it, to give it a new spirit.”
Although much of the comment sur-
rounding the Westpac wardrobe centres
on the woman’s angle, Peter Weiss likes
to emphasise how well the wardrobe has
been received by the males.
“The bank male today isn’t the tradi-
tional, stereotyped conservative dresser
anymore. These young men joining
Westpac today like to wear their new
sweaterorwhatever.and looka bitzappy.
They care about how they look, and it
shows when they’re walking down the
street. In fact, whenever we make a new
‘top-up’ offertothe males to update their
wardrobe, the response has been astoun-
ding! They keep asking for more ...”
And how does Peter Weiss view the
working relationship with Westpac itself?
“Well apart from the obvious answer
like ‘it’s-healthy-for-business’ sort of
thing, I must say I really do respect the
Bank for having the courage of their
convictions by actually executing their
thoughts into action. It shows that the
Bank has cared enough about its staff to
go for the best. And of course, they
heavily subsidise the wardrobe too, to
give their staff an even better deal ...
Looking backoverthe last yearespecially,
and looking towards the future, I would
say the impact of the Westpac wardrobe
is making a lot of other corporations out
there sit up and take notice.”
Peter and Adele Weiss: “No-one should
ever feel like a clone. "

Corporate
Hunting Grounds.
Frank Conroy: Successful ‘scalp’ hunter.
The $2O Billion tombstone wall.
««HT here’s a whole wall full of
tombstones out there!” says
JL Mr. Frank Conroy, General
Manager of Westpac’s Corporate division,
pointingtothe adjoining wall outside his
office. “And they add up to about $2O
billion worth”.
A tombstone in banking jargon, is
simply a small advertisement announc-
ing the details of a major loan deal,
designed for record purposes only. The
more serious financial press publications
are sprinkled with such tombstones
announcing projects ranging from min-
eral developments to dam constructions.
But to the financial layman, seeing so
many tombstones in one place, they
somehow evoke an image of ‘Corporate
Scalps’. Proofofasuccessful huntingtrip
through the land of project finance.
If that’s the case, then Westpac has
certainly been a keen hunter, because
during the past 18 months, the Bank has
managed 80% of all syndicated loans
raised in Australia, and including such
mammoth projects as the $1.2 billion
Dampierto Perth Natural Gas Pipeline.
In the last October issue of the re-
spected magazine ‘Euromoney’, Westpac
was ranked Number One lead manager
for energy financing in the world. No
mean feat, considering Westpac is only
the world’s 66th largest bank.
However, project financing is only
one aspect (though a very large one) of
Westpac’s fast growing Corporate Bank-
ing Division. Up until quite recently,
Westpac’s Corporate operations were
divided up into various units in each
state. But since July lstthisyear, as part
of the Bank’s newwholesalestructure.all
Corporate units have been brought to-
gether and now report to one office
headed by Mr. Frank Conroy.
“This restructure enables us to co-
ordinate our activities much better’’, said
Mr. Conroy, “... basically, we’ve divided
this division up to service three tiers of
corporate clients. The first tier is designed
to service very large multinational-type
clients and government. The second tier
takes care of our National Accounts
(which although very large too, don’t
usually operate outside Australia). And
finally, the third tier services the big
middle market of corporate accounts
(mostly medium-sized businesses)...”
By creating three distinct levels within
the Corporate Division, Mr. Conroy is
confident Westpac will be able to give its
corporate clients a far better level of
service than any other financial com-
petitor.
But in the battle for the big corporate
dollar, perhaps the most powerful ace
Mr. Conroy has up his sleeve, is his newly
developed team of “Group Account
Executives”.
“The job of these highly specialised
executives, explains Mr. Conroy, is to ..
go one step further than just taking care
of our large corporate clients. They must
actually be able to anticipate our clients
needs in advance, and then provide a
solution to those needs... trading banks
have never done this before, the reason
we can do it now is because we’ve been
able to put our best people onto it”.
Each Group Account Executive under-
goes an intense and expensive training
period, as part of Westpac’s Professional
Corporate Bankers' program. Duringthis
time, the Account Executives become
thoroughly familiar with a concept refer-
red to as ‘Relationship’ management.
Accordingto Mr. Conroy, an understand-
ing of this concept helps his executives to
"... really get to know their clients on a
longterm basis. Ithelpsthemappreciate
the particular environment the client is
operating in, and who makes all the
decisions in the company.
To help the Account Executives per-
form their tasks even more efficiently,
Mr. Conroy says the numberof accounts
each executive works on has been re-
duced. This allows them to devote extra
time for research and planning.
One of the main reasons Westpac is
developing the Group Account Executive
teams so thoroughly, is so they will be
well prepared for the possible effects of
de-regulation and foreign bank entry.
Mr. Conroy explains, “If the bigforeign
banks do settle here, it’s going to be very
easy for them to target the very large
multinational clients that operate herein
Australia. Because that’s exactly what
they’re used to doing all around the world
... Butwith our Account Executiveteams
already in place,givingtopservicetoour
corporate clients, it's going to be much
harder for those foreign banks to break
in. Of course, now that Westpac has its
own international presence, we can also
match many of the global facilities the
foreign banks offer anyway ...”
Altogether, Westpac’s Corporate
division has nine Group Account Execu-
tive teams, covering everything from
multinationals, government instrument-
alities (Telecom, Qantas etc.) to Japanese
and Korean business (major Australian
trade partners). One such team is headed
by Mr. Ron O’Neil, a Group Account
Executive who has been working in
Westpac’s Corporate division for the past
7 years. His list of clients includes such
corporate giants as Pioneer Concrete,
Amatil, Lend Lease, Ampol and Peko
Walsend.
The way Mr. O’Neil see his role, "...
the name of the game is to be 100%
responsible to the needs of our custom-
ers. I’ve to know my clients so well, that if
they speak in a certain tone of voice for
instance, I will know whether to press a
point or back off. It’s a person to person
situation”.
There is no such thing as a typical
working day. Sometimes I might work
through to 9 or 10 o’clock each night
while the pressure is on ...”
To offset the effects of this pressure
however, Mr. O’Neil says hedoesmanage
to squeeze in an hour at the gym for at
least two or three times a week. He also
setstimeasideeach weektotake hisdog
for regular walks through Balmain, where
he lives.
“If you don’t keep reasonably fit in this
business, you’re more subject to execu-
tive stress”, he says.
Apart from the endless researching
role involved in keeping up with the
activities of his clients, Mr. O’Neil says he
nurtures the client relationship in other
ways too.
“I am constantly looking for oppor-
tunities to get to know my customers
better”, he says “They’ve got to love
dealing with Ron O’Neil... so Ido things
like hosting five of my clients along to the
Australian Film Institute Awards night
coming up soon. But believe me, although
this kind of socialising goes beyond the
standard banker’s business lunch ... it’s
not meant for fun. It’s plain hard work. In
this job, you’ve got to have your antennas
out!”

44V f we see a gap in the overseas
I marketplace,wewanttobeable
A to fill thatgapas soon as possible
with a Westpac product”, says Mr. Stuart
Fowler, Chief General Manager of
Westpac’s Corporate and International
Division. “But to do that, we must be
given the opportunity to expand inter-
nationally”.
Currently, Westpac has over 5,000
people working in 305 offices, spread
around the world in 20 countries. Yet
despite this, the Bank is unable to open
full service branches in Australia’smajor
trading partners such as Japan, Taiwan,
South Korea, Singapore or Hong Kong.
This is primarily due to the fact that
foreign banks from those countries are
not allowed to open branches here in
Australia. If they could, then Australian
banks like Westpac would be entitled to
‘reciprocal access’to open intheircoun-
tries too.
"We need to go into Asia because
that’s where Australia’s future is irrevoc-
ably committed. We want to be able to
follow Australian companies as they ex-
pand their operations overseas, so we
can service them there. And reciprocity
will help us to do that”, says Mr. Fowler.
But the argument for ‘reciprocity’ is
only one measure the Bank is taking to
help satisfy its global ambitions. On a
more personal level, Westpac is taking
great pains to ensure that its overseas
operations are headed by high-powered
executives with ‘local-knowledge’, which
often means recruiting directly from the
foreign market.
‘‘Thesimpletruth is”, says Mr. Fowler,
‘‘that Americans feel more comfortable
talking to Americans, British to British,
Japanese to Japanese and so on. Plus
you need people with an intimate under-
standing of how the local marketplace
works, where the contacts, products and
the information is ...”
As part of the Bank’s recent thrust into
the U.S. marketplace, Westpac lured Mr.
Tony Walton from his senior vice presi-
dent position at Chase Manhattan, to
become General Manager of Westpac’s
U.S. operations. Mr. Fowlercites himasa
prime example of how 'local knowledge’
can benefit the Bank’s off shore activities.
Since taking up the post, Mr. Walton
has drawn up a 3 year plan aimed at
giving Westpac’s U.S. operations a growth
rate of 20% per annum. Already the Bank
has been invited to participate in a
number of large American finance deals
in the $5O million range, and another in
the $lOO million range. Meanwhile, to
help build Westpac as a wholesale bank
in the U.S., Mr. Walton says, ‘‘Obviously,
we have concentrated on companies
which have a close connection with our
sphere of influence the Western Pacific
region”. But he also added that Westpac
has now begun approaching major U.S.
companies in three industries, regardless
of whether they have any connection to
Australia.

shore network is Mr. Phillip Deer, who
heads up its Asian operations, including
Singapore, Japan, China and Hong Kong.
And Mr. David Murison who heads upthe
London operation.
Both these appointees, along with
other Westpac executives with ‘local-
knowledge’, are also working to fulfil I one
of Westpac’s objectives to have about
30% of the Bank’s assets overseas.
To back up its people, Westpac isalso
implementing extremely sophisticated
communication and funds transfer tech-
nology to speed up progress.
“A lot of banks would give their eye-
teeth to have some of oursystems”, says
Mr. Fowler. “For instance, our global
exposure system which was initiated by
us 3 years ago, has reoently been taken
up and marketed by America’s giant
General Electric division as a major
product. And a lot of enquiries have been
coming to us from around the world for
this system, which we designed pretty
much in house ...”
What about Westpac’s long-term
global aspirations?
“You’ve got to be realistic”, says Mr.
Fowler. “We will certainly be a ‘universal’
bank in our home territory of Australia,
and will endeavour to meet 100% of our
customers here. Overseas, we will prob-
ably develop into an excellent ‘niche’
bank, where we will meet certain needs
fora certain range of customers. Including
large multinational companies. To ac-
complish this, we are building an inter-
national platform, a springboard if you
like, where we can develop global rela-
tionships with ourcustomers... produc-
tive relationships”.
The Fast, Fast
World of
Foreign Exchange.
On most weeknights, the trim
shape of Peter Chan can be
found running and puffing
through 6 kilometresof leafy streets in St.
St. Ives, Sydney. Although Chan is not
exactly a fitness fanatic (he smokes at
least a packet of cigarettes a day), he
exercises to help fend off the pressures of
his job. Which are enormous.
Because Peter Chan isoneofthatrare
breed of financial wizz-kids called Foreign
Exchange dealers, whose prime job it is
to buy and sell currency on behalf of the
Bank. It’s the kind of business where
people make their living off the third and
fourth decimal places of exchange.rates.
A transaction might range from organising
currencies for tourists travelling over-
seas, right up to major offshore deals
worth over $lOO million.
As Westpac’s chief dealer, Chan,


admits that he “lives and breathes the
market 24 hours a day.’’ He operates in a
room on the third floor of Westpac’s Head
Office, which is affectionately known as
the ‘Ulcer Department’. Afterspendinga
few minutes there, it’s not hard to see
why.
Phones ring. VDU keyboards clatter.
Telexes whirr. Chan’s team of 30 dealers
constantly shout across to each other in a
non-stop stream of dealer jargon like
“Hong Kong is sitting on two points” ...
“BHP is still sniffing.” The frantic pace
continues from 7.00 a.m. right through
the day, and on into the night.
“Sometimes my peoplewill workupto
15 hours a day straight.” says Chan, with
more than a touch of pride to his voice.
“In this business you have to give every-
thing. There is only one place to be in any
business and that’s number one. There's
no prize for being number two ... so we
are very bullish and I am confident our
team is the best in Australia.”
At 37, Chan knows the foreign ex-
change market backwardsandforwards,
and doesn’t mince his words when talking
about the nature of his work.
"... if I tell you we don’t make mis-
takes, I’m telling you a lie... but our job is
notto make mistakes. Ourjob istoassess
the risk and go into a transaction with our
eyes wide open. We’re not punting or
gambling, we’re simply taking a certain
view on the movement of currency and
acting on it. We’re constantly on the
phonetoour people in London, New York
or wherever ... they tell us what the
market is doing. It never stops ...”
Although foreign exchange has always
been a frantic business, it has become
even more so during the last 10 months
since the floating of the Australian dollar.
As Chan explains: “The value of our dollar
is now determined by the people in the
marketplace ... not so much by the
Reserve Bankanymore ... Sothe activity
has increased tremendously.”
With such a hectic pace, it’s little
wonder that the average age of Chan’s
team of dealers is 28. After 40, few can
stand up to the pressure.
Where exactly does Peter Chan’s For-
eign Exchange department fit into
Westpac’s global plans?
“Westpac already has a very substan-
tial share of the total foreign exchange
market here in Australia, and is a major
contributor forthegroup’soverall profits
... sothe Bank’s management has made
a firm commitment to it. We are now mak-
ing a major thrust into the international
money markets, on a global scale. We’re
putting a lot of resources behind it ...
expecially now that there’s a lot of talk
about Australia’s case for an offshore
banking centre ... in fact, I would say the
future of foreign exchange activities looks
unlimited.” says Chan.
Meanwhile, as the fast, fast world of
foreign exchange gets even faster, Peter
Chan says he will be ready for it. He will be
running a lot more kilometres at night,
and maybe even cut down on cigarettes.
ATime-Zone
Advantage.
When the decision to float the
Australian dollar was announ-
ced last year on Friday 9th of
December, it generated a tidal wave of
speculation aboutthe possibility of Aust-
ralia becoming an offshore banking
centre. Politicians, lobbyists, financiers
and bankers all jumped onto the band-
wagon and aired their viewpoints.
Now, 10 months later, thecaseforan
offshore banking centre is still attracting
a lot of comment, especially from sup-
porters of the idea.
In effect, they say by creating such a
centre, it means loans will be raised here
and accounts settled in major trading
currencies like the SUS, Japanese Yen,
Deutschmark, Pound Sterling and the
Swiss Franc. Thus allowing Australia to
become an important centre for world
currency dealers and operators. It would
also increase Australia’s financial stature
in the world, especially in the Western
Pacific Region.
One of the key supporters of the
centre is Westpac’s managing director,
Mr. Bob White.
“Australia can only become an im-
portant financial centre if we open our
doors, and if our own banks can operate
internationally.”
“Australia needs to become an im-
portant financial centre for us to grow.”
he says. “And now we have an opportunity
to do so, but it doesn't have to be in
Sydney. Modern communications are so
advanced, it (offshore banking centre)
could be located in Sydney, Melbourneor
Perth ...”
Mr. White points out Australia’s geo-
graphical position gives us a unique
‘Time-Zone’ advantage over other coun-
tries, because Australia virtually stands
astride the Eastern and Western Hemi-
sphere money markets, and would bethe
first money market to open after New
York closes, and be open two hours
earlierthan Hong Kong or Singapore.
Therefore, an offshore banking centre
in Australia could bridge a time gap and
help provide a 24-hour cover extending
across the 3 major time zones from
Europe to Asia to America.
“Currently our time zone is dominated
by Hong Kong, Singapore and to some
extent Tokyo” say Mr. White. ‘‘But of
course, there is still some doubt about
the future of Hong Kong. For ustooperate
effectively we must develop a more
international flavour and offer more
benefits...”
One obstacle to Mr. White’s vision of
an offshore banking centre here, is the
local tax structure. Currently, banks op-
erating in Singapore are only taxed 10
cents in the dollar, but in Australia,
banks, like all companies are charged
the standard 46 cents in the dollar. On
top of this, both Singapore and Hong
Kong have had a lotmoretimetobecome
established and develop their facilities.
So even if clearance isgiventocreatethe
offshore banking centre, in Australia, we
still face stiff competition from our South
East Asian neighbours. Which is one of
the reasons why Mr. White supports
further de-regulation of the banking in-
dustry, and in particular the concept of
‘Reciprocal Access’ with foreign bank
entry.
"At Westpac, we believe in free enter-
prise, and we believe in competition” he
says. “And what’s more, we want to
operate effectively abroad. Buttodothat
and increase our influence in the Western
Pacific region especially, Australia must
open up its doors and let foreign banks
operate here as banks (not subsidiaries).
That way, we will be allowed to expand
into their countries as well. And the
stronger our banking industry is, the
stronger our case for an offshore banking
centre located here ...”

A writer’s adventures in panic
RON SAW
AT THE TABLE next to mine sat a war-
rior: a colonel in full fig, shoulders and
chest ablaze with brass and ribbons;
and with him was a boy perhaps 12, his
chest rather more quietly illuminated
with the golden cross of Sydney Gram-
mar.
“Hello,” said the colonel. “I know
you. Vietnam. You were that reporter
chap. Now, there's a bit of luck. My boy
here is very intested in journalism. He
was just asking me a few questions that
maybe you could answer.”
His boy looked at me, wide-eyed.
“Were you a war correspondent, sir?”
Well ...
THERE IS a popular belief, which I
suppose journalists should nourish, that
war correspondents are hard-drinkin’,
wisecrackin’, tough-as-guts, adventur-
ous, devil-may-care international lovers
like Errol Flynn or Humphrey Bogart. I
was closer to Woody Allen.
My first battle was on top of a hill
called the Horseshoe Feature, the al-
most-worn-away remains of a long-ex-
tinct volcano, not very far but not
very close, either to the South Viet-
namese town of Dat Do.
God alone knows what we were do-
ing there but the Viet Cong had booby-
trapped a school in Dat Do and the
Australians were on the balls of their
feet, teeth bared.
It was hot and dry and dusty but
quite pleasant, really. The only disturb-
ance came from an American battery
which fired vast projectiles into the
slumbering and lifeless jungle in “H and
I” (harassment and interdictment). The
noise was awful. If the things went off
100 times a night then I, lying perhaps
50 metres away, sprang off my blow-up
bed horizontal and rigidly so 100
times a night. I was glad when they told
me to go back to Nui Dat but even there
engines of war intruded.
No sooner had I recovered from this
lot than the US army flew me north to
Da Nang and from there, by some
ghastly mischance, to the besieged garri-
son at Khe Sanh.
Khe Sanh, they told me when it was
too late to get out of the aeroplane, had
been taking up to 1500 hostile shells a
day but now there could be even fewer
than 100. Everything went black.
Though it looked like a loosely-
tossed and blasted garbage heap, Khe
Sanh seemed pretty quiet.
I went for a tour of inspection, trying
to look as if I knew what I was doing,
with Murray Sayle who was there for
His Lordship Thomson of the London
Daily Express.
Whistles started blowing as we
walked and, far but not far enough
away, huge reddish-black columns
arose in the air. I sprinted for the shelter
of a sort of earthworks and lay beside it
trying feebly to burrow in.
Sayle, on the other hand, kept walk-
ing slowly, insouciantly. I think he was
swinging a walking-stick. If he wasn’t,
he looked as if about to.
When they blew the all-clear, I hur-
ried after him and told him that he was
carrying his air of Britannicus Sum
much too far. “You could be right,” he
said. “But your exhibition was not so
much raw courage as needless de-
fiance.”
“Eh ...?”
He pointed to my earthworks. On the
side away from where I’d been grovel-
ling, a huge red-and-white sign said:
“DANGER. HIGH EXPLOSIVES.”
I knew then that the Australians
needed me in the south and, pausing
only to inspect the bar amenities in Da
Nang and Saigon, I sped to a fire-sup-
port base from which tanks and mortars
were shooting into the Long Hai hills.
As I knew mortars from the movies,
they went off with a sort of gentle
“thwung.” These mortars, though,
caused me to leap not much less than
the big guns and I had to speak sharply
about it to an amiable sergeant-major.
“I s’pose they are a bit noisy,” he
said. “Never mind: we’ve got your mat-
tress in a nice, quiet, little one-man
bunker. And in the morning there’ll be a
decent shower over yonder ...”
“A shower! You beauty!”
“Yeah; there’s only one little
trouble: Some Charlie up in the Long
Hais keep on taking pot-shots at our
blokes who go for a bit of a scrub. But
don’t worry. He’s come close but he
hasn’t zapped anybody yet.”
I remembered in a flash that I’d had
a shower only that morning in Saigon
and would, almost certainly, have an-
other when I got back.
It was at that base that one of the
most disturbing factors of modern war-
fare became manifest: the Australians
regarded a reporter as somebody in the
charge of their public relations section
and, as they put out radio calls for heli-
copters, they would tell whomever was
listening that they had a “Papa Romeo
(PR) to be picked up.” I made another
stirring address.
“You’re making me sound like some
Italian grandfather,” I said. “What
would be wrong with just saying there’s
a reporter here to be picked up?”
I forget the precise reasoning but the
army’s rationale was that the army knew
nothing about reporters. We were just
PRs. “Or, if you like,” said the CSM,
“we can make it War Correspondent.”
“Well, that’s not really much more
accurate. But at least it doesn’t sound as
if the army’s host to a swarm of elderly
perves.”
“Okay, so we’ll make it WC, just for
you.”
“WC! That’s worse! So, now I’m a
dunny?” The army, which may or may
not have known that my first name is
Charles, solved the problem by telling
the world that Whisky Charlie needed a
chopper. □


The road to Australian apartheid
DAVID M c NICOLL
NEVER A DULL moment up in the
Top End. Remember a few months ago
I wrote about Alex Wood, head ranger
at the Katherine Gorge National Park?
He was about to get the flick because of
his belief that the magnificent parks of
the Northern Territory should belong to
all Australians and not be the exclusive
preserve of Aborigines.
Well, Alex Wood survived and is
about to descend on the south (on leave)
to present what he calls “damning evi-
dence” against Aboriginal land rights
legislation which he sees as discrimina-
tory against all other Australians.
Wood’s latest crusade concerns the
infuriated protest against the recent
closing by Aborigines of the road
through Arnhem Land to Nhulunbuy.
In the opinion of Wood and most
Territorians this is a main road and
permits to travel by it should be freely
available. As Senator Bernie Kilgariff
(NT) said last week: “It constitutes an
infringement of the public rights to
travel on what should surely be re-
garded as a public road.” Like other
Territorians, Kilgariff believes that the
Roper Highway and the Arnhem High-
way should meet at Nhulunbuy to com-
plete a major coastal road around Aus-
tralia with every Australian having
the right to travel on it.
I’ve said it before and I say it again
certain Aborigines and their white ma-
nipulators are doing their best to bring
apartheid to Australia.
ALEX WOOD, mentioned above, is an
inventive type. Recently, he had erected
in the Katherine Gorge region a sign
reading “Miniata Park. Wood’s Sacred
Site.” Quizzed about the sign, Wood re-
vealed that Miniata is the botanical
name of the Darwin Woolly Butt tree.
As for “sacred site,” he said: “In my

Well, Head Ranger Wood, I don’t

BRIAN DUNLOP is just back from
England where he worked on prelimi-
nary studies for his portrait of the
Queen (commissioned by the Victorian
Art Gallery).
He had four one-hour sittings (or
rather standings, as the Queen will be
on her feet in the portrait).
Alex Wood and his sacred site
No regalia, no trappings, no decor-
ations. The Queen will be hatless, in a
simple yellow dress, a few strands of
pearls and what Dunlop describes as an
amazing brooch a spray of wattle
made of diamonds.
Finishing off the portrait, Dunlop
had a change of surroundings from
the exquisite studio in Buckingham
Palace to a rather grotty loft in Mel-
bourne.
EVAN WHITTON, The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald’s European correspondent,
is one of the top flight of reporters
although this view may not be shared by
some of the people connected with the
Wran royal commission.
But, sadly, every now and then Mr
Whitton lets his fans down.
He let them down with a thud last
week when, writing of Petrov happen-
ings, he wrote: “This chance was nearly
lost; Menzies was holding a last cabinet
dinner prior to the elections, they were
all drunk and Wentworth had difficulty
in getting someone to come to the
phone.”
“They were all drunk”! This is surely
an outrageous assumption coming from
someone who was not there. And when
you look at some of the more upright
members of the Menzies team
Hasluck, Casey, Beale, McEwen,
Mcßride, Kent Hughes, Spicer,
McMahon the idea of them all being
drunk is quite ludicrous.
Interesting that the Melbourne Age,
which also used Whitton’s story, deleted
the “drunk” bit. Pity Granny didn’t do
the same.
Brian Dunlop: a no-frills portrait
THE newspapers and magazines of
Australia devote disproportionate space
to pontifications about wine.
Having said that, may I join the wine
discussion? Two new Australian cham-
pagnes - the Wolf Blass Chardonnay
Cuvee 1982 and the Seppelt Fleur de
Lys are pleasantly drinkable, though
still no threat to good French.
American expert Frank Stone was at
the tasting before the Expovin (Sydney
October 2 to 7). He gave rapturous
thumbs-up to Lindeman’s Fimestone
Ridge 1980 and the De Bertoli 1983
Sauterne. As I say, too much is written
about wine these days.
DON’T GET SICK in New Zealand.
That’s the message from an American
woman who visited Sydney a few
months ago. On her way home, she con-
tracted a severe bronchial condition (on
top of slight emphysema) and was
popped into hospital in a small city.
“The service at the hospital was pre-
historic,” she writes. “Don’t ever get
sick in New Zealand. It’s the absolute
pits ... Australia is 50 years ahead of
New Zealand. Don’t get me wrong
the people are lovely but the techniques
are turn-of-the-century ... like lancing
the artery in your groin with no
deadener, right in your bed in the ward,
to get a blood sample; then admitting
they goofed and would have to do it
again. After four days in that horrible
infirmary, was moved to (big city) hos-
pital. It was no better.”
She was finally flown home to Am-
erica where she entered intensive care in
a San Francisco hospital. □

In 1884 Joseph Handel Cutler set up
shop as a bespoke tailor in King Street,
Sydney, doing weskits, trousers and
floggertail coats for the likes of Edmund
Barton, Henry Parkes and Alfred
Deakin; for a young Welsh rabble-
rouser from Balmain named Billy
Hughes; and, quite possibly, good,
sturdy trousers for an ex-RN boatman
named William Stannard. Joseph’s son,
Leslie Frederick, succeeded to owner-
ship, moved the premises to Bligh

sering away through two world wars;
and his son, John Handel Lawson Cutler,
is managing director in this, the year of
the firm’s centenary. J.H.L. decided to
celebrate properly: on October 20 there
is to be a grand black-tie ball (white ties
being desirable, but, alas, almost ex-

The Aussie who really invented TV
PHILLIP ADAMS
NOT CONTENT with winning lots of
them, it was Graham Kennedy who first
named the Logies in honor of John
Logie Baird, who claimed to have in-
vented television. It now turns out that
those strange little statuettes should be
called the Suttons. Because it was a
Victorian, Henry Sutton, not a Pom,
who really invented television. For this
revelation I’m indebted to the CSIRO’S
Clive Coogan and today’s column relies
heavily on a fascinating speech he gave
at the Melbourne Club in July, 1981.
Coogan made Sutton’s acquaintance
by accident, when browsing in a library
in 1980. Prior to that chance meeting,
Victoria’s Leonardo da Vinci seemed to
be James Harrison of Geelong, who had
invented and built, in 1856, the first re-
frigerator in the world. The proof of its
pre-eminence lies in the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington where the an-
tique appliance is duly venerated.
Harrison was also the first editor of
the Geelong Advertiser and later the
Melbourne Age where, for 20 years, he
wrote the world’s first popular science
columns. He also made the first efforts
to ship frozen meat to England.
But, as Coogan points out, Sutton
transcends Harrison by several orders
of magnitude.
Henry’s father, Richard Sutton,
arrived in Australia in 1853 and
promptly joined the gold rush to Ballar-
at. Seeking amusement in his tent at
night, he set about constructing a con-
certina a device which had just been
invented in England by Charles
Wheatstone, the father of the telegraph.
Sutton’s concertina was an enormous
success in Ballarat. Seeing the possibil-
ity of an expanding business pun in-
tended Sutton sent to Melbourne for
a dray-load of the instruments. In so do-
ing, he accidentally established Sutton’s
Musical Emporia, famous to this day.
Henry was born in Ballarat in 1856,
left school at the age of 11 and he began
to educate himself. He started building
models and machines and won a multi-
tude of medals and prizes for drawing at
the Ballarat School of Design. At 10, he
had made observations of the flutter of
insect wings against smoked glass, de-
veloping these into a theory of flight.
By 14 he had read every book on sci-
ence and engineering in the library of
the Mechanics’ Institute and his claim
for the da Vinci title was well underway.
For he promptly constructed an orni-
thopter, one of those devices which flies
by flapping its wings. An astonished
witness described its ascent: “The ar-
rangement was wound up, gave one or
two flaps and immediately darted off in
a circular direction flying in a circum-
ference of about 12 feet. It could be ad-
justed to fly in right or left-hand circles
or to climb.”
This constituted the first experiment
in Australia on heavier-than-air flying
machines and considerably pre-dated
the work of Lawrence Hargrave. Thus,
at the age of 21 and without any formal
qualifications, Sutton was invited by the
Aeronautical Society of Great Britain to
submit papers on the topic.
At 14 Sutton also invented a new
type of dynamo which, being reversible,
could also function as an electric motor.
When it was rediscovered in Europe a
few years later, it was patented and be-
came known as the Gramme Dynamo
and not, sadly, the Sutton Dynamo. Ac-
cording to Coogan, it revolutionised the
use of electric power.
Before he was 25, the young Sutton
had invented a new type of lead storage
battery, a torpedo, a color printing pro-
cess, telegraphic facsimile and a method
of using gas and water pipes for tele-
graphic signalling.
And working in the isolation of Bal-
larat, far from the company of other
scientists or technicians, completely ig-
norant of Thomas Edison’s work, Sut-
ton invented a carbon filament lamp.
Sadly, Edison had invented the same
device just 16 days earlier.
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell in-
vented and patented the telephone (in
another of those historic photo-finishes
involving a rush to the patents labora-
tory) which was regarded as the marvel
of the century. The great Lord Calvin
went to Boston to examine it and pro-
nounced “pon my word” when he had.
Having read a sketchy description of
Bell’s invention in a copy of the Scien-
tific American , Sutton proceeded to in-
vent 20 different types of telephones.
Soon he had linked the Sutton Em-
porium to its warehouse with what was,
almost certainly, Australia’s first tele-
phone line. Shortly thereafter Bell
visited Ballarat, where he was duly as-
tonished by Sutton’s achievements.
Sutton rarely applied for patents be-
cause “he spurned material gain and
wanted to benefit fellow workers in sci-
ence.” But others were only too ready to
exploit his inventiveness and, as a re-
sult, 16 of his 20-plus phones were
patented by others.
There seems to be no end to Sutton’s
energies. A tireless and fascinating lec-
turer at the Ballarat School of Mines
(where he taught electricity and applied
magnetism) he also constructed the first
motor car in Australia and then made
another.
“It is the doctor’s phaeton to seat
two,” wrote Sutton, “for the box seat
can be added over the motor to take a
third person or luggage. The motor is
vertical, single cylinder, air cooled by
radiators. The oil feed is automatic:
there is perfect combustion and certain
ignition. There is no disagreeable odor
and no smoke. The motor is started
from the seat.”
In the course of building his cars,
Sutton invented two new types of carbu-
rettor and took out a patent in New
York for “explosion engines,” his term
for internal combustion. He made the
first triumphal trip by car from Mel-
bourne to Ballarat, escorted by mem-
bers of the Melbourne Cycle Club. And
a little later he moved a motion at a
meeting of automobile amateurs at the
Port Phillip Club Hotel, in Melbourne
which gave rise to the Royal Auto-
mobile Club of Victoria.
What else? Well in 1900 he built a
portable radio set, a walkie-talkie with a
range of 500 m. (It wasn’t Australia’s
first radio. Credit for that goes to Sir
Charles “Overland Telegraph” Todd,


Fig. 5.54 Schematic of Sutton’ T elephane’ devised 1885
[Sutton (1890), Fig 4)
his brilliant son-in-law William Henry
Bragg and his son, William Lawrence
Bragg. Later the Braggs became Austra-
lia’s first Nobel Prizemen and, accord-
ing to Coogan, deserved at least one
more for their work in molecular bi-
ology. It isn’t bragging to say that young
Bragg set the scene for the discovery of
“the double helix.”)
Sutton subsequently became one of
Australia’s first radio “hams” and was
granted a licence by the Commonwealth
Government to erect a wireless station
at his Malvern home.
Meanwhile he was experimenting
with stereoscopic photography, con-
structing pianos and greatly improving
the bicycle. And when he wasn’t busy
running Sutton’s business, he was also
fascinated by the macro and the micro
universes, being both an astronomer
and a microscopist.
But this brings us to undoubtedly his
greatest triumph. For Sutton also
devised the gadget that, even more than
the nuclear bomb, symbolises our cen-
tury: The boob tube. The idiot box. The
telly.
Apparently Sutton wanted the citi-
zens of Ballarat to see the Melbourne
Cup of 1885. So he invented the first
entirely feasible conception of tele-
vision.
“It had to use telegraph lines,” ex-
plains Coogan, “and these could not
transmit signals fast enough to follow
the flashing hooves. But it would have
been ample for more sedentary subject.
He demonstrated this later in London
with a measure of success and his paper
on the topic was reprinted in various
journals, including the Scientific Ameri-
can in 1910. Sutton called his instru-
ment not television but ‘the telephane’.”
While the parks of Australia are lit-
tered with statues of obscure generals
and corrupt, land-booming politicians,
you’ll find no bronze of Sutton. Even in
Ballarat, his effigy adorns no plinth. Yet
his contemporaries were proud of him
and celebrated his genius.
In The History of Ballarat, 2nd
edition, by William Bramwell Withers,
we learn of “this Ballarat scientist (who
has) won the recognition of the first men
of science in the world. And this is no
celibate aesthetic, scorning social de-
lights for, though a tireless worker, Mr
Sutton is a benedict and it is to be
devoutedly hoped that his wife shares
adequately in the enthusiasm of scien-
tific research. He is today working in
original paths as zealously as ever and
seldom retires before 3 o’clock a.m.
“Such a worker as Henry Sutton is,
may plead on virtue’s side against a
vicious mass of base and brutal ‘larri-
kin’ lust and indolence against a city
full of vain inanities and the growing
passion for endless amusements, and
strident, unmannerly irreverence.”
Henry Sutton died in Ballarat at the
early age of 58, of heart failure and
chronic nephritis. He is buried in
Brighton Cemetery. In a glowing obitu-
ary in the Ballarat paper they said of
him: “He kept the flywheel of his brain
spinning.”
Little was he to know that his inven-
tion, television, would stop the fly-
wheels of millions of others. □


BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
How the Colliwobbles flattened the Magpies
COLLINGWOOD is an industrial sub-
urb in Melbourne famous for the manu-
facture of shoes, starting price bookies,
two-up and a football team called the
Magpies a team blessed with more
tradition than the Grenadier Guards,
Royal Horse Artillery and United States
Marines combined.
Time was when children born in the
Collingwood district were expected to
sign a form swearing eternal loyalty be-
fore leaving maternity hospital. The
winning of a Collingwood
guernsey was always con-
sidered on a par with winning
the Order of Merit or the
Nobel Prize. If a judge of the
High Court had also played
football for Collingwood,
upon receiving his eternal re-
ward, the newspaper in their
obituaries, naturally, would
mention first that he was a for-
mer Collingwood footballer.
However, only the old and
venerable can remember
when Collingwood most re-
cently won a premiership. The
year was 1958 and they look
back on it as a never-to-be-
forgotten one like a year of
the century for great
burgundies.
There is a new word in the
language and I am sure it has
made all the modern diction-
aries: “Colliwobbles”. This is
a deep-seated infectious virus
that has affected Collingwood
since the late 50s. Almost
everything has been tried, from using
Gough Whitlam as number one ticket-
holder through to (shudder) the ap-
pointment of a coach who had never
played for Collingwood, through to
(double shudder) the invasion of a pep-
up team from South Yarra.
Yet the fans remain loyal and about
twice as many are infected with the as-
tonishing VFL passion as those of al-
most any other club. For the recent
semi-final against Fitzroy, they had a
curious tendency to dress up. I noticed
some young ladies who adorned them-
selves with pictures of every member of
the team. With the modern rules that
allow reserves plus interchange players,
this can mean at least 25 players. Some
members of the cheer squad they are
sort of high priests, like Jesuits to the
Catholic church dressed themselves
as black and white minstrels and others
covered their faces in alternative strips
of black boot polish and white zinc
cream. This display of club colors was
akin to war paint.
Well, the deadly Colliwobbles is a
disease like cancer, multiple sclerosis
and the common cold: the greatest
scientists cannot find a cure. The Mag-
pies beat Fitzroy, thrashed the formid-
able Carlton in the second semi, and
seemed to be in the greatest surge since
58.
Commentator Lou Richards, known
Collingwood coach John Cahill: not going into extra time
THE AGE
here as “Kiss of Death,” went on to pre-
dict that this was the Magpie year and
announced there would be a great vic-
tory over Essendon in the preliminary
final. The Colliwobbles struck again, in
their most lethal form. As you know,
Essendon won by 133 points the
greatest preliminary final margin ever.
Could I give you just a small range of
the Melburnian headlines over that fate-
ful weekend?

TURN TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Regrettably, only one club can win
the premiership. Who gets the blame?
Not the president, not the committee,
not the selectors, not even the players.
The coach is the villain. Therefore, at
the end of the season, the 11 unsuccess-
ful coaches are taken out and shot.
But things are becoming worse. Just
lately, they have taken to shooting
coaches in mid-season. Mr Tony Jewell
had to walk the plank at St Kilda in
mid-1984. It is remarkable how short
life is at a club that should be concerned
with the hereafter. In the past decade
they have had Allan Jeans, Ross Smith,
Mike Patterson, Alex Jesaulenko, Jewell
and now Graeme Gellie
whose job is rather less secure
than if he worked for GM-H.
The word is that Darrel
Baldock, former Saintly cap-
tain, will decide this week
whether to take the job.
North Melbourne finished
11th on the ladder this year
and coach Barry Cable, after
a three-season stint, already
has returned to Western Aus-
tralia. The commentators
have been warning that Mike
Patterson, coach of Rich-
mond, and Tom Hafey, at
Geelong, are in danger of a
night of the long knives.
Hafey denies utterly that his
life is in danger.
Ranald Macdonald, by the
most brilliant footwork since
Arthur Murray, managed to
survive as president at Col-
lingwood but people were
walking on the other side of
the road and ducking down
manholes when they saw
coach John Cahill. No Magpie can en-
dure such a de-feathering and live. Even
though he dragged them up to the third
position on the ladder, Cahill resigned
on Wednesday evening.
It is very dangerous. In 1982, Hafey
at Collingwood and Royce Hart at
Footscray also met their demise in mid-
season. Coach life expectancy is down
to something like 18 months.
We have been making a survey and
we estimate that nigh on 62 coaches
have been interred since 1973.
There has been recent worry in Vic-
toria about the over-culling of kanga-
roos. I believe that we are culling
coaches at too severe a rate. They
should be under the protection of the
conservation ministry.
The government should take very
careful note of their breeding rate and
no more culling should occur without a
written permit. □

COVER STORY
Asians in Australia:
more harmony than hatred
Springvale shops: “No worries,” said the young Vietnamese with the Carlton Football Club patch on his jacket
To investigate the months of verbal brawling about racial tension, The Bulletin
went to the front lines of contact with Indo-Chinese migrants. BRUCE
STANNARD and SUSAN MOLLOY report that they found many irritations but
also much acceptance.
OUTSIDE Cabramatta’s Bing Lee de-
partment store (“biggest bargains this
side of Hong Kong”), an ingenious
barefoot busker in faded denims and
with a head of wild ginger hair and a
matching moustache was somehow
coaxing an amplified musical cacoph-
ony out of a bass drum, a guitar, cym-
bals, a tambourine and a mouth organ.
In the nasal drone of a 60s folk singer,
he wailed an old Joan Baez number
about peace and love and the brother-
hood of man.
As the incantation filtered along
busy John Street, Vietnamese, Chinese
and Laotian shoppers regarded this
example of culture with the kind of pol-
ite though excessive caution which tour-
ists usually reserve for king cobra
charmers in Calcutta.
Still, many smiled bravely and
nodded and tossed whatever small
change they could spare into a cap
which rested on a crude cardboard sign.
“HELP!" it said. In Cabramatta, the
heartland of Sydney’s Asian commu-
nity, that is one plea which everyone re-
cognises.
When Trinh Van Phuc and his family
finally reached Darwin in 1978, after an
epic six-week voyage in a 10-metre boat,
“help” was the only English word he
knew. He had painted it in big, white
letters on the board he waved at the
navy patrol boat that spotted them and
guided them in.
“If an Australian asks for help,” he
said in the almost flawless English he
now commands, “then, of course, we
have a duty to help. We have very little
but, whatever it is, we share it willingly.
“All of us have suffered. We know
what it is to seek help and to receive it.”
Whatever is shared, Australia has
witnessed six months of verbal brawling
about racial tension since Professor
Geoffrey Blainey who heads Melbourne
University’s history department first
issued his warning about effects of
Asian immigration. Bulletin reporters
went to the outer suburbs of Sydney and
Melbourne, to the front lines of contact
between Australians and Indo-Chinese
migrants, to observe relations between
the races.
The suburbs chosen were Cabra-
matta and Springvale. These were the
ones nominated by Blainey as most like-
ly to show tension.
In a newspaper article published at
the end of August, Blainey said: “In
comfortable suburbs, in many schools
and offices, the relations between indi-


Cabramatta, Sydney’s little Saigon: genuine community strength drawn from cultural and racial differences
vidual Asians and Australians
are excellent.
“Those who know only
those relationships and who
never venture into the suburbs
where so many Asians have
congregated have no idea of
the social tensions. In parts of
Springvale and Cabramatta,
for example, the different cul-
tures jostle and elbow and
misunderstand each other.
The economic tensions are
also acute.”
One might half expect to
find in these suburbs com-
munities sharply divided and
hunkered down behind bristl-
ing ethnic barricades. But any
such expectation is a gross
distortion of the reality.
Among the Australians in these
suburbs is some hostility toward the
Vietnamese, much dull resentment,
some complaints about irritations.
There is also to be found, however, co-
operation, friendship and a strong and
vital community spirit.
FAR FROM turning from the Asian
community, Cabramatta people seem to
be enjoying yet another aspect of what
has long been a particularly rich multi-
cultural existence. They are attending
classes in everything from the Mandarin
language to Tai-chi (Chinese shadow-
boxing exercises), Kung-fu and table
tennis. There is even an Australian in
the local Lion Dance team and plans
have been made for Chinese and Viet-
namese cooking classes, as well.
Ray Mathews with Chou Ky Thay: “This bloke’s a real gem”
Some, of course especially among
the young unemployed and the elderly
feel threatened by the number of
Asians suddenly plonked in their midst.
But the anger is directed not so much
toward the people as toward the govern-
ment bureaucrats who put them there.
“They’re very nice when you get to
know them,” said Thelma Collins, a re-
tired army nurse who has lived in
Cabramatta for 20 years. “We’ve got
Asian families on both sides of us and
we natter over the fence the way you
would with dinkum Aussies. They’re
very clean and tidy. They are polite and
quiet. They mind their own business.
Not what we expected. It’s just ... the
numbers, there are so-many of them and
they came so suddenly.
“Governments have always used
Cabramatta as a dumping ground for
refugees and migrants. No
thought seems to be given to
the consequences. They (the
government) adopt a ‘She’ll
be right, mate’ approach.
“We are at least making an
effort to get to know and
understand them but I know
others who wouldn’t give
them the time of day. It’s a
shame but there are people so
shut-tight against any notion
of change that no amount of
talk is going to make them any
different. We take the view
that a human being is a hu-
man being whether he’s black,
brown or indigo. We’re
Australians; we believe in a
fair go and we’re prepared to
give it to them. God knows, they deserve
at least that after what they’ve been
through.”
There was an understandable tension
four years ago when the first large num-
bers of Asian refugees arrived in
Cabramatta but that tension seems to
have resolved itself in most cases in a
sense of acceptance. In others, it is a
matter of resignation.
Ken Barnard who owns and runs
E. H. Hibble, Cabramatta’s biggest real
estate agency, has lived in the district all
his life and recently has paid particular
attention to the growth of the Asian
community. “I’ve heard all this media
talk about racial tension,” he said, “but
if any of these so-called academic ex-
perts bothered to come out here and
meet people they would see that we are
doing very well indeed.


“In many respects, Cabramatta is
much more tolerant of racial and cul-
tural differences because we’ve had to
live with them for so long.
“It may sound like a contradiction
but we draw a genuine community
strength from those cultural differences.
No one out here wants to be stamped
out of a mould like so many clones.
Cabramatta’s people come from a
dozen different ethnic backgrounds and
they’re intensely proud of that diversity.
“Where else in Sydney can you find a
Yugoslav delicatessen next to a Viet-
namese restaurant next to a Polish sol-
icitor’s office next to an Indian doctor’s
surgery?
“Of course we’ve got bigots here but
they’re nowhere near as savage as those
outside this community. People in
Cabramatta have for the most part a
shared experience: Politics or wars or
both have driven them from their home-
lands; they’ve come here for a fresh
start. Poles and Yugoslavs
and Vietnamese have got
these things in common.
“There is, I think, an arrog-
ant tendency particularly in
political and academic circles
to underestimate the com-
mon good sense of ordinary
working-class Australians.
The people who are doing all
the worrying about ‘racial ten-
sion’ seem to be headline-
grabbing politicians and
middle-class academics who
have never even been here.
“Professor Blainey talks
about the need for ‘shared
values.’ These people do share
Australian values. They aren’t
peasant farmers who’ve been
hauled out of a rice paddy:
They are urban middle-class,
very intelligent and very keen
to get on with the business of
getting on.
“Like the so-called dinky-
di Aussies, they want a home
and security for their families.
The big difference is that, instead of
whingeing about work, they go out and
get stuck into it. They’re certainly not
lazy. I’ve seen Asian blokes come here
with nothing and work and work and
work until, pretty soon, they get what
they want. They learn English at night
and, although they don’t drink beer like
your average Aussie, they’re very soci-
able.”
Those sentiments were echoed by
Phin Tang, a welfare worker with the
Indo-China Chinese Association. “You
get the odd racial slur from some young
kid who doesn’t know any better,” he
said, “but it is absolutely wrong to say
that there is any real racial tension here
likely to boil over into communal viol-
ence. That’s just not on.

“The Asian community A well aware
that, physically and culturally, it does
stand out from Other sections of the
community. But people can’t change the
way they look, any more than they can
change their cultural identity. And nor
should they.
“I can’t believe anyone would want
an Australia where everyone shares the
same outlook, the same views. There is a
tremendous strength in our ethnic diver-
sity and I think more and more people
are coming to realise that.”
Reg Vesperman, secretary-manager
of the Cabra-vale ex-servicemen’s club,
is another who endorses the view that
the district is far from being a hotbed of
racial tension. “I’ve spent 38 years
here,” he said, “and I think I know the
people reasonably well. Sure
you’ve got the ‘typical westies’
the people who want
nothing more out of life than
their football, their pokies,
their meat pies and their
Holden cars and they’re the
ones who don’t want a bar of
change and then you’ve got
a lot of others who don’t share
those okker values at all. They
are people who have come
from European backgrounds;
they know what it is to be dis-
possessed, to be tossed out
and to leave all that’s comfort-
able and familiar and secure a
long way behind. So there is a
good deal of sympathy out
here for what the Indo-
Chinese have been through.
“Many of the Europeans
have come out here to get
away from repressive commu-
nist regimes, too. The old-
guard Aussies are, I’m afraid,
set in their ways and you’re
not going to change them. But I see
signs of acceptance and welcome for the
Indo-Chinese every day. I look out my
office window in the morning and see
the little Asian kids toddling off to
school across the park hand in hand
with the little Aussie kids. If that’s not a
positive sign, I don’t know what is.
“They have become members of our
club and, although they don’t stand at
the bar swilling beer all night, they en-
joy a little flutter on the pokies and they
are quite sociable. I think they are
making the effort to join our society, to
get to know us.
“It wouldn’t hurt if a few more
Aussies made a bit of an effort to meet
them half-way.”
Ray Mathews is one man who has


Nikhom Panith and family: in Australia dreams can come true
KEVIN BROWN
done precisely that. Mathews,
a nuggety truckdriver, rolled
into the Chinese Buddhist
Association’s Cabramatta
temple while I was talking
with 50-year-old Cambodian
curator Chou Ky Thay.
Mathews makes a regular stop
at the temple so he can chat
with Thay, a former importer-
exporter who escaped from
Phnom Penh after the rest of
his family was butchered by
Pol Pot’s troops.
“This bloke’s a real gem,”
Mathews said as he threw an
arm around the beaming
Thay. “His English may not
be great but every time I walk
in here he makes me bloody
welcome. There’s not a lot of
places a man cops a salute like
that.”
Mathews, a former 2nd
RAR trooper in Vietnam,
stopped to help a motorist
with a flat tyre recently and
discovered that the man was a former
South Vietnamese soldier with whom
Mathews had shared a hospital ward in
Saigon. “Great people,” he said. “I
reckon, if you gave them a block of land
up by Ayers Rock they’d be growing
cabbages within a year. I think
Australians have a lot to learn from
them.
“They’re not out here banging tam-
bourines on street corners and preach-
ing Buddhism, they’re not ramming
their beliefs down our throats, so why
should we be insisting on their be-
coming instant Aussies?
“These are people who know what it
is to have their freedom snatched from
under them; they’re here to create a new
life for themselves. Anyone who says
Cabramatta veteran Reg Vesperman: “Signs of acceptance”
KEVIN BROWN
they can’t fit in because they don’t share
our values just doesn’t know them. I’d
like to see some of those loudmouth
Canberra politicians come out here and
get to know them before they shoot
from the lip the way they have been do-
ing.”
Not all of the Indo-Chinese in
Cabramatta have been successful as has
Nikhom Panith, a 31-year-old Laotian,
but his story brings together the threads
of so many of the others. Panith, a for-
mer narcotics expert with the United
States AID agency in Vientiane, and his
wife Thong Lo braved communist
troops and gunboats to swim the vast
and muddy breadth of the Mekong Riv-
er and reach safety in Thailand in 1978.
After three years in Thai camps, they
were chosen for resettlement in Austra-
lia.
“We came without a cent in our
pockets,” he said, “but we had a dream
and we realised that, in Australia, such
dreams can come true.”
Panith worked as a process worker,
his wife worked in a factory. They
scrimped and saved enough money to
lease premises and start Cabramatta’s
first Indo-Chinese butcher shop. They
own the shop now, as well as the nearby
80-Bo restaurant and a frozen chicken
processing business. Their next project
is to start an Indo-Chinese club in
Cabramatta.
“Once, when I ate in the factory can-
teen,” Panith said, “my Australian
workmates threw scraps of food at me
and said, ‘Go home, Asian bastard.’ I
told them, ‘Look, I am a Catholic.
Christ teaches a belief in the universal
brotherhood of man. I love you as my
brothers. Why not try to love me?’ From
that moment on I had no
more trouble from my
Australian brothers.”
SPRINGVALE has the bland
suburban air of a nice place in
which to bring up children. It
is an area housing 84,000
souls, 67 percent of whom are
under the age of 35. It is a sub-
urb of young families repre-
senting more than 20 ethnic
groups. With 4000 residents
from Indo-China, it is the sub-
urb with the greatest concen-
tration of Vietnamese in Mel-
bourne. But it is not the sub-
urb with the strongest feeling
or flavor of a “little Vietnam.”
This feeling is to be found in
Richmond, in the inner city.
There, Victoria Street bustles
with Vietnamese grocers,
shops, restaurants, video out-
lets, pinball parlors and street
life.
Springvale has very few
Vietnamese shops and the oc-
casional Chinese restaurant, long sym-
bols of Australian eating habits.
The city of Springvale embraces
suburbs such as Keysborough and
Noble Park. All neat, clean, planned
and pruned, the area smacks of honest
money and television lives. Modern
brick veneer bungalows sit squarely in
clipped gardens. It looks newly middle-
class, with aspirations for more. It has
its share of pizzerias, Greek continental
grocers’ shops, Kentucky Fried Chick-
en, Red Rooster, Woolworths, Pizza
Hut and an Aussie Fried Chicken out-
let. There is no racist graffiti just the
incidental, undirected obscenity.
Not far from this this ordered sub-
urbia lies the Springvale Migrant
Centre, titled Enterprise. Australian

It’s important to the future of this country that
enough people believe in and invest in its vast natural
resources. In so many ways, BP Australia has been
doingiust that.
Once again, BP is backing Australian energy.
But this time the energy takes the form of work,
sweat, determination and all the other qualities that
make up a tennis champion.
As well as sponsoring the Davis Cup team,
SSBM/8P195
BP is also supporting the new Tennis Achievers
programme, which is pledged to finding good junior
players and turning them into great senior players.
By helping to develop these
precious ‘resources’, BP hopes that
Australia may soon re-emerge as a
tennis power.

flags flutter above its two-storey brick
accommodation units. The blocks bear
names such as Elm, Birch and Wattle.
Young Australian native trees and
shrubs are planted in neat order. The
only noteworthy thing that has hap-
pened recently at Enterprise was when
two Vietnamese lesbians were asked to
leave after failing to close their curtains.
The nocturnal show and the audience of
young boys proved too much for man-
agement.
According to the 1981 census, the
biggest number of immigrants to
Springvale came from the United King-
dom and Eire, then Yugoslavia, Italy
and Asia. One-third of Springvale’s
population was born overseas.
A. G. Curry Real Estate has been in
the area for 25 years and the agency’s
Malcolm Sloane told The Bulletin that
the people who were buying houses
after a year or two of renting in the area
were mainly Vietnamese. The cost of a
weatherboard is around $56,000, a brick
veneer from $60,000 to $lOO,OOO.
People, Sloane said, tended to live in
the area for about five years and 30 per-
cent of home-buying was done as an in-
vestment before moving on.
Prices have risen with so
many Vietnamese anxious to
buy houses.
“When the Greeks and
Italians moved in, a lot of
Australians moved out,”
Sloane said. “Now the Viet-
namese are moving in and a
lot of the Greeks and Italians
are moving out: It is a cycle in
this area; there is a high turn-
over.”
The Bulletin spoke with
many shopkeepers and shop-
pers on a weekday in the cen-
tral shopping area of
Springvale itself. The younger
the person, the less they
liked Vietnamese. However,
nothing was said in anger by
either European immigrants
or Australian-born. The reac-
tion, slightly one of a siege
mentality, was more of quiet
resignation than of hatred.
The spacious suburbia of
outer Melbourne seems to
have countrified the locals. Free from
the tensions of dense high-rise living or
city closeness, with a municipal unem-
ployment of only 2600 and a local coun-
cil which vigorously supports
multiculturalism, people spoke either
with friendliness or with mild irritation
at the latest influx of immigrants.
The typical reaction of people to
whom The Bulletin spoke was to preface
their remarks with the words “I’m not a
racist but ...” Many had unfavorable
anecdotes or complaints but, signifi-
cantly, often they talked about someone

else’s unhappy experience not their
own. There was no aggressive racism,
just a low-key resentment among those
who did not like the Vietnamese. These
people asked that their names not be
used.
A middle-aged Greek woman said:
“I think they are very nice people. They
are very polite. Unfortunately, most
people do not feel like this.
“The only thing I do not like is, they
are not very considerate. Even in their
driving habits, they push in. I don’t
think they know their road rules. They
are dangerous. I tell you, if 1
am going to make a right-
hand turn, I wait to see what
they are doing because you
never know.”
A female shopkeeper born
in Australia of Greek parents:
“Speaking to must customers,
I see a lot of them shifting out
of Springvale. The area has
dropped a lot. The value of
houses is falling. Neighbors
say, ‘Oh, Vietnamese are mov-
ing in.’ I personally don’t
think they are doing much to
upgrade the area; they seem
to be lowering the standard
but I’ve never noticed them
being boisterous or causing
trouble in that respect,
they’re all right.
“They do stick up for
themselves a lot but I suppose
that’s like the Greeks and Ital-
ians when they first came
here.
“I hate being prejudiced. I
have a girlfriend who is Chinese. These
people have their ways and it will take a
few years for them to act right. But, if
more of them arrive, we may be forced
to leave. They are gradually taking over
but I’m not condemning that. They’ve
got to be somewhere.
“I hear people and I can see with my
own eyes and it’s funny, they have such
beautiful cars, you wonder how they do
it.
“I don’t have them on my doorstep,
so they don’t get on my nerves, but I
have a customer who lives near them


Cabramatta may be changing but the signs of old Australia cling on
and she says they are
unhygienic they urinate
around the doorstep. I don’t
think people would say things
like that if they didn’t happen,
do you?”
A young Australian traffic
officer: “It’s a touchy situation
but that’s only because no
Vietnamese can speak Eng-
lish. If they spoke English, it’d
be all right.”
A middle-aged Australian
female shopkeeper: “They are
taking over. They’re hopeless
drivers, absolutely hopeless.
They think they’re still in their
own country and they come in
and barter with us for lower
prices. They’re not into
cleanliness, that’s for sure. We
certainly live different lives,
don’t we?”
A young female shop as-
sistant: “It’s hard to say when
you’re put on the spot. It’s bet-
ter when you’re angry. Some
of them are very arrogant. They barter
all the time. What bugs me most is their
driving.”
A young female clerk: “A lot of the
other migrants are dead against them
because of the grants they get handed
out which they (the others) never got.
“I don’t know if we can absorb so
many. How many can you absorb and
integrate into society without changing
its structure? I have mixed feelings
about it.”
A middle-aged Australian house-
wife: “Their kids are unrestrained. I
The new face of Cabramatta: Orient and Occident at ease
really don’t believe a lot of them are
refugees. Look at the money they have
and their cars. Before you know it,
they’ve bought a house and a lot pay
cash for the houses.
“They are coming in so freely, com-
pared with other nationalities. And who
are they? They could be anything. They
are not true refugees. They start
businesses within two years. How many
of us could do that?
“Where do they get their money
from?”
An Australian male shopkeeper:
“The ones who come into my shop can
speak English. I like them, I find they’re
very polite. My word, there is a feeling
against them especially among other
nationalities.”
A young male Australian shopkeep-
er: “They’re good customers. They don’t
mind spending their money. If I was
over there, I would pal up with other
Australians like they stick together here.
“It doesn’t worry me if they come
here: We have plenty of room.”
An English immigrant: “I shouldn’t
speak too badly because I’m an immi-
grant myself but I can’t see why South
Africans and Rhodesians aren’t allowed
in; they would integrate better.
“Springvale has always been very
ethnic but we have lost some Greeks
and Italians who have moved out.
“I don’t want to be a racist but, per-
sonally, I don’t think it is a good idea
that so many are coming out. I would
think Australians and other migrants
are concerned but no one says it.”
And so on. It is a litany of mixed
irritations. Says Jenny Slade, manager
of community services at the Springvale
Town Hall: “I am sure you get name-
calling in schools and I am
sure some individuals get a
bad time from their neighbors
but it is on an individual
basis.
“We have our bully boys
but we don’t have a density of
living, so we don’t get the ten-
sions that could happen in in-
ner-city suburbs. We’ve only
ever had isolated examples of
racism.”
Merle Mitchell, director of
the Springvale Community
Aid and Advice Bureau which
has been operating since 1971,
said Springvale had seen spas-
modic large influxes of Turks,
South Americans and Yugo-
slavs in the past decade. Each
group had felt a certain
amount of prejudice until a
new group arrived and the
fears had been transferred to
the latest influx.
Mitchell said she had
asked Blainey to visit Spring-
vale. He had declined.
The Vietnamese to whom The Bul-
letin spoke either did not speak
sufficient English to comment or said
they were too busy with their Vietnam-
ese-oriented businesses to nptice any
prejudice. One confided that “bad”
things had happened to him in the six
years he had been in Australia but said
being quoted on them would not be
good for his business.
A young Vietnamese man sporting a
Carlton Football Club patch on his
denim jacket, summed it up: “No
worries.” □

We believe it is this philosophy

Graham Greene: reflections
on death and life
Distinguished author Graham Greene, at 80, pronounces himself to be “not as
manic and not as depressive. ” But in an interview with MARTIN AMIS he
discloses a “morbid ” listing of dead friends and persisting concerns and dreams.
“ALL MY FRIENDS ... are dead. One
finds that one’s acquaintances die at the
rate of 19 or 20 a year. That would in-
clude only about four that one has
known well. I keep a rather morbid list.
Yes, with a cross against the ones I
knew really well.”
“How do you feel when another one
goes? Does it leave the life that remains
feeling thinner?”
“I think it does a bit. Evelyn Waugh
I was shocked by his death. One is
shocked when a bit of one’s life disap-
pears. I felt that with Omar Torrijos (the
Panamanian leader). I think that’s why,
in the case of Torrijos, I embarked on
what I hoped would be a memoir* but
turned into a rather unsatisfactory
blend of things. I felt that a whole seg-
ment of my life had been cut out.”
“That list of yours: It must be quite a
long list by now.”
“Oh yes.”
It is, I believe, fairly common to feel
a tremor of intimate recognition on
your first glimpse of Graham Greene.
Like most literate residents of the
planet, you have known this presence
(cool, fugitive, slightly sinister) all your
reading life and here he is. He stands
at the entrance to his Paris apartment,
erect and inquisitive. The pale, head-
masterly face is impassively well-pre-
served and, in its outlines, seems no
different from the photographs on the
three-shilling Penguin books of the 50s:
long upper lip, frowning forehead, the
moistly clouded stare. His clothes, too,
are the expected mixture of greens and
browns; the lank tie heavily knotted
(with the thin end out-dangling the
thick). The only obvious infirmity he
suffers is an arthritic little finger; his
handshake is gently and appropriately
masonic.
“Do you have any particular feelings
about turning 80?
“No, except annoyance at all this
fuss and halloo ... One thing I did en-
joy was going up to Bury St Edmunds to
The young Graham Greene: he retains his sympathy for the dream of communism
the Greene King Brewery and doing a
mash the first stage of brewing. By
October, there will be 100,000 bottles
with a special label with my signature
on it. It’s their strongest beer. They’re
very good, Greene King.
“Now, that I liked .. . Otherwise,
well, I get tired more easily, I begin to
forget names. I’m in rather better health
than I was five years ago when I had a
cancer operation. I’m on a plateau. I’m
not as manic and I’m not as depress-
ive.”
The flat is spacious but not airy.
Through the closed second-floor win-
dows come the usual sounds (trium-
phant and hysterical) of mobilettas on
the Boulevard Malsherbes. The English
Sunday newspapers are fanned on the
table, along with a copy of the Spectator
open at the correspondence page.
Greene’s accent is thoroughly European
and the Rs are candidly Gallic; when he
says, “Belief is rational and faith is irra-
tional," the stressed words sound exact-
ly the same. He has the demeanor and
habitat of a retired civil servant or (just
possibly) an exiled spy a quiet
Englishman, a confidential agent, a
third man.
Veteran interviewees have a reper-
toire and Greene relied on his anecdotal
store to begin with the time he joined
the Communist Party “in hopes of get-
ting a free trip to Moscow,” the time he
requested electric-shock treatment from
a psychiatrist friend, the time he was de-
ported from Puerto Rico by the Ameri-
can authorities, his experiments with
Benzedrine while writing The Confiden-
tial Agent (in the mornings) and The
Power And The Glory (in the after-
noons), before the war.
Sensing my familiarity with these
stories (I had just read the collected es-
says and the two volumes of autobiogra-
phy), Greene said: “As you see, I’ve got
nothing new to say. One’s said it all in
one’s work.
“It was embarrassing at the National
Film Theatre the other day ... I’d just
received Quentin Falk’s book about my
experiences with film and films and I
had time to read it beforehand. Luckily,
it had been published only the day be-
fore. Because every word that I uttered

in response to questions at the NFT had
been taken from this book. I’d got ab-
solutely nothing further to contribute.”
“You certainly get about a good
deal.”
“I haven’t much this year,” said
Greene who has visited Switzerland,
England, Italy, Spain, Antibes and now
Paris in the past couple of months. “I’ve
resisted the temptation of Panama, at
least. I love long plane journeys, es-
pecially if I’m being paid fpr and I’m
travelling first-class.
“I used to go to Panama via Amster-
dam to avoid going to the United States
a 15-hour journey, which I loved. I
drank a lot of Bols gin and I read. And
there were no telephones and no letters.
It’s like being in a hospital. I’m very
happy in a hospital. Nobody can really
get at you.”
The telephone rang. “Another pro-
fessor,” sighed Greene.
“You say you avoid going to the
United States ...”
“Well, I don’t like the United States.
And I don’t like New York. I don’t like
the electricity I don’t like getting an
electric shock whenever I touch a door
handle. I don’t like the dirt and, on the
whole with many exceptions I don’t
like Americans.
“They strike me rather as the English
abroad strike me: noisy and incredibly
ignorant of the world.
“I had a woman who came to see me
from Houston the other day and she
was the most incredibly stupid woman
I’ve ever known. And she was a graduate.
We talked about the Central American
situation, she’d never heard of it. She’d
never heard of any troubles down there.
Later, she wrote to me saying that she’d
talked to her colleagues about what I’d
said and she found to her astonishment
that a lot of them agreed with me.
“Reagan is a menace. I’m very disap-
pointed by the death of Andropov; I
had great hopes of him.
“I preached for some years that any
reform in Russia could only come not
from the old men or the army but from
the KGB. A Polish film director told me
that the KGB let the army go to Afghan-
istan in order to get their feet in the mud
... Despite the obvious noises Reagan
has been making, he’s as extreme as
anyone in the Kremlin. I’m amused and
interested by the fact that he’s meeting
Gromyko but I have a feeling that
Gromyko will not be helping the re-
election. He will have a clever move to
damage it. I don’t think he will allow
Reagan to pass himself off as a peace-
maker.
“I felt the shadow darken when
Reagan came to power. But perhaps
we’re all getting used to the idea. Per-
haps the next generation will live under
this shadow even more equably than
your own.
The ageing Greene: would rather end his days in the Gulag than in California
“I’ve got a secret dream that
(Libya’s) Colonel Gaddafi will get hold
of a couple of nuclear bombs and drop
them somewhere. America and Russia
will come together to extinguish the
danger and might never entirely separ-
ate.”
We lunched in moderate bourgeois
splendor at a Right Bank brasserie. The
lordly waiters seated Monsieur Greene
with some reverence and listened
shrewdly to his request for a ‘‘martini
dry. Sec! Tres, tres sec.” He added: “I
never do what the doctors tell me. I
think the body knows better than the
doctor. I never eat vegetables. Castro
was shocked. He said, ‘What regime do
you have?’ His was very strict, you see. I
said, ‘I don’t have one. I eat and drink
what I like.’
“So, if the body says: ‘Have a
drink ...’
“Then I drink.”
GREENE was drinking moderately
but with relish the following night. By
coincidence he has befriended my best
friend in Paris, a youngish (English) art-
ist who went down to Antibes several
years ago to paint Greene for the Na-
tional Portrait Gallery. So a picnic din-
ner was arranged at the private wine-
cellar of another common friend. Old
friends die but new ones are born and
Greene clearly has something like a ge-
nius for friendship. Friendship is com-
plicated too, however, and nothing
about Greene is uncomplicated. Con-
trary impressions must be dealt with.
He is an ideologue. You sense that
his beliefs are embedded in past
struggles and ascendancies. (In Catholic
Central America, with its hot and cold
wars, the old polarities are still vivid.)
His life and work have been
grounded on faith and on its opposites
and counterparts: loyalty and betrayal,
stoicism and doubt. He is fond of quo-
ting Robert Browning: “Our interest’s
on the dangerous edge of things. The
honest thief, the tender murderer, the
superstitious atheist...” and Greene al-
ways has been drawn to moral
banditlands. “Human beings are more
important to believers than they are to
atheists,” he has said. But they are less
important too, in a sense, and we re-
member Bendrix’s remark in The End
Of The Affair that even with love we get
“to the end of other people” and must
look for something else.
“There is a certain sympathy,”
Greene said, “which the present Pope
doesn’t seem to recognise, between the
believing communist and the believing
Catholic ... I don’t feel as though I’ve
changed much since I joined the Inde-
pendent Labor Party at the age of 27.
Curiously enough, there’s an Indian
woman who’s writing a book claiming
that I’m the only one of the 30s group
whose beliefs remained unchanged.
Orwell changed and Auden changed.
Isherwood changed. I retain this sym-
pathy for the dream of communism any-
way, though I agree that the record is
very discouraging. We’re all unbelievers
within our own faiths.”
I taxed him with his oft-misquoted
remark that we would rather end his
days in Russia than in America.
“What I meant was that I would end
my days sooner in Russia because there
they pay writers the compliment of re-
garding them as a danger.”
“But if it came to it?”
“All right. Yes. I would rather end
my days in the Gulag than in than in
California."
“That’s a very typical remark, if you
don’t mind me saying so.”
But he did not seem to mind at all. □

DANCE
The juniors
make the
big time
By JOHN CARGHER
IN THE fifth year of its existence, the
so-called Dancers Company of the Aus-
tralian Ballet finally has made its debut
in its home town, Melbourne, playing at
the Princess Theatre. It is an obvious
parallel to London’s Royal Ballet at
Covent Garden and the Sadler’s Wells
Royal Ballet, some of whose perform-
ances in recent years have been much
inferior to the Giselle presented in Mel-
bourne by the Dancers Company.
The Dancers were formed
in 1980 by Marilyn Jones and
were her major contribution
to the history of the Austra-
lian Ballet during her brief
tenure as artistic director. It is
to be hoped that talk of dis-
banding the group for finan-
cial reasons is unfounded, for
its concept and present work
under its new director,
Marilyn Rowe Maver, must
be admired.
Jones laid down some sen-
sible ground rules, principal
among which were that cities
too small to be visited by the
national company should not
be denied classical ballet of
professional standards and
that junior principals needed
experience in major roles to
test their mettle. At a lower
level graduates of the Austra-
lian Ballet School gain practi-
cal experience before being
accepted by the parent com-
pany.
Let me anticipate the argu-
ment that plenty of modern
groups visit smaller venues. It
in no way denigrates these to
say that (a) classical ballet has
a more immediate appeal to
an inexperienced dance audi-
ence and (b) is essential to an
understanding of the history
of dance.
The Dancers Company is
supplemented with guest prin-
cipals from the Australian
Ballet and their Melbourne
Giselle had rather more of
those than would have been
offered in, say, Geelong or
Newcastle. Two of them, David
Ashmole and Evelyne Desutter, are ad-
ditions to the ranks of Australian Ballet
principals which, for some reason, have
been kept quiet.
There has been no mention that
Ashmole was the Red Knight (a most
difficult role) in the recent television
series about Ninette de Valois, Check-
mate. Ashmole has been a Royal Ballet
principal since 1975 and his emergence
without fanfare in the junior company
is surprising.
I saw four of the seven guest princi-
pals in two performances, press dead-
lines forbidding me to add Evelyne
Desutter, Paul de Masson and Fiona
Tonkin, the kind of dancer for whom
this company really was created.
More to the point, I saw the Dancers
Company in ensemble and in a major
ballet so famous that any failings would
have stood out like a sore thumb. There
were none. The corps de ballet was spot
on and the minor principals were well
up to scratch, Ulrike Lytton’s Queen of
David Ashmole as Albrecht in Giselle
JAMES McFARLANE
the Wilis, with her smooth pas de
bourree, being particularly noteworthy.
Mark Annear and Greg Horsman
danced very well in their respective
peasant pas de deux. As their partners,
Joady Chambers had a slight edge on
Elizabeth Toohey.
The reappearance of Rowe Maver
after several years and more operations
to her foot was a pleasure for all. (Was it
for her, I wonder?) Giselle is no Aurora
or Odile and Rowe Maver is still a bal-
lerina with perfect ballon and the ability
to hold an arabesque on point, while her
touching Mad Scene remains un-
changed. It was a pity that she was part-
nered by Jonathon Kelly, who little
more than walked through his part.
The second performance was vastly
superior. Not only was Christine Walsh
a suitably fragile and ethereal Giselle
but she was undoubtedly inspired by
her partner, Ashmole.
Ashmole is in the mould of Anthony
Dowell: tall, good looking, with a good
personality and a fine, if not entirely
flawless, technique. The ease
with which every movement is
fully extended, his precise
footwork and graceful linking
of enchainements delighted in
this notable addition to our
sadly depleted ranks of male
principals.
He was handicapped only
by a strange twist to Rowe
Maver’s reconstruction of
Giselle, which climaxes with
Albrecht forced to dance him-
self to death. Every dancer in
history has turned on his most
spectatular leaps or entrechats
to demonstrate the demonic
power of the Queen of the
Wilis. But in this version,
Kelly and Ashmole were
required to execute only a
series of unenergetic en-
trechats quatre a rough bal-
let equivalent of running a
five-minute mile.
Presumably, entrechats be-
ing a weak spot among Aus-
tralian dancers since Garth
Welch retired, Rowe Maver
thought it better to reduce the
choreography at this point to
primary school level. Yet the
half-dead Albrecht being
saved by the break of dawn
becomes ridiculous if the pro-
tagonist is not seen to be put
under great physical strain.
Except for this small but
important point, this Giselle is
exactly the kind of perform-
ance which should be seen by
audiences which exist here, as
in England, for a junior back-
up ballet company attached to
a major organisation. □

FILMS
Full rein for
grand vision
of America
Robert De Niro in Once Upon A Time In America: immigrant dream with a touch of horror
By SANDRA HALL
THIRTEEN YEARS in the making,
three hours 40 minutes long, with a re-
ported budget of $4O million, Sergio
Leone’s Once Upon A Time In America
is in every sense a big picture a mag-
nificently overblown amalgamation of
American myths done with a loving eye
for the grotesque, the savage and the
dreamily sentimental.
That was too big for the Ladd Com-
pany which infuriated Leone by cutting
the film back to two hours 20 minutes
for release in America. But here we have
the full version, thanks to Australian
distributor Roadshow which took its
cue from the excitement caused in
Cannes where it was shown whole this
year.
In essence, this is the American im-
migrant dream done with a touch of
horror the Dead End Kids grown into
The Godfather. Leone, who worked in
his youth with American directors
Raoul Walsh and William Wyler, has
used the traditions of film noir as a
framework for a work as rich in images
as a Renaissance canvas.
It is centred, fittingly enough, on
New York’s Lower East Side al-
though not in Little Italy. Perhaps to
forestall cracks about making an eastern
spaghetti western, Leone has left the
Mafia alone to tell a story of four Jewish
gangsters. His heroes Noodles
(Robert De Niro), Max (James Woods),
Cockeye (William Forsythe) and Patsy
(James Hayden) grow up on
Delancey Street, starting out (like
Wyler’s Dead End Kids) as larrikins
getting away with whatever they can.
Then comes Prohibition and the true
flowering of their talents as hold-up
men, bootleggers and occasional hit
men.
But Leone’s real theme is friendship
competitive friendship.
Max and Noodles are fascinated by
one another, both as companions and
rivals. When this friendship mysterious-
ly sours, everything else goes wrong.
Leone begins his story in the middle,
with Noodles in an opium house in the
Chinese quarter trying to blot out past
mistakes by staying permanently be-
fuddled. The year is 1933, Prohibition is
over and he is on the run, blaming him-
self for betraying the rest of the gang
and wondering desperately how it all
happened.
He looks back to his boyhood and to
his high life and, while drawing together
these threads, Leone also is moving
Noodles forward to a denouement some
30 years later.
He handles these shifts in sequence
so elegantly and with such a sure feeling
for the rhythms of passing time that a
two and a half hour version seems in-
conceivable.
Once Upon a Time could hardly be
called a fresh or original story. Leone is
in the business of dignifying cliche and
his frequent lapses into stale metaphor
leave plenty of room for bathos, es-
pecially in the last 40 minutes which
wind up to an awkwardly unconvincing
ending. But he works on such a grand
scale and every frame is so richly filled
with color and incident that the creak-
ing of the plot is drowned out by the
clamorous detail which surrounds it.
The settings have the strength of an
extra character - Delancey Street in the
early scenes is as bustling and exotic as
some middle eastern trading port and
each stage in the story is marked by
some image which distils and fixes its
mood with extraordinary force or quiet
lyricism (underpinned by Ennio
Morricore’s wistful score).
Leone never considers his characters
in isolation always in context and
for much of the time they are photo-
graphed in wide shot against a back-
ground seen in deep focus, so that the
layers in perspective are always clear.
As well, cinematographer Tonino Delli
Colli has lit the film in chiaroscuro
which tends to emphasise the sense of
passing time along with the realisation
that Leone is offering a meditation on
America itself.
Noodles is one of De Niro’s less
spectacular performances but no less
effective for that. He gives Noodles a
convincing watchfulness, an odd streak
of wildness and a stubborness which
is his weapon of last resort against the
more ruthless Max. Noodles also ages
persuasively down to the hunched
wariness of his walk.
Woods is a tall horse-faced actor
with wide brown eyes, a pock-marked
complexion and an air of menace. His
Max is a creature of icy pragmatism, a
conman who sees in Noodles not so
much a friend as a challenge.
Leone is sentimental about their
youth together but not about what they
become. He sees them as mercenaries,
uncommitted to anything but money
and thus doomed.
With the women in the film, Leone’s
not so much at ease. Tuesday Weld does
well with a nonsensical part as Max’s
masochistic girlfriend but Elizabeth
McGovern is miscast as the petulant
Jewish princess who realises early that
Noodles’ adoring regard for her is tepid
stuff beside his fascination with Max
and the masculine pleasures of thieving,
brawling and casual sex. McGovern is
half-a-head taller than De Niro and in
their scenes together, no matter what is
supposed to be going on, looks totally
disengaged.
The film is marred most in the end by
Leone eventually being forced down
from his mythic heights to deal with a
few mundane plot developments in as
worldly a way as possible and failing ut-
terly.

THEATRE
The legend as
a sort
of pantomime
By BRIAN HOAD
JUST in case you had any sick ideas to
the contrary or just thought it was a re-
run of the film version of 1967, the
entrepreneurs wish to emphasise that
you will see Richard Harris “live on
stage” in the current revival of the last
of the Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick
Loewe musicals Camelot. It has just
launched its national tour in Sydney.
Despite widespread belief that musi-
cal spectaculars have become so econ-
omically risky that they can be tackled
only by subsidised companies such as
the Australian Opera (which is toying
with the idea of Carousel ), the Kevin
Jacobsen and Pat Condon organisations
have chosen to take a punt on the most
spectacular of them all. At least, the
Broadway production of 1960, the Aus-
tralian production of 1963, the London
production of 1964, etc have passed into
theatrical history as some of the most
amazing collections of frocks and set-
tings ever to have cluttered a stage.
Camelot became the ultimate triumph of
packaging over content; so much so
that even the Butchers of Broadway
(who hated it) could not dim the glory
of that “one brief, shining moment” at
the box office.
The current spate of revivals started
in 1980, on Broadway again. The origin-
al star, the late Richard Burton, was
back in the role of King Arthur at
least for a brief, shining moment or two
until he went out one day for a very
long lunch and subsequently was taken
poorly on stage and subsequently
replaced by Harris (who had been the
celluloid Arthur of 1967). Harris has
been playing the role, on and off, ever
since in America and England and now
Australia. This production is “dedicated
to the memory of Richard Burton.”
First things first: As the curtain went
up at Sydney’s Her Majesty’s, some
hearts sank to find that fairyland had
faded somewhat when compared with
the no-expense-spared fantasies of local
lad John Truscott who decorated the
Australian version of 1963, the London
version of 1964 and the celluloid ver-
sion. It was only to be expected in these
more stringent economic times in the
theatre. American interior decorator
Tom Barnes is credited with the current
illusions. They are gaudily simplistic
and rather charmingly old-fashioned.
One effect is to throw the content
into sharper focus.
The source is that vast and whimsic-
ally-wise collection of four novels of
T. H. White, The Once And Future King.
Lerner clearly had problems with both
the whimsy and the wisdom. His awk-
ward solution was to devote the first
half to a vaguely satirical spoof of days-
of-old, switching in the second half to a
rather sombre tragedy of lost idealism.
His lyrics, however, remain trite
throughout. Loewe, already eager at the
time to retire on the profits from My
Fair Lady , tossed off a largely forget-
table score spanning a narrow spectrum
from simple jollity to sweet sentiment.
Richard Harris, Richard Muenz, Marina Prior in Camelot:
And yet the legends of King Arthur
are so well known, so potent, that audi-
ences may easily expand on Lerner’s
narrow and muddled interpretation for
themselves. And, in a sense, Camelot
added in its day to the substance of
those legends as the favorite musical of
President John F. Kennedy. Odd, really,
how that latter-day Arthur returned
again and again to witness the collapse
of the very idealism for which he stood
in the eyes of millions. But as legend
now has it for a brief, shining moment
the White House became synonymous
with Camelot until hopes and dreams
were smashed again on the rocks of his-
tory at Dallas in November 1963.
Nevertheless, the high-minded
would do better to stay at home and
browse again through White’s fascina-
ting epic; or, for a more substantial mu-
sical version of a fateful Arthurian love
triangle, there’s always Wagner’s Tris-
tan And Isolde. As for the rest, try a
second bottle of wine with dinner (or
whatever it is that induces a childlike
state) and approach Camelot for what it
is a sort of pantomime.
Harris plays Arthur accordingly, in
grand, hammy fashion. At the age of 50,
he is at his best as the ageing, anguished,
disillusioned monarch of the second
half but rather creaky in the brave at-
tempts to restore a youthful spring to his
steps in earlier scenes.
Harris also directs the show and he
does this at a snappy pace which defies
much slumbering in the stalls.
His Queen Guenevere is not very
queenly, indeed rather flighty, but Ma-
rina Prior looks pretty enough and sings
sweetly.
The central menage-a-trois is com-
pleted by Sir Lancelot, beloved by
Guenevere (and Arthur). It is a difficult
role, taken on here by American import
Richard Muenz. He’s good. Lerner,
Loewe and Harris (as director) all try to
make a musclebound fool of him in the
early scenes, yet he emerges with dignity
and his splendid singing voice is the
musical highlight of the evening.
Another American import, James
Valentine, has a broadly jolly time in
the dual role of Merlin and King Pel-
linore. On the other hand, Peter
Cousens would clearly like to raise the
level of the evening and presents
Arthur’s bastard son Mordred as some-
thing more malignant than the usual
hissable villain.
Yet it is pantomime, as hordes of
sprites and nymphs and knights and
lords and ladies and squires and
wenches come and go with a tra-la-la
and a hey-nonny-nonny; a good old-
fashioned night of theatre of the sort
you might have thought you would
never see again.
And, flaws and all, it’s pleasant
enough as that. □


Three true stories
about computers and
communications
and their effects on
business.
Is one of them yours?
One of the largest financial
institutions in Australia, with offices
and agents throughout the country,
asked Coopers & Lybrand to examine
their computer and communications
network.
Rapid growth in the’7o’s, combined
with many other factors, resulted in
the organisation having many different
types of computers which often weren’t
able to communicate with each other.
So it became difficult for the agents
to access information from the head
office. After a thorough analysis of
the problem, Coopers & Lybrand
developed a communications system
that connected the various offices and
agents.
First some new computers were
installed. Then Coopers & Lybrand
designed the networks and specified
sophisticated switching equipment
which allowed all of the computers to
interface.
As a result the organisation’s staff
were provided with individual
terminals, voice communication and
videotext facilities.
Information now flows much faster
throughout the organisation’s many
offices and agents and this has result-
ed in a considerable cost saving.
Agents now find it much easier to
access their information and, not
surprisingly, this has resulted in more
business from the agents.^#
Coopers & Lybrand were auditing
Ozwide Industries* Using their own
DDB 3369.033
software on the client’s computer
system, they discovered many sales
made during a certain month did not
appear in that month’s figures.
As the number of transactions
in this carry-over was substantial,
Coopers & Lybrand suggested Ozwide
go back and look at each month during
the previous year.
Further investigation proved that
the practice was a prevalent one.
The Ozwide sales force, having
made its budget each month, would
save the “overs” and put them into the
next month’s figures, a practice that
was seriously affecting the company’s
cash-flow situation.
Now, Ozwide are using Coopers &
Lybrand’s software each month to
detect any instances of carry-overs,
and sales appear when they are made.
Not when the sales force decides
to reveal them.^^
Budgeting for the subsidiary of
a multi-national company can involve
many people for an extended period
of time.
Concerned at all the hours being
squandered in this particular exercise,
Staffords * the affiliate of a large multi-
national, called in Coopers & Lybrand
who developed a specially designed
computer budgeting model for the
company. It simplified the process,
reducing budgeting time from twelve
to just three weeks.
The model not only simplified the
process but allowed the company to
consider various permutations before
deciding upon the final budget.
The savings the company realised
in both money and management time
are an indication of just how effective
Coopers & Lybrand’s involvement can
be in helping make companies more
profitable. 99

BOOKS
Novels beat
the revelations
of compromise
Jean Rhys in 1931 and in 1966: publication of her letters will defuse intending biographers
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Jean Rhys, Letters 1931-1966,
edited by Francis Wyndham and
Diana Melly. Andre Deutsch,
$24.95
GOD PROTECT us from our friends,
as the saying is. God has not protected
Jean Rhys from these two friends who
have competently and sympathetically
put together this book, apparently as a
compromise between a biography
which Rhys specifically forbade in her
will and nothing. They desperately
wanted there to be something but, com-
petent and sympathetic and all that,
should it have been done?
Wyndham says that Rhys believed
an artist’s work should be considered in
separation from the facts of his or her
life, even though the facts had provided
the raw material for the work.
It will be a pity if people who come
on the letters before the novels and
short stories should be put off by the
letters with their repetitiveness, dep-
recating complaints, apologies and cries
for help to the extent that they will
not acquire the novels, now available,
after a long time, in paperback. This is
probably quibbling. At least the letters
offer a revelation to non-writers about
the dire circumstances that can confront
and, of course, inhibit a writer: lack of
time, lack of space, lack of a typewriter,
lack of heat, cold flats and cold cottages
far from transport all a condition of
lack of money.
While writers of lesser talent were
somehow sustained through a network
of friends of friends with minor jobs
that needed doing, Rhys had no such
support. You will look for her name in
vain in the indices of memoirs of the 20s
and 30s. If only she had caught the eye
of the Bloomsberries or of Lady
Ottoline Morrell and been asked to
luncheon at Garsington with Lytton
Strachey. Or of Bertrand Russell, in-
stead of Ford Madox Ford whose pliant
lover she became with the consent of his
wife.
Ford did influence his friend Edward
Garnett, a publisher’s editor, to help
Rhys have her first book published but
there his usefulness ended and Rhys’
name does not appear in Garnett’s bi-
ography A Life In Literature.
The first letter, written on March 1,
1931, from a London address to a
woman named Peggy Kirkaldy, thanks
her for a letter of praise about the novel
called After Leaving Mr Mackenzie
which had been published by Cape the
year before. The last letter is from
Cheriton Fitz Paine, a remote Devon
village, dated March 9, 1966, to Diana
Athill. It begins, “Max died uncon-
scious and this morning very early we
went to Exeter crematorium. A sunny
day, a cold sun and a lot of flowers but it
made no sense to me,” and ends, “I am
sorry for a sad letter ... it’s so cold.”
She wrote that she had dreamed she was
having a baby and took this to mean she
must finish the book she had been
writing for obscure years on bits of
paper at the end of a kitchen table. She
did finish the book and it was published
in October of the same year. It was The
Wide Sargasso Sea, considered her best,
and had a critical success winning her
two awards. So, when she was 76, life
took a turn for the better.
She had had a curious publishing
history. Her first five books The Left
Bank, Postures (later known as Quar-
tet), After Leaving Mr Mackenzie, Voy-
age In The Dark and Goodmorning,
Midnight were published in Britain
and the United States between 1927 and
1939. Five books novels and collec-
tions of short stories in 12 years
sounds as if the author was assiduous.
But each was achieved against the odds,
partly because she lacked confidence
and partly because of her sad and
muddled personal life.
She simply dropped out of sight, in
the social and literary sense after 1939,

published in hardback in the 70s and
almost all her work can be found now in
paperback, to the great reward of buy-
ers, on bookshop shelves.
Rhys was born Ella Gwendoline
Rees Williams in Dominica where her
father, a Welsh doctor, had married into
one of the long-established European
planter families of the West Indian
island. She left Dominica for school in
England, a course at the Royal Acad-
emy of Dramatic Art, the chorus line of
a touring company and a love affair
with an older man who “pensioned her
off’ after a year.
She married Jean Lenglet, a Dutch-
French journalist of dubious reputation
who went to jail for currency violation,
and had two children - William, who
died, and Maryvonne to whom many of
Rhys’ letters are directed. Maryvonne
stayed with her father when he got out
of prison and Rhys went off to Paris to
be taken up by Ford, the centre of a
literary clique of expatriate Americans
and Britons.
She married twice after Lenglet
Leslie Tilden Smith who was an unsuc-
cessful literary agent and then his
cousin Max Hamer, a lawyer who went
to jail for fraud and suffered a series of
strokes when he emerged. She is un-
failingly nice about both in her letters.
Francis Wyndham remembers her in
his introduction not as the haunted
lonely woman who figures in the exquis-
itely written novels nor as the restless
spirit who wrote, often with a glass of
whisky handy (if she could afford it),
“these brave, bitter letters” but as “a
slant-eyed siren who valued frivolity
and fun” and found them in “an old
tune, a new scent, a perfect cocktail, a
wonderful joke.”
Incidentally, the table of acknowl-
edgments provides a glimpse of a little-
known aspect of the literary world. The
“papers” letters, laundry lists, restaur-
ant bills, jotted memos, notes of tele-
phone conversations end up in places
such as the University of Tulsa, Okla-
homa, and the Humanities Research
Centre at the University of Texas in
Austin. The “papers” become fodder
for the extended theses on British and
European authors by aspiring PhDs
who know everything about their sub-
ject except what it was that made him or
her tick. The publication of the Rhys
letters will defuse intending biogra-
phers, if any. □

Win the
performance erf
vour banker be
as impressive
as the view
from his office?
When choosing a bank for their
international business and corporate
finance needs, some Australian
businessmen unfortunately subscribe
to the view “foreign is better”.
Yet overseas, one Australian
bank is acknowledged as a master in
the international money arena.
That bank is the ANZ.
ANZ has long been Australia’s
most active bank internationally, with
an extensive network of offices
covering all the International Financial
Centres throughout the world.
The ANZ is ideally poised to
assist Australian businesses with their
particular domestic and international
finance requirements.
Among the facilities we
can provide are foreign currency loans,
term loans, overdrafts, commercial
bills, leasing plus a full range of foreign
exchange and trade finance services.
Through the Capital Markets
Group we can also arrange specialised
facilities such as access to inter-
national and domestic capital markets,
project finance and big ticket leasing.
Best of all, we have some of the
finest banking brains in the world on
our staff and they’re at your beck and
call. They speak the same language
as you do.
And we believe they understand
Australian international and domestic
business problems far better than any
foreign banker.
When choosing a banker for
corporate finance and business
services, look beyond the London, New
York and Paris skylines.
Look for skill, integrity and the
good old Australian know-how
Look to the ANZ.

betrays the same quality of feeling that
guides his hand when drawing or paint-
ing.” It is a quality that permeates these
gentle memoirs.
The Brisbane of Rees’ youth, remem-
bered at dusk with jacarandas in bloom,
becomes a painterly vision of silver and
mauve-blue. With his first impression of
Sydney in 1916 all “golden fore-
shores, russet trees and creamy morning
light” Rees is already spreading a
canvas with those rich, buttery impastos
of his distinctive style of landscape
painting.
The young Rees overcame by per-
severance, talent and a febrile imagina-
tion the handicap of being born in a
Brisbane where art training was mini-
mal. He developed a fine pen technique
to record buildings while drawing on a
romantic Celtic inheritance to beautify
the city with architectural caprices of his
devising.
These early drawings first caught the
eye of Syd Ure Smith and his partners
of the Smith & Julius Studios. Thrown
into the deep end of Sydney’s commer-
cial art, printing and publishing activi-
ties, the artist broadened and refined his
talent in an apprenticeship that brought
him in touch with most of the creative
activities which enlivened the local
scene in the 1920 s and 30s.
Modest about his achievements,
Rees is generous in praise and apprecia-
tion of his fellow artists of a period
when talent was in abundance. It was a
time of both the creation of Art In Aus-
tralia and the establishment of the So-
ciety of Artists with a membership
which reads like a rollcall of the greats
of Australian painting during the era
between the wars.
Much valuable social history is re-
corded in accounts of the society (Rees
had to wait 15 years before being ac-
cepted as member) and of the various
contemporary art groups and commer-
cial galleries of the period. But the
special quality of the memoirs comes
from the benign, perceptive and often
humorous accounts of artists and entre-
preneurs.
A cast of such characters provides
Rees with a fund of splendid stories,
none of them hurtful or malicious. One
to be treasured is of Melba sitting in her
car in a filthy temper, refusing to talk to
Syd Ure Smith. When George Lambert
hurried across the street to pay his
courtly respects, she bawled out: “Clear
out, Ginger I don’t want to see you,
either.”
When the promised second volume is
published, Rees will have lived through
the period from 1895 to the present.
Whatever this venerable artist makes
of the confused and contradictory
values of the past few decades is certain
to be recorded with wisdom, tolerance
and an abiding love of art. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Harry beats the bushes again
by Patricia Rolfe
A FAMILIAR figure will be seen short-
ly creeping through the well-trodden
underbrush of our TV screens. Natural-
ist Harry Butler is doing the com-
mercials for a new edition of Angus and
Robertson’s classic What Bird Is That?,
a book he says he grew up on.
Neville Cayley’s work was first pub-
lished in 1931. The new edition, no field
guide -- it weighs 3.5 kg has more than
400 previously unpublished paintings
by Cayley. The text has been revised
and expanded by Terence Lindsey.
The new edition costs $59.95. Angus
and Robertson have printed 50,000 cop-
ies and will spend $300,000 on the TV
campaign.
The unpublished paintings almost
literally were lying around on the floors
of the company’s Kingsgrove, Sydney,
warehouse when Gordon Barton bought
it in 1970. The warehouse was closed
and the old boxes in which the paintings
were kept were moved to the editorial
department where senior editor Mary
Coleman, who edited the current
edition, says the staff barked their shins
on them until the marketing manager’s
insistence on a new edition was re-
warded.
The unpublished paintings were part
of a major project undertaken in the
1920 s which foundered after Cayley and
George Robertson had a falling out.
Louis Auchincloss: women “not nicer”
HITTING the right month to tie a book
in with a film release is hazardous.
Jonathon Cape may not even get the
right year for their hardback reprint of
Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano
now in the book shops. The film may
not be released until next February.
Penguin can be more flexible with their
paperback which is printed here. They
fly in film in advance and can print in
two weeks. They will leave Under the
Volcano until 1985.
The film, however, is likely to find
many new readers for Lowry’s complex
novel, only spasmodically in print since
publication in 1947. Many actors, inclu-
ding Richard Burton and Jack Nichol-
son, wanted to play the alcoholic Con-
sul. The role is Albert Finney’s.
BOY GEORGE and his group aside,
culture clubs have never been strong in
this country; sensibly, we think clubs
are for having a good time. Literary and
other such clubs have, however, been in-
fluential at times in the United States.
By coincidence, two different looks at
them will turn up here early next year.
One is ... And Ladies of the Club.
When Helen Hooven Santmyer read Sin-
clair Lewis’s Main Street she was
outraged. She sat down to write her ver-
sion of life in a US small town with a
woman’s book club as the starting point.
Fifty years later and aged 88, she was
ready to publish.
Her book has been well received in
the US, both critically and by the pub-
lic. It will go straight into paperback
here, mainly because of its 1216 pages
and will come from Picador.
The other is Louis Auchincloss’s The
Book Class. Auchincloss is something of
a successor to Henry James and Edith
Wharton and his world of New York
society is a long way from Main Street.
His narrator, weary of being harangued
about sexual discrimination at dinner
parties by “the lawyer in menacing

NEIGHBORHOOD
Time for compromise runs out
as ANZUS crisis continues
With its partners failing again to resolve the biggest crisis in the history of the
ANZUS defence treaty over visits by nuclear ships the tide of events is running
out, FEDOR MEDIANSKYreports, on the New Zealand-American standoff.
THE MEETINGS of ANZUS foreign
ministers in New York last week gener-
ated atmospherics rather than achieving
positive results. The ministers failed to
make headway in their efforts to resolve
the impasse over New Zealand’s refusal
to accept visits from United States nu-
clear ships.
US Secretary of State George Shultz
reportedly was furious over the clear
failure of his strategy of letting time and
a little pressure soften the intransigence
of NZ Prime Minister David Lange.
Australian Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden remained adamant that he
would not play message boy between
our old allies. Lange stood his ground
and his isolation from New Zealand’s
traditional friends became all the more
evident by the qualified support he
received from Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko.
The arrangements for the least-
publicised and yet one of the most sen-
sitive meetings of the ANZUS ministers
in New York were worked out well in
advance.
The impression given before the
talks was one of deliberate understate-
ment, as though publicity could only ex-
acerbate the most difficult set of meet-
ings in the otherwise rather unspecta-
cular history of the tri-partate alliance.
So the ministers met last week al-
most casually while all three were in
town to participate in the start of the
annual global talkfest which usually be-
gins in late September with the opening
of a session of the General Assembly of
the United Nations.
The extreme sensitivities of the
ANZUS partners were reflected clearly
in the unwillingness to discuss jointly
the ban on nuclear ships. So the parties
who have prided themselves on main-
taining a united front decided on separ-
ate bilateral meetings to deal with the
most serious crisis in the alliance.
While Australia is not directly
involved the nation’s security interests
cannot be divorced from it.
The dispute also touches on a sensi-
tive issue between Prime Minister Bob
Prime Minister Lange (left) with Secretary of State Shultz: little room for compromise
Hawke and Hayden and the balance to
be struck between the American al-
liance and the Australian government’s
commitment to other foreign policy ob-
jectives especially in arms control.
Concern exists already among some ad-
visers that the US-NZ stand-off could
harden America’s Reagan adminis-
tration on arms control initiatives with
which Australia has identified itself
closely.
The deadlock also raises domestic
and external complications for Shultz.
Having just weathered a particularly
dangerous bout of nuclear allergy in
Europe over deployment of weapons
there, the US is deeply concerned lest
the New Zealand example destabilise
the resolve of some North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation countries and
Japan.
To describe Lange’s position as ex-
tremely difficult would be a gross under-
statement.
New Zealand’s economy and exter-
nal trade are vulnerable to the point
where even minor influences can have
major consequences. Agricultural ex-
ports are vulnerable to less drastic
measures than the economic sanctions
at which the US has hinted but seems to
have retracted in New York. Still, US
officials recently disclosed that Defence
Secretary Caspar Weinberger personal-
ly intervened last year to stop the
dumping of surplus US butter on Asian
markets especially in the Philippines
and Japan which are vital to the New
Zealand dairy industry.
The Reagan administration has been
especially appreciative of the New Zea-
land role in thwarting Moscow’s south-
western Pacific and Antarctic interests.
As some strategic analysts have noted,


the Soviet Union is a large importer of
agricultural goods and is keen to ex-
pand its fishing agreements in the Pa-
cific; consequently, it would not find
compensating New Zealand too difficult
should the new government have more
trouble reaching traditional markets.
From the outset of the crisis, Shultz
seems to have placed a lot of faith in the
belief that time would work for him by
making the New Zealand government
realise the full consequences of its al-
lergy. However, time starts to run out
toward the end of this year. “Sea eagle,”
the next exercise involving the ANZUS
navies, is scheduled for early next year.
If US ships were denied entry to
New Zealand next year, the suggestion
is that the final showdown would take
place in Canberra during the ANZUS
council meeting next July.
By setting out a sequence of time
frames, Shultz evidently is trying to
place escalating pressure on Lange. Yet,
as the New York meetings showed, he is
proving to be less compliant than his
Australian counterparts.
On the face of it, the situation leaves
little room for compromise.
Senior US officials reportedly have
brushed aside arguments about a lack of
strategic necessity for their ships to call
in at New Zealand ports. Nor do the
officials seem much impressed by New
Zealand’s continued willingness to exer-
cise with all kinds of ships outside its
territorial waters.
For its part, Wellington does not
seem to have focused on formulas for
compromise. One such is that used for
Danish ports by which the US refrains
from sending nuclear-powered ships
and Denmark, in turn, refrains from
asking about the armaments on the
ships which do arrive. A similar ritual
takes place in Japan.
Both those practices attempt, albeit
transparently, to reconcile local
sensitivities with the uncompromising
US policy on neither confirming nor
denying nuclear armaments. □
NEW CALEDONIA
Independence
Front flings down
the gauntlet
Political slogans in Noumea: dialogue with Paris may have ended
© MICHAEL COYNE/THE IMAGE BANK
By STUART INDER
BATTLE LINES have been drawn in
New Caledonia following the an-
nouncement in Noumea by Indepen-
dence Front parties that they will set up
a provisional independent government
on December 1. The parties have re-
jected the French government plan for a
referendum on self-determination for
the French overseas territory in 1989.
They plan to rename New Caledonia
Kanaky, adopt a new flag and constitu-
tion, and “actively” boycott the forth-
coming elections for the New Cal-
edonian Territorial Assembly. The “ac-
tive” boycott means that they plan to
disrupt the electoral procedures.
The announcement came after a
three-day closed meeting of several
hundred delegates representing pro-in-
dependence political parties and groups
forming the Independence Front. The
meeting agreed to form a new organisa-
tion known as the Kanak Socialist
National Liberation Front, or FNLKS.
In the next week, local committees of
the FNLKS will be established, and
they plan to meet on November 11 at a
regional meeting to establish a 37-mem-
ber assembly.
The timetable then calls for a nation-
al convention of pro-independence
forces for November 24 and 25, which
will elect an eight-member provisional
independent government.
The provisional government will
consist of a president, prime minister
and six ministers, forming a
“decentralised democratic socialist re-
public.”
Members of the Independence Front
have been foreshadowing these devel-
opments for some time, following the
rejection by the French National As-
sembly of the front’s request in France
to move more quickly towards self-de-
termination and independence.
The decision to form the FNLKS
probably means the end of dialogue be-
tween the independence leaders and
Paris and the polarisation of anti-inde-
pendence and pro-independence forces
in New Caledonia.
New Caledonia has six anti-indepen-
dence groups and parties, and last week
there was pressure among them to form
themselves into one unified anti-inde-
pendence movement to meet what they
see as the new Kanak threat. □

MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, WE’VE BUILT
A VILLAGE CALLED YULARA.
And if you’re going to be
STRANDED IN THE DESERT, THIS IS
JUST THE PLACE TO DO IT.
But before you do, you must
LEARN THE BASICS OF SURVIVAL.
The first lesson is to locate
ALL THE WATER HOLES.
After all, people have been
KNOWN TO WANDER AROUND IN
Yulara for minutes at a time,
TRYING TO FIND ONE OF THE MANY

The second lesson is even
MORE IMPORTANT.
The desert can often be an

THE CHOICE OF SHELTER IS CRITICAL.
WE RECOMMEND FOUR PLACES:
The fully facilitated Yulara
CAMPING SITE.
The Ernest Giles Tavern.
The ioo room Four Seasons
Hotel.
The 230 room Sheraton Hotel.
Lastly, you will have to
DECIDE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO
MAKE THE 18 KILOMETRE TREK TO
Ayers Rock.
Will it be by air-conditioned
coach? Or air-conditioned car?

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Fairfax fund-raising-the
mystery and the drama
The proposed multi-million-dollar John Fairfax issue has aroused great interest
in the financial community. Bulletin Editor-in-Chief TREVOR KENNEDY reports
on the drama and mystery surrounding the move.
A MAJOR ROW is brewing
both within and without the
John Fairfax Ltd media group
over the company’s proposed
issue of $96 million worth
of participating preference
shares.
Within the Fairfax family
where tensions have run
high in the past there is a
distinct lack of unanimity on
whether the issue will slacken
the family grip on the group,
thus making it vulnerable to
takeover.
Outside the group there is
concern in two quarters: the
Sydney Stock Exchange has
initiated talks with Fairfax
seeking to improve the rights
of holders of the proposed
issue and the State Superan-
nuation Fund in NSW is
understood to be formulating
a complaint to the National
Securities and Exchange
Commission along similar
lines.
These problems, coupled
with considerable general
market speculation on the
issue, are likely to make the
group a focal point of con-
siderable controversy in the
coming months.
The market speculation
has concentrated on why
Fairfax flush with cash after
a bonanza year wants the
money. In the media industry
it is generally assumed that
the highly ambitious manage-
ment of the company will lead
a fairly dozey board, com-
prised of family members and
their running mates, into a
major takeover here or over-
seas.
It is understood that most
of the opposition on the board
of John Fairfax Ltd is coming
from former chairman Sir
Warwick Fairfax and at least
John Fairfax Ltd board (l to r): (standing) J. B. Fairfax, A.
Lissenden, Sir David Griffin; (seated) Sir Warwick Fairfax, James
Fairfax, Sir Vincent Fairfax
Group general manager Greg Gardiner: explanations
one other director. It is said
that various legal opinions
have been flying around.
The Fairfax family con-
trols about 50 percent of the
equity of the group which
publishes The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, The Australian
Financial Review, The Sun,
The Sun-Herald, The Can-
berra Times, The National
Times, The Illawarra Mercury,
The Newcastle Herald and a
range of other country and
suburban newspapers and
some magazines. It also owns
80 percent of The Age, Mel-
bourne, owns and operates
Channel 7 TV stations in Syd-
ney and Brisbane and owns
the Macquarie Broadcasting
Network. It is a generally
asset-rich media prize which,
free of family control, could
easily expect a takeover offer
at a price of $ll to $l2 a share
compared with the current all-
time high market price of $6
to $7 a share.
The family has threatened
to come asunder on previous
occasions particularly at the
time James Fairfax succeeded
his father, Sir Warwick, as
chairman in a move that bore
all the hallmarks of a blood-
less coup. In more recent
times, however, the family has
mended its differences and is
reputed to have worked out a
succession.
The deal is believed to be
that James Fairfax will, in a
few years, step down in favor
of Sir Vincent’s son John. At
virtually the same time,
James’s stepbrother Warwick
Jnr (Sir Warwick’s son by his
third and current wife, Mary)
will step into the major power
base of managing director
and thus run the company.
Current chairman, James


Sydney headquarters and how Fairfax’s Financial Review reported the share issue
Fairfax is Sir Warwick’s son by his first
marriage. James Fairfax is a childless,
51-year-old, confirmed bachelor.
Sir Warwick and his wife have an
almost religious zeal about ensuring the
accession of Warwick Jnr (aged 23 and
working for the Chase Manhattan Bank
in New York) to the control of the
group and perpetuation of the family
dynasty.
This could hardly sit all that com-
fortably with Sir Vincent, who is Sir
Warwick’s first cousin, as his son John
in his early 40s has spent all his
working life in the company.
The rub is, however, that Sir War-
wick’s end of the family as repre-
sented by the Warwick-James combined
shareholding has about twice the
voting power of that represented by Sir
Vincent’s family. The 50 percent of
John Fairfax Ltd which the family owns
roughly breaks down into one-third Sir
Warwick, one-third James and one-
third Sir Vincent.
That’s what gives Sir Warwick’s sons
the edge provided, of course, that
everything goes as it should and there
are no major bust-ups in the family.
If there were, Fairfax shares could go
through the roof and this great corner-
stone of power and influence in Austra-
lia could be up for grabs. All that may
be unlikely but it is one of the things
that makes the current Fairfax share
issue a great deal more interesting than
most.
The issue of PP non-voting shares is
the culmination of months of haggling
at board and senior management level
about a capital raising. Pressure in its
favor has come from the executives and
there are many who believe that a slack-
ening of family control is not without its
attractions to some of the
highly ambitious managers
who see themselves as wholly
responsible for the recent
change in the company’s for-
tunes and, given the future of
the company hierarchy said to
be arranged by the family,
could well be looking for
some benefits.
In fact, one of the sub-
missions which caused some
heartburn among family
members at board level was a
suggestion that up to 10 per-
cent of the total issued capital
should be placed in an em-
ployee share ownership plan.
In the event that the PP
shares which are proposed to
be issued are finally granted
full rights (a not unlikely
event in these times) the fam-
ily equity would be down to
35 percent.
With that level of equity in
family hands, any split in
Fairfax solidarity could hand
the company over to a raider
or a management-backed le-
verage buy-out arrangement.
For many years now, the
Fairfax family has resisted
any equity issue to fund the
aspirations of management
because of the threat that rep-
resents to their control of the
company. That various mem-
bers of the family have now
obviously agreed to this form
of equity issue is interesting
but a trifle weird from the standpoint
that there is no stated objective for the
funds.
The board has been told that man-
agement expects to bring it news of a
“significant and important opportu-
nity” in the course of this financial year
and that these funds are critical to its
capacity to act quickly.
Rumors abound in the marketplace
of what this may be. Local speculation
centres on the possibility of a takeover
of Northern Star Holdings. Abroad,
while various targets in the United
States could be in view, the popular
pick is either the London Daily Express
group or the company which publishes
the conservative Daily Telegraph , also
out of London.
The extent of the mystery of what the
money is for can be seen from the fact
that papers presented to the board seek

capital expenditure programs of around
only $25 million for 1984-85. Even the
bids by the various general managers
from which the $25 million was culled
are said to have totalled only around
$5O million and the best these latter
claims could be described as is “ambit
claims.”
From the standpoint of efficient capi-
tal raising, the chosen method is, at best,
questionable. An issue with full voting
rights would probably command a
much lower dividend yield than the
proposed PPS issue. There have been
considerable differences over the best
way to go and the final method was fixed
only days before the announcement.
In a letter last month from Stephen
Higgs, a director of the underwriting
company Dominguez Barry Samuel
Montague Ltd, to Greg Gardiner, the
general manager of John Fairfax Ltd,
Higgs stated: “Since our memorandum
dated 12th July, 1984, and after con-
siderable dialogue with you, we have
varied slightly our thinking as follows:
“I.A PPS issue should be preceded
by a l-for-5 bonus issue as it will create
a better psychological impact at the time
of announcement. This comes about in
part because the suggested issue price
will appear generous when mistakenly
compared with the cum bonus share
price.
“2. In valuing the PPS, we now be-
lieve such a formula should allow for
the fact that investors may apply a dis-
count factor to the PPS price, of around
10 percent to the ordinary share price,
when the PPS is fully participating. This
is to reflect the lack of voting rights.”
The letter then went on to enunciate
how important it was to place the family
rights in a fashion that did not knock
the market around.
The final financing method chosen,
of course, not only raises capital but it
also puts a sizeable amount of cash ($6
million?) into the hands of those family
members who need it though, from
distant observation, few of them seem to
and maintains family control of the
empire.
But why? Why does it need the
money and why does it need to do it in
such a controversial way?
Merchant bank sources say that
Fairfax in this latest year has created
provisions in its upcoming balance
sheet to the tune of about $2O million on
top of the $6O million in pre-tax earn-
ings that it has announced for the year
ended June 30. And this, in Gardiner’s
words to the board and at least one po-
tential underwriter, “was based on more
conservatively expressed profit figures
than the figures for probably any other
company in the country.”
The balance sheet will show that the
improvements in the company’s for-
tunes have taken place across the board.
Certainly, that is what Gardiner is tell-
ing underwriters and directors.
He has told them in recent times that
there is a very handsome surplus in the
working capital ratio, that the debt-to-
equity ratio is greatly improved (every
$1 in the company’s business could be
allocated 47 cents borrowed and 53
cents from shareholders’ funds), earn-
ings before interest and tax on total
shareholders’ funds is 15.6 percent (the
best for 10 years), earnings before inter-
est and tax to turnover is 10.9 percent
and heading for 13 percent, the interest
cover has improved from 2.6 percent to
4.6 percent.
There is very little point, of course, in
looking to the Fairfax newspapers or
magazines for any explanations of what
the group has in mind. When you keep
the directors of the company in the dark
to the extent that is happening here,
what chance have the shareholders?
And they must be pretty confident of
their influence to mount a share issue
with the sort of restricted rights which
is, by and large, abhorred by the mod-
ern investment community. □

Pruning good for Hunter grape-grower
WHEN Griffin Holdings, the Perth coal
mining and investment group, took over
the W. R. Carpenter Holdings Ltd group
late last year, the feeling was that con-
sistent lossmaker, Arrowfield Wines,
would be sold.
But Griffin held on to the NSW up-
per Hunter vintner and the decision ap-
pears to be paying off. Presenting its
new season range of whites at a lunch-
eon in. Sydney last week, newly-ap-
pointed Arrowfield general manager
Richard Everett said the producer had
“operated on the right side of the ledger
for the first three months of the year.”
He thought Arrowfield would record its
first profit in 1984-85, albeit a modest
one.
The profitability has been brought
about by the company’s rationalisation.
The hectares under vine have decreased
from 460 to around 120 over five years.
Staff has been cut.
The point of the exercise has been to
establish Arrowfield as a premium wine
producer. It has only seven whites and a
red in the range against 17 labels less
than a year ago. Arrowfield will pick
about 1500 tonnes of grapes in the har-
vest early next year and, with some 80
dozen bottles to a tonne, it makes the
company a small- to medium-sized
producer.
Everett, whose position is a new one
and who has spent time at the big pro-
ducers Kaiser Stuhl Wines (owned by
Penfolds Wines and ultimately Adelaide
Steamship Ltd) and Philip Morris Ltd’s
Lindemans, is happy with the cosier ap-
pearance of Arrowfield. He says: “You
don’t bank literage, you bank dollars.”
With the emphasis on quality, the
company will miss its chief winemaker
of the past eight years: Gary Baldwin.
With his skills the company has won
major awards in Australia and Europe.
Arrowfield holds the Farmer Bros Tro-
phy from the National Wine Show, for
the best two-year-old chardonnay.
Baldwin has elected for a change of
pace at the Australian Wine Research
Institute in Adelaide, translating the re-
sults of laboratory tests and research
into advice for winegrowers.
Everett is advertising for a new
winemaker.
Tenacious trier
MAJOR United States-controlled ad-
vertising agencies do not fare well when
it comes to winning advertising projects
for the Australian Government. One
major, McCann Erickson, has made
plenty of submissions and had plenty of
knockbacks but the agency seems not to
have given up.
McCann announced last week that it
had set up shop in Canberra through a
small local outfit, BBT Productions.
BBT has billings of around $1 million
through clients such as L. J. Hooker, the
Canberra Commercial Development
Authority and local retailer, Gallaghers
Discounts.
“You may call me a ruthless, union-bashing, capitalist exploiter,
Crawley but, I warn you, I’m impervious to flattery!”
McCann’s plans happen to coincide
with plans by the Australian Govern-
ment Advertising Service (AGAS) to
move its headquarters to Canberra.
AGAS has offices in Sydney and Mel-
bourne.
AGAS director Joe Thompson told
Wildcat “the policy side of things”
would be handled from Canberra
where the service would be closer to the
department to which it belongs Mick
Young’s Special Ministry of State.

TWO RATHER prosaic 50th anniver-
saries claimed Wildcat’s attention this
week.
The Urban Transit Authority of NSW
has decked out vehicles in new colors to
celebrate 50 years of bus services.
The other joyless jubilee is definitely
more pedestrian but its significance
flows on to all, for everybody uses the
product.
Tubemakers of Australia Ltd reveals
in its annual report that 1984 marks the
50th anniversary of the making of steel
pipes in Australia.
Stewarts and Lloyds (UK) Ltd, in a
joint venture with BHP, began produ-
cing steel pipe on a continuous weld
mill at a site near BHP’s Newcastle
steelworks in 1934.
From that beginning, Tubemakers
has developed into a major Australian
manufacturing and merchandising
company. The company employs more
than 6000 people and had a turnover in
1984 of $731 million.
The Poms have long since gone,
however, and Tubemakers’ principal
shareholders today are BHP (49.75 per-
cent) and Sumitomo of Japan (25 per-
cent).
What Tubemakers’ eulogy to pipe-
making does not tell us is that the com

pany enjoyed a manufacturing monop-
oly in Australia until 12 years ago.
Melbourne industrialist Lance,
Reichstein, founder of Industrial Engin-
eering Ltd, became increasingly frus-
trated with Tubemakers as the only sup-
plier of steel tube in Australia as the
1960 s drew to a close. With plant im-
ported from France and financial back-
ing from the one-year-old Australian In-
dustry Development Corporation, he
launched Australian Tube Mills Pty Ltd
in 1972. Wormald International, as a po-
tential customer, bought into the com-
pany which has become a Wormald
subsidiary.
Tubemakers’ domestic manufactur-
ing, monopoly was ended and ATM has
a reputed market share of 20 percent.

THAT APM Ltd is much more than a
paper company was rammed home with
the release of its annual report.
The report showed that pulp and
paper products made up only 34 per-
cent of sales of $ 1.2 billion. The growing
packaging division took 39 percent.
The range and destination of prod-
uct is diverse, as Wildcat found when
lunching with executives. Chris Henze,
general manager of the international
trading and industrial products division
of subsidiary Brown and Dureau Ltd,
said that it recently exported zincalume
steel (made by BHP Ltd subsidiary John
Lysaght and Sons Ltd) to India. That
customer sold the steel to a customer in
Kuwait who sold it to his customer,
involved in the Gulf war, who cam-
ouflaged and built a warehouse of it. □

THE DUAL personality of the Austra-
lian stockmarket has seldom been more
apparent than of late. Industrial stocks
are firm with quite a number reaching
into new high ground; in contrast,
major resource counters are making
heavy weather while the spec mining
and oil market is generally listless and
featureless.
Several big industrials have put up
startling performances such as Lend
Lease (mid-year low $4.40, recent high
$6.40), Boral (respectively, adjusted,
$2.50 and $3.33), J. Fairfax (resp, $4.70
and $7.04), Industrial Equity (resp, $4.80
and $7.30) and Adelaide Steamship
(resp, $3.95 and $5.46) since the mar-
ket slump in May/June.
The accompanying Bridge Data
charts show Adelaide Steamship Com-
pany shares weekly over two years and
monthly over a decade.
The monthly chart shows what a
bonanza this stock has been for far-
sighted investors who embarked before
the middle of 1980 and have stayed
aboard.
The weekly chart throws the new
intermediate uptrend since mid-year
into finer focus and shows that the latest
rise has emerged out of a neat rect-
angle.
A linear measurement of this pattern
points to a minimum upside target of
$6.
For the record, Adelaide Steamship
Co is now a highly diversified group the
principal elements of which are Tooth &
Co, National Consolidated, Petersville
Sleigh, DJ’s Properties and David Jones.
Cross shareholdings exist between
Adelaide Steamship Co and its satellites
so that a definitive map of the group
would be a challenge to the most gifted
cartographer.

THE MODEST FARMER
Giving the greenies a serve
by Bert Kelly
AFTER MOST seminars I make stern
resolutions to give them up, particularly
if there were many greenies present. So
Mavis was surprised when I accepted an
invitation to attend the conference
entitled “Agriculture and Conservation,
Achieving a Balance.” This was held at
Wodonga on September 11 and 12. But
when Mavis found that I had been
invited to make the after-dinner speech,
and about conservation this time and
not tariffs, she understood. She knows
the lure of an invitation for even an ex-
MP to give tongue is hard for him to
resist, particularly if the audience is
likely to be prestigious and large, MPs
being accustomed to addressing small,
apathetic and aged audiences.
The task of the conference was to
work out ways of marrying good farm-
ing to conservation. This is essential if
we are to continue to produce the
wealth needed to make conservation
possible. This is too often forgotten by
conservationalists who often seem to re-
gard making money with deep sus-
picion. lan McLachlan, the president of
the National Farmers Federation, made
this crystal clear in his talk.
Unfortunately, there were not many
farmers present and I can understand
this because often the greenies really
make us cross. But they must realise that
it is no good their going around hitting
us with their halos. They seem to think
that they can make farmers good by
laws and regulations. Farmers will gen-
erally win in the end if there is a con-
frontation between the two groups. “My
mob will do your mob like a dinner,” I
warned them. “You may have more
brains but they have more time to
think.” Conservationists must learn to
work with farmers, not against them.
I would like to pretend that my after-
dinner speech was received with pro-
longed applause but it wasn’t really. I
told them how I made the first contour
banks in South Australia, bragging a bit
as you would expect from an ex-MP. I
told them how our state soil conserva-
tion Act operated, how it contained
some sticks but these were seldom
needed as carrots usually work better,
though it is nice to know that the stick is
there if needed.
I also told them how I recently went
to an Australian farm management con-
ference where I heard young farmers
telling us how they were cropping their
country year after year, even wheat after
wheat, and they did not seem ashamed.
I had risen ponderously to my feet and,
in my most pontifical manner, given the
young beggars a lecture about how I
had ruined the structure of my soils in
the 1930 s by obeying the government’s
injunction to “grow more wheat”
during the depression. “You will crop
the guts out of your country if you keep
going like this,” I warned them.
They replied that it was not over-
cropping that damaged my soil but
over-cultivation. They were probably
right. I remember how we even used to
have fallow competitions then. I won
one once, with the soil worked down to
a beautiful fine tilth. Soon afterwards
there was a summer storm that removed
much of the soil we had so carefully
tilled. The young farmers say that they
can maintain the structure of their soils,
even with these close rotations, by using
grain legumes or nitrogen to get vigor-
ous root growth and by using chemicals
instead of the cultivator. I suppose they
are right. No one takes much notice of
me any more.
I said that water erosion was a far
more serious problem than soil wind
erosion. I know that the dust storms
which are whipped up by bad north
winds in the summer and throw a pall of
dust over the cities, scare people and we
read leading articles warning us that our
heritage is blowing out to sea or to New
Zealand.
But the plain fact is that most of the
soil movement is to the next sandhill or
the next paddock. The audience thought
that this was an awful thing for me to
say.
Then I got deeper into trouble by
telling them that we were pushed from
behind by the rabbits when clearing the
light mallee soils. We just had to clear
the sandhills or the rabbits would har-
bor there and eat out the good flat land
between.
Then I made things worse by saying
that the mallee soils were moving
masses of sand not very long ago as geo-
logical time is measured but they quick-
ly covered up again with mallee and
other vegetation when the climate
changed just a little.
I also told them how, long before the
western prairies of the United States
were ploughed, explorers’ diaries told of
the great dust storms that darkened the
skies even then. The fact is that soils,
particularly light soils, can be
regenerated if wisely handled.
The conservationalists were glad
when I sat down. Still, there is nothing
unusual about that. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
AMI down but far from out
ONE OF THE stocks in the portfolio
Australian Mining Investments Ltd
reached its low point for the year at 16c
last week.
But I’m tipping it’s now about to rise.
For the day after AMI hit the pits, Syd-
ney broker Rivkin Ltd stepped into the
market and took out more than 550,000
shares at 17c and 200,000 options
(which expire with an exercise price of
20c in December) at lc each. The stock
closed the week at 17c buyer and no
sellers.
It appears that Rivkin at least has
woken up to this company’s potential.
When we first put AMI into the port-
folio (B, May 29) it was on the basis that
it had acquired for a mere $lOO all the
coal assets of the failed Gollin group. In
addition to the $lOO nominal purchase
price, AMI undertook to repay loans of
$3.3 million. The assets acquired had a
net book value at May 1, 1984, of $11.25
million and comprised:
■ A 6.02 percent interest in Port
Waratah Coal Services Ltd the coal
loading facility at Newcastle which has
already paid a $270,000 dividend to
AMI with a further $230,000 approved
for the current year.
■ More than 500 ha of freeholds and
30 houses in the Hunter Valley in the
books at $70,000.
■ A 49.34 percent share of Gunnedah
Colliery in which the other partner was
Consolidation Coal Co Inc of the US, a
subsidiary of Conoco, which in turn is a
subsidiary of du Pont.
Consolidation Coal paid around $22
million to buy its interest in Gunnedah
from Peko-Wallsend early in 1982 and
since has invested another $3 million in
mine development ahead of a decision
in the US to pull back from overseas
operations.
That is the key to AMl’s latest coup
the company has bought Consolida-
tion Coal’s half interest by simply buy-
ing a $1.3 million loan the American
company had in the mine for $1.25 mil-
lion.
Gunnedah Colliery, I’m assured, is
operating on a cash-flow breakeven
with an output of 500,000 tonnes, most
of which is sold to Japan as a blended
coking coal.
The mine is presently an under-
ground operation.
Since negotiations were completed
to take out the US interests, I under-
stand approval has been granted for an
open-cut operation to begin production
before Christmas with markets assured
to double annual throughput to 1 mil-
lion tonnes.
AMI has on issue 24.2 million 20c
fully-paid shares (of which 7 million are
unlisted) and 17.27 million December
31, 1984, options exercisable at 20c.
With the shares at 17c, the options
are technically worthless and the com-
pany is capitalised by the share market
at a mere $4.1 million. Yet it has nearly
$2 million in liquid funds at the end of
June (ahead of buying out the US Gun-
nedah interests), plus all the existing
assets in the coal loader and mine, and
before the end of October it should see
restored to the lists its gold prospecting
subsidiary, the 59 percent owned Astron
Resources Ltd. Ahead of the listing
Astron had some $2 million in cash but
at a meeting yet to be held it will acquire
mostly for vendor stock the unlisted
Sovereign Gold NL which has advanced
prospecting operations going east of
Kalgoorlie in joint ventures with
Austamax and Phillips Oil.
AMI came back from their year’s
high of 27c after the company made a
special dividend in July of one Astron
share for every 50 AIM held thus
securing a spread of Astron’s relisting.
Now that we appear to have passed
the bottom of the coal industry slump
there’s room in this stock for a funda-
mental reassessment of its worth.

Japan’s Aimless Generation
A wave of hedonism shocks the workaholic elders and threatens the future.
They are nothing like the motorcycle
gangs and dope dealers of Tokyo’s mis-
fit fringe. There is even something endear-
ingly innocent about the way they sneak out
of their middle-class homes, change out of
their school uniforms behind the bushes in
Yoyogi Park and cavort away the Sunday
afternoons in punk garb, A 1 Capone gang-
ster costume and ’sos-era rock-and-roll out-
fits. But there is something chilling in the
emptiness of their eyes. “I just like to spend
my time aimlessly,” says 17-year-old Yumi
Watanabe, and it is as if a dispirited pleas-
ure-seeking is whittling away the work-
aholic soul of modern Japan.
Never mind the old traditions —disci-
pline, respect for age, company songs and
polite bows. Japan is made of contradic-
tions, and rebellion is nothing new: records
of bloody school clashes go back to 1883;
there have been three separate waves of
juvenile delinquency since the postwar re-
construction. But the youths who erupted
in the ’6os and ’7os had passions and causes,
ranging from Vietnam and pollution to po-
litical corruption. What’s new and frighten-
ing to the elders is an anomie that has no aim
but to pass the time, a limp shrug from the
direction of the future. How can Japan stay
No. 1? Already there are young executives
refusing overseas postings, taking all their
vacation time, going home at 5 o’clock.
Some of them are going back to small towns
and starting low-pressure businesses. There
are communes.
The youthquake is still selective. Young
people in Japan run the traditional gamut,
from the misfit fringe to the 40 percent or so
of superachievers who push for spots in the
elite universities. But'the fringe, while tiny,
is growing. Juvenile crime is on the rise and
spreading to the middle class. There were
2,125 reported incidents of school violence
in 1983, including 929 assaults on teachers.
Youths under 18 were arrested in connec-
tion with 45 percent of last year’s crimes,
including violent offenses.
For some Japanese, such statistics stoke
visions of “A Clockwork Orange” style so-
ciety in which random violence becomes a
way of life for alienated youths. But most
parents, educators and officials are less con-
cerned with the fringe than they are with the
aimlessness that like an epi-
demic among mainstream youths. Most
telling, and disturbing, is the fact that Japan
has one of the world’s highest teen-age sui-
cide rates; last year 560 youngsters between
the ages of 15 and 19 took their lives. “You
now run into huge numbers of Japanese
who don’t seem to have a close identifica-
tion with any value system or locality,” says
Masao Kunihiro, a cultural anthropologist
at Tokyo’s Sophia University. “We didn’t
have that kind of Japanese even after
[World War ll] when the country was in
really bad shape.”
Japan’s very success in fighting back
from the wartime disaster has much to do
with the current shiftlessness of youth. Just
a generation ago most Japanese workers
had a clear dream of middle-class affluence,
best illustrated by the relentless drive to
acquire the “three C’s”: a car, a cooler (air
conditioner) and a color television. The in-
dividual dream blended comfortably with
the national push to create an economic
miracle that would once more establish Ja-
pan as a global power. All of Japan, like one
giant locomotive, pulled in the same direc-

tion, relying on its deep-seated tribal in-
stincts for group harmony, hard work and
unquestioning obedience to authority
figures.
Today the middle-class dream is a way of
life for perhaps 90 percent of Japan’s popu-
lation. Bred on television and sated with
luxuries, youngsters fail to be excited by
creature comforts. What they see instead
are the long hours of overtime that their
fathers put in at the office. They are repelled
by the prospect of an hours-long commute
in packed trains. They wonder why their
fathers live like boarders in the homes they
have so lovingly jammed with high-quality
consumer goods. And they worry about the
toll of the fast-paced life that is beginning to
show in rising rates of stomach cancer and
heart disease, and in a national suicide rate
that has increased by nearly 25 percent over
the past decade. “In Japan,” says educator
Yoko Muro, “it’s never a question of wheth-
er you enjoy your job and your life, but only
how much you can endure.”
Ladder: Even the superachievers are hav-
ing misgivings. Each spring tens of thou-
sands of well-scrubbed college graduates,
self-consciously attired in new blue serge
suits, sit for entrance examinations to Ja-
pan’s top corporations. But doubts about
the heavy personal sacrifices required to
climb Japan’s hierarchical ladder are begin-
ning to emerge. A recent poll conducted by
the office of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Na-
kasone shows that only 24.5 percent of Jap-
anese students are fully satisfied with school
life, as compared with 67.2 percent in the
United States.
The postwar generation’s drive to excel
economically has also resulted in a huge
migration to the cities where 76 percent of
Japan’s 119 million people now live. Gone
are the tightly woven agrarian communities
where a single home housed three, even
four, generations. Now most Japanese
homes are an American-style two-genera-
tion affair, with increasing numbers isolat-
ed in high-rise buildings and lacking many
of the neighborly ties that traditionally
bound the Japanese. The results are painful-
ly clear to educators. School violence is rare
in older communities, says Deputy Director
Takehide Yokoo of the National Institute
for Education Research; it happens “in the
peripheral regions of the city, in the new
suburbs where people don’t know each oth-
er, and there is little sense of community.”
Home life has also been changed, perhaps
unalterably, by the push of Japanese women
into the job market. Since 1976, nearly 3
million women have entered the work force;


Rocking for show: The emphasis on independence and self-gratification seems to be undermining Japan's industrious soul
today roughly 25 percent of mothers work.
The improved economic status of Japanese
women has already taken a toll on tradition-
al family life: the divorce rate has increased
by 50 percent over the past decade.
There has also been a change in the way
children are raised. While the traditional
overindulgence of Japanese children is still
strong —a recent study by the Education
Ministry shows that more than two-thirds
of all elementary school children do not
make their own beds —a small, but growing
number of Japanese mothers seem less anx-
ious to shield their children from the min-
ute-to-minute blows of daily life. Almost 20
percent of all children under seven now
attend one of Japan’s more than 22,800 day-
care centers. Many older children find their
after-school hours unsupervised —a fact
that police and educators link to the rising
rate of juvenile crime. In many delinquency
cases, says Yoshikatsu Nakamura of the
Tokyo police department, “both parents
work and there is a tendency for them to
give children money when they can’t give
them enough attention. ”
Japan’s thrust toward affluence, urban-
ization and denuclearization of the family
all reflect a Western influence that is erod-
ing Japan’s time-honored devotion to con-
formity. “My parents try to impose on us
their mistaken ideas, pretending they know
everything,” says Jun Kono, 19. “A lot of
what they say is inconsistent and that dis-
gusts me.” But if today’s youth place greater
emphasis on independence and self-gratifi-
cation, individual choice has proved a heavy
burden for many youngsters. They have
neither the hungry spirit of their parents nor
the political commitment of their 1960 s
counterparts. They are more aware of what
they do not want than of what they do. In
the old Japan, says youth counselor Keiko
Koyanagi, “there was a solid order. But
those days are gone, and we are in a period of
confusion.”
The confusion is most evident in the
schools, the bedrock of the Japanese indus-
trial system. Youhg people soon learn that
their shot at lucrative, high-status govern-
ment and business jobs hinges almost exclu-
sively on educational pedigree. Pressuie to
perform—and conform—in the schools can
begin at a painfully early age. Some parents
pack their toddlers otf to “cram” schools to
study for entry into elite kindergartens,
From there, the competition only deepens,
Ninth graders sit for exams that they know
will make or break their chances for admis-
sion to the “right” high school. At the end of
the senior year, students take an excruciat-
ing set of college-entrance exams that can
provide the ticket to the “right” college and
then the “right” job. Fittingly, these tests
are called “examination hell.”
Japan’s educational system through high


school is highly regarded, but the stress on
standardized tests highlights its inherent
weakness: it emphasizes memorization of
facts at the expense of analytic thinking and
creativity. “Those things that do not show
up in the test scores—personality, ability,
courage or humanity—are completely ig-
nored,” says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s educa-
tion commitee. “Frustration against this
kind of thing leads kids to drop out
and run wild.”
Or simply run wild within the system.
Last month, after Japanese students began
the new school year, the windowpanes of
Classroom F at Rissho High School in To-
kyo suddenly shook; then flames erupted in
the yard outside. Police soon caught the
teen-ager who had hurled the Molotov
cocktail and had sped away on a motor
scooter. He threw the bomb, he said, to get
even with a teacher who had criticized his
greased coiffure and given him an im-
promptu haircut.
Vagabonds: It wasn’t an isolated inci-
dent; the erosion of Confucian decorum
has bred a disdain for law and order that
shocks Japanese adults. Alarm began to
mount last year following a series of mur-
derous assaults on vagabonds in the port
city of Yokohama that left three men dead
and 13 seriously injured. The junior-high-
schoolers responsible for the assaults were
unrepentent, telling the police they had
done it “for kicks.” In another celebrated
case, a 19-year-old bludgeoned his parents
The Al Capone look: First,sneak out of the house and change behind the bushes
to death with a metal baseball bat after an
argument over a stolen cash card. Tell-
ingly, the youth, who is now serving a 13-
year prison term, had been studying for his
third attempt to pass the back-breaking
university entrance exams when he mount-
ed his horrifying attack on his parents.
The spate of school disturbances has put
educational reform at the top of Japan’s
social agenda. Law-enforcement agencies
and educators have launched a campaign
to eradicate school violence. Police now
patrol events that have attracted violence
in the past, such as graduation ceremonies,
a time when juvenile gangs tend to seek
revenge against an inflexible system that
has no place for them. Teachers have also
tried to curb the surge of violence by per-
sonalizing their attention to students. The
initial results of these efforts are impres-
sive: classroom violence declined by 35
percent in the first half of 1984 from the
previous year’s rate. But few are willing yet
to relax their guard. “There is always the
chance the situation could worsen into
something like we see in the United States
and Europe,” warns Hideo Tokuno, depu-
ty director of the National Police Agency’s
youth section.
Looking further ahead, Nakasone re-
cently appointed a blue-ribbon panel of edu-
cators and opinion leaders to study ways to
remedy the crisis in Japan’s schools,
Among the various reforms under consider-
ation are steps to encourage corporate re-
cruiters to hire graduates of nonelite univer-
sities who have performed well, despite
their failure to obtain admission to a more

Tiny tots attend a ‘cram’ school, Nakasone visits a junior-high schoolroom: Calls for a return to a ‘moral education’


prominent school. The panel has also taken
some cues from the United States, propos-
ing both special programs for gifted chil-
dren and a wider variety of vocational
schools. “If the schools can give children
hope and dreams for the future and the will
to do their best,” says Kaifu, “today’s edu-
cational desert will become a thing of
the past.”
Nakasone and his ruling LDP have called
for the development of a system that would
emphasize a return to “moral education,”
and the LDP platform declares: “Patriot-
ism and the traditional respect for one’s
parents should be taught at school.” Al-
though Nakasone stresses that any new sys-
tem must be flexible, such calls have sent a
chill through many Japanese who remem-
ber the role the schools played in their coun-
try’s militaristic past.
While Japanese parents are concerned by
the rising tide of schoolroom violence, they
are no less worried about the far larger pool
of aimless youngsters who can find little
better to do than to pack video-game ar-
cades or don punkish fashions. Their lack of
drive is already showing up in adult society:
a recent Japanese survey of 10 countries
shows that Japan ranks last in the job satis-
faction category; where only 15.9 percent of
the Americans polled expressed dissatisfac-
tion with their jobs, fully 34.7 percent of the
Japanese had such feelings. “Ten years ago
young people were hard working and saw
their jobs as their primary reason for being,”
says Tamotsu Sengoku, director of the Ja-
pan Youth Research Instititute. Now, he
adds, “Japan’s economic accomplishments
are second to none, and young people don’t
know where they should go next.”
Some may take their cues from the grow-
ing pool of young professionals who have
broken step with the corporate world.
Many talented young people have eschewed
9-to-5 white-collar jobs in favor of small
independent design shops, publishing ven-
tures and other pursuits outside the main-
stream. Others have cobbled together
strings of part-time jobs that pay the bills,
but can be dropped whenever the spirit
grows restless. And a small, but growing,
number of young people are abandoning
city life to seek out cheap land in depopulat-
ed rural villages where they can establish
self-sufficient communes and artists’ re-
treats. “These are very intelligent, well-edu-
cated people who have begun to look for a
different route,” says Donald Clark of the
International Research Institute in Tokyo.
“There is a concern for a recovery of the
social intimacy of the small social unit, the
family and the village.”
Even many of those who have graduated
All Eyes on Tokyo
In Bangkok, the teen-agers cram the trendy boutiques of the
Siam Shopping Center by day, then cruise the discos by night
showing off their afternoon’s catch: fashions based on Tokyo’s
latest designs. In Hong Kong, youngsters navigate the crowded
streets, their eyes shaded by glossy black plastic sunglasses, their
ears covered with Walkman earphones, their heads swimming
with the synthesizer sounds of Japan’s pop solo act, Kitaro. Even
in staid Singapore, students have created their own version of
Tokyo’s Yoyogi Park on Sentosa Island, where they hang out
and try the latest dance steps. Throughout Southeast Asia,
Japan is fast replacing the West as the No. 1 trend setter on
matters of teen-age style and taste.
The rising fever to copy Japanese fads
seems harmless enough. While young-
sters from Seoul to Bangkok are eager to
assume the trappings of Japan’s youth
culture, they have not been infected by
the slackening discipline and aimlessness
of Japan’s teen-agers. Instead, the Japa-
nese influence plays out primarily in the
fashion department. Like their Japanese
counterparts, these kids carry clothes,
ornaments and costumejewelry to school
in paper bags. When classes let out, they
shed their plain school uniforms, then
strut their made-in-Japan designs in
parks and in shopping centers. Theirs is
not a defiant message; they just want to be
seen. “I’m proud to have people looking
at me,” bubbles 17-year-old Ek in Bang-
kok, decked out in a purple shirt, black
pants and an imitation Fedora.
The fascination with flashy fashions
owes much to the growing reserve of
pocket money enjoyed by many Asian
youths. With middle-class affluence
spreading throughout Southeast Asia,
particularly in Thailand and Singapore,
respect for daddy’s hard-earned dollar is
diminishing rapidly. Some youngsters
now lay out $3OO a month on clothes. “It
doesn’t matter how much I spend on
clothes,” boasts Na, an 18-year-old Thai.
“I can get money whenever I need it.”

ROBERT WALLIS— JB PICTURES
That sort of ebullient consumerism may help explain why
Asian youths have not picked up on some of the more dubious
Japanese trends. Affluence is much newer to Southeast Asian
teen-agers than it is to Japanese youths; the sheer appetite to buy
and to own is just peaking. In Thailand, says Surichai Wungaeo,
a sociologist, “the music, dance and dress are not part of
rebellion against the established order.” Indeed, Asia’s punked-
out teen-agers seem eager not to be confused with the violent
youths who create problems in Japan’s schools, or even with the
growing pool of juvenile delinquents in their own countries. One
of the favorite slogans among Thai students is “We hate vio-
lence, we just like dressing in beautiful clothes.”
Still, adults are not altogether thrilled by the pleasure-seeking
abandon of some of the younger generation. Thai teachers and
parents worry that teen-agers will drift
away from important cultural and reli-
gious values. In Singapore, officials are
alarmed by the erosion of public deco-
rum. A recent rash of break-dancing—
one of the many American fads processed
by way of Tokyo—prompted officials to
lay down the law: no break-dancing in
shopping malls or other public places.
Now Singaporean flashdancers must
confine their gyrations to a designated
area on Sentosa Island. But that has not
curbed the urge to moonwalk. As many
as 10,000 kids now pack off to the island
on weekends to perform the latest steps.
Japan, of course, is eager to promote
the export of its youth culture. The gov-
ernment’s first step toward encouraging
Japanomania was a 1974 student-ex-
change program. The success of that pro-
gram has generated others, most recently
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone’s
“ Youth Friendship Exchange Program,”
which has already brought 150 Thai teen-
agers to Japan for various monthlong
visits. Such exchanges are certain to be
supported by Southeast Asian officials
and parents, but only as long as their kids
come back with their heads turned only
by the style of Japan’s youthful rebel-
lion —and not its substance.

into the mainstream in recent years seem to
be striking out from the workaholic path of
their fathers. Today’s budding executives —
male and female alike —are delaying mar-
riage and family life and are using their
salaries and leisure time to travel, entertain
and just relax. They are also learning to say
“no” to their bosses; senior company offi-
cials complain that younger employees now
frequently turn down overseas postings,
voicing reluctance to contend with the
crime, poor city services and alien customs
of other countries. “[Young professionals]
haven’t stopped working hard,” says one
middle-aged Japanese manager. “It’s just
that they are much more versatile than we
were. They still do their jobs well, but they
also know how to play.”
Health Care: Some social commentators
worry that the “alternative Japan” that is
now emerging could hobble the Japanese
economy in the years ahead. With the
highest life expectancy in the world —79.8
years for women, 74.2 years for men —
Japan is growing older faster than any
other industrialized nation. As the post-
war baby-boom generation ages, a' smaller
number of young workers will be expected
to pay the mounting pension and health-
care costs of an aging population. But
there are fears that today’s youth will not
be equipped to assume that burden if their
apathy persists. “When this younger gen-
eration reaches mid- and upper-manage-
ment levels we can expect some negative
impact on [economic] growth,” says Zeni-
chi Ishikawa, a senior analyst at Daiwa
Traditional garb: A fading portrait
Street dance: The point is to be seen —and rattle the grown-ups
Securities. “Japanese management will
have to anticipate changes: manufacturers
will have to concentrate on more automated
means of production such as robots or auto-
mated office systems.”
Japan’s competitors should not hold
their breath: the Japanese character may be
changing, but it is still flowing strong.
“There are still plenty of young Japanese
who go the second mile and sacrifice con-
venience for the good of the group they’re
affiliated with,” says anthropologist Kuni-
hiro. What the country needs, says the
LDP’s Kaifu, is a challenge that will revive
the drive to excel. A touch of adversity
could do the trick. “If Japan receives some
economic damage from [competition by]
South Korea or other developing nations,”
says Sengoku of the Youth Research Insti-
tute, “the Japanese may feel they have to
work harder again.”
If the nation can meet such tests, there
may prove to be some unexpected blessings
in the experiences of Japan’s aimless genera-
tion. The groping challenges to authority
and discipline, the burgeoning displeasure
with a rigid workaholic standard and the
sometimes misdirected attempts to achieve
greater independence are all serving to in-
troduce an element of diversity into a uni-
form society. For better or worse, it seems
likely that the Japan of tomorrow will be a
livelier, more colorful place because of the
youth of today.

THE KOREAS
Hands Across the Border
At the tense truce village of Panmunjom
in the demilitarized zone last weekend,
hundreds of North Korean trucks rolled
slowly in convoy across the border. Out to
sea, nine North Korean ships headed south
across the naval demarcation line, some
bound for Pukpyong on South Korea’s east
coast, others headed for Inchon on the west.
Their holds were laden with textiles and
medicines, rice and cement —relief supplies
for victims of fierce floods that swept across
central South Korea early last month and
left nearly 200 people dead. But the mission
was also freighted with symbolism: for the
first time since the Korean peninsula was
divided 39 years ago, the rival governments
in Pyongyang and Seoul had agreed on an
exchange of something other than bullets
and angry words.
The small but historic step capped rough-
ly a month of closely watched diplomatic
volleying between the two capitals. It also
came at a time when Pyongyang and Seoul
are both quietly competing to burnish their
images and build bridges abroad. North
Korea’s initial offer of assistance for the
floods’ victims was made on the eve of South
Korean President Chun Doo Hwan’s land-
mark state visit to Japan last month, the first
such trip ever by a Korean leader. Previous
offers of relief aid from both sides following
past natural disasters had invariably been
rejected out of hand. This time, however,
Seoul officials hesitated briefly and then
accepted—effectively one-upping Pyon-
gyang’s offer by saying they did not need the
supplies, but would go along anyway as a
conciliatory gesture.
Even so, it was something of a surprise
that the deal was actually
brought off. Negotiations over
details of the transfer were han-
dled in Panmunjom by repre-
sentatives of the two countries’
branches of the Red Cross.
They broke down two weeks
ago over North Korea’s insist-
ence that it be allowed to truck
supplies directly into Seoul.
Unwilling to grant Pyongyang
such a propaganda coup, the
South Koreans held out for a
handover inside the DMZ until
last week, when they agreed to
a request that North Korean
journalists be allowed to ac-
company the supplies a short
distance across the border.
The operation itself began
Saturday morning, when the
first of 370 North Korean
trucks crossed through the
military checkpoint in Pan-
munjom. As journalists and
cameramen from both sides
jostled for position, South Ko-
rean Red Cross Secretary General Cho
Chul-Hwa greeted arriving officials and in-
vited them to visit Seoul—an offer the
North Koreans politely said would have to
be considered “privately.” The convoy then
moved off to an open lot in the tiny DMZ
village of Taesong-Dong, about a quarter of
a mile away, and began unloading 500,000
yards of cloth, more than 700 boxes of medi-
cal supplies and 7,500 tons of rice packed in
110-pound sacks marked “Made in the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.”
The goods were left there for later pick-up
by South Korean trucks.
Aground: The seagoing phase of the ex-
change took place in quieter surroundings
away from the emotionally charged border.
One of the five small ships bound for In-
chon, 20 miles west of Seoul, ran aground
while still in North Korean waters. The rest,
with South Korean escorts, anchored out-
side the harbor Saturday night before pro-
ceeding in to unload their cargoes of cement
the following morning, when the four ce-
ment-laden ships destined for Pukpyong
were also scheduled to make port.
If nothing else, the events stood in sharp
contrast to the scene in Rangoon a year ago,
when North Korean agents planted a bomb
that killed four South Korean cabinet mem-
bers and narrowly missed Chun himself. But
for all its historic significance, last week’s
relief mission was also just another sign of
the steely competition that divides the two
Koreas. It could mark the beginning of a
change in mood, but few expect the coldest of
cold wars to really thaw anytime soon.

HONG KONG
‘One Country, Two Systems’
Evans and Zhou exchange copies of the draft agreement: Pointing the way to a deal with Taiwan?
THEILER —UPI
In Peking’s Great Hall of the People last
week, British and Chinese officials put
their initials to velvet-bound copies of the
landmark agreement that over the next 13
years will guide Hong Kong’s return to
Chinese rule. Beneath an ornate mural de-
picting mating doves, Britain’s ambassa-
dor, Sir Richard Evans, and China’s vice
foreign minister, Zhou Nan, embraced
awkwardly, then raised glasses of cham-
pagne. “We owe our achievement first and
foremost to the farsighted decision of Chi-
nese and British leaders,” said Zhou. “The
joint declaration,” Evans replied, “is the
practical embodiment of the imaginative
concept of‘one country, two systems’.”
That unprecedented notion was greeted
last week with mixed optimism and resigna-
tion in the colony. People stood in long lines
outside government offices to snatch up
more than a million copies of the 38-page
Chinese-language text, which in broad
strokes outlines the terms under which
Hong Kong in 1997 will give up its status as a
crown colony to become a Chinese Special
Administrative Region. The draft treaty
pledges that the colony will retain virtually
all its freedoms—including, for at least 50
years, its capitalist economy. But the prom-
ises still must be reconciled with the poten-
tially heavy hand of communist authority.
Taiwan: But even as Hong Kong came to
grips with future shock, speculation turned
to its possible impact on a far tougher ques-
tion: Peking’s hopes for reunification with
the rival Nationalist government in Taipei.
Said Chen Bojian, the deputy director of the
Hong Kong office of Xinhua, the Chinese
state news agency that functions as Peking’s
informal embassy in the colony: “The idea
[of one country, two systems] is suitable not
only for Hong Kong, but for many other
regions. It is definitely suitable for Taiwan.”
Few were surprised that Peking would use
the 1997 accord to bring up the Taiwan
question. “Hong Kong is only the appetiz-
er,” a Western diplomat in the colony said
last week. “Taiwan is the main course, and
always has been.”
That is certainly not how the fierce anti-
communists in Taipei see it. Taiwan’s Prime
Minister Yu Kuo-hwa went quickly on the
attack last week, accusing Britain of “push-
ing 5.5 million people under communist
totalitarian enslavement.” Taipei officials
have repeatedly scoffed at Peking’s propos-
als for reuniting Taiwan with the main-
land—including a nine-point plan floated
three years ago and more recent remarks by
China’s top political leader, Deng Xiao-
ping, suggesting that one country, two sys-
tems could point the way to a resolution.
Test: At very least, the new accord will
add a new dimension to relations between
the two Chinas. Hong Kong is Taiwan’s
third largest overseas market, as well as the
conduit for indirect trade with China that
this year could be worth nearly $1 billion.
Like Peking, the Taipei government main-
tains a shadowy network of representatives
and supporters in the colony, including pub-
lications, banks, labor unions and even sev-
eral individuals who hold seats in Taiwan’s
Legislature. One of the accord’s major tests
will be whether the Chinese keep their prom-
ise to allow pro-Taipei supporters to stay on
without reprisals after 1997. “I
want to stay,” says Edward
Tseng, 69, a veteran corre-
spondent for Taiwan’s semiof-
ficial Central News Agency
who has lived in the colony for
two decades. “The question is
whether the communists will
let me.”
Despite such ties, Taiwan it-
self could be persuaded to loos-
en its Hong Kong connection
once the red star of the People’s
Republic is hoisted over the
governor’s mansion. “Other-
wise,” said one foreign analyst
in Taipei last week, “it would
indicate that the Kuomintang
[the Nationalist Party] and the
Communists are talking.” The
pressure comes not only from
survivors of the 1949 retreat
from the mainland, but also
from 85 percent of Taiwan’s
population who are ethnic
Taiwanese without mainland
ties and have no wish to be in-
eluded in a reunited China.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian
put on Peking’s best face at the United Na-
tions last week, promising that China would
be “far more generous” to Taipei than it had
been to Hong Kong. Diplomats expected
that the 1997 accord would feature promi-
nently this week at China’s Oct. 1 National
Day celebrations —the occasion Peking
used three years ago to float its nine-point
reunification plan, which proposed that
Taiwan could keep its economy, its govern-
ment and its 500,000-man armed forces in-
tact in exchange for a nominal pledge of
mainland sovereignty. Hong Kong’s deal
with the Chinese is not nearly so sweet, but
Peking’s fond hope is that it will prove to be
the start of something even bigger.

A Report on Peking’s
Political Prisoners
The solitary confinement was the worst
part. Arrested in Peking in November 1979,
magazine editor Liu Qing endured five
months alone in a cold, wet cell where he
developed rheumatism and difficulty in
walking; his hair fell out in clumps and his
eyesight deteriorated rapidly. Moved to a
group cell, he refused to obey a guard’s order
and was beaten. “My body was covered with
blue and purple bruises, ” he recalled later.
“/ had been forced to wear a gas mask that
made it very hard for me to breathe, and I
was restricted with handcuffs that cut into
my flesh. ” He was transferred to the infa-
mous Temple of the Lotus Flower labor

camp and is believed to be locked up some-
where in Peking today. His crime? Selling
transcripts of the “public” trial of fellow
dissident editor Wei Jingsheng.
Liu Qing’s ordeal was summoned up last
week in a bleak report published by Amnes-
ty International just hours after London
and Peking initialed the draft agreement
that will guide the eventual transfer of Hong
Kong to China. “Throughout China,” the
report asserts, “prisoners of conscience
[are] detained solely for the non-violent ex-
ercise of basic human rights. Some of those
jailed have been convicted of‘counter-revo-
lutionary offenses’ under articles of the
Chinese law that can be —and have been —
applied to suppress non-violent dissent.
Others have been detained without charge
or trial.” The report also protests China’s
extensive use of the death penalty: “In late
1983 a wave of mass executions took place
as part of a clampdown on crime in which
several thousand people are believed to have
been executed in less than three months.’
The report lists several categories of Chi-
nese citizens that are allegedly subjected to
extensive government abuse. Among the
casualties have been young workers and
students who participated in the “democra-
cy and human rights” movement that began
in 1978. Amnesty claims, for example, that
at least 20 dissident editors have been ar-
rested on political charges. Another group
consists of Roman Catholic priests, many of
whom were imprisoned during the 1950 s
for remaining loyal to the Vatican.
Shackled: Once jailed, prisoners may
find themselves facing conditions the re-
port describes as “cruel, inhuman and de-
grading.” At times inmates must stand
without moving for 24 hours at a stretch.
They endure prolonged solitary confine-
ment; hands are shackled behind the back,
sometimes for weeks. In addition, the re-
port describes the xiaohao, a cell too small
to stand up in. A former inmate recounted
that “punishment in this cell could last
from a few days to six months and that
prisoners who had spent more than a few
days in it had trouble walking when they
were allowed out.”
Amnesty officials claim that despite Chi-
na’s official secrecy, they have dossiers on
60 “prisoners of conscience.” But according
to spokesman Richard Reoch, “the scale of
imprisonment is much larger than Amnesty
can effectively make estimates for.” Peking
did not respond to the charges, but many
American experts believe that the Amnesty
report was no surprise. Still, China’s hu-
man-rights performance has improved sig-
nificantly since the communist victory in
1949. The report congratulates Peking for
two 1980 legal reforms that provide for
somewhat greater personal freedom. Reoch
also concedes that the number of political
prisoners has dropped since the end of the
Cultural Revolution. But he insists that the
problem remains a vast one. “It is clear that
in China some of the most fundamental of
rights—freedom of expression, the right to
a free trial and freedom from execution —
have not been at all secured.”
HARRY ANDERSON with DONNA FOOTE in London
‘Both Sides Are Very Content’
Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Geoffery
Howe, was a key figure in the negotiations
that produced the new agreement on Hong
Kong's return to Chinese rule. Last week
in New York he spoke with Newsweek’s
Patricia J. Sethi about the terms and out-
look for the accord. Excerpts:
SETHI: Are you happy with the
agreement?
HOWE: Well, I shouldn’t think there’s
an agreement in the world with which
both parties are fully satisfied. Obviously,
it’s been a matter of give-and-take. But I
think we’ve reached a conclusion with
which both sides are very well content.
Q. What was the toughest negotiat-
ing point?
A. The most difficult thing, particularly
for those watching us from Hong Kong,
was whether or not British administra-
tion in some form would continue after
1997. That plainly was not acceptable in
the context of the negotiations as a whole.
Q. How do you answer critics who say
that Britain is “selling out” Hong Kong?
A. To describe [the agreement] as a sell-
out really is standing the truth on its
head. It would have been a sellout if we’d
said, “Right. The lease runs out in 1997.
That’s the end of the road, and we wash our
hands of it.” We did not do that. This is a
clear, legally binding international agree-
ment. It’s the highest possible commit-
ment that two sovereign states can give. It
isn’t an agreement sketched out with a few
strokes and paragraphs —it’s full of detail.
And it’s an agreement that meshes with
the interests of the main negotiating par-
ties. Weboth want Hong Kong to succeed.
Q. But how do you ensure that China
abides by its terms?
A. Hong Kong has achieved its present
position because of growing Chinese un-
derstanding and good will toward the
desirability of success there. And that will
be the pattern for the future. It couldn’t be
guaranteed by force from anywhere—by
outside agencies, by outside nations. It
Howe: ‘We want Hong Kong to succeed ’
ROBERT R. McELROY— NEWSWEEK
can be guaranteed by the commitment of
two countries that attach importance to
their reputation in international law, and
that have a direct common interest.
Q. Isn’t there still the possibility that the
agreement could be negated by a leader-
ship change in Peking?
A. I believe that any government of
China that has the best interests of China
at heart is bound to recognize that the
successful performance of this agreement
is profoundly in China’s interest. If there
were to be any problem in the future, of
course we should be anxious to do all we
could to see that the agreement is upheld.
But I frankly don’t see that happening.
Q. What about the question of self-deter-
mination, which Britain gave so much
weight to in the Falklands?
A. The Falklands and Hong Kong are
totally different places with totally differ-
ent histories. Hong Kong lives on the
margin of China and is based upon a lease
for the overwhelming majority of its terri-
tory. It hasn’t got, it hasn’t developed a
representative pattern of government —
again, that’s a consequence of its history.
But we have said throughout that we want
this conclusion to be acceptable for the
people of Hong Kong.
Q. Why are there no plans for a referen-
dum on the agreement in the colony itself?
A. We thought seriously about this, but
there would be real practical difficulties.
We were anxious not to create a situation
that would cause sharp social and political
conflicts in a society that’s of a special
nature. And, of course, the Chinese would
not, I think, have welcomed a referendum.


EUROPE
Getting Together
But Staying Apart
Reagan and Gromyko break the ice, but Moscow
remains suspicious of the effort at conciliation.
If nothing else, it was the photo opportu-
nity of the year. When Ronald Reagan
met Andrei Gromyko in the Oval Office last
week, so many photographers turned out to
record the occasion that they couldn’t all
get into the room. Reagan’s managers don’t
believe in underplaying a symbolic event, so
the cameramen were ushered through in
shifts, requiring the principals to hold
their pose for nearly 20 minutes. Through it
all, Reagan looked strangely ill at ease.
When Gromyko asked when the “hurri-
cane” would be over, the president launched
into a dissertation on Hurricane Isidore be-
fore realizing that his guest was talking
about riotous photographers, not tropical
disturbances. At first, the Soviet foreign
minister put up with the delay like a seasoned
trouper, but as the show dragged on, Gro-
myko began to grumble. “One could con-
duct the whole negotiation while they are
doing this,” he complained.
Then, finally, they got down to business.
For 3Vi hours, including a working lunch,
With Mondale: ‘Reagan is our president"
LARRY DOWNING— NEWSEEK
Reagan, Gromyko and their advisers
thrashed over the bitter issues that divide the
United States and the Soviet Union. Reagan
was remarkably conciliatory. “In dealing as
equals,” he told Gromyko, “our common
purpose ought to be that this competition is
peaceful.” Gromyko was stubbornly suspi-
cious. “The Soviet Union will continue to
judge [the] real intentions of the U.S. side by
its practical deeds,” he said afterward. The
meeting, Reagan’s first with a top Soviet
leader, settled nothing; there was no tangible
progress toward any specific goal, such as
the resumption of talks on nuclear arms. But
the administration’s weeklong courtship of
Gromyko achieved its minimum objectives:
despite Democratic charges that Reagan
was an election-eve convert to arms control,
the effort was a clear political plus for the
president. And it left the door open for a
modestly promising dialogue between the
superpowers in a second Reagan term.
‘You and I*: The talks in the Oval Office
began with the president reading a statement
written in his own hand on a yellow legal
pad. Reagan assured Gromyko that he rec-
ognized the Soviet Union as a superpower
and that, in the words of one official present,
“while we don’t admire their system, we
don’t seek to change it.” Gromyko respond-
ed' with a familiar diatribe blaming Wash-
ington for international tensions. When the
discussion turned to arms control, the two
leaders quickly found themselves at logger-
heads. “There’s much you don’t know about
our positions,” Reagan complained. “It’s
simply a matter of whether we are willing
to talk, you and I.” But Gromyko refused to
be pinned down. Whenever Reagan ap-
proached the crux of an issue, he changed the
subject. “It was clear that they weren’t inter-
ested, that they did not come to negotiate
numbers,” said a U.S. official. “They came
to meet Ronald Reagan.”
Several times Reagan tried to assure Gro-
myko of his sincerity. “We’re not seeking
superiority,” he said at one stage. But the
president wasn’t running away from tough
issues. He said Moscow’s military establish-
ment “far exceeds your needs of self-defense.
We have reason to see you as an expansionist
power.” Reagan also brought up human
rights in a measured way, explaining that
Americans care about the fate of Soviet
dissidents because of their own immigrant
A photo opportunity in the Oval Office:
heritage. “We expected a strong reply on
that, and we didn’t get it,” said a top White
House aide. As the participants broke for
lunch, Reagan took Gromyko aside for sev-
eral intense minutes of man-to-man talk,
without even an interpreter between them.
Later, in the Red Room, Gromyko raised a
glass of cranberry juice to Nancy Reagan
and suggested slyly: “Every night, whisper
‘peace’ in his ear.” The First Lady replied:
“I’ll also whisper in your ear. ”
‘A New Beginning’: Throughout the
week’s discussions, tone seemed to count for
more than substance. Addressing the U.N.
General Assembly, Reagan called for “a
new beginning” on arms control and pro-
posed a new “framework” to guide negotia-
tions during the next 20 years. Gromyko
held a brusque meeting with Secretary of
State George Shultz and then delivered a
speech of his own, stonewalling Reagan’s
proposals with a demand for “concrete
deeds and not verbal assurances.” Despite
his intransigence, Gromyko’s mere pres-
ence was a political blessing for Reagan,
whose failure thus far to talk peace with the
Kremlin seemed to be one of the few weak-
nesses of a juggernaut re-election campaign.
Walter Mondale tried to recoup in his own


In dealing as equal,' the president told his visitor, 'our common purpose ought to be that this competition is peaceful'
meeting with Gromyko. But the Democrat-
ic candidate was in the difficult position of
trying to be neither a neglected wallflower
nor a meddling gate-crasher. He got his
moment in the spotlight but had to use it,
lamely, to remind Gromyko “that President
Reagan is our president and there should be
no misunderstanding of that fact.”
With the election less than 40 days off,
Reagan spent most of last week on foreign
affairs. He got himself into terrible trouble
over the bombing of the U.S. Embassy annex
in Beirut two weeks ago. First Reagan tried
to shrug off the absence of adequate security
provisions. Then he made things worse by
seeming to blame Jimmy Carter’s intelli-
gence policies for the disaster. But the presi-
dent made good his losses with the Gromyko
visit. Just talking to the Soviet foreign minis-
ter was a political plus; any actual progress
would be a bonus. And when the White
House talks ended, Gromyko agreed to a
follow-up meeting with Shultz the next
day—a sign that Moscow had not given up
on the president.
Reagan and Gromyko got their first
glimpse of each other at a U.S. diplomatic
reception in New York City the night before
the president’s address to the United Na-
tions. Gromyko, his wife, Lidia, and Soviet
Ambassador to the United States Anatoly
Dobrynin were among the first of the 200
guests to pass through the receiving line in
the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel. The Soviet foreign minister greeted
Reagan without a smile. Jabbing his finger at
the president’s stomach, he appeared to be
lecturing his host. But it turned out that
Gromyko was merely reminding Reagan
that they had met before —at a San Clemente
barbecue in 1973, when Reagan was gover-
nor of California and Gromyko was accom-
panying Leonid Brezhnev to a summit with
Richard Nixon. The two men spoke for less
than a minute; each said he was “looking
forward” to their formal meeting on Friday.
Umbrella: "We are ready for constructive
negotiations with the Soviet Union,” Rea-
gan declared at the United Nations the next
day. In an expansive tour d’horizon, he sug-
gested that progress could be made on a
variety of regional problems, including Cen-
tral America and the Middle East (box). On
arms control, Reagan said Washington and
Moscow should “build a bigger umbrella
under which it can operate —a road map, if
you will, showing where during the next 20
years or so these individual efforts can lead
... If progress is temporarily halted at one
set of talks, this newly established frame-
work for arms control could help us take up
the slack at other negotiations.” Reagan
offered no specific concessions to get arms
talks going again, but he did hint that he was
prepared to be flexible.
The tone of Reagan’s speech was striking-
ly temperate, even for a politician who needs
to buff up his image as a peacemaker. The
president did not criticize the Soviets for
walking out of the parallel Geneva talks on
strategic arms (START) and on intermedi-
ate-range nuclear forces in Europe (INF).
He did not refer, even obliquely, to last year’s
Korean-airliner atrocity. And he managed
to call for “a diplomatic settlement” in Af-
ghanistan without mentioning the Soviet
invasion. Afterward, Reagan said he hoped
he had given the Soviets “an offer that they
can’t refuse.”
But the Russians weren’t exactly falling
all over themselves to cooperate. Gromyko
and the rest of the Soviet delegation sat
impassively through Reagan's speech and
did not even join in the polite applause at the
end. “Just because Reagan changes his
tune,” said a Soviet source, “are we ex-
pected to dance? We are not convinced


EUROPE
about Washington’s sincerity.” Addressing
the Soviet Writers Union in Moscow, Presi-
dent Konstantin Chernenko charged that
American leaders still did not want “the
normalization of Soviet-American relations
on the principles of equality, mutual respect
and non-intrusion into one another’s inter-
nal affairs.”
The official Soviet reaction probably had
been laid down in advance. Walter Mon-
dale’s response was equally predictable and
a lot more outspoken. The Democratic
standard-bearer charged that only “the new
Reagan” endorsed arms control; “the old
Reagan” opposed it and worked instead for
military superiority. “To those who wel-
come the new Reagan,” Mondale added, “I
say this: My dad was a Methodist minister,
and he once told me to be skeptical of death-
bed conversions. I asked him why, and he
said, ‘Because sometimes they get well on
you’.” Mondale had a point about Reagan’s
flip-flop on arms control, but so far his own
polls showed that the issue was getting him
nowhere.
At midweek, Shultz and Gromyko met in
the U.S. Mission to the United Nations for
their first detailed discussion since last Janu-
ary. Gromyko was prepared for nothing
more than a once-over-lightly; his aides an-
nounced at the outset that the foreign minis-
ter would stay for only three hours, much
less time than previous meetings have con-
sumed. Later, U.S. officials reported that the
Playing to the Crowd
At the United Nations, Ronald Reagan and Andrei Gromyko
offered different visions of the world’s troubles and villains.
■ Reagan on US. Foreign Policy. The United States welcomes
diversity and peaceful competition; we do not fear the trends of
history. We are not ideologically rigid. We do have principles,
and we will stand by them. But we will also seek the friendship
and good will of all, both old friends and new.
■On Arms Control. We recognize that there is no sane
alternative to negotiations on arms control... I believe this is
A president’s promise: ‘Good will’
PHOTOS BY JACQUES M. CHENET— NEWSWEEK
a view shared by every
country in the world
and by the Soviet Union
itself. ... We would
consider what measures
of restraint both sides
might take while negoti-
ations proceed. Howev-
er, any agreement must
logically depend upon
our ability to get the
competition in offensive
arms under control . . .
Our approach in all these
areas will be designed to
take into account con-
cerns the Soviet Union
has voiced.
■On Central America.
Regrettably, there are
forces in the region eager
to thwart democratic
change. But these forces
are now on the defensive; the tide is turning in the direction of
freedom. We call upon Nicaragua in particular to abandon its
policies of subversion and militarism and to carry out the
promises it made to the Organization of American States to
establish democracy at home.
■ On U&-Soviet Relations. I propose that our two countries
agree to embark on periodic consultations at policy level about
regional problems. . . . Spheres of influence are a thing of the
past. Differences between American and Soviet interests are
not. The objectives of this political dialogue will be to help
avoid miscalculation, reduce the potential risk of U.S.-Soviet
confrontation and help the people in areas of conflict to find
peaceful solutions.... I feel particularly strongly about break-
ing down the barriers between the peoples of the United States
and the Soviet Union and between our political, military and
other leaders. ... I will suggest to the Soviet Union that we
institutionalize regular ministerial or cabinet-level meetings
between our two countries on the whole agenda of issues before
us.. . .In such talks we could consider the exchange of outlines
of five-year military plans for weapons development and our
schedules of intended procurement.
■ Gromyko on Nuclear Arms. It was Washington’s deliberate
intention to wreck the negotiations on nuclear arms, both
medium range and strategic. And it did succeed in this.. . . The
United States must remove the obstacles it has erected to the
holding of talks. Unless these obstacles are removed, of course,
these talks will not take place —and this is what the U.S. has in
mind. . . . An effective measure [would be] a quantitative and
qualitative freeze on nuclear-weapon arsenals by all states that
possess them. This could be done first by the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.A. on a bilateral basis.. . .We have never sought, nor do we
seek, superiority. What we want is to maintain the equilibrium,
and at the lowest possible level.
■ On Space Weapons. We express the hope that the United
States will refrain from actions that would render irreversible
the process of turning outer space into an arena of military
rivalry and that it would be willing to engage in talks with a
view to reaching agreement. For its part, the U.S.S.R. contin-
ues to favor the idea of starting such talks as soon as possible.
■ On Central America. The situation in Central America . . .
should be settled by peaceful means, on the basis of the
unconditional cessation by the United States of interference in
the internal affairs of the countries’ governments. It is possible
that such a settlement has been opened up thanks to the
constructive approach of Nicaragua and Cuba and to the
initiative of the states of the Contadora group.
■ On U&-Soviet Relations. The threat of war has grown, and
the foundations of world peace have become more shaky.
This course [is] more than ever such a marked feature of the
current policies of the United States and of those who have
chosen the role of its
accomplices. .. . [U.S.
leaders] virtually flaunt
their indifference to the
reputation of the U.S.
side as a partner in in-
ternational affairs. But
there is nothing here to
be proud of. . . . The So-
viet Union believes that
it is precisely concrete
deeds and not verbal as-
surances that can lead
us to the normalization
of the situation in our
relations with the U.S.
. . . Every American, ev-
ery American family
should know that the
Soviet Union wants
peace and only peace
with the United States.
A Soviet attack: ‘U.S. obstacles’


session produced several lively exchanges,
including some in English, a language that
Gromyko understands but rarely speaks in a
formal setting.
“Reagan’s speech threw a spanner into
the works,” a Third World diplomat with
close ties to the Soviets said at the U.N. “The
Russians came here with a tough prepared
text which would place the blame squarely
on the United States. Now they have to go
into an overnight reassessment of the situa-
tion.” But when Gromyko addressed the
General Assembly, it was clear that he
hadn’t been won over. The Soviet foreign
minister told a senior Western diplomat that
only two new paragraphs were added to his
own speech after Reagan’s address. Gromy-
ko didn’t specify which two, but the entire
speech was tough and businesslike. It
contained no personal attacks on Rea-
gan and no new demands, but it wasn’t
especially conciliatory, either. “A
shade harsher than hoped for’ ’ was the
verdict of one top White House aide.
‘Try and Try Again’: Gromyko ac-
cused the administration—not for the
first time —of “frenzied militarism.”
He claimed that “current U.S. policy”
was to blame for the breakdown of the
arms talks, but he left his options open
by saying negotiations could be re-
sumed if Washington decided to “re-
move the obstacles it has erected” —
which could mean anything the Sovi-
ets want it to mean later on. Shultz
emerged from the General Assembly
visibly angered. He called Gromyko’s
speech “sad and disappointing,” but
he said the administration would “try
and try again.”
When his turn came, Mondale was
careful not to negotiate with Gromy-
ko; he kept pointing out that Reagan is
president, insisting that the Soviets
would gain nothing by delay. He was
critical of Soviet policy in several
areas, including human rights. Mon-
dale made a plea for the right of Soviet
Jews and others to emigrate, and he ex-
pressed specific concern for more than a
dozen Soviet dissidents, including Andrei
Sakharov, handing Gromyko a list of their
names. “They didn’t throw the list in our
face,” a Mondale aide said later. “That’s
something.” The Soviets did try to throw
Mondale abone. Tass, the Soviet news agen-
cy, commented approvingly: “It followed
from what W. Mondale said that he, for his
part, regarded a turn for the better in rela-
tions between the United States and the
Soviet Union as important and, in principle,
possible.” It was not the kind of endorse-
ment that W. Mondale was likely to bran-
dish on the campaign trail.
As for Reagan, it was clear that the Sovi-
ets hadn’t yet made up their minds about his
sincerity. After the White House meeting,
Tass commentator Yuri Kornilov sneered
at Reagan’s “pseudopeaceable” rhetoric.
But Soviet policy was in a state of flux; the
Kremlin isn’t likely to set a firm course until
it has a chance to study the U.S. election
results and the opening moves by the win-
ner. Meantime, Moscow wants to stay on
the good side of world opinion by insisting
that it is ready for better relations with
Washington. Chernenko underscored that
point last week during another of his brief
public appearances (this time, instead of
pinning the Order of Lenin on someone, he
had one pinned on him). “The capitalist
countries,” said Chernenko, “should know
that provided there is reciprocity, they will
always have in the Soviet Union an honest
and well-wishing partner.” As the week
ended, Gromyko spent more than two
hours with Shultz. Again, there were no
breakthroughs, but the two sides agreed
that there should be further contacts, possi-
‘Ron and the Dancing Bear’: Reagan sounded conciliatory, but Gromyko was wary
bly including a visit to Moscow by Shultz
early next year.
Reagan’s political handlers already have
launched ablitz of campaign advertisements
trumpeting his accomplishments as a peace-
maker. There is no reason to doubt Reagan’s
devotion to peace. The real question is
whether his own conservative constituency
would rein him in. With the campaign under
way, administration hard-liners have been
lying low. But once the president is safely re-
elected, they may stage a counteroffensive
against the peace policy. Standing up to
hard-liners has never been Reagan’s strong-
est suit. On the eve of his talks with Gromy-
ko, he gave in to pressure from one conserva-
tive lobby and formally proclaimed last
week to be “National Peace Through
Strength Week.” The president also is ex-
pected to sign a measure sponsored by Sen.
Charles Grassley, a conservative Republi-
can from lowa, that will change the address
of the Soviet Embassy in Washington to “1
Sakharov Plaza.” The embassy is moving
soon anyway, but the symbolic change of
address is the sort of unprofitable provoca-
tion that the president was supposed to be
putting behind him.
Reagan’s attempt to convince the Soviets
that he is genuinely interested in better rela-
tions began last January with his “Ivan and
Anya” speech, in which he appealed to ordi-
nary Soviet citizens as well as their leaders,
The message still hasn’t sunk in. “They want
to know that we’re not playing a game for
domestic political purposes,” said a senior
presidential adviser. “But they’ll know that
in six weeks, assuming we win.” Henry Kis-
singer, for one, agreed that the superpowers
were moving toward arms negotiations and
some form of coexistence, albeit “in a crab-
like manner.” Former national-security ad-
viser Zbigniew Brzezinski went so far as to
predict that some kind of arms-control nego-
tiations probably would begin “not far into
January of next year. ”
Persuasion: The breakthrough, if it comes
at all, may not be that quick. First the Soviets
will try to extract unilateral concessions
from Washington, such as a moratorium on
the testing and deployment of antisatellite
(ASAT) devices. They will have to be per-
suaded that Reagan wants to negotiate, but
that he won’t give them something for noth-
ing. Fortunately, the Soviets are worried
about weapons in space, where U.S. technol-
ogy seems to be opening up an “ASAT gap.”
That issue could eventually break the stale-
mate and bring the superpowers to a forum
in which each of them would have an oppor-
tunity to match words with deeds.

A Last-Chance Debate
“OK, Guys...Standby...Now Remember,Don’t Bore The Audience With The Real Issues...And Wal-
ly Baby—Keep Those Snappy‘Where’s Th’Beef ’Lines Coming...Remember—This Is Show Biz!!...”
BROOKINS— RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH
Mondale has just 90 minutes to pop Reagan’s balloon.
Single combat is as old as Hector and
Achilles struggling in the dust outside
the walls of Troy. In 1960 America melded
this heroic tradition with the television
age—and the presidential debate was born.
This Sunday night Ronald Reagan and Wal-
ter Mondale will meet in Louisville for a 90-
minute scrap over domestic issues. This
debate will be different. Never has an incum-
bent president soaring so high in the polls
risked his supremacy by sharing a podium
with his rival. Never has a challenger been so
desperate, so candid about being ill at ease
before the television cameras —and yet so
experienced in hand-to-hand combat.
In last week’s preliminaries Reagan domi-
nated the media show simply by meeting
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Yet campaigning in Ohio the president
proved again that he can be his own worst
enemy when he let slip a series of maladroit
comments about the latest Beirut truck
bombing. Mondale’s own low-key
session with Gromyko hardly boosted
his standing. But the challenger
showed flashes of a candidacy still
capable of rebirth. In a well-crafted
speech at George Washington Uni-
versity, Mondale articulated the prin-
ciples of compassion and fairness that
animate his political beliefs. And in an
interview with The Washington Post,
he evoked the gritty determination
that saved him in the primaries. “Ac-
tually, I’m sort of a political vagrant —
there’s no visible means of support,”
Mondale said. “And I just have to go
out and win it on this basis.”
Reagan’s demonstration that loose lips
can sink presidents and Mondale’s dogged
efforts to define himself may presage a de-
bate more revealing and riveting than any-
thing in the campaign so far. Reagan aides
are happy to play for a tie: all they need to
avoid is another damaging gaffe or lapse by
the president. The president’s handlers have
done what they could to make the encounter
dry and bloodless—insisting on a stilted for-
mat with each candidate behind a podium
responding to questions from four reporters.
The Mondale camp is delighted that the
domestic debate (and an Oct. 21 follow-up
on foreign policy) is being held at all: they see
it as their big chance to scrape the Teflon off
the Reagan presidency. “If we cut him, he’ll
hemorrhage,” predicted one Mondale aide.
Reagan aides are trying to get their boss to
study videotapes of Mondale’s past debates,
so the president will understand, as one
adviser put it, “how tough the guy is.” But
BRUCE HOERTEL
MARK PETERS
Stockman, Sovern: Sparring partners for the stars
the Reaganites are confident
they have deciphered Mon-
dale’s consistent debate profile:
he likes to interrupt and put his
opponent on the defensive, yet
is humorless and predictable.
Mondale, according to his
handlers, is “psyched” for the
debate. He has been honing his
arguments for more than a
week, and soon will begin prac-
ticing in front of a camera with
a tiny group of debate hand-
lers critiquing his perform-
ance. While the president will
again use David Stockman as
his debate sparring partner,
Mondale will be rehearsing
with Columbia University
president Michael Sovern play-
ing the Gipper. Mondale strat-
egists have yet to decide how
aggressive Mondale should be.
Lew Kaden, a New York law-
yer who is prepping Mondale,
concedes Reagan’s mastery of
television: “The president is a
superb debater. He knows the
medium very well.”
Mondale freely admits that he’s baffled by
television. He told The Washington Post,
“I’ve been trained to deal with an audience
and how you move them . . . It’s how that
looks on the evening news that’s my prob-
lem.” But Mondale argues that Sunday
night’s set-to will be different: it’s conversa-
tional, he’s an experienced debater and well
versed in the issues. Kaden is similarly up-
beat, but acknowledges that his candidate
has to remember that “TV is a one-on-one
conversation with each viewer. Mondale
will be at his best if he can see it that way.”
‘Peace’: If Mondale is laden down by tele-
vision, the Reagan camp views it as their
lodestone: everything is geared to producing
the right “sound bites” for the evening news.
During his one day on the road last week, the
president was typically thematic: in a brief
speech at Bowling Green State University he
mentioned “peace” 21 times. In Milwaukee
he praised “the bedrock values that. . .nour-
ish our families” —values that some critics
find lacking in Reagan himself (box).
Perhaps responding to the restive mood
of a traveling press corps desperate for sub-
stance instead of symbols, the presi-
dent departed from custom and ac-
cepted questions from his student
audience at Bowling Green. It was an
unmitigated disaster; in just 25 min-
utes Reagan managed to insult Jim-
my Carter by hinting that past in-
telligence letdowns contributed to
the Beirut bombing, confuse Libya
with Lebanon and mishandle several
other substantive issues. But Reagan
aides sloughed it off; their daily
phone polls still show everything
coming up Ronnie. These surveys
have the president leading in all 50
states, and an aide called his national


margin a “rock solid” 20 percentage points.
Mondale’s own polls conveyed the same
dispiriting message: he was being buried
alive. The candidate’s frustration was palpa-
ble, just as it had been when he hit rock
bottom after losing the New Hampshire
primary and the Maine caucuses. On both
occasions the specter of impending defeat
had an oddly tonic effect. It galvanized Mon-
dale to abandon caution and state simply
and passionately: this is where I stand and
may well fall.
Tfeart and Soul’: “I have been counseled
to cut loose from my history, to desert the
forgotten Americans I have always fought
for,” he told an enthusiastic student audi-
ence at George Washington. “My answer is
no. I would rather lose a race about decency
than win one about self-interest. I would
rather fight for the heart and soul of America
than fight for the bonuses of the Fortune
500.” This invocation of traditional Demo-
cratic populism was combined with an
angry litany of contrasts between the so-
called “new Reagan” and the “old Reagan,”
prompted by the president wrapping himself
around an olive branch at the United Na-
tions. “The new Reagan calls for peace in
Central America,” Mondale declared in one
of a dozen examples. “The old Reagan
launched an illegal war in Nicaragua.”
The campaign tried to capitalize on the
Fighting Fritz themes of the
speech with a new series of tele-
vision ads, but the strategy was
marred by continued feuding
among Mondale’s media men.
Two of the ads attacked Rea-
gan on the deficit, a tactic that
one disgruntled media adviser
called “idiotic.” He explained,
“People don’t understand the
deficit. And even if they under-
stand it, they don’t believe
Ronald Reagan is responsible
for it.” A five-minute spot,
designed to paint Mondale as
a fighting underdog, was the
product of so much conflicting
advice that some thought
it ended up as a confusing
pastiche.
Kathleen Jamieson of the
University of Maryland, who
analyzed the forensics of the
1980 debates for the networks,
theorizes that there are only
four moments during the cam-
paign when the voters might “open up” to
the Mondale message. One was after the
successful Democratic convention —and
Mondale promptly squandered it. The oth-
ers come after the debates, including the
Oct. 11 vice presidential face-off. “If Mon-
Single combat 1980 style: The Carter-Reagan face-off
dale wins, he’s got to reinforce the message
fast,” she said. “If he doesn’t win, it doesn’t
much matter what he does.”

Reagan as Grandfather
In public, Ronald Reagan’s pro-family pronouncements reso-
nate with the old-time values of “The Waltons.” However,
cynics have long contended that the drama the president’s own
brood represents should be called something like “Life With-
out Father.” Nancy Reagan herself confirms one specific
report about Reagan as family man. The president, it develops,
has never met Ashley Marie Reagan, his 17-month-old second
grandchild.
Michael Reagan, the president’s adopted son and father of
Ashley and 6-year-old Cameron, claims Grandpa has not been
remiss. “It’s at my request, really,” he contends from his Califor-
nia home. “The president can’t come by himself. He brings a 26-
car motorcade with him wherever he goes. Because of the bad
guys out there, he doesn’t want
to give the kids a lot of press
time. Frankly, I don’t want
people to know what [the chil-
dren] look like.”
On the other hand, Mi-
chael says his father tries to
see grandson Cameron about
twice a year, and phones and
writes frequently. Sheila Tate,
Nancy Reagan’s press secre-
tary, points out that Cam-
eron sat in the presidential box
with the rest of the Reagan
family during last summer’s
Dallas Republican conclave.
According to Tate, Ashley
was left with friends because
her parents didn’t want to ex-

pose the small child to “the craziness of the convention.”
One longtime Reagan family acquaintance thinks Nancy may
be the reason the president so rarely makes contact with part of
his family. “The problem really is that [Reagan] has two fam-
ilies—one from [Jane] Wyman, one from Nancy,” the friend
remarks. “I think Nancy likes to have all that as history, and as a
consequence, doesn’t promote as much social interaction with
Michael and Maureen as with her own kids.” Nancy herself
readily admits that there have been “problems” with Michael
Reagan. “But we’re working on them,” she says, adding only
that she is “old-fashioned” and does not approve of airing family
difficulties in public.
‘They Don’t Need Us 9 : Maureen Reagan, meanwhile, says the
problem isn’t a matter of her father and stepmother playing
favorites with the children. Says the thrice-married Reagan
daughter, “They don’t need any of us . . . They have each other.
They are each other’s best
friends and it’s been that way
for over 30 years. It’s not a
complaint. It’s a fact.”
Though Democrats may
stew over the president’s public
persona as an all-American fa-
ther, it is unlikely that the latest
revelation will cause him any
political harm. Says Michael,
“I don’t think Mondale can
make it an issue.” And when
will the grandparents begin
substantively increasing their
visitation time with their
grandchildren? Joshes the un-
perturbed father, “I figure
they’ll have plenty of time to
see them in five years.”

A Capitol Hill Budget Bazaar
JAMES K. W. ATHERTON— THE WASHINGTON POST
A huddle on the Hill: Legislative limbo after a week of all-night political chaos
The issues were dead serious: the shape
of a nearly $3OO billion defense budget;
the scope of an ambitious crackdown on
crime; the fate of an important civil-rights
measure. But last week’s debate on Capitol
Hill smacked of rug trading in some back-
street bazaar. As the 98th Congress stum-
bled toward adjournment, the angry meet-
ings and slapdash legislation overwhelmed
even the veterans. “None of us here thinks
that this is the way we should do business,”
complained Sen. Mark Hatfield. Fear of
next month’s elections ran so strong that
“I’m nervous and I don’t even have an
opponent,” joked Missouri’s Democratic
Congressman Richard Gephardt. In the
circumstances, the prevailing logic was sim-
ple: Something for Everyone.
The defense debate, among others, wound
up with both sides claiming victory. Ronald
Reagan had requested $313 billion, al3 per-
cent increase over last year’s military budg-
et. Instead, he had to settle for $293 billion, a
5 percent increase. That was enough to satis-
fy Reagan’s pledge to beef up the military,
said Senate Republican John Tower. But
Democrats pointed out that the figure near-
ly matched the budget deemed acceptableby
none other than Walter Mondale.
‘Claim’: Even more improbable, both
sides also managed to “win” the debate over
the MX missile. Reagan had called for 40
missiles; Mondale had proposed to elimi-
nate them all. Instead, Congress agreed to
finance 21 missiles contingent on other votes
by Easter. Beamed one top Democratic
House aide: “We can claim victory and say
we stopped the MX.” But Minority Whip
Trent Lott predicted that if Reagan wins in
November, Congress will contain more Re-
publicans next spring. “Perhaps,” he said,
“we had a victory because we’re not getting a
vote on the MX this year.”
Sensitive social legislation was also
thrown into the mix. Reagan has long made
his demands for tougher anticrime legisla-
tion part of his standard campaign speech,
When his crime package aimed at tighten-
ing drug control, sentencing, bail, parole
and other criminal provisions hit the
House, the Republicans—to their sur-
prise—cornered enough Democratic sup-
port to win approval. House Speaker Thom-
as P. (Tip) O’Neill had given his blessing for
Democrats to vote according to their politi-
cal instincts—in part out of respect for the
impact Reagan’s appeals were having on
local voters. Only the purists were disap-
pointed. “We are not seriously legislating,”
Gephardt said. “Everybody wants to have
something about crime in his brochure.”
The Republicans attached the crime
package to the emergency-financing meas-
ure that keeps the government running in
the absence of approved spending bills.
Members of both parties also attached plen-
ty of their own pork-barrel legislation to the
vital financing bill, including $lB billion
worth of local water projects. The pork, all
members felt, could help their own elec-
tions. Explained O’Neill, “A lot of members
felt it would be very well to include [the
crime measures] so the president would not
veto the bill.”
Stalling: At the end of the week the financ-
ing bill was so weighed down by pet projects
that Reagan’s veto was a real possibility.
Sens. Bob Packwood and Edward Kennedy
tried to attach an amendment designed to
strengthen the law against sex discrimina-
tion in federally funded educational pro-
grams. Infuriated, Republican Sen. Orrin
Hatch then launched a filibuster attack on
the Kennedy proposal. The wearied Senate,
in no mood for interminable stalling tactics,
immediately crushed the filibuster. As the
chaos continued, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker, who is retiring, moaned:
“I’m afraid I’m going to see 18 years of
legislative combat reel before my eyes.” Two
years earlier the 98th Congress had begun its
work with a noble compromise on social-
security reform. Last week it was fading in a
haze of midnight oil and running-scared
politics.

Life or Death: A Candidate’s Choice
In the middle of a tight, tough Senate
campaign that may become a modern
classic, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt
last week faced a grim decision. The issue
was capital punishment, the case in point
an appeal for clemency from convicted
murderer Velma Barfield, 51. Barfield’s
execution is scheduled for
Nov. 2, four days before
Election Day and Democrat
Hunt’s showdown with Re-
publican Sen. Jesse Helms.
The timing meant that
Hunt, who now trails Helms
by 4 points in the polls,
could not postpone his deci-
sion until after the elec-
tion —and at least some ob-
servers think Hunt was
forced to choose between of-
fending the state’s conserva-
tive majority and outraging
Convict Barfield
AP
its liberal minority. Either way, the the-
ory goes, Hunt loses.
Hunt chose to deny clemency, explain-
ing that Barfield, who confessed to poi-
soning her fiance, her mother and two
other persons, had been legally sentenced
to death. The Helms campaign was silent ,
but some of Hunt’s advisers
are worried. Their worst-
case scenario is that Hunt’s
decision, by prompting op-
ponents of the death penalty
to stay home, could cost him
just enough votes to throw
the election to Helms. The
voters will cast their verdicts
on Nov. 6 —but Velma Bar-
field, who last week asked
the court to reject further
attempts to stay her execu-
tion, probably never will
know who won.

Beirut: Who’s to Blame?
The road of good intentions: Amid calls for a pinpointing of responsibility, the administration found itself beyond reproach
DON WRIGHT— MIAMI NEWS
Misguided decisions, oversight and naivete made the terrorist attack easier.
Anyone that's ever had their kitchen done
over knows that it never gets done as soon as
you wish it would.
—Ronald Reagan, Sept. 23
We’re feeling the effects today of the near
destruction of our intelligence capability in
recen tyears before we came here.
—The president, Sept. 26
Who was to blame for the latest security
failure in Beirut? As the two Ameri-
cans killed in the attack on the embassy
annex were buried last week, that question
demanded clearer answers—and better pre-
cautions. Instead, Democrats put the bur-
den on Ronald Reagan, the president faulted
Jimmy Carter and no one really seemed
willing to shoulder responsibility.
The unseemly spectacle started after Wal-
ter Mondale and Democratic congressmen
charged that the administration had left
the diplomatic compound inadequately pro-
tected. In reply, Reagan first shrugged off
the security lapses, then hinted that Carter
was to blame for slashing intelligence capa-
bilities that might have prevented the bomb-
ing. That suggestion outraged Democrats,
who pointed out that intelligence spending
had gone up under Carter. The former presi-
dent called the assertion “personally insult-
ing”—and a day later Reagan phoned Car-
ter to make amends.
The Wall Street Journal and several col-
umnists argued that sofneone should be held
to account and possibly resign. But Under
Secretary of State Ronald I. Spiers said he
had not yet found anyone to hold responsi-
ble. From the available evidence, however, it
was clear that misguided decisions, over-
sights and naivete up and down the chain of
command had made the third suicide truck-
bomb attack on a U.S. facility in Beirut in 18
months far easier than it should have been.
Among the missteps:
■ The move to East Beirut. The most trouble-
some question was why U.S. diplomats were
moved to the East Beirut suburb so hastily in
July. The decision was reportedly made over
the private objections of embassy security
chief Alan Bigler, who argued that it was
“premature.” Several veteran U.S. diplo-
mats said they also balked. But the same

GEORGE SEMERJIAN
diplomats said Washington was intent on
pulling Americans out of West Beirut to
keep them from getting killed during the fall
campaign. U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon
Reginald Bartholomew recommended the
East Beirut site, and Assistant Secretary of
State for Near Eastern and South Asian
Affairs Richard W. Murphy approved it.
Said Murphy: We picked what was certain-
ly a very safe location by all evidence. ’ ’
■ The hiring of Lebanese guards. The deci-
sion to post U.S.-trained Lebanese guards
instead of Marines outside the annex made
more sense: Lebanese law requires foreign
troops to remain inside embassy grounds.
But Bartholomew, who approved the hiring
of the guards, may have been naive in think-
ing they could defend the annex by them-
selves, especially given the spotty record of
the Lebanese Army. During the
attack, the Lebanese guards fired
at the suicide van only after it sped
past them. One guard tried to stop
it by pounding on the side. It was
only thanks to a British bodyguard
that the van was kept from entering
an underground garage and col-
lapsing the annex on top of it.
■ The contracting delays. On the
day of the bombing, two months
after the move to East Beirut, secu-
rity measures at the annex were
still only 75 percent complete. A
steel gate had been lying around for

two weeks, and television scanners had yet to
be activated on the annex roof. Local con-
tractors said they were working on a new
embassy building in West Beirut. But that
did not explain why first priority was not
given to the East Beirut site, or why a team of
Seabees was not brought in to finish thejob.
■ The precautions not taken. West German
antiterrorist specialists believe that even the
steel gate would not have provided adequate
protection. They argue that the annex
should have had double security gates that
would have forced all incoming vehicles to
stop twice, an armored personnel carrier
with a machine gun overlooking the en-
trance and even a nest of mines that could
have been activated by sentries. After the
blast, security officials finally did implement
some of those measures. A 106-mm antitank
cannon was pointed at the road leading to the
annex, a Lebanese APC was parked in the
middle of the road and a jeep and a truck
were placed between the concrete blocks.
Five Marines also took positions directly
inside the compound.
■ The intelligence question. Democrats had
considerable reason to attack Reagan’s
charges of an intelligence breakdown under
Jimmy Carter. It was Carter who started to
increase intelligence spending in 1979, after
years of cuts under Republican presidents.
Those increases continued under Reagan.
For other reasons, however, U.S. intelli-
gence in Lebanon has suffered in recent
years. In 1982 Israel deprived the CIA of
some of its best antiterrorist sources by ex-
pelling the PLO from Beirut. And in 1983
the truck-bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy
in West Beirut killed seven CIA agents,
including some of its top Mideast analysts.
In July the Defense Intelligence Agency did
warn that the East Beirut site was “highly
vulnerable.” But Washington apparently
chose to overlook that intelligence.
■ The retaliation option. Others believed the
latest attack could have been avoided if
Washington had struck back after the truck
bombings last year. So far, Reagan officials
have rejected that option, both because U.S.
intelligence shows that the Islamic Holy
War is too diffuse to retaliate against, and
because any strike against its patrons in
Syria could lead to a showdown with the
Soviet Union. But there was at least a debat-
able argument that some sort of counter-
strike might have acted as a deterrent to
would-be terrorists, even if it did not elimi-
nate the perpetrators of the previous car
bombings. The suicide drivers appear to be
fanatics eager to die for their cause. But their
sponsors in Damascus
and Teheran may have a
better understanding of
the costs of their actions.
Hindsight, of course,
is always 20-20. The rel-
evant question now is
what can be done to pre-
vent future terrorist
atrocities. After the East
Beirut attack, the House
Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee did approve $366
million to improve secu-
rity at U.S. embassies.
(Reagan officials had
asked for $llO million,
saying they could use
only that much immedi-
ately, but the committee
voted the full amount anyway.) It also rec-
ommended three measures that would in-
crease penalties for hijacking airplanes, ex-
tend federal jurisdiction over hostage-takers
and offer rewards up to $500,000 for leads on
terrorists. Sen. Arlen Specter, meanwhile,
proposed making it legal to kidnap suspect-
ed terrorists and try them in America.
Antiterrorist efforts in other countries
suggested further options. West German
police have managed to all but neutralize the
Baader-Meinhof gang by cultivating hun-
dreds of paid informants and using surveil-
lance equipment in public places. In their
fight against the Red Brigades, Italian au-
thorities have taken advantage of elastic
preventive-detention laws and offered re-
duced sentences to terrorists who turn
state’s evidence. And the Israelis have had
considerable success with informal ex-
changes of intelligence with security forces
in other countries, particularly in their bat-
tle against PLO hijackings in the 19705.
Any of these measures could help reduce
America’s overall vulnerability to terror-
ism. But how useful they would be in Beirut
was another question. Most of the measures
before Congress would depend on the coop-
eration of local populations. In other coun-
tries, antiterrorist forces have the advantage
of established codes of law and order and
strong systems of justice. Lebanon has none
of these. As for international efforts, special-
ists stress that they are most effective when
kept at the level* of informal contacts be-
tween local forces. A worldwide antiterror-
ist organization, comparable to the interna-
tional police force, Interpol, would be of
strictly limited value.
Still, improvements can be made. Above
all, Americans need to become more sensi-
tive to terrorism on a day-to-day basis. It is
not in their nature. Unlike Israelis, they do
not live with the constant specter of terror at
home. Abroad, they would like U.S. embas-
sies to be places of welcome, not fortresses.
On a political level, U.S. officials sensitive to
issues of civil liberties have been reluctant to
push for draconian antiterrorist measures.
The compound’s new look: Tank traps, sharp-eyed marksmen
But what the hostage crisis in Iran and the
past two years in Lebanon have shown is that
terrorists can take cruel advantage of those
features of the American system. And if the
atrocities are to be curbed, Americans will
have to learn to exert as much energy taking
precautions against terrorism as they spend
wrangling among themselves.

MIDEAST
‘Some Reason for Hope’
For more than two years now, the Middle
East has immobilized even the hardiest
of diplomats. But last week there were signs
that a little movement, if not progress, might
finally be at hand. The unity government
of Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
seemed willing to withdraw from southern
Lebanon if it could secure acceptable guar-
antees of security on Is-
rael’s northern border.
King Hussein of Jordan
suddenly resumed diplo-
matic relations with
Egypt, whose President
Hosni Mubarak seemed
eager to act as a region-
al power broker. Ya-
sir Arafat was back in
Amman dickering once
again over the future of
the Palestine Liberation
Organization. As always
in the Middle East, there
were obstacles to prog-
ress everywhere. But if
nothing else, many of the
principals seemed un-
happy enough with their
hands to try at last
for something better.
“There are opportuni-
ties,” said Dr. Ahmed
Esmat Abdel Meguid, Egypt’s foreign min-
ister. ‘ ‘I think there is some reason for hope. ”
Just before the Muslim New Year, Hus-
sein put through a call to Mubarak with the
news.that Jordan was sending its ambassa-
dor back to Cairo. The move was not unex-
pected; although Jordan was the first of the
Arab states to break relations after Anwar
Sadat made peace with Israel in 1979, Egypt
and Jordan had grown steadily closer in
recent months. Mubarak called Hussein’s
move “a daring step,” and both Israel and
the United States applauded it. But Syria
and Libya accused Hussein of dealing the
Arab world “a treacherous stab in the back”
and threatened to retaliate.
Mending Fences: Both Mubarak and Hus-
sein stood to gain from their reconciliation.
The move helped vindicate Mubarak’s poli-
cy of cautiously mending fences with other
Arab countries while refusing to scrap the
peace treaty with Israel. It could also help
Mubarak reassert Egypt’s traditional pre-
eminence in the Arab world, particularly if
others follow Jordan’s example. Iraq,
whom Egypt and Jordan have supported in
the war with Iran, is a likely candidate to
restore ties with Egypt; so are Morocco
and Tunisia, both pro-Western regimes.
Saudi Arabia chided Hussein for going
against an Arab summit resolution. But if
the Saudis do send an ambassador back to
Mubarak: A power-broker role?
SCHREIBER—GAMMA-LIAISON
Cairo, the other gulf states would presum-
ably follow suit.
The diplomatic flurry seemed to be draw-
ing the Reagan administration into the Mid-
dle East again. After signaling its willingness
to pull out of southern Lebanon without a
simultaneous withdrawal by Syria, Israel
asked Washington to broker an agreement
with Damascus. The
State Department’s top
Middle East hand, As-
sistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy, who
had gone to Beirut to in-
vestigate the U.S. Em-
bassy bombing, made
trips to Damascus, Jeru-
salem and Cairo to see if
he could help. In his ad-
dress to the United Na-
tions General Assembly,
meanwhile, Ronald Rea-
gan said his 1982 West
Bank peace plan was still
very much on the table.
In New York, Meguid
met with his Israeli coun-
terpart, Yitzhak Shamir.
In return for an Israeli
withdrawal from Leba-
non and Taba —a border
strip in Sinai claimed by
both Egypt and Israel—and serious prog-
ress on the Palestinian issue, Egypt let it be
known that it would consider sending its
ambassador back to Israel. Some regional
diplomats even hoped it would be possible to
put life back into whatever could be salvaged
from Camp David and the Reagan plan.
The immediate obstacle was Syria.
Egypt’s hopes for diplomatic progress de-
Arafat , Hussein in Amman: Dickering over the PLO’s future
UPI
pended upon two difficult premises: that the
United States could get Syria, Lebanon and
Israel to agree to terms in southern Lebanon,
and that Arafat and King Hussein could
finally find common cause on the Palestin-
ian issue. But Syrian President Hafez Assad
has tried to intimidate Hussein in the past —
in 1980, the Syrians massed 50,000 troops
and 1,000 tanks near the Jordanian border—
and he could make life difficult for him
again. Mubarak’s close relationship with
Hussein might deter Syrian bullying.
How far the Israelis were willing to move
was another problem. Jerusalem and Da-
mascus began exchanging signals when
U.N. Under Secretary Brian Urquhart told
Israeli officials that he had found “a mood of
realism” in Damascus and Beirut and a
willingness to recognize Israel’s security
needs. At his suggestion Israel dropped its
insistence on a simultaneous Syrian with-
drawal. With Murphy relaying messages,
the ad hoc bargaining began. Israel’s desire
for a Lebanon pullback was serious, but so
far there has been no sign of a breakthrough.
Warnings: With memories of humiliation
in Lebanon still fresh, there was a reluctance
in Washington to get drawn into the Middle
East just before elections. Henry Kissinger
warned that the United States should avoid
becoming involved in new troop-withdraw-
al negotiations and should let Israel and its
adversaries work out the problem alone. A
former high-ranking administration official
agreed. “I think we ought to stay out of the
place for another year,” he said, “so every-
body gets it into his head that they have to
make some concessions.”
Even if Israel and Syria do reach an
agreement on Lebanon, a resolution of
the Palestinian problem still seems the
most distant of dreams. So far, Labor’s Peres
and Likud’s Shamir have been able to coexist
within Israel’s new “national unity” gov-
ernment because getting out of Lebanon
and salvaging the economy transcend ide-
ology. But negotiating the future of the West
Bank with King Hussein and a delegation of
Palestinians could easily
destroy all pretense of
“unity” and bring on an-
other general election.
“The problems are very
big,” conceded one Is-
raeli official. “At best,
we’re at the start of a
long diplomatic road
which will involve many
compromises and much
haggling.” That was
an understatement, but
where there was move-
ment there was hope, and
for a long time now, there
hasn’t been much of ei-
ther in the region.

SCIENCE
Answers From an Icy Grave
In 1845, two ships and 138 men led by
explorer Sir John Franklin set sail from
England in search of the fabled Northwest
Passage to China —and disappeared. Five
years later, would-be rescuers stumbled
across the first evidence of the doomed ex-
pedition: three simple graves in the frozen
Arctic tundra of Canada’s Beechey Island.
Now scientists have finally opened two of
those graves and found the bodies of two
sailors so well preserved by the permafrost
Sailor Torrington: Doomed expedition
PHOTOS BY OWEN BEATTIE—UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA
that they may help solve some of the myster-
ies surrounding the ill-fated expedition. “It
was like being in a time machine,” says
Owen Beattie, a University of Alberta an-
thropologist who headed the research team.
“We were surprised by how well groomed
and clean they were.”
Historians already know that after the
three sailors died, the explorers sailed south-
west from Beechey Island. Franklin himself
died of unknown causes just over a year later
after his ships became trapped in ice near
King William Island. A poignant note found
by a rescue mission sent by Franklin’s wife in
1857 revealed that the 105 survivors finally
abandoned the ships the following spring
and struck out along the western shore of the
island, tugging lifeboats laden with supplies.
According to the sketchy note, their goal
was the mouth of the Back River on the
Canadian mainland. No one knows where
they expected to go from there, but if the men
had been able to row thousands of miles
southwest up the Back River and down
connecting inland waterways, they would
eventually have reached the Pacific Ocean,
proving that there was indeed a watery pas-
sage across the great Northwest. Scattered
bones discovered (and subsequently buried)
by an American lieutenant named Schwatka
in the late 1870 s showed that some of the
men almost made it to the river’s mouth;
they perished within sight of the mainland
near an inlet that Schwatka named Starva-
tion Cove.
Wasteland: Beattie and his team expect to
learn more about the expedition’s early days
from one of the disinterred bodies, that of
Petty Officer John Torrington. The un-
marked condition of the corpses indicated
that the two men did not die violent deaths,
as some historians had speculated, and an
analysis of tissue and internal organs ex-
tracted from Torrington’s body before it
was reburied will help scientists zero in on
the actual cause. Earlier, researchers had
uncovered some clues to what killed Tor-
rington’s shipmates more than two years
later. While the pieces of skeletons orginally
buried by Lieutenant Schwatka have never
been found, Beattie recently discovered
enough bones on King William Island to
account for at least seven other men. Analy-
ses revealed high, possibly toxic levels of
lead (probably from eating tinned provi-
sions sealed with lead),
evidence of scurvy and
—a grimmer find—mys-
terious cut marks that
strongly suggest there was
cannibalism on the fatal
trek across the frozen
wasteland. “Because the
bones are scattered on the
surface,” explains Beat-
tie, “the most popular in-
terpretation is that the
men literally dropped as
they walked.”
The disappearance of
Frozen hand
Franklin’s expedition, the worst tragedy in
the long search for the Northwest Passage,
aroused worldwide interest. During the
next few decades, a number of ships stopped
at Beechey Island, and its makeshift ceme-
tery with three graves became a minor
shrine for explorers hoping for a better fate.
But the graves remained unopened for 138
years. Apparently, Beattie says, no one until
now thought of asking the dead men them-
selves for answers to why they died.

WORLD BUSINESS
Renaissance for Reaganomics?
Reagan addresses the IMF and World Bank: ‘Economic growth has rolled out in a rising tide to reach distant shores’
At last week’s IMF and World Bank meeting, America’s recovery was all the rage.
Ronald Reagan, the incorrigible opti-
mist, was in fine fettle. Speaking before
the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
Washington last week, the U.S. president
heralded the birth of “an American renais-
sance.” By “renouncing past policies of gov-
ernment regimentation and overspending,”
he declared, “economic growth gathered
force and rolled out in a rising tide that has
reached distant shores.”
Not everyone bought that rhetoric, but
it set the theme of the conference. The
assembled bankers and ministers grappled
with the messy issues of exchange rates
and budget deficits. They slogged through
the details of Argentina’s anti-inflation
agreement with the IMF, and they made
some slow and grudging progress on an aid
program for sub-Saharan Af-
rica. But the dominant issue
was economic growth—and
on that there was little dis-
agreement. America’s robust
recovery has awed the world,
and more than a few countries
are well on the way to adopt-
ing “supply side” policies.
“The world is going through
the greatest change in eco-
nomic thinking since the New
Deal,” says Jacques Thierry,
president of Belgium’s Banque
Bruxelles Lambert. “There is
a groundswell away from gov-
De Larosiere with Clausen, Re-
gan: ‘Supply siders’?
ernment intervention, increased welfare
spending and high taxation.”
That sounded like a definition of “Rea-
ganomics,” and nowhere was that prescrip-
tion more talked about last week than
among the West Europeans. Years of ane-
mic growth and high joblessness have shak-
en Europe’s faith in itself, and the months
before the meeting were filled with signs
that Europe has increasingly turned toward
the United States for clues to its own salva-
tion. Italy’s left-wing La Repubblica
summed up the situation with the headline:
COULD REAGAN BE RIGHT?
Few Europeans are ready to embrace
Reaganomics unreservedly. Some note
wryly that the real thrust of Reagan’s
policy has come from classically Keynes-
ian budget deficits —and nearly all of them
APPLEWHITE— AP
worry that those deficits could further in-
crease interest rates and siphon investment
capital out of their economies. They also
fear that America’s recovery might over-
heat, fueling inflation, and they are uneasy
over the high-flying dollar. Last week sev-
eral European governments told Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan that the U.S. cur-
rency may be overvalued. West Germany,
pushing for an “orderly” system of curren-
cy exchange, pointedly did not rule out a
second intervention, similar to its sale of
$750 million two weeks ago that sent the
dollar plummeting.
‘Eurosclerosis’: Still, Europe may have lit-
tle choice but to follow the Reagan model.
The region’s troubles speak for themselves.
Much discussed in the IMF’s lounges last
week were two reports published by the
Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development. One calculated
that, since 1973, the United
States created more than 13
million jobs, while Europe lost
3 million. The other cautiously
but unequivocally attributed
“Eurosclerosis” —the harden-
ing of the Continent’s econom-
ic arteries —to high taxes, in-
flexible labor laws and overly
generous welfare programs.
For most countries, the re-
ports simply confirmed the fa-
miliar; many have already
taken the first halting steps
toward remedying their prob-
lems. France recently unveiled


Coping With the Debt Crisis
The deal was a hard-charging banker’s
dream, as innovative as it was simple.
Troubled by a portfolio of shaky foreign
loans, Citibank of New York recently
struck upon an unorthodox expedient: to
take out insurance against possible losses
arising from “prolonged delays” in pay-
ments from five developing countries. It
was the first time a bank had tried such a
solution —and it was one more indica-
tion that private institutions, acting inde-
pendently of governments, are slowly
finding ways of coping with the Third
World debt crisis.
With all the problems that banks face
in recovering overseas loans, Citibank’s
surprise move was something of a coup.
The carefully crafted arrangement gave
the bank, the United States’ largest, a
$900 million policy covering a tenth of
its outstanding loans to Argentina, Bra-
zil, Mexico, Venezuela and the Philip-
pines—some of the world’s most indebt-
ed nations. The policy protects Citibank
against losses caused by the political acts
of governments, ranging from foreign-
exchange restrictions to a debt moratori-
um and even outright default. It could
also boost the bank’s stock and give the
company new flexibility in its overseas
dealings. Citibank will pay $4.5 million a
year for the policy, with a $50 million
deductible for each country. And the
insurer, Cigna Corp. of Philadelphia,
confirms that many other banks have
shown interest in striking similar deals.
Test: It would be unrealistic to ex-
pect those banks to follow Citibank’s
lead immediately, however. John Ma-
loney, a spokesman for the bank, cau-
tions that the program is still a “pilot
project.” And Dennis Callahan, a securi-
ties analyst with Paine Webber in New
York, expects most bankers to “test the
waters before they swim.” But the Citi-
bank deal is important because it signals
a new way of thinking about the debt
crisis. Rather than relying solely on
IMF-sponsored austerity programs and
multilateral debt reschedulings to defuse
tensions between borrowers and lenders,
U.S. and European banks seem to be
searching for new, private-sector solu-
tions. That may lessen the need for the
sort of last-minute arrangement —nego-

Grinspun: A search for new solutions
AP
Grinspun—that pulled Argentina from
the brink of default last week. “Noth-
ing like this has ever been done before,”
says Callahan. “There’s real excitement
out there.”
Citibank’s insurance gambit is not the
first of these efforts. Earlier this year,
Continental Illinois Corp. in Chicago
won permission from the Mexican gov-
ernment to convert $1.3 billion in exist-
ing loans to Grupo Visa, the country’s
second largest private corporation, into
floating rate bonds. The deal represented
a major tax saving for the Mexican com-
pany, because interest paid to foreigners
on the bonds would not be taxed by the
government. And because the securities
are negotiable, Continental might be able
to sell them to outside investors in the
future —allowing the bank to reduce its
portfolio of Mexican loans and diversify
its risks. Chase Manhattan Bank took its
cue from Continental when it recently
coordinated a $300 million conversion
for Vitro S.A., Mexico’s biggest glass
manufacturer.
Other deals have been similarly inno-
vative. For much of the past year, banks
have been “swapping” foreign loans —
exchanging a Mexican loan for a Brazil-
ian loan, for example, in order to balance
their portfolios. And Bankers Trust in
New York is at the forefront of a pio-
neering effort to write up credit worthy
loans and sell them off to smaller banks
and institutional investors —all for a hef-
ty fee. The bank will parcel out about $6
billion in such loans this year, up from
$2 billion during the few months the
program was in effect last year, and it
expects an eightfold increase by the end
of the decade. For the moment, these
packages involve only high-grade “in-
vestment quality” loans —which for
Bankers Trust excludes Third World
credits. But other banks, including
Citibank, have reportedly been able to
sell some Latin American loans. If so,
that could signal a further loosening in
the log-jammed debt crisis, perhaps giv-
ing both the banks and their borrowers
some badly needed maneuvering room.

what some commentators have called an
experiment in “supply-side socialism,” a
state budget that slashed personal taxes,
created new incentives for private invest-
ment and, for the first time in a decade, cut
federal spending below the nation’s growth
rate. Italy has trimmed its 10 percent infla-
tion rate by a third over the past year by
curbing state wages and social welfare pay-
ments. And Holland and West Germany
are loosening their labor laws. Legislation
that has prevented employers from firing
workers in times of economic distress has
also acted as a deterrent to any new hiring.
That the United States and Europe
should be so preoccupied with domestic
growth shows how much the international
economy has improved. Two years after
the debt crisis shook the underpinnings of
the world’s financial system, the IMF is
convinced that its policies are bringing
about a cure. Last week’s meeting reaf-
firmed the “case by case” approach to debt
negotiations, where the problems of a
country’s debt burden are handled individ-
ually rather than as part of a global solu-
tion. “It offers the only realistic hope of
continued progress,” said IMF managing
director Jacques de Larosiere. With Brazil
and Mexico implementing IMF austerity
programs—and with Argentina and the
Philippines verging on an agreement—
there in fact seemed to be little point in
trying another tack.
Supply-side principles also seemed to
govern the convention’s thinking about the
world’s poorest nations. The World Bank’s
Development Committee issued a forceful
condemnation of Third World industrial
policies and called for less government
intervention and more private enterprise.
It also endorsed the U.S. view that global
recovery and freer trade will solve most of
the poor nations’ problems.
Recovery: There is some evidence to sup-
port that view. America’s imports from the
developing world have risen 30 percent in
1984 to $l2 billion—four times more
than the increase in debt-service costs
resulting from this year’s rise in interest
rates. The catch is that the benefits of
that trade boom have largely gone to the
more advanced exporters of Latin America
and Asia. The world’s poorest countries
still fear that the global recovery will
pass them by.
In light of that, it’s ironic that the con-
ference made so little progress on its only
new item of business —the $2 billion aid
package for sub-Saharan Africa. The pro-
gram was backed by almost all of the
World Bank’s members last week, a fact
that heartened the organization’s presi-
dent, A. W. Clausen. But no government
has actually pledged any money. That fact
was largely lost in the heady talk over the
U.S. recovery, which may say something
about how “have not” nations will fare
under a supply-side world economic order.

Short Brothers: On the Wing
A Sherpa under construction: Making a comeback by producing ‘reliable workhorses’
It was just after the turn of the century
when Short Brothers, Ltd., opened shop
in Sussex, England, to sell wondrously
modern, gas-filled aerial balloons. For the
next few decades, the company flourished
as sales of its bulky passenger planes
and bombers boomed. Ever since the 19505,
however, fortunes have slumped in the
wake of defense cuts and some misguid-
ed diversification attempts. Now, feisty
“Shorts” is making a comeback: a recent
series of lucrative contracts has bolstered
both finances and prestige at the tiny air-
craft company.
The company’s first big coup came in
March, when Shorts—which is now based
in Belfast—won the heftiest deal in its long
history: a contract worth up to $660 million
from the U.S. Air Force to build Sherpa
cargo planes. NATO will use the widebo-
died aircraft to ferry F-15 and F-16 jet
engines and other vital parts from the com-
bat front to rear-area repair stations. For
Shorts, securing the contract was a daunt-
ing task. Its Sherpas were vying against the
Spanish-built CASA cargo craft that was
being touted by McDonnell Douglas,
Moreover, the U.S. Air Force had not
turned to a foreign manufacturer for air-
craft since World War 11. The arrangement
was “very significant because a U.S. Air
Force contract is a major seal of approval,”
says marketing director Alex Roberts,
“There are many foreign countries who are
influenced by what America buys and who
could have requirements for this sort of
aircraft. Our job now is to capitalize on the
breakthrough.”
Last month, Shorts netted another prize
when it signed on for a joint venture with
Sikorsky, the giant American helicopter
manufacturer. Shorts will bid for a $560
million contract from Britain’s Royal Air
Force to produce a modified version of Si-
korsky S Blackhawk, now used by the U.S.
Army. In an area of cutthroat competition,
the linkup will serve Shorts well. It will
enable the company to acquire sophisticated
technology that could prove helpful if Shorts
decides to develop helicopters on its own.
Meanwhile, Shorts has signed similar
joint ventures with America’s Rohr Indus-
tries and Brazil’s Embraer aerospace com-
pany. It is also profiting from the brisk sales
of its wide-bodied Shorts 330 and 360 com-
muter planes. All have combined to boost
the firm’s sales by 100 percent over the last
eight years, as well as make a small trading
profit after many years of substantial losses.
The company attributes its rebound largely
to an ability to fill gaps in the aviation
market at competitive prices. A buyer
“doesn’t necessarily want the most sophisti-
cated technology,” says Roberts. “He
wants a reliable workhorse that doesn’t eat
the bosses’ lunch.”
Jobs: Shorts’s recent good fortune has also
provided a boomlet for Northern Ireland’s
beleaguered economy, where unemploy-
ment still runs more than 20 percent. With a
work force of about 6,500, the state-run
company is small by industry standards.
But Shorts is the province’s biggest industri-
al employer, and its recent contracts could
provide nearly 1,000 additional jobs.
Company officials hope that Shorts’s re-
cent contracts will enable the company to
develop its own new-generation aircraft—
and make its recovery permanent. “If all
continues to go well, in the next two or three
years we will be around the corner and
accelerating up,” says Roberts. To ensure
that, the firm will continue working in sev-
eral fields: aircraft sales and design, air-
frame production and missile systems. Do-
ing so with characteristic aggressiveness,
Shorts will surely be on the wing well into
the 21st century.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Translation: Letting Computers Do It
S dentists have long predicted that computers would one day
help speed up the arduous task of translating texts —and now
that time has come. Systems designed in the United States, Japan,
Europe and South America follow one of two basic approaches.
The “direct” method uses rules of syntax and grammar to
translate one language into another, while the “interlingua”
approach employs an internal intermediate language as a bridge
between the “source” and “target” languages.
Still, difficulties remain. Few programs can yet resolve the
ambiguities in such sentences as “Ship sinks today.” (Is it a
newspaper headline or an order to send out a shipment of sinks?)
Editors still must refine the translations by interpreting some
idioms and deciphering unfamiliar words. But the programs are
improving, and the companies involved are optimistic. “In 10
years’ time,” says the head of one Japanese firm, “more than 80
percent of all translation work will be done by machines.”
Taking the Direct Route
The direct approach is the most com-
mon, though not always the simplest,
method of computer translation. It re-
quires a separate program—including a
dictionary of thousands of words and
phrases, as well as rules of syntax, gram-
mar and conjugation—for each pair of
languages involved in a given translation.
Last summer, a small Tokyo firm, Bra-
vice International, Inc. began marketing
the country’s first commercial Japanese-
to-English translation system. Unlike
word-based systems, this one breaks a
Japanese sentence into phrases that are
translated and then reconfigured into an
English sentence. The company says the
system can translate Japanese into pass-
able English at a rate of up to 3,000
words an hour on simple texts. Bravice
produces systems priced from $72,000,
including computer, disc drive, printer
and software.
Bravice’s system is based on the trans-
lating methods pioneered by Weidner
Communications Corp. of Northbrook,
111. Partly owned by Bravice since 1982,
Weidner offers direct-method systems
that translate English into French, Span-
ish, German, Portuguese and Arabic.
There are also systems that translate
French, Spanish and German into Eng-
lish. Only six months ago, Weidner intro-
duced translation software that works on
an IBM Personal Computer and does
rough translations at between 1,200 and
2,000 words an hour. (Previously, the
system was compatible only with more
powerful minicomputers made by Digital
Equipment Corp., which operate at 5,000
to 8,000 words per hour.) Weidner’s new
software allows an operator to define un-
familiar phrases before translating the
full text. Programs for the IBM PC sell for
$ 11,000 and start at $ 16,000 for the Digit-
al computer.
A program developed by Automated
Language Processing Systems (ALPS) of
Provo, Utah, calls for the continuous as-
sistance of a human translator. The system
presents an operator with sentence-by-
sentence adaptations that can be changed
immediately. The computer “learns” as it
proceeds through a text; once a term has
been translated to the user’s satisfaction, it
will be changed the same way when it
appears again. Software for the ALPS
system costs $ 15,000 with an added $5OO-
- licensing charge.
man de Rojas. He found that Aymara, a
language spoken by 3 million Indians in
the Bolivian and Peruvian highlands, con-
tains a simple yet rigid syntax structure
that could be easily reduced to algebraic
equations suited to a computer. These
equations form the core of a mathematical
“language” that canbeapplied to virtually
any Western language. Already, the sys-
tem can translate English, Spanish,
LAURIE GRACE
A Universal Language?
The interlingua method is most effec-
tive for texts that require translations into
several languages. One such program is
Systran, marketed by World Translation
Center, Inc., of La Jolla, Calif., and used
by the Commission of the European Com-
munities. Researchers at the Group Study
for Automatic Translation in Grenoble,
France, continue to refine their 10-year-
old system that makes use of a “neutral
language” called Ariane, which standard-
izes the syntactic organization of a lan-
guage before the actual translation.
A unique approach has been developed
by Bolivian computer scientist Ivan Guz-
French or German into the other three
languages at a rate of6oo words a minute.
Guzman de Rojas says the dictionary ca-
pacity still must be expanded to arrive at a
passable accuracy rate of 90 percent.
Logos Corp. of Waltham, Mass., uses a
modified interlingua method in its Ger-
man-English program. It incorporates a
universal language that analyzes struc-
ture and content, while using the direct
method to complete the translation. The
system operates on the Wang Office Infor-
mation System. There is a $lO,OOO instal-
lation fee as well as a sliding-scale charge
based on the amount of usage.

Matsushita in Audio Technology
TECHNICS CREATES A NEW
DIMENSION IN HIGH FIDELITY:
THE 65mm DEEP
COMPONENT SYSTEM.
Don’t be fooled by its nearly flat appearance.
The only thing flat about our revolutionary new
65mm-deep SB-RlOO speaker system is its fre-
quency response. It’s pure high fidelity—with
surprisingly rich and lively bass—designed to
hang on a wall.
The secret—Technics’ original coaxial
honeycomb disc design. Honeycomb disc
speakers use flat diaphragms that enable sound
waves to radiate in unison and reach your ears at
the same instant. By placing a honeycomb disc
tweeter in the middle of a honeycomb disc
woofer and surrounding the woofer with a
passive radiator for enhanced bass response,
we have created a high-performance, 100-watt-
input power (music) speaker system just
315 mm x 315 mm x 65mm.
Our speaker-within-a-speaker innovation
closely approaches the ideal of a linear phase
“point sound source,” where sound dispersion
is the same both vertically and horizontally.
This means a more lifelike sound and clearer
stereo imaging.
But we didn’t create the SB-RlOO to hang
alone. Its equally sleek companion, the SA-RlOO
FM/AM stereo cassette receiver, is yet another
example of Technics’ mastery of miniaturization
technology. A slimmer, redesigned auto-reverse
tape transport mechanism, an extremely flat
transformer, and two special LSIs configured in
high-density “fine pattern” printed circuit boards
comprise the new technology behind its 65mm
depth. A detachable infrared remote control unit
keeps the SA-RlOO clean, uncluttered, and easy to
operate from almost anywhere in the room.
The SB-RlOO and SA-RlOO. Two works of art
from the company that makes a science of
sound. Technics. As a beneficiary of the vast
R&D resources of Japan’s largest consumer ele-
ctronics group, Matsushita Electric, we continue
to create new dimensions in hi-fi entertainment.

Happily caught holding the baby
Bruce and Susan Stannard with Bob Hawke and Georgia Louise
THE pre-campaign cam-
paigning was underway last
week when Prime Minister
Bob Hawke, followed by his
faithful band of reporters and
cameramen, was caught hug-
ging a baby at Sydney’s Cruis-
ing Yacht Club.
The Prime Minister was
clearly in a winning mood. It
was the anniversary of Austra-
lia ll’s America’s Cup victory
and the day of the launching
of Bulletin writer Bruce
Stannard’s biography Ben
Lexcen The Man, The Keel,
The Cup. The baby on hand to
be hugged was Bruce and
Susan Stannard’s five-week-
old daughter, Georgia Louise.
In his tribute to Lexcen’s
achievement, Hawke said the
hard childhood endured by
this “boy from the bush” had
contradicted the notion that
yachting was “a silvertail
sport.” The designer of Aus-
tralia 11, was an original Aus-
tralian genius and the win “a
symbol that Australia is on the
move again, that Australians
are winning again.”
The Prime Minister con-
founded his audience by man-
aging to get in a few words for
Treasurer Paul Keating who
is better known for his love of
antique clocks than mucking
about in boats. Hawke said
Keating was “another Austra-
lian genius who flowered in
1983,” adding that both the
Treasurer and Lexcen had left
school at 14.
Crueller side of China
CHINA may be the “in” place
to visit but an Amnesty Inter-
national report issued last
week serves as a reminder that
it can be a repressive place in
which to live.
The 132-page report tells
of political prisoners being
held for years without trial,
ill-treatment of prisoners, the
use of labor camps for “re-
education” and continued
mass executions.
Some 44 crimes are pun-
ishable by death in China.
They include “counter-revol-
utionary” offences, theft, em-
bezzlement, molesting women
and pimping.
The report says public ex-
ecutions were supposed to
have stopped in January 1980,
but still were being carried out
and the bodies still being
left on display. Executions are
carried out by what Amnesty
calls the “traditional meth-
od”: the victim is shot in the
back of the head while he or
she kneels.
Knock first, then
‘knock’
FEDERAL MPs apparently
face a problem if they want
their parliamentary interjec-
tions noticed.
The microphones in front
of the hon mems normally are
turned off but are switched on
by sound. A quick interjection
might be finished before the
member’s microphone has
turned on. The MP’s wit or
nastiness is wasted.
The trick, it seems, is to
get the microphone switched
on just before interjecting.
Coughing into the micro-
phone, or bumping it is sup-
posed to work well. The ex-
pert at this little ploy is said
to be garrulous Liberal
frontbencher Michael Hodg-
man.

BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
AN OLD backgammon quip says:
“There’s no bad way of playing a
double four.” That might strike
you as odd but you will find that
in most cases double fours seem to
play themselves. However there
are exceptions. The illustration
shows one.
White throws the magic 4-4;
what’s the play? No one would
doubt that the first move is Wll to
W 7, making the bar point as well
as effecting the six-point prime.
White now has three more 4s to
play. He could move the blot re-
maining on the 11 point to W 7 too
but the last two present a problem.
Many inexperienced players
might elect to sacrifice the six-
point prime, moving the last two
fours from W 9 to W 5 but it is the
wrong play. In this situation the
double 4s should be played as
shown by the arrows, leaving three
blots one each on the 1, 2 and 3
points.
Before you scream in horror,
get your board out and try it. Sup-
pose Black hits all three blots;
what is he going to do then? In
short, nothing. However many
White blots Black hits he cannot
get out from behind White’s prime
until White breaks. If White is on
the bar then he’s not going to
break.
All that will happen is that
Black will continue rolling and
will be forced to break up his im-
pressive home board. White then
will re-enter and travel around
again.
White’s priority now is to cap-
ture his 3 point. Nothing else is as
important so he must start it now.
If it is not hit he can capture it
next roll. As we have seen, if it is
hit it doesn’t matter.

Opening lead three of

ABOUT 90 percent of bridge
players have never played dupli-
cate bridge. Furthermore, most of
them don’t realise that duplicate is
a wonderful training ground for
improving one’s game.
The chief reason is that in rub-
ber bridge most mistakes tend to
get by unnoticed, while in dupli-
cate one’s mistakes are brought to
attention sharply by comparing
scores with those obtained at other
tables on the very same cards.
Consider this deal where West
leads a spade against three no-
trump. Declarer follows low from
dummy and East wins with the
king. Back comes a low diamond
and South’s jack loses to the
queen.
Another diamond lead from
West forces out the ace and
declarer must now decide how to
play the hearts. He has no way of
knowing where the queen is. If he
plays a heart to the king and fin-
esses on the way back, he goes
down one when West takes the
queen and returns a diamond.
In most rubber bridge games,
this might be chalked up to bad
luck but in duplicate declarer
would realise he had goofed. By
comparing his result with other
declarers who played the same
hand, he would learn that most of
them had made the contract even
though they also misguessed the
heart finesse.
The key play occurs at trick
one, when declarer should go up
with the ace of spades. He then
leads the king and another heart,
planning to finesse. This method
of play guarantees the contract.
When dummy comes down,
South can see nine sure tricks a
spade, four hearts, a diamond and
three clubs and he should not
jeopardise them by playing a low
spade from dummy at trick one.

The Australian environment is
among the harshest in the world.
You've got to be tough when
you drive off road, and you've got
to have a tough vehicle like Toyota
Land Cruiser or HiLux 4WD.
The engineering that goes into
these famous vehicles has proven
itself in this country for twenty-five
years, ever since Sir Leslie Thiess
brought the first Land Cruisers in to
help build the Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric project.
The feeling of reliability they
give you is unequalled. Their sales are
unequalled, too.
You'll see them used in Australia's
