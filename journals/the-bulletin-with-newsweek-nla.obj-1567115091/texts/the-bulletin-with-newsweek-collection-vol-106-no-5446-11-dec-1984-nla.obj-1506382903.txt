The Mercedes-Benz 190 E is not
just a new car, it is a totally new class of
car: the first compact car ever built to
Mercedes-Benz standards. Unlike cars
of similar size, it is engineered without
compromise in any respect. As such, it
will stand as an evolutionary achieve-
ment in the history of the automobile.
Within its lithe, compact dimensions
are hidden awe-inspiring technological
breakthroughs in suspension design,
in performance characteristics, in
space utilisation and also in safety
engineering features.
As a result of its ten years of

intensive development it is the most
agile, most dynamic Mercedes-Benz
saloon ever built.
However, the most exciting dis-
coveries of all are only revealed when
you experience the 190 E from the
driver's seat.
ass
The quickest reflexes of
any Mercedes-Benz.
The authoritative American
magazine Road & Track has said of the
190 E: “It’s clear that Mercedes spared
no expense in designing the suspen-
sion of this agile road car - it may well
be the best-handling automobile that
Mercedes-Benz has ever built?
What brings about such unguard-
ed admiration is the quite revolutionary
Mercedes-Benz multi-link rear sus-
pension system. Its ‘spatial kinematics’
design locates each wheel by five
independent links that correspond to
the five separate forces operating on it
at any given time.
Not only does it endow the car
with obviously impressive handling but
with ride characteristics that make
comparison with previous compact cars
impossible. Road & Track once again:
“If you were blindfolded and placed
inside this car, you would swear
that you were riding in a (Mercedes)
380SEL7 High praise indeed.
The 190 E musters dynamic
performance from an outstanding new
two-litre power plant.
This turbine-smooth
engine develops remark-
ably high torque in every
speed range. It has a
cross-flow head and new
electro-mechanical fuel
injection. The Mercedes-
Benz four-speed auto-
matic transmission features
manual over-ride for
spirited driving.
A hydraulic dual-circuit braking
system places discs at each of the four
wheels to retard its headlong progress
with cool Teutonic efficiency. As an
option, the anti-lock braking system
(ABS), introduced to the world by
Mercedes-Benz, is also available.
The evolution
of a new class of Mercedes-Benz.
For a full twelve months, the
190 E was meticulously honed in the
wind tunnel to produce not only an
aggressive wedge profile but a superbly
low co-efficient of drag (0.33) as well.
But this aerodynamic efficiency
is only a part of the engineers’ skill.
The car’s unusually long wheelbase
provides a remarkable amount of its
total space for the passengers.
Front seat occupants enjoy similar
legroom to that offered in “S-Class”
saloons, whilst the back seat comfort-
ably caters for two adults.
Inside the car are the familiar
Mercedes features dictated by ergono-
mic engineering. The dash design is
gimmick-free, easily read and easily res-
ponded to. The atmosphere is controlled
by a sophisticated heating, ventilation
and totally-integrated air-conditioning
system for your driving comfort.
The first compact car with a
Mercedes-Benz standard of safety.
The 190 E is unmistakably a
Mercedes-Benz in every detail,
including its uncompromising safety
standards. The 190 E does not merely
comply with Australian safety regu-
lations. It meets the more stringent
requirements of Mercedes-Benz.
Naturally, the 190 E’s quick and
predictable reflexes are its primary
defence against accidents.
But the forty years spent by the
company pioneering safety have pro-
duced a unique system of defences for
this new car including the Mercedes
‘safety cell’ and crumple zones, a mo-
nocoque body welded at no less than
4,745 points, and the use of costly,
high strength/light alloy metals.
The 190E\is as safe as any
Mercedes production car ever built.
The tradition finds new expression.
The 190 E must rightly take its
place ahead of all other compact cars
because there will always be one irrec-
oncilable difference: the 190 E is a
Mercedes-Benz.
As such, it inherits a one hundred
year old tradition of quality. But in a
package so advanced that it will be emu-
lated for years to come.
The 190 E is indeed a testament
to the company’s founding credo:
“The best or nothing’.’
Engineered like no other car.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Disarmament lessons
No doubt the Nuclear Disarmament
Party and Don Chipp are mostly good
and worthy souls but haven’t they read
any modern history?
Britain In 1914 had a tiny army by
European standards, which tempted the
German kaiser to try to knock out
France in six weeks and subjugate all
Europe. He almost succeeded and it
took a world war and 14 million lives to
restore the situation. Similarly, in 1939,
after three years of appeasement, Hitler
was tempted by British and French
weakness to overrun Europe. This time
it took five years and 40 million lives to
stop him. It should be remembered that
it was allied servicemen who opened the
gates of the nazi death camps, not
members of the British Pacifist Union.
It is worth noting that Switzerland
has always had conscription and has
always been one of the most heavily
armed and highly prepared nations in
the world. The result has been 200 years
of peace.
It is only the terror of the atom bomb
that dissuaded Stalin from overrunning
Europe in the 1950 s and this balance of
terror has given us peace between the
great powers for 40 years.
By all means, let us dismantle our
stores of arms but let it be a bilateral or
multilateral exercise not unilateral.
Those who forget the past are usually
compelled to relive it. Weakness has
never been a guarantee of peace. As the
old song says, “When will they ever
learn!”

Harassment of doctors
Congratulations to David Barnett (B,
November 20) on his excellent objective
commentary on Medicare. There can be
few providers of health care (apart from
those with blinkered ideological socialist
views) who would not agree that he has
described the current state of affairs
very accurately.
The latter part of the article dealt
briefly with matters which are causing
great concern to many medical
practitioners, namely the persistent
harassment and denigration of the pro-
fession by politicians and health depart-
ment officials using the pretext of inves-
tigation of fraudulent or unnecessary
services.
It would be naive to suppose that the
laws of human nature should apply to

the medical profession in a different
manner to that which they apply to any
other group of society. Of course there
will be some doctors who behave in a
dishonest or inappropriate manner. The
same applies to politicians, journalists,
lawyers, high court judges, secondhand
car salesmen, pizza parlor operators, the
butcher the baker and the candlestick
maker, etc.
There is no evidence to suggest that
this “human nature factor” is greater in
the medical profession than in any other
group in our society. In fact, given the
vocational and caring nature of the
practice of medicine, it would not be
unreasonable to estimate that it is pro-
bably far lower than for many other
groups.
However, the government has com-
mitted several millions of dollars to the
pursuit of doctors who are committing
misdemeanors and it is hard to avoid
reaching the conclusion that there is
some sort of vendetta mentality at work.
Why is it that similar vast amounts of
money are not being spent on the
surveillance of other groups in society,
some of whose members may be acting
in a dishonest manner?
The consequences of the present
activities against the medical profession
will, in the long run, be disastrous for
the public. Mr Barnett has already
referred to the significant erosion in the
traditional trust placed by patients in
their doctors. However, there are
greater implications for the public
which need to be considered. The
majority of cases in which doctors are
accused of fraud relate to actions taken
to enable patients to receive insurance
rebates from Medicare, itemisation of
accounts and writing of referral slips to
specialists being the two most obvious
examples.

Medical fears reviewed
David Barnett’s article “Ailing health
insurance plan needs treatment” is the
first that I have read in the last 12
months which goes some way toward
redressing the balance, in that it has
some reasonably accurate assessments
of Medicare.
It is interesting to see some of the
fears of the medical profession ad-
dressed in a more objective manner and
the gross deficiency of the scheme
beginning to become apparent even
within the first year.
One has always been fascinated by
the fact that the media can promote a
group of intelligent, hard-working and
basically responsible people to be dis-
honest and not entitled to the money
they earn and abusing the Australian
society.
People are beginning to understand

No poetry to aged eyes
When the discussion of the Bulletin’s
poetry was at its best, I hesitated to butt
in for two reasons: I had a definite bias
by reason of having been started on
Longfellow at the age of nine; then
Palgrave introduced me to a host of
poets and lyricists.
Next I discovered The Bulletin and
D. M. Wright, Zora Cross, K. Slessor,
Hugh McCrae and a swarm of others
who set a standard I tried to emulate.
The nearest was the publication of a
villanelle in 1923.
Since then I have played with the
triolet, the rondeau and the sonnet with
indifferent success except that it has
given me better word control. I don’t
know what I could have learned from
an addiction to poetry in the modern
manner.
I had thought the criticism might
have given us a fair helping in your last
special, although I suppose a full page
of Garvey is a good sign. But I can
imagine the shudders that are shaking
the tender frames of some.
I have, however, a feeling that full
justice is not done to your poets when
you print their efforts in neat grey
coffins.
My 85-year-old eyes protest at being
invited to read and enjoy what becomes
hard work.
Caxton, Mergenthaler and Richard
Hoe, in a combined effort, could not
produce something as bad as black on
grey unless perhaps grey on black
“Perhaps, when you’ve finished ogling my wife,
we can get down to business!”
which, after all, is what some of your
poets deserve.

Casks play it cool
I can not stand by and let the comments
made in “Batman’s Melbourne” (B,
November 20) pass without comment.
Wine in casks pays 10 percent, not 10
cents. The average increase in price is
about 50 cents per cask or $4.99 pre-
budget to $5.49 post-budget.
The average bottle in fact, any
bottle wine pays the same tax, ie 10
percent, not $1.50. So a bottle of wine
retailing at $5 pre-budget should now
retail at about $5.50. For a bottle to rise
by $1.50, the pre-budget retail price
would have had to have been about $l5.
The tax is therefore not discrimina-
tory between casks and bottles.
The point of the article, however,
was that this allegedly unfair tax was
going to wipe out the small/medium
winemakers selling in bottles.
I think Australian wine consumers
should firstly be given the facts of the
case and secondly be given a little more
credit for their obvious discernment.
Batman’s article refers to the need
for controlled temperature fermentation
in the hot Australian climate in order to
produce quality wines.
Berri Estates, Australia’s largest
winery, produces and sells cask wines
under its own brands as well as in bulk
to other makers. Its own brands rank
third-largest in the cask market and one
variety Berri Fruity Gordo Moselle
is the largest-selling wine in Australia.
Wine drinkers in Australia are
deserting the traditional 750 ml bottle at
an ever-increasing rate in favor of the
cask why?
The answer is that top-selling cask
wines are made by companies such as
Berri Estates under controlled tempera-
ture fermentation. The massive re-
frigeration capacity of the Berri/
Renmano Group (more than 1000
tonnes) ensures that the quality of our
cask wines is generally much better than
those made by smaller wine makers,
many of whom are without the benefit
of adequate refrigeration.
The dreadful truth that must be faced
by the Len Evanses of this world is that
the better cask wines in Australia are
much better than most of the bottled
wines. They are also more keenly priced
and presented in a convenience pack.
The decline in glass 750 ml bottle
sales and the extraordinary growth of
the wine cask has nothing to do with the
federal government sales tax. It has
everything to do with consumer sat-
isfaction.

between 1981 and 1984 by container

The epitome of western adventur-
ism and class privilege, the 1985 Range
Rover, is now awaiting orders.
While on the surface you may have
difficulty telling it apart from its worthy
predecessors, the 1985 Range Rover is
in fact a monument to revisionists.
Open the door (with new wind-
cheating mirrors but without wind-
whistling quarterlights) and you’ll see
a Range Rover you’ve never seen before.
One with a new fascia and
instrumentation.
New front seats which adjust every
which way.
New seat upholstery and door trim.

Finally, I challenge the broad state-
ment made so often by the wine media
and writers that no good wine comes
from irrigated areas.
Firstly, there are very few areas
which have no irrigation anywhere in
Australia and secondly and more im-
portantly, wines made from grapes
grown by my company’s shareholders
in the Riverland of South Australia and
made with the most modern and
advanced technological equipment
available by highly qualified
winemakers, are consistently winning
wine show trophies and medals against
wines produced from grapes grown in
the so-called premium areas such as
Coonawarra, Barossa, Hunter, etc.

Another piece of advice
Your article “Flight of the Sacred
Stones” (B, November 13) contains
many attacks on the dreaded “white
advisors” of Aboriginal people. The
myth of the manipulative, self-seeking
and inevitably Marxist advisor has been
continually fostered by conservative
forces and their media outlets as part of
their campaign against Aboriginal
people and their interests.
I am an average white Australian
who through the advantages of my color
and background is fairly well-educated.
However, I make frequent use of white
advisors when I lack expertise. I seek
advice on legal matters, taxation, insur-
ance and might, if my income
warranted it, seek advice on investment.
The idea that the blacks would be
fine without interfering southern
“stirrers and radicals” is a convenient
one for miners and pastoralists. They


would certainly prefer a situation where
people, frequently of limited education
and commercial experience, had to
negotiate without the benefit of advice
and expertise. The truth is that these
terrible white advisors act after con-
siderable consultation with Aboriginal
people and try at all times to protect
their interests powerful vested in-
terests simply do not want to see
Aboriginal interests protected or
promoted.
Perhaps you should do a feature on
these figures you have reduced to
malevolent stereotypes. You would find
talented, intelligent, humane people
who just happen to believe that
Aboriginal people deserve a fair go and
that includes the right of every
Australian to seek expertise when they
need it.

Parties not open to all
Don Aitkin’s comment (B, November
13) that “those already in political
parties do not want hordes of new
members pouring in they would only
disturb existing arrangements” certainly
appears correct, based on my ex-
perience.
One of the major parties was so
disinterested in having me join it that,
six months after my original application

Ready for a mix-up
While living in Paris I saw the most
beautiful women in this world: they
were from Montelimar in southern
France or from Martinique or other
French colonies. They were a product of
a racial mixture.
Apart from being beautiful these
people were healthy and physically well
developed.
The French have few prejudices and
this is why their national substance, in
spite of certain sexual frivolities, is kept
in a reasonable state of health.
With AIDS and other calamities
spreading over this proud freckled
society, the time is ripe for a radical
change in the prevailing attitudes.
If we want to keep this continent, we
have to seek a biological renewal which
would offset the ravages of twisted
standards with incest and other devia-
tions becoming an epidemic.
New blood is badly needed by mixed
marriages; otherwise; we’ll be
destroyed by our own hands with no
need for any foreign invasion.

Defending Ferntree Gully
I feel compelled to protest about the
biased nature and emotive language of
the article “The horror story of Ferntree
Gully High” (B, November 6)
Could you find no students or par-
ents to speak in favor of the school,
thereby giving a more credible and
balanced account of the issues?
“Strange to think a whole generation has grown up knowing
nothing of matching accessories. ”
I was a student of Gully High from
1968-74 and have fond memories of my
time spent there and heartfelt apprecia-
tion for the teachers for giving me a
stimulating and useful education.
After my final year, I left reluctantly
but motivated to continue my education
further. More importantly, I was aware
of the necessity of taking responsibility
for myself a crucial lesson for life!
I now work in the profession of my
choice and deal daily with adolescents
who are casualties of schools which
could not or would not cater to their
needs nor accommodate their in-
dividuality.
The very least that Gully High offers
is an acceptance of individual differ-
ences and a genuine dedication of
teachers like Bob King to cater for
students’ individually varied needs.

’Our defences are down’
With the policies of the major parties on
the table, it is clear that neither is
prepared to do anything serious about
the defence of Australia in the long or
short term.
Indicative of the off-hand approach
is the opening statement of the Liberal
leader’s policy speech on defence which
refers to the provision of adequate
defence as being “a prime responsibility
of the federal government.” This is a
significant reduction in priority from
the 1976 White Paper statement that
defence was the “first responsibility of
government.”
The content of both speeches is
distinctly lacking in any appreciation of
what a defence policy is about. There is
no strategic appreciation, merely a very
limited look at a skimpy shopping list
which should, in any case, be a matter
for the government’s expert advisers.
Mr Hawke claims credit for projects
introduced by his predecessors
because 20 months is insufficient to do
anything in defence except dismantle
capability. On the other hand, Mr
Peacock criticises the present govern-
ment for decisions and failures which
are at least equally the responsibility of
the Fraser government.
For the rest, the debate has centred
around the non-issue of nuclear dis-
armament a non-issue because it is so
manifestly one-sided and superficial in
any intellectual terms. Those who are
concerned about their children’s future
will not pursue policies which threaten
nuclear war because they disturb a
balance which exists. Strident
emotionalism makes no positive con-
tribution to this most important of
issues.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Ballot blue
A STAGGERING 6.8 percent
of the 8,331,106 Australian
voters managed to vote in-
formally. The Electoral Com-
mission is checking ballot
papers to find the cause
generally held to be confusion
flowing on from the simplified
Senate voting paper to the
detriment of the House of
Representatives. Nonetheless
the Hawke government was
returned with a reduced but
comfortable majority of
something less than 20 seats.
The Opposition’s good
showing is likely to have
removed the threat of
leadership challenges to
Andrew Peacock.
UN accord
AUSTRALIA won diplo-
matic kudos at the United
Nations General Assembly
which last week adopted a
resolution drawn up mainly
by Canberra on a com-
prehensive nuclear test ban
treaty. The resolution was
passed by 109-0. The 26 ab-
stentions included the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Bannon hanging on
SOUTH Australian Premier
John Bannon lost his Labor
majority in the Saturday by-
election for the seat of
Elizabeth when a former ALP
member defeated the official
party candidate. The vote was
a rebuff to the left-wing con-
trollers of the SA branch.
Bannon, himself a moderate,
will be relying on the support
of two independants to
govern but is determined not
to go to the polls until late
next year. He says one lesson
of the federal elections is that
voters prefer governments to
serve out their full term.
Smog problem
MELBOURNE has Aus-
tralia’s worst smog problem
according to Jeff Wright,

Sydney had 15. Only three
metropolises in the world
Tokyo, Mexico City and Los
Angeles had worse smog
problems than did the
Victorian capital.

budget presented to the
Supreme Soviet (parliament)
last week contained a 12 per-
cent increase in defence
spending to SA26 billion,
giving defence a 4.9 percent of

as in Soviet practice military
expenditure is hidden under
various budget items, the total
defence outlay is believed to
be much higher.
Afghan aid
ACCORDING to American

COVER STORY
Labor’s earthquake to shift
the tax summit forward
As the shockwaves rolled in from the polling booths, government leaders became convinced
that the oppositions tax campaign had had some bite. RICHARD FARMER tells how the
government will urgently refocus on the hip-pocket nerve.
PRIME MINISTER Bob Hawke will
come under great pressure from within
the ALP to bring forward his planned
tax summit from September to early
next year. Saturday’s election setback is
being blamed by leaders of all party
factions on community fears about what
new taxes will be introduced. Opposi-
tion leader Andrew Peacock cam-
paigned relentlessly and effectively on
the taxation issue with suggestions that
Labor had a capital gains tax and death
duties on its agenda.
Hawke, with what in retrospect can
be seen as a certain arrogance, refused
to give any indication of what he
planned on the tax front. To blunt
Peacock's attack he promised that any
changes would only follow a national
conference at which the views of busi-
ness, trade unions and PAYE taxpayers
would be represented.
Hawke’s cabinet colleagues are
happy enough to go along with the tax
summit while doubting that it will really
make the job of selling changes any
easier. What frightens many of them is
the timing. Waiting until after Sep-
tember to make the decisions means
that it will be 1986 before they come
into effect. If a capital gains tax is
introduced then it will be 1987, the year
of the next planned election, before
anyone begins paying it.
The alternative strategy is to make
whatever hard decisions are necessary
in the budget next August. Then the
electorate will at least be able to make
its judgment on the basis of what the
changes actually mean to it rather than
a guess about what they might mean.
In support of the argument for
hurrying up the tax reform process,
some ministers are quoting the example
of the assets test for pensioners. The
truth is that very few pensioners will be
affected by it.
Yet it emerged as a significant factor
last Saturday because most pensioners
did not realise that they would escape it.
Those who become subject to it might
continue to grumble but it is a reason-
able assumption that there will be few
Labor supporters among that affluent
group.
The same pattern is expected to
apply to a capital gains tax which
excludes the family home. Most people
will never be affected by it but until it is
in operation for at least a year the
ground will remain fertile for an op-
position to suggest that they will.
Handling this taxation issue will be
the major test for Hawke in his second
term. He is on the record as favoring a
tax on capital as are Industry and
Commerce minister John Button and
Finance minister John Dawkins. But
there remains a significant section of the
party which believes that the electoral
risks are too great for the revenue
benefits that would be gained.
Treasurer Paul Keating is very much
in that camp. During the campaign
Keating would have dearly loved to
have come out with an unequivocal
statement that a capital gains tax and
death duties were not on. That he could
not do so is a measure of the support
that such measures have, not only
among his colleagues, but in the trade
union movement as well. With the
prices and incomes accord being the
vital part of his economic strategy,
Keating reluctantly realises that tax
changes must have the support of the
Australian Council of Trade Unions.
The Treasurer’s battle will be to have
a broadly based indirect tax accepted.
Only if this is done can there be any real
relief for ordinary income tax payers.
Yet just as the ACTU is in favor of taxes
on capital, it is opposed to those such as
a retail sales tax. Keating has to reach
agreement with the unions that any
increases in prices caused by an indirect
tax are not taken into account in fixing
wages. To get that agreement he might
well have to concede on the question of
a capital gains tax.
Keating is unlikely to make any
concession on death duties. Within the
NSW branch of the party, opposition to
them is total. In the cabinet that is an
issue where Deputy Prime Minister
Lionel Bowen would give Keating valu-
able support.
Not that Bowen is certain to con-
tinue as deputy prime minister. The
foreign minister and head of the centre
left faction in the caucus, Bill Hayden,
may yet decide to challenge for the post.
Hayden’s decision about challenging
Bowen will depend very much on the
internal manoeuvring now going on


within the parliamentary party on the
shape of the second Hawke ministry.
Both the left and the centre left, with the
support of the Victorian independent
group headed by Senator Button, want
the size of the ministry increased. The
parliament this time is bigger while
Labor does not have an increased
majority it will have more backbenchers
if the ministry stays at 27.
A backbencher’s lot is not a par-
ticularly exciting one. It is the hope of
becoming a minister that sustains them
through the tedium of long par-
liamentary sittings. Yet the Hawke
ministry in the past 20 months has been
a very successful one. There have
certainly been no disaster, even if some
ministers look as if they would be better
suited with a different portfolio. No
wholesale sackings are likely. Every one
of the 27 ministers certainly expects to
be re-elected in the caucus ballot which
leaves no room for the ambitious.
It is from this basis that the moves
for an expanded ministry have come.
The centre left originally proposed that
there should be some seven to 10 new
ministers. After discussions before
December 1 with the other factions,
there was general agreement that the
number be three. The Prime Minister
was aware of these discussions and did
not seem to be opposed to an increase in
the number of ministers.
Saturday’s result changed Hawke’s
view. He obviously became worried that
it would look bad for a party with a
reduced majority to increase the
number of chiefs. At a post election
press conference Hawke said there
would only be minimal changes, and no
increase in numbers.
That statement made before
faction leaders including Hayden, the
left’s Gerry Hand and the right’s
Senator Graeme Richardson met in
Melbourne on Sunday irritated sev-
eral ministers.
Some government departments in-
volve a considerable administrative
workload and a large part of a
minister’s day can be taken up reading
and signing quite minor pieces of paper.
Ministers in charge of these large de-
partments would like to follow the
British practice and have someone of
ministerial rank to assist them.
Thus there could be a minister for
Defence Personnel or such-like who
would share the load with the Defence
minister without any new department
actually being created.
The device used would be that which
Malcolm Fraser introduced when he
appointed a young John Howard as
minister for International Trade
Negotiations.
The centre left believes that three
new ministerial appointments of this
kind would not arouse the ire of the
ANALYSIS
The re-election - past and future
by Alan Reid
THE ECONOMY stuck to Bob Hawke
and’ as a consequence, a majority of the
Australian electorate stuck to Hawke
and his Labor government. When you
get right down to bedrock, that is the
explanation for last Saturday when
Prime Minister Hawke and most of his
fellow ALP parliamentarians were
returned as the government of Australia
for the next three years even though
they have a decreased majority in the
House of Representatives.
Hawke started the election campaign
well in advance in popularity in the
public opinion polls over Opposition
leader Andrew Peacock. In part, that
was due to Hawke’s nature: he is a
superb communicator. At the real poll,
on election night, this popularity was
not maintained to the same extent.
What helped to maintain his
popularity at its extraordinarily high
level and his government’s standing at a
reasonable one was the impression of
financial responsibility which Hawke
managed to convey during his relatively
brief stint as Prime Minister since
March 5, 1983. This financial achieve-
ment enabled Hawke to produce facts
which Peacock was hard-put to counter.
Hawke could point to:
■ Australia being the fastest-develop-
ing economy in the world;
■ Creation of 250,000 jobs and a
decline in unemployment levels;
■ Inflation halved from what it had
been in the final period of the Malcolm
Fraser-led 1975-83 Liberal-National
Party coalition government;
■ Lower interest rates;
■ Higher profit levels for private
enterprises;
■ Taxation benefits for income
earners;
■ Revival of home building and
assistance for first-home buyers.
Hawke also was lucky and you
need luck, as well as brains, in politics.
Soon after his March 1983 election win
came the breaking of the drought. On
top of that, the world economic situa-
tion showed some improvement with
the all-important US economy ex-
periencing a recovery of sorts.
Peacock cunningly picked the hip-
pocket nerve. He made appealing taxa-
tion offers, warned that the economic
recovery showed signs of being short-
lived, undertook to abolish asset testing
for pensioners and to wipe out the extra
impost on superannuation payments
and cried wolf over capital gains and
other taxes. But Peacock could not
overcome the Hawke aura of financial
responsibility.
Hawke, moreover, gave three basic
pledges for the next three years:
■ The level of taxation would not
increase as a proportion of gross
domestic production;
■ The deficit would be reduced;
■ Government spending increases
would be kept below the rate of
economic growth.
A measure of the impact that these
pledges had on other than traditional
ALP voters is that both The Sydney
Morning Herald and the Melbourne
Herald - normally Liberal supporters -
advocated a further term in government
for Hawke’s administration.
A feature of the ALP campaign (and
this could be why it got the approving
reception which it did in what are some
usually non-ALP circles) was the
deafening silence on the part of the
party’s left wing. The running was left
almost entirely to Hawke, with
Treasurer Paul Keating acting as a
backstop.
Now the elections are over, the left
wing probably will re-emerge and seek
to make life difficult for the man who
did so much to put the ALP on top.
While a majority of the voters may like
Hawke, the ALP’s left wing dislikes
both him and some of his policies. □


people in the way that Hawke obviously
fears it will. Nor would it lead to
massive increases in expenditure of the
sort on which Paul Keating has based
his opposition.
Hayden and Dawkins will push their
proposal very hard with Hawke. And in
the back of Hawke’s mind will be the
knowledge that the man he replaced as
Labor leader in 1983 might yet choose
to exact a part revenge by standing
against Lionel Bowen. Such a decision
by Hayden would do far more to
undermine confidence in the Labor
government than the appointment of
three ministers.
For his part, Hawke is now obliged
to listen to the advice of senior party
members. Saturday’s vote, however it is
interpreted, tarnished his image and it
will be much more difficult in future for
him to disregard party feelings by ap-
pealing direct to the public.
If Hawke has had his power curbed a
little by the result, Liberal Leader
Andrew Peacock has at least had a stay
of execution. His party’s vote Australia
wide was virtually unchanged on that in
1983 but coming after an expectation
that it would go down, that is probably
good enough to save him from
challenges. Yet just as Hawke will have
to listen more to his colleagues, Peacock
will find National Party Leader lan
Sinclair much more assertive.
The National Party were the big
winners in the election and their in-
creased vote will have the effect of
removing the albatross tag from
Sinclair. The result will be a greater
emphasis on hard-line conservative
policies within the opposition.
Fiddling while Rabbie Burns ...
“THE BEST-laid plans of mice and men
gang aft agley ...”
PERHAPS the Australian Labor Party
should have used Rabbie Burns, instead
of Mick Young, in framing their new
voting laws. The electoral reforms of the
Hawke government went agley with a
vengeance.
The decision to change the Senate
polling system to stem the informal
votes which traditionally reduce Labor’s
share of the vote succeeded admirably.
Under the rules where electors only
had to tick one box, instead of marking
every square, informal voting for the
Senate was down. Yet, a massive mis-
understanding of the changes cost
Labor dearly in the House of Rep-
resentatives.
ALP scrutineers throughout the
country have reported the same finding.
Voters, having put the simple mark
“l” on their Senate ballot paper, pro-
ceeded to do the same with their vote.
This made the Senate vote valid but that
for the lower house was not.
The Labor Party’s changes this year
to the electoral laws simplified the
Senate voting system but did not change
the system for the House of Repre-
sentatives.
For a Reps vote to be valid, every
square still had to be numbered. The
multi-million-dollar advertising cam-
paign by the Electoral Commission
which pointed out the new system for
the Senate did not stress this difference.
The result was chaos and an increase in
informal voting for the House of
Representatives from some 2.5 percent
to about 6.8 percent.
Not every stupid voter, of course,
votes Labor. But, judging by the reports
from Labor scrutineers, the ALP does
have a majority there. For every Liberal
who completed a House of Represen-
tatives ballot paper with a single “1” at
least two Labor voters did the same for
their party. The ALP judges the net
result of such wrong voting to have cost
it 1 percent on a national basis.
The accuracy or otherwise of this
assessment soon will be known offici-
ally. The electoral commissioner will be
given the task by Special Minister of
State Mick Young to evaluate the in-
formal vote.
The commissioner’s report will be a
vital prerequisite to attempted further
changes by Labor to the electoral laws.
Labor’s aim is to have voting for the
House of Representatives on the op-
tional preferential system. This would
mean that votes marked just “1” would
be as valid as those that numbered in
every square.
When Labor this year proposed this
system, the Democrats would not agree
to it. In the wake of the apparent
unfairness of the poll, perhaps they will
next time.
Yet, while Labor wants a change to
the House of Representatives voting
system, it must be said that no one
within the upper echelons of the party
predicted that staying with the old
system for the lower house while having
the new system for the upper house
would have any serious effect on their
vote. Nor did they predict that so many
traditional Labor voters would wilfully
vote informal in the Reps. Young is sure
to be criticised in Labor’s agonising
post-mortems. But the criticism will not
be so much for simplifying the Senate
voting system as for the costly advertis-
ing campaign leaving widespread im-
pression that one mark on a ballot
paper was sufficient to indicate a pre-
ference for the House of Represen-
tatives as well. □

THE ECONOMY
Hawke faces
a dose of
Thatcherism
By JOHN EDWARDS
ITS ELECTORAL lustre dulled by the
poll result, the Hawke regime faces 12
months of extremely difficult and deli-
cate decisions. Each is of fundamental
importance to the shape of Australian
government.
The past 18 months already have
brought three important changes to the
system.
The first has been the experience of
the pay/price accord which has seen the
trade union movement disciplining its
constituents to hold the agreement. That
could not have been predicted a few
years ago.
The second has been the opening up
of the senior levels of the com-
monwealth public service. The third
change arguably the most important
was the floating of the Australian
dollar a year ago, integrating Australia
with world financial markets and
removing the single greatest problem in
using monetary policy to affect the
economy. All three changes flowed from
a government which even many of its
supporters alleged to be doing very
little.
The next three years and particularly
the next 12 months will produce another
set of dramatic changes.
The government must address four
key issues in 1985. All are closely
connected, properly should be made
together and all four will test both the
ability of the government to make the
right decision and its ability to get the
right decision accepted by business, by
trade unions and by the states.
These issues of 1985 are the review of
state and commonwealth taxing powers
and functions, the federal budget, the
national taxation system and the pro-
ductivity case before the Arbitration
Commission.
The Hawke government will have to
decide early next year on an overall
strategy to be consistent over the four
events.
It is impossible, for example, to
separate a decision to encourage the
states to raise a greater share of their
own taxes from the subsequent federal
budget or from the impact on take-
home pay or prices.
It is possible but unwise to produce
tax cuts in the next federal budget
without first obtaining from the trade
unions some offset in either the price
indexation or the productivity arbitra-
tion hearings.
If Prime Minister Bob Hawke is to
keep his promise not to allow taxes to
increase as a share of national output,
he probably will have to make tax cuts.
Our marginal income tax always pro-
duces a higher growth in revenue than
does the average growth in incomes. So,
the government has to find some way of
packaging the required cuts with its
continuing central objective of keeping
a lid on wages.
As Hawke has pointed out, correctly,
you do not need an incomes policy in a
recession. But you do need it in a
recovery and particularly in an ex-
pansion.
The tax review can not be separated
from either the indexation and pro-
ductivity cases or from the shape of the
federal budget.
If we move more of the tax total to
indirect levies based on sales, there will
be a one-time price increase as the tax is
introduced.
Since that would be offset by a fall in
the marginal rate of income tax, the
government would need trade union
agreement to keep the price rise from
being included in an indexation pay
increase.
If it were included, employees would
be double-dipping once for the
income tax cut and again in a wage
increase compensating them for the
price increase.
That is another issue on which the
government has to make an overall
policy in advance.
Next year’s budget will present a
more general issue.
In a very important modification of
his three budget promises, Hawke has
committed himself to reducing the
deficit as a number as well as to keeping
taxes to no more than their present
proportion of output. The inescapable
arithmetic of these two promises, given
real growth of 4 percent, is that public
spending in the next budget can only
increase by about 2 percent. Half of this
is committed in advance to pay interest
on the increase in the national debt and
the remainder is committed to pay for
the full-year cost of programs in-
troduced this year. That leaves zero real
increase in remaining public spending
next year.


In practice, that means that if
defence spending (for example) has to
increase by 2 percent in real terms to
meet contractual commitments, spend-
ing on health or education must be cut
in real terms.
The government can “fudge” this by
pretending that Australia will have 5
percent growth rate in 1985-86 but, if it
wants to take the exercise seriously, it
will be painful.
The budget that must result from
Hawke’s current set of promises will
look much like that of Britain’s
Thatcher government tax cuts and no
real spending increases.
This is not an analogy which Hawke
will welcome.
The connection of these decisions
poses a very great challenge to Hawke’s
style of consensus and summitry.
Only the federal government could
or should be able to co-ordinate an
approach to the four major forums of
1985. But the obligation of consistency
over negotiations with different sets of
partners leaves little room to respond to
the bargaining demands of any one of
the partners.
Because so many issues press for
1985, the appearance of consensus is
likely to break down.
Important as they are, the four issues
do not exhaust the federal agenda for
the next 12 months.
The Prime Minister and his minister
for Industry and Commerce, Senator
John Button, have talked for 18 months
about the need to re-structure
Australian industry and the need to
shape our training, trade and invest-
ment assistance to closer integration
with the fast-growing economies of
Asia.
Hawke and Button want to re-shape
the federal bureaucracy in some
unspecified way to help this along. Both
are waiting on the Manufacturing In-
dustry Council a creation of the tri-
partite approach to decisions to
create a favorable climate for cuts in
protection against imports.
How Manufacturing Industry Coun-
cil performs in 1985 and how its
recommendations relate to the central
issues of employment and wages which
pre-occupy the government in its
economic planning will be one of the
tougher issues of next year.
So will the continuing refusal of New
Zealand to allow nuclear armed or
nuclear powered ships into its ports.
The government is most unlikely to
change policy and the United States
probably will not want to force the
pace.
In the American view, the ANZUS
alliance is a long-term arrangement
which will survive the occasional aber-
rations of its members.
But the Hawke government may be
drawn into trilateral discussions on the
issue (perhaps in the next ANZUS
council meeting and Foreign Minister
Bill Hayden could stir the pot to keep
together his domestic support.
Lor Hawke, the next 12 months will
test his substance as well as style. □
John Button: waiting for the winds of change
THE COALITION
Peacock safe
- for the time
being, that is
By DAVID BARNETT
808 HAWKE’S miscalculations have
given Andrew Peacock a good six
months’ breathing space as Liberal
leader and ended talk of a new con-
servative party.
The challenge Peacock faced from
John Howard has been averted.
Peacock will have the autumn session of
parliament next year to show that he
can sustain the momentum of the cam-
paign. If he sinks back into the lethargy
of the preceding 18 months, next winter
will truly be bleak for the colt from
Kooyong. By then, the challengers may
be thick on the ground: not only How-
ard but also Jim Carlton, Michael
MacKellar, Steele Hall and perhaps two
new members, Julian Beale (Deakin,
Victoria) and Paul Everingham
(Northern Territory).
Revolt in the party over Peacock’s
handling of his responsibilities as Op-
position leader boiled up in October
and almost resulted in a leadership
ballot.
It was stifled by Howard on the
grounds that it would be playing into
the government’s hands with an election
looming. But Howard’s supporters say
that he had the numbers.
Peacock fought a controlled and
programmed campaign. The strategy
was based on the premise that the belief
in Peacock had survived the previous 18
months and that it could be revived. But
the polls which indicated a further
landslide for Prime Minister Hawke
may have been self-defeating. Liberals
believed the polls scared people back to
their Malcolm Fraser in 1980.
Senior Liberals believe the same
wariness of Labor was operating again
and that a significant part of the
electorate doubts Hawke’s ability to
control the left wing of his party.
They dismiss the argument that the
informal vote affects only the ALP.
However, they say the many blank
papers appear to have been a protest
against the Hawke government.
They suspect some of the protest may
have been from Nuclear Disarmament
Party supporters who did not have
lower house candidates.
Hawke’s decision to call an early
election, to give the Opposition seven
weeks in which to campaign, and then
to debate with Peacock in the final week
live on television has reduced the
government’s certain term in office from


John Howard: challenge averted
JOHN ELLIOTT
six to four and a half years. The
Opposition parties know that they can
return to government with a gain in
1987 of less than 2 percent.
That both strengthens Peacock and
makes him more vulnerable.
He is now an alternative prime
minister and a leader who has cut
Hawke down a size or two.
As such Peacock can expect a better
run in the media. He will be harder to
mock. But, if he starts to look like the
obstacle to a coalition government,
Peacock will once more be in danger.
Over the past 18 months, as the
opinion polls have shown, the parties
were reasonably close but Hawke out-
stripped Peacock in approval rating.
National Party leader lan Sinclair
has emerged from the campaign like an
embattled bull walrus on an Arctic
beach. He is scarred but triumphant.
Hawke made a special effort to un-
seat him, but Sinclair improved his mar-
gin in New England. The 17 seats held
by the National Party in the lower house
have been increased to 20 and could
reach as high as 23.
The vote also reflected the economic
downturn in rural Australia. Farm
incomes are expected to fall by about 30
percent this year, while costs have
continued to rise. Farmers have had
little benefit from the accord.
Sinclair will be returning to Can-
berra a more comfortable leader.
Apart from Deakin and Casey in
suburban Melbourne, Liberal Neal
Browne, the former Communications
minister, looks as if he is making his
second return to parliament for the new
seat of Menzies.
Peter Shack also is making a return
for Tangney in Western Australia and
Alexander Downer will be a second
generation South Australian Liberal for
the new seat of Mayo.
Kathy Martin has made a successful
transition from the Senate to the House
of Representatives as the likely winner
of the new Queensland seat of
Moncrieff.
All five Tasmanian seats have been
held for the Liberals including
Braddon and Bass where sitting Lib-
erals had retired and Dennison where
redistribution cut into Michael
Hodgman’s power base in what was
already a marginal seat.
The coalition also appeared to have
won Macquarie in the Blue Mountains
west of Sydney and was pushing the
ALP to a surprisingly narrow result in
Hunter, west of Newcastle, where the
swing required was 5 percent.
The coalition parties did not win the
election but they feel they won a cam-
paign. They also feel that Hawke’s
control over his party has been
weakened and that they can work
toward victory in 1987, in the way that
in 1969 and 1980 the ALP laid the
groundwork for victories.
They are yet to decide whether to
stick with their present leadership, as
was the case with Gough Whitlam in
1969 and 1972, or whether to change it
as the ALP did in February last year
when it replaced Bill Hayden with Bob
Hawke. □
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT
Garrett puts
his feelings
on the record
By PAUL GARDINER
PETER GARRETT, the shaven-headed
singer from Midnight Oil, is the
embodiment of a droll Green Party
joke. The Greens’ three media stars in
West Germany, among them the
remarkable Petra Kelly, were sardonic-
ally dubbed “the divas” by lesser party
members. In Garrett, Australia’s new
Nuclear Disarmament Party (NDP) has
a real diva and one who commands
support and adulation.
While the Greens reluctantly went to
their most successful election campaign
with a developed party platform (their
earlier view being that a specific
platform was not needed) and garnered
6 percent of the vote, the NDP has
avoided policy and stuck instead to
straight nuclearphoby.
This “no bases, no bombs and no
uranium” approach is actually out-
greening the Greens.
In the absence of a party policy and
a point blank refusal to expand on the
nuclear trinity, there is really only one
source of information on where Garrett
stands. And that is a less than satisfac-
tory one the songs of Midnight Oil.
Garrett is the band’s principal lyricist,
the author of many of the mainly
political songs for which it is famous.
Even with allowances that Midnight Oil
is not the NDP, there is little doubt that


the songs, the image of Garrett himself
and the widespread apprehension about
their future among a significant propor-
tion of young voters have coalesced to
give the NDP its shot at the door to the
Senate.
Midnight Oil’s themes have not
changed significantly since the band’s
earliest albums; they are all fairly bleak
and troubled, almost obsessively con-
cerned with large questions
Australia’s perceived client status in
relation to America, the bomb, the
media, the corporations, the environ-
ment and Australia’s dangerously he-
donistic approach to life in general.
This is not to say that the songs are
without hope. But the best and most
remembered and most played of
them, the anthems of a good proportion
of Australian youth, have a desperate
edge.
Midnight Oil’s potent blend of rage,
despair and denunciation is seen best in
songs such as Power and the Passion:
People wasting away in Paradise
Going backwards once in a while
Moving ahead, falling behind. . .
Sundays the beach never a cloud
Breathing eucalypt, pushing panelvans
stuff and much junk food
Laughing at the truth, ’cause Gough was

Uncle Sam and John were quite enough
Too much sunshine, too much of sky
It’s enough to make you wanna cry.
You take what you get and get what you

It’s better to die on your feet

largely military, largely American:
US Forces give the nod
It’s a setback for your country
Bombs and trenches all in rows
Bombs and threats still ask for more

same sort of treatment:
Chopping down tons of trees got seas

Why do 1 drown you build brick boxes

Music
Some of these songs have been on
high rotation airplay for the past two
years.
Since the release of its album 10, 9,8,
7,6, 5,4, 3,2, 1, the band has dominated
the Australian rock and roll scene.
Previously regarded highly for its
remarkable power as a stage band, 10, 9,
8 ... was the album that finally
transformed it into one of the country’s
major commercial successes.
The album has been in the sales
charts for two years.
The sentiments on it are not the
reason for its enormous impact.
Midnight Oil plays by far the most
potent Australian rock and roll and an
indigenous, pub-bred brand of music
which you will not find anywhere else.
In all of its eclectic borrowing from
other varieties of music, Midnight Oil
has continued to play what is sometimes
called “rage” music music to have a
good time with.
Yet the band has also managed to
create a variety of rock and roll that
consists, lyrically, of significant political
songs and angry songs at that. This is
quite unusual. There are a few political
bands in America and more in England.
With the exception of the Clash, none
has generated anything like the Oil’s
sales.
Its latest album, Red Sails in the
Sunset, is proving to be just as popular
as usual. Upon its release in October,
the record jumped to the top of the
charts and seems destined to stay there
for some time. The songs (Who Can
Stand in the Way is one of them) are
again a blend of desperate observation
and vague admonishment about a
potentially better future. But the cover
says it all a photo montage by
Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura of
Sydney after being nuked, with no
harbor and an oddly isolated Opera
House.
One more element in Midnight Oil’s
songs should be noted: they are about
alienation.
The people who voted for the NDP,
if the songs are anything to go by, feel
cut off, disaffected and isolated. They
are the new trendies, often unemployed
and with a fairly bleak view of their
future.
It is totally unlikely that any amount
of condemnation of the NDP by the
likes of Liberal deputy John Howard
(for favoring appeasement, as he sees it)
or Prime Minister Bob Hawke (because
his government is active on the disarma-
ment issue) will turn them around. After
all, they were voting for a view of the
world that has been thoroughly re-
inforced for years in a quite persuasive
medium.
And what of Garrett as a continuing
political factor? It is possible to conjec-
ture from the songs. Most of them are
pure here-and-now observation through
a radical prism.
What the major parties on both sides
should hope is that Garrett plays the
political game with a little less bash than
the extremely tough manager of
Midnight Oil, Garry Morris. Morris
makes the average, able multinational
executive look like a sissy. □

QUEENSLAND
Revolution in
education
foments revolt
By JANET WILSON
IN THE PAST, education Queensland-
style could never have been described as
innovative: some schools refused to
teach Darwin’s theories and taught cre-
ationism instead, and the Queensland
government banned a teaching course
and a teachers’ resource kit in the late
70s, describing them as “too radical.”
But Queensland now is on the verge
of overhauling its education system
and has provoked the wrath of the
parents and teachers.
Last year, the operations of the
education department were reviewed,
from the school system to the
administration. The task force doing
this came up with four options, one of
which was called “The preferred
option”, a three-tiered system that
looked after a child’s education from
pre-school to tertiary age.
That option has become the choice
of education minister and former
primary school teacher, Lin Powell. If
he has his way the preferred option will
become a reality in Queensland schools.
Powell says, “What we want to do is
to help the child develop educationally,
rather than just keep them out of the
dole queue.”
Under the plan, the old divisions of
infant, primary and secondary schools
would be abolished. The preferred
option is based on the psychological
and social development of the child. It
would see children enter the first tier of
their education at pre-school, would
take the child up to year three and
would be non-graded.
This, says Powell, would allow the
child to learn at his own speed within
the four years and correct learning
difficulties: “It’s proven by testing that
if a child shows a learning difficulty
early and most of them do and it’s
remediated (sic) early, they’ll never have
that problem again.”
Stage two of the preferred option
would see the child entering year four
and going on to year 10 in a continuous
curriculum.
Powell says a major advantage of
this would be to help students bridge the
gap between years seven and eight, the
jump from primary to secondary
school.
Powell says the emphasis would be
geared around a basic core curriculum,
but scope would be provided for some
choices or options in the final stages.
Stage three would be based on junior
college. Academic students could carry
on to grades 11 and 12 at a junior
college, as at present, but students
wishing to train for blue and white-
collar jobs would be able to specialise.
The junior college would be linked in
with the present TAFE system offering
trade courses, and the theoretical side of
apprenticeship training.
“This option has the ability to in-
crease the number of kids staying on to
grades 11 and 12 and make it meaning-
ful and useful for them,” Powell says.
The idea is not new among
Queensland educationists. Ken Imison,
dean of the school of education at the
Darling Downs Institute of Advanced
Education, says the proposed
curriculum has been around for several
years.
“The whole concept gives more
flexibility for children and doesn’t bind
them up in the lock-step system we now
have,” he says.
“I believe there must be a whole
rethinking of the structure of education
in Australia. The system we now have of
changing the curriculum at grades 8, 9
and 10 is artificial. Also, we have to do
some re-thinking of the senior years.
The increasing problem of non-academ-
ic children coming into grades 11 and
12 to avoid the dole has to be looked
at.”
But the preferred option doesn’t
have everyone’s approval. Community
and education-interest groups say
they’re being kept in the dark about the
new plans.
The public will be given the chance
to discuss and comment on the proposal
when the task force presents its paper in
February. Lyle Shuntner, president of
the Queensland Teachers’ Union, says
that will be too late. He says, “The
report will go to the minister in January,
who will then present it to cabinet for
approval. Now there’s not much room
then for meaningful consultation or
argument after the decision is made.
“Our whole position is really based
on our being presented with a fait
accompli.”
Bev Galtos, president of the
Queensland Council of Parents and
Citizens, agrees: “How can you be
happy about anything if you don’t know
what it is? Some of the concepts sound
excellent, especially in the early
childhood years. But we don’t know
whether what we’re imagining is the
same thing as they’re planning.”
But Powell told The Bulletin general


Simon Crean: his taxation stand will have an important impact on the ACTU presidency
DON McPHEDRAN
interest groups had been told: “We’re
doing our homework so that by the
beginning of next year we will have a
discussion paper that’s worthwhile. It
will in fact be a thoroughly researched
document that will allow for good
discussion. What cabinet will approve is
the discussion paper to be just a discus-
sion paper. It won’t be approving any
changes to the system.”
But the provision in this year’s
budget to build two trial junior colleges,
at Torquay, near Hervey Bay, and
Alexandra Hills, near Brisbane, hasn’t
allayed Lyle Shuntner’s fears. He says,
“Until you’ve had consultations with a
wide range of people and formulated
answers to questions that arise, then
who in their right mind would want to
go ahead with a trial or pilot? And it’s
quite obvious that that’s what’s happen-
ing at Torquay and Alexandra Hills. It’s
a new arrangement and it’s an arrange-
ment that’s part and parcel of the
preferred option.”
Lin Powell says that a pre-school to
year three school has also been estab-
lished in Roma.
“What we’re going to do is run a few
pilots to prove or disprove the theory.
It’s silly to introduce something without
trying it out,” he says.
The Queensland Teachers’ Union
has unanimously voted for a
moratorium on the preferred option
until there has been more public discus-
sion on it.
Says Shuntner: “Outside the minister
and senior education officials, I don’t
know any group that’s happy with
what’s happening. The lack of consulta-
tion has led to a lot of suspicion.”
Powell looks like having a fight on
his hands. □
THE ACCORD
Severe strains
ahead for price,
incomes deal
By DEBORAH HOPE
THE FIRST 20 MONTHS of Labor’s
prices and incomes accord with the
Australian Council of Trade Unions
must be acclaimed as a success. It is the
next 12 months that will prove the
extent of the deal’s durability.
The issues to be confronted in 1985
include superannuation, taxation, the
inflexibility of the wage indexation
system and industry policy. These,
rather than the occasional union break-
away from the system, will be the test.
The danger for the federal govern-
ment if it fails in any of these areas is a
new mood of union militancy.
The agenda for 1985 will provide
unions and business with four forums
outside national wage cases in which to
vent their frustrations with the system.
They are the Arbitration Commission’s
review of its wage guidelines, the ACTU
congress, the government’s tax summit
and the commission’s hearing into
national productivity due to com-
mence around September.
The slowdown in employment
growth expected to continue into next
year can only heighten the tensions.
Employment and Industrial Rela-
tions minister Ralph Willis already has
hinted at a loosening up of the wage
system in anticipation of a pay pressure
build-up over Labor’s second term.
Willis told The Bulletin in a recent
interview that the government would be
looking at ways of building “a bit more
flexibility” into the wages system to try
to “give that little bit to those workers in
highly profitable areas or who have a
good reason or expectation for getting
more than the average for instance,
where there is a high demand for
workers.”
Willis said: “The big trick the
crucial question for continued econ-
omic expansion and job growth here
is to maintain that overall restraint and
build in a degree of flexibility.”
The danger of upsetting the
delicately balanced equity barrow and
the difficulty of constraining any flow-
on of specific wage improvements is
. obvious. It is understood that the
: government has in mind particularly the
! resources sector where a minor boom at
I least in oil and gas is anticipated within
I the next few years.
! The problem which the government
must face is coping with a build-up of
expectations in other parts of the
workforce. It may have to confront this
issue early next year when the commis-
sion hands down its decision on the
drawn-out anomalies case for 80,000
federal public servants. This could yield
a pay rise as high as 6 percent.
Union and business thinking already
is pre-occupied with preparing the
ground for the commission’s 1985 in-
quiry into national productivity. The
ACTU, for its part, has made perfectly
clear that it will be arguing for com-
pensation for a 4 to 5 percent rise in
productivity to be distributed wholly or
in part as improved superannuation
benefits for Australia’s workforce.
The Confederation of Australian In-
dustry and the Business Council also
have made plain that they oppose the
ACTU’s basis for reckoning productiv-
ity and that the additional employer-
funded superannuation benefits the
ACTU is seeking would act as a strong
disincentive to jobs growth.
The Business Council disputes the
conventional basis for assessing prod-
uctivity (which it says gives a rate of
about 2.5 percent growth a year and
states that, “after certain corrections .. .
our average productivity growth per-
formance is little more than 1 percent
per annum.” It opposes superannuation
schemes, such as that recently in-
troduced into the building industry,
which are totally employer-funded.
The confederation has signalled
clearly that it intends to use the labor
on-costs argument to dispute claims for
increased worker benefits to match pro-
ductivity rises. The government has said
that on-costs have fallen almost to the
level of the late 1960 s but the confeder-
ation uses a different calculation to
produce a higher figure. According to its


sums, across-the-board superannuation
would result in a 1.4 percent increase in
total labor costs.
The confederation argues further
that next year’s productivity claim “pre-
sents potentially as de-stabilising a set
of circumstances as did the introduction
of the 38-hour week in 1981” and that
its distribution through, for example,
superannuation benefits would cause
the Australian economy to retreat into
recession once more.
Another possibility for the pro-
ductivity case is that the union move-
ment again will raise the question of a
national employment fund. This idea
was raised originally at the 1982 special
federal unions conference and, if
applied to the productivity case, could
mean a proposal that employers pay
John MacBean: potential beneficiary
part of any award into a jobs fund. In
the highly-charged atmosphere of in-
creasing profits, some unions feel that
this is the only reliable way of ensuring
that corporate investment leads to job
generation.
The tax summit planned for late next
year is another issue focusing the atten-
tion of unions and business. The
government summit is timed to fall after
the budget and also after what could be
a difficult ACTU congress.
Labor has welcomed comments by
Business Council representatives on the
Economic Planning and Advisory
Council supporting a move to a
reformed tax system, including a
broader base of indirect taxes and
capital taxes.
ACTU presidential heir-apparent
Simon Crean has also given his support
to such a package being developed. This
is despite a move toward more indirect
taxation being against ACTU policy.
Crean believes that the unions will
accept the change if it is presented as a
package including relief for the many
workers who have reached the 46 cents
in the dollar bracket.
Crean also has signalled prepared-
ness to grapple with the vexed question
of discounting the consumer price index
for wage adjustment purposes to take
any new indirect taxes into account.
This issue is likely to generate a highly-
emotional discussion within the union
movement in 1985 because of the his-
tory of discounting wage indexation.
Debate on this matter at the ACTU
congress will be of extreme importance
in settling the body’s presidency. The
danger for Crean is that, if the union
movement has not been convinced of
the merits of an indirect tax approach
by September, he could lose ground to
NSW candidate and Labor Council
secretary John Macßean.
The most highly-charged issue over-
shadowing the accord is what unions
describe as government inaction on
implementing key parts of industry
policy outlined in the accord
document.
This issue will shape the
attitude of the powerful
Amalgamated Metals, Foun-
dry and Shipwrights Union to
the other matters discussed
here. There is already private
talk within the union of in-
dustrial campaigns halting
major resource projects to
press the government to act.
The falling out between the
manufacturing unions and
Industry and Commerce
minister John Button began
over alleged delays in setting
up the manufacturing and
other industry councils and
the secretariat to serve them.
Debate over whether unions were
fully informed of the jobs impact of the
car industry restructuring plan and
government refusal to respond to a
proposal for $5OO million emergency
assistance to the heavy engineering in-
dustry have added acrimony,
According to Willis, the tensions
over industry policy are a problem but
one that may be overcome. Button
believes that the problem is entrenched,
“It’s never been the function of the
industry councils to demand something
and have it acceded to as an automatic
right. They are there to advise,” he said
recently.
Button said a main problem for the
heavy engineering industry was over-
capacity a product of the mythical
resources boom of the Fraser govern-
ment years. “The problem we have to
face up to in this country is that going
into business involves making profits
and taking risks. There’s a mentality
here that says in the good times we will
make the profits but when we have to
take some risks and that doesn’t work,
then, we come to the government,” said
Button.
“We have to change the view of the
government as the universal alms.” □
EMPLOYMENT
Big companies
see little hope
of job growth
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
JOB CREATION, one of the govern-
ment’s main tasks in its first term,
promises to be just as challenging in the
second.
Ironically, with few exceptions, the
big companies that the Prime Minister
has worked so hard to get on side will
not be contributing to any employment
growth through 1985.
Led by Australia’s largest corporate
profit-maker, BHP Ltd, the large manu-
facturers and resource companies say
they see no growth in their employment
over the next year. In some companies
numbers will fall. Companies are fol-
lowing through on the restructuring of
1981 and 1982 when the recession
provided reason for retrenchments that
could have happened gradually over
earlier years.
Corporate profits have recovered
across the board this year but employ-
ment levels have not and, generally, will
not.
A survey by The Bulletin of leading
companies while not exhaustive, is a
pointer to corporate attitudes to job
prospects. The table on page 39 shows
how employment levels have moved
through the 1980 s - through the reces-
sion to the recovery. In many cases,
there have been divestments or acquisi-
tions and these are explained where
possible. BHP, whose jobs reduction
has been well documented, has seen its
PUBLIC OPINION
Some cautious
optimism about
unemployment
ONLY 44 percent of Australians believe
that unemployment will worsen in the
next 12 months.
This is 10 percent lower than last
year and is the first time that the
majority surveyed have not thought
unemployment would deteriorate, the
Morgan Gallup Poll finds.
World economic pressure still
most often blamed for unemployment
was mentioned as such by 41 percent
(down 4), trade unions by 37 percent
(up 1) and the government at 16 percent


worker numbers drop from
69,700 to 50,450 in the four
years since 1980.
The group’s steel centre
employees have been cut from
38,369 to 24,575. BHP’s chief
economist, John Brunner,
says that the resource con-
glomerate’s numbers will con-
tinue to decline but “not by
retrenchments all being
well.”
Brunner says: “The big
companies like us will not
provide the growth in employ-
ment. The increases will come
in the service industries and
the public sector. All the little
businesses around the place
will provide the jobs.” At a
Committee for the Economic
Development of Australia
luncheon recently, John
Niland, professor of
Economics in the field of in-
dustrial relations at the University of
New South Wales, said that the 1970 s
would be seen as the decade of female
participation in the workforce and the
1980 s would go down as the era of
growth in small business.
The federal Opposition pointed out
in shooting for the vote of the small
businessman during its election cam-
paign that, of around 750,000 enter-
prises in Australia, 99 percent employed
fewer than 100 people, 93 percent
employed fewer than 10 people and 82
percent fewer than five.
Almost 40 percent of private sector
employment is in businesses with be-
tween one and nine employees. Busi-
nesses with between one and 99
employees provide work for more than
60 percent of the private sector
workforce.
BMP’s John Brunner: the exchange rate is critical
DON McPHEDRAN
Among the large companies, service
industries are leading the way in cre-
ating jobs. The Myer Emporium Ltd’s
numbers, for instance, shot from 29,279
to 48,939 from 1980 to 1984 -
admittedly assisted by big acquisitions
on the way, including the takeover of
Grace Bros. Woolworths has been
steadier, with employment constant at
around 46,000 for the last three years
but only last week the retailer an-
nounced plans to open 54 stores
through to the end of 1985, providing
4200 extra jobs in a $93 million invest-
ment in equipment and stock.
The largest employer although not
the company with the largest payroll, as
only around half the stalf are classified
as full-time is G. J. Coles & Co Ltd. It
has seen a 30 percent lift in employment
over the four years. At the same time, its
profit has increased around 97
percent to $107.6 million. In
the table, the profit perform-
ance results are included to
show how most companies
have recovered in their final
figures and how earnings have
moved over the years from
1980. Inflation is not built into
the figures, which means any
mathematical correlation with
employment figures is hard to
make.
Another bright spot is
banking where Westpac and
the National Australia Bank
have added numbers. Both
banks are the result of
mergers in 1982 Westpac
arose from the CBA and Bank
of NSW and the National
Australia from the CBC and
National Bank.
Their performances over
the past couple of years have
been encouraging.
Westpac put on more than 500
people, taking its total to 35,022, in the
year to June and numbers had risen to
35,556 by the end of the September
quarter when the bank balances. The
jobs came across the board. Westpac’s
general manager, personnel, Col
Atfield, said that there would be con-
tinued growth in a local banking centre
approach. There were jobs in the
support of electrical banking projects,
in technical services and data process-
ing. If there was a negative for Westpac
it was that the bank “does not see any
growth in areas which don’t involve
customer interface, such as clerical
administration support.”
The National Australia has almost
equalled Westpac’s recent growth and
claims that recruitment levels are at
(down 5) is blamed by an equal number
as are employers at 16 percent (up 4).
Unemployment is now blamed on
people not wanting to work by 30
percent (up 2).
Each of the 1117 people aged 14 and
over interviewed throughout Australia
in early November was first asked
whether he or she expected the number
of unemployed to increase, fall or
remain the same in the next 12 months.

around 2500 to 3000 a year. These are
expected to continue through 1985.
In the Confederation of Australian
Industry’s latest Labor Market Trends
which looks at job prospects in industry
segments the category “Finance, Pro-
perty and Business Services” emerged
as a “great success story.” Some 65,000
jobs were added through the classifica-
tion from November 1981 to August
1984. The confederation’s figures are
seasonally adjusted Bureau of Statistics
numbers. The CAI also said that about
il 5,000 jobs were created in the
categories of public administration,
defence and community services from
February 1983 to the end of August last
quite a chunk of the 267,000 jobs the
Hawke government claimed to have
created in its first term.
The public sector and community
services have been the big job creators
over the past 12 months.
Unemployment, not a major talking
point in the election campaign, has
become institutionalised. Governments
can only chip away at it. October labor
force figures from the Bureau of
Statistics show 578,800 people (season-
ally adjusted, 617,300) are employed
against total employment of 6,655,600
(6,523,200). This means an unemploy-
ment rate the number of unemployed
as a percentage of the total of employed
and unemployed persons of 8.1 per-
cent.
In October 1983 the unemployed
stood at 653,100, compared with the
employed of 6,336,200 for an un-
employment rate of 9.3 percent. Ac-
cording to Brunner, “the exchange rate
is the critical factor as far as employ-
ment prospects are concerned. We have
to get the real effect of the exchange rate
down.”
He said import competition was
stifling producers. A floating dollar
provided little chance of bringing the
rate down artificially.
The concern of most companies in
manufacturing and resource is in
maintaining job levels. Building
supplier Monier Ltd was the most
positive, predicting “modest growth
prospects.” John Holland Holdings Ltd,
a civil and mechanical engineer
involved in just about all projects bar
residential work, has seen employee
numbers decline over the past two years
and sees the slide continuing. Holland’s
general manager Bryan Kelly said that,
while there had been a gradual decrease
in permanent staff, casual employees
had fallen significantly.
ANI Ltd, manufacturer and supplier
of steel, metals and rolling stock, says it
will see “a net loss of 300 to 400 more
people” in the current year. The decline
from 9200 to 8600 in June this year was
mainly accounted for by attrition
natural and otherwise at the Comeng
plant in Sydney. Managing director
Neil Jones said that attrition would
continue and jobs most likely to be
effected were in the administration
areas. Caught in the gloom of the heavy
manufacturing sector, Jones added: “I
wouldn’t give too much encouragement
to the future of the unemployed.”
MIM and CSR are reducing their
staffs. MIM has dropped 700 employees
since June, leaving it with 8000. In
July/August, MIM offered early retire-
ment to all employees over 55 years of
age in Brisbane, Townsville and Mount
Isa and so far has had acceptances from
about 470 people. The retirements com-
plement the MIM policy introduced
in February of not replacing
employees who leave the three centres.
There have also been retrenchments in
Brisbane and Townsville since June
about 100.
With the company suffering from
depressed copper and other metal
markets and low coal prices, its labor
force will continue to fall.
CSR also has the coal problem. In
the year to March last, the diversified
resource group retrenched 140 salaried
staff and 32 wage earners and re-
deployed 170 workers from the troubled
Blackwater mine in Queensland to other
mines. Jobs have fallen from March to
September from 14,327 to 13,500,
mainly due to divestment of the Thiess
Petrosea company employing some 700
people in Indonesia. The Mount
Gunson copper mine in South Australia
was closed in April, putting about 90
out of work. □

EMPLOYMENT
Accord ‘cloaks’
Hawke blame
for the jobless
Professor Corden: young people’s wages awards should be abolished
By DAVID BARNETT
IF JOHN STONE is correct, not only
could Bob Hawke do something about
youth unemployment but he also ought
to because he should take some
responsibility for its high level.
But, if he did so in the terms ad-
vocated by Stone it could well destroy
the prices and incomes accord.
The accord is the foundation of the
government’s economic strategy, which
has its goal at least in theory the
end of unemployment.
Stone was head of the Treasury when
the Hawke government won office. His
election-eve discovery that the Fraser
Liberal-National Party government’s
1982 budget was over-running badly
was the justification Hawke used to shed
1983 campaign promises.
Stone resigned from Treasury four
days before the second Hawke-Keating
budget was brought down this year, thus
dissociating himself from it.
Stone is now a visiting professor at
the Monash University Centre of Policy
Studies in Melbourne. He told the
Minerals and Energy Club in Brisbane
recently that the two great leaps in
unemployment from 1970 to 1980 came
in 1974-75 and in 1982.
On each occasion, the chief causes
were to be found in actions of the trade
union movement over whose policies
and destinies, Stone pointed out,
Hawke had presided in his previous
capacity as ACTU president.
Australia’s unemployment rate is 8.6
percent - some 617,000 people, of
whom 60,000 are teenagers. The adult
unemployment rate is 7 percent, that for
the 15- to 19-year olds 23 percent.
It would be higher but for the grow-
ing number of teenagers who are
staying on at educational institutions
for want of something better to do.
Stone says the price of labor and
particularly of youthful
labor is too high: People,
particularly the young, are
being priced out of jobs by
industrial tribunals under
the pressure of trade union
power.
Professor Max Corden
of the Australian National
University in Canberra,
who believes the wages
awards for young people
should be abolished, thinks
likewise. So, in a caut-
iously-worded report, does
the Bureau of Labor
Market Research which is
part of the federal Depart-
ment of Employment and
Industrial Relations.
Minister for Employment and Youth
Affairs in the Fraser government, Neil
Brown asked the bureau to carry out a
study into the relationship between
youth employment and youth wages.
That was ready in time for in-coming
Labor minister Ralph Willis.
The bureau identified a “compres-
sion” between teenage and adult wages
between 1972 and 1974 when rates for
young people, relative to adults’, rose by
Senator Ryan
8 percent. It was even steeper for the
youngest workers 14 percent in the
case of 17-year-olds, as against 5 per-
cent for 20-year-olds.
The process began with a federal
metal industry award. Such awards
were the precursors of the national wage
determination and the compression
flowed on to the rest of industry. As it
did so, the employment of young males
and even more of young females began
to fall.
The report was received by the next
government and by the trade union
movement like a bad smell.
Victorian state organiser of the
Amalgamated Metals and Shipwrights
Union, Jim O’Neill said that for high-
priced politicians to call for a reduction
in wage rates to solve youth unemploy-
ment was sheer hypocrisy.
In the metal trades, 16-year-olds
were paid $96 a week and 20-year-olds
paid $193.30, which he said was not
excessive considering that many per-
formed the work of adults.
Willis is concerned to deny any
suggestion that he has tried to bury the
bureau report but he does not accept its
arguments. Although the report found
an association between youth wages
and employment prospects, Willis said,
its extent was unknown and other
factors were involved.
Reducing youth wages is unaccept-
able to the trade union movement. That
would endanger the accord.
So, the government has commis-
sioned more reports.
Minister for Employment and Youth
Affairs Senator Susan
Ryan has asked the in-
ternational Organisation
for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development to
carry out an inquiry.
The OECD report is due
soon. It rejects wage reduc-
tion and reflects the
European view that the
way to deal with youth
employment problems is
through training and
support schemes.
Willis has commis-
sioned two reports. The bu-
reau has been put to work
on a national survey of the
problems of unemployed
youth. The exhaustive
survey will look at social, economic and
education backgrounds.
The Victorian chairman of the
Technical and Further Education
Council, Peter Kirby, is conducting
another inquiry into labor market
programs.
The bureau took time off from its
long-term study to make a submission
to the Kirby inquiry, saying it could find
little cause for optimism that current

wage-and education-based subsidy pro-
grams are making young people more
employable.
There are several of these. The
Hawke government continued all the
Fraser government schemes and in-
creased their funding. They cost $846
million a year, of which $lO9 million is
for the Special Youth Employment
Training Program and $26 million for
the Community Youth Support Scheme.
Opposition leader Andrew Peacock
has now taken on the entrenched
Australian industrial system, proposing
replacement of the Arbitration Com-
mission by a new tribunal which would
set minimum wages and an inquiry into
junior wage rates.
The policy which the Hawke govern-
ment finds feasible is the conservative
continuation of the present schemes,
brought up to date, improved and
revised as circumstances dictate.
Hawke did not refer to youth un-
employment in his campaign opening,
merely repeating his pledge to increase
employment.
But he is bothered. It is true, he said
during the campaign, that there is some
evidence of a possible link between the
pay of young people and unemploy-
ment. As with Willis, he quickly added
that the evidence suggested that the
problem was more complicated. Yet,
Hawke said, the government would be
prepared to look at it.
As Willis has said, the number of
full-time jobs for the less-skilled has
been declining. The principle of last
in/first out when times are tough works
against young people.
Willis concedes that the disparity has
grown over the years of the compression
effect.
Last year, when it was whipped up
during the election campaign as a rod
with which to beat the Fraser govern-
ment, polling showed unemployment to
be the major issue. It rated 79 percent
concern. Now, it is around 57 percent.
But people do not necessarily mean it
when they nominate unemployment as
the issue of their first concern.
Asked to nominate the issue which
they regard as possibly of most benefit
to themselves or their families, taxation
becomes the “pea.” Pensions follow.
Unemployment drops back to about 7
percent.
Stone says that the government has
traded off higher-than-necessary un-
employment caused by the 8.6 percent
rise in wages under the accord to buy
votes from those who are fortunate
enough to have jobs. The government,
he says, entered into its Faustian com-
pact with the trade union movement
because it lacked the courage and
leadership in the interests of un-
employed youth to tell its mates in the
ACTU where to get off. □

SECURITY
ASIS agents’
nervous wait on
police chief
By DAVID BARNETT
A DECISION which could mean life or
death for Australian secret agents
abroad has been passed to Victorian
Police Commissioner Mick Miller. He is
the only person in the force who knows
the names of the 11 Australian Secret
Intelligence Service (ASIS) agents who
mucked up their training exercise at
Melbourne’s Sheraton Hotel a year ago.
ASIS head James Furner passed the
names to Miller at the direction of
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden.
ASIS had fought vigorously against
having to disclose the identities of its
people to state authorities.
Victorian police apprehended five
agents at the time. Their names are
known to several members of the force.
The 11 others who got away began a
High Court action against Hayden who
wanted to hand on their names as well
to the Victorians.
Hayden is the minister responsible
for ASIS. Its headquarters are in his
department and agents may be posted
abroad as diplomats.
The 11 agents argued that they had
contracted with the commonwealth that
their identities remain a secret. They
lost their action. The court held six to
one that this was unenforceable at law
and that Hayden could disclose the
names.
But the seven justices gave him no
other comfort. Mr Justice Deane said he
thought considerations of public in-
terest should have weighed heavily with
Hayden. If it came to a question of
penalty for the offences allegedly com-
mitted by the trainee ASIS agent (who
broke down a door), the Victorian court
might consider that the major share of
the blame for a sorry mess lay with
those who gave instructions to decent
men in the name of their country.
Mr Justice Mason said the com-
monwealth had recruited men on the
grounds that their names would be kept
secret, instructed them to take part in
the exercise and then argued that it was
entitled to disclose their names while
itself remaining immune.
Mr Justice Murphy said common
sense would suggest exercising discre-
tion against revelation in the case of a
minor offence.
Deane also observed that some of the
material put before the court could not
be disclosed for exceptional and com-
pelling reasons of national security.


Hayden acknowledged this
when he spoke to reporters
after the court had found the
ASIS contracts to be un-
enforceable. The agents
themselves would not be in
danger but other people could
be placed in considerable
physical danger elsewhere in
the world.
Hayden subsequently said
that Australian agents could
be placed in considerable
physical danger in other parts
of the world if the identity of
one person were disclosed.
Conclusions could then be
drawn about the context of
that person on earlier occa-
sions.
Hayden refused to explain
further what he meant. How-
ever, sources with experience
in such work have been able
to furnish an explanation.
Disclosing the identity of any ASIS
agent who has served abroad is to
identify his predecessors and successors
in his cover capacity as likely also to be
ASIS agents. It also points the finger of
suspicion at the local contacts and
associates of those agents as persons
who might have been supplying in-
formation and assistance to a foreign
Police Commissioner Sinclair ( “Mick”) Miller
country Australia. This would explain
what Hayden meant by “drawing con-
clusions about the context.”
ASIS agents are posted abroad either
under diplomatic cover or under private
cover as, say, businessmen.
Agents posted as diplomats to
embassies may be “disclosed,” in
postings such as to Washington or
London where they would have
responsibility for liaison with the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency (CIA) or
British Intelligence, or they may be
“undisclosed” in countries with whom
Australia does not have an alliance or
with whom relations are cool.
If an undisclosed agent’s cover is
blown, he is declared persona non grata
and is asked to leave.
The undisclosed agent under private
cover whose identity is blown is in a
much more precarious position. De-
pending on the country, he may be the
person “in considerable physical
danger.”
ASIS enjoys a high reputation as an
effective intelligence organisation.

Mark Ella scores for Australia in the first Test against England at Twickenham
Courtesy RUGBY WEEKLY
for the Victorian socialist left as well as
an amusing story for the media.
Commissioner Miller is no stranger
to actions and exercises which go
wrong. The Victorian police receive
1400 or 1500 public complaints a year.
They deal with them by apology and
explanation, by payment of compensa-
tion and by disciplinary action against
members of the force.
Thus, when police hunting prison
escapees broke down the door of the
wrong house at Healesville at about the
same time as the Sheraton incident, a
senior officer was sent to re-assure the
householder and his distressed pregnant
wife.
The owners of the Sheraton and its
employees have received $365,400 in
compensation for the broken door and
the upset caused to them.
The hotel’s share was $259,000 and
boosted net profit for that half-year by
75 percent.
Premier John Cain has said firmly
that the decision on what charges are to
be brought against the 16 ASIS agents
whose identities are known to Miller is a
matter for the police.
Miller has been conferring with the
State Director of Public Prosecutions,
John Coldrey. No charges have been
laid yet.
Miller has a reputation as being an
outstanding police commissioner. A
decision which could lead to the deaths
of an unknown number of people ser-
ving Australia around the world is a
new challenge for him, although one
might have thought it more properly the
responsibility of a government.
Of course, the nature of spying is
such that if the names did get out and
result in “considerable physical danger”
we would be most unlikely ever to
hear about those who suffered the con-
sequences. □

Ella plans to
bow out with
the grand slam
AS THE Wallabies rugby union team
contemplates the chance of achieving an
unprecedented grand slam at the
weekend when it faces Scotland in the
last Test of the Australian tour of Britain
and Ireland, Mark Ella linchpin of the
side’s success has announced his retire-
ment from representative football. In this
exclusive interview with CHRIS
THOWSON, Ella (who scored tries in
each of the first three Tests against
England, Ireland and Wales) discloses
that this will be his swansong, that he will
continue to reject offers to play rugby
league and that he will concentrate on his
business career.
YOUR TALENT and expertise have been
widely admired and praised over here.
The London Observer described you as
“the detonator which explodes the brilli-
ance of Australian backs at critical
moments” and wondered how the
Wallabies would fare without you. Let’s
put it the other way around: What do you
reckon the “Ella factor” means to the
Wallabies? How do you assess your
contribution to this very sophisticated
rugby machine?
Looking at my game in relation to
the Australian team as a whole, I would
say I am the one who would give the
backs a bit of room to move. I firmly
believe that Australia’s backline is made
of seven talented players. Having all
this talent around, there is a need for a
spark to ignite it someone to give the
guys an opportunity to express their
talent. This is what I built my
reputation on during the last
five to six years. On the other
hand, I think of myself more
of a support player than a
creator. I create, as I said
earlier, in the sense that I give
the other players an op-
portunity to express them-
selves but basically I am a
support player. I believe that
the game of rugby football is
about continuity ... This is
what you may call, if you
wish, the “Ella factor” but I
am afraid there is nothing new
in it: It is one of the oldest and
most basic principles of
football.
Would you be able to make an
assessment of your main
strength and weaknesses as a
player?
My strength is based on my ability to
read the play and an instinct for open
space or for gaps, as they are called.
Taking opportunities in limited space
and under pressure is what makes a
good Test footballer. My main weak-
ness is the inability to kick well but that,
in a way, is a blessing in disguise since it
developed my running instincts.
Mentally, I am still OK but at the
moment I am jaded to a certain extent
after playing top-class rugby for about
six years.
I am not going out there on the field
with any pre-conceived ideas about the
way I am going to play the game. It
never works out. I play out of instinct
and that’s where I am more successful
than most. I am approaching the end of
my career and I am totally relaxed,
doing whichever comes naturally. If I
am uptight, things do not happen.
You expressed the view in an interview
that “British rugby seems to be stifled by
referees and safety-first attitudes” and
you have not spared the New Zealand AH
Blacks, either. You also seem to believe
that the future of the game is embodied in
the Australian approach in what you
called the “continuity game.”
The All Blacks’ and British type of
rugby football is based on a winning-at-
all-costs attitude. Hence a stereotype 10-
man rugby in which they will always try
to use the same set moves. We attempt
to be inventive whenever we can. We try
to open the game up, whereas the All
Blacks and the British try to keep it tight
all the time.
To be honest, I would say that we
lost several Test matches by taking risks
and trying to be inventive. Yet, this is
the Australian way of playing and we
would not change. We scored some
exciting tries and played a kind of
football which is entertaining to the

standard in Australian company cars that's never
existed before.
It's the best value , 6-c/linder company car in Australia.
It enhances a company's prestige. And it satisfies those
who drive it The Executive is the definition of what a
world class company car should be. It has power
steering and automatic transmission. The 3.3 litre ,
6-c/linder engine now has Electronic Spark Timing
which gives 15% better economy in city driving*And
for 27% more power* there's the option of Electronic

The driving environment has new levels of quietness ,
comfort and refinement. The seats are finely woven
cloth - the driver's is adjustable even for height.
There are electronic touch controls and electronic search
tuning for the AM/FM stereo radio. New panoramic
styling increases lightness and a sense of space.
Outwardly the Executive has an aura of style and
purpose which reflects well on both the company that
owns it and the person driving it. And it also offers the
best value for money in its class , either as a sedan or
wagon, plus Holden reliability and service.

our newest
ideas
aren't just
all talk.


A lot of our newest ideas are about data communication.
Because at our Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut, we’re
constantly improving the ITT System 12™ telephone exchanges for both

To improve telecommunications,we're
advancing technology in integrated circuits,
programming and artificial intelligence.
voice and data.
So computers can talk to
each other as easily as people
can.
It was at the ATC and other
labs around the world where
ITT engineers undertook a
$7OO million research and
development project to make
System 12 the only telephone
switching system with fully
distributed control.
Control is spread through-
out a system. Not locked up in
a central computer.
So a problem in one area
doesn’t become a problem
everywhere.
Thanks to its fully digital
integrated circuits and
modular architecture, System 12 can handle new features and added
traffic, including data, easily and economically.
Many of the integrated circuits System 12 uses were designed at the ATC.
But that was only the beginning.
Scientists are finding ways to pack more tiny circuits on microchips.
So more software can be programmed into less hardware.
Engineers are using computers to build new types of computers.
Which will speed up the process for designing the microchips that operate
System 12.
And computer scientists are advancing software technology and
artificial intelligence to make System 12 “smarter" to be more adaptable
in the future.
Now there are 19 countries that have ordered System 12. And with
these new ideas, System 12 will be able to serve them and other countries
well into the future.
Because every new idea helps the future get here a little sooner.
That’s something to talk about.

public. Unfortunately, sometimes we
had to come off second-best for that.
Let’s move to a chapter which stirred up a
great deal of controversy at the time:
your replacement as captain of the
Wallabies. You have been the favorite
player of former coach Bob Dwyer who,
after your replacement, was quoted as
saying: “There is no need to change the
captaincy, nor anything to be gained by
that. Mark has been a very successful
captain, both on and off the field ...”
How badly were you affected by that
decision? Do you still resent it?
At the time, I resented it. Initially, I
was pretty disappointed. I felt I had
done enough to warrant the captaincy
again. When one is the captain of the
national side it doesn’t matter what
sport it is and you are dropped from
the captaincy, your pride is bound to
suffer. Obviously, when there is a
change of coach and a general change
in rugby circles, these things happen. I
made some statements then that I wish I
had not made. With hindsight, the
hardest thing to overcome was my
pride.
I have to say that it was without
doubt the biggest disappointment of my
rugby life. When I was dropped from
captaincy, I was also under pressure for
my position. Michael Lynagh was
playing very good football at that stage.
I had to prove to myself probably not
to myself, since I always knew I had the
ability and that I can do it. My main
aim at that stage was to be able to play
well for Australia.
A lot of people helped me through.
Bobby Dwyer, my family, my fiancee
and her family helped me a great deal.
Without their continuing encourage-
ment, I would have lost heart and failed.
Now, I forget all about that and get on
with the job. I am now 100 percent
behind (tour captain) Andrew Slack.
You had a stormy relationship with the
coach, Alan Jones, during the early
stages in particular. What was the evolu-
tion of your relations?
The beginning was a bit difficult and
my reaction was probably exaggerated
at the time. As it turned out, we have a
job to do. Alan is coaching the Aus-
tralian side. So we have to keep things
moving on. Irrespective of what one
feels or thinks about anybody, I am here
to make sure that if I play for Australia
I am doing my best. We are here to win.
We are playing for our country and
that’s it. Personal feelings are put aside.
Alan’s attitude toward this tour is very
down-to-earth and I am right behind
him and Andrew in our attempt to win
all four Tests. Now it is more than just a
working relationship.
This tour could be a watershed in your
career. If Australia wins all four in-
ternationals, there would be little else for
you to achieve in rugby union. Would you
join one of the rugby league clubs who
have been trying to sign you on?
I have passed the stage where I was
thinking about rugby league. I had
several offers (to turn professional)
during the past two to three years and I
rejected them, although they were pretty
good financially. There is no reason to
go back on that. Of course, the material
incentive is important but there is more
in a game than just money. I have
enjoyed myself playing rugby union
during the past 10 years and I guess that
rugby union is the last competitive sport
of my sport career. I intend to con-
centrate on my profession.
I have a secure job with Rothmans in
Australia and I intend to build my
future with them. At the end of this tour,
I will spend three months in Britain for
my company. I have been approached
by several clubs but, to tell you the
truth, I don’t really know if I am going
to play rugby or not.
You have mentioned feeling jaded. Is this
going to be your last tour?
This is definitely my last tour. Not
only that but I have also decided to
retire from representative rugby at the
end of the tour ...
This tour is my swansong. It would
be nice to retire with the grand slam
under my arm. □
Bringing back the crowds
MARK ELLA s career in rugby union
parallels a renaissance of the sport in
Australia. Mark and his two brothers,
twin Glen and Gary who is a year
younger at 24, have largely been
responsible for bringing crowds back to
the sport through their pursuit of
“anything can happen” 15-man rugby.
The flair with which the Wallabies
have disposed of Ireland, England and
Wales is causing a re-examination of the
military style of British rugby where
often the backline is forgotten when
win at all costs tactics ensure that the
half-back and five-eighth (the fly halves)
and eight-man forward pack hog the
ball in what is called 10-man rugby.
Ella has shown on all levels that
anything is possible on a football field.
No one has a better set of hands,
shown emphatically when he took a
desperate clearing pass from Wallaby
ullback Roger Gould in the test against
the English and in one movement
transported the ball along the backline
to ensure a try eventually scored by
breakaway Simon Poidevin. Ella
(despite his perceived kicking weak-
ness) can pot field goals with either boot
when unsighted of the posts and off
balance. He is also uncannily fast off the
mark. His apparently lazy movements
and laid-back manner mesmerise op-
ponents.
Mark Ella was born and raised in La
Perouse, a Sydney suburb that stretches
into Botany Bay. He is one of 12
Aboriginal children of May and Gor-
don Ella. All three brothers showed
promise at an early age. At Matraville
High School, the brothers inspired the
senior rugby team to 228 tries and 1192
points in 24 games in 1977. At the end
of that year, all three were chosen in the
Australian schoolboys team to tour the
British Isles. The Ellas were the stars
and the team scored 110 tries in 16
matches, trouncing all that their hosts
could offer and capping the tour with a
25-6 defeat of Wales at the hallowed
Cardiff Arms Park. All three tries were
scored by Ellas.
As Mark was gradually showing
himself to be the outstanding performer
of the trio although he would never
have that said the brothers signed up
with Sydney’s Randwick club, known as
the Galloping Greens. The Ellas per-
fectly complemented Randwick’s run-
ning philosophy.
With Mark directing proceedings
from five-eighth, Randwick strung
together a record five successive pre-
mierships in the tough Sydney, comp-
etition.
From the Randwick springboard,
Mark represented and captained
Sydney and New South Wales and
ultimately Australia. A personal
highlight was being chosen with Glen
and Gary for the seventh Wallabies who
toured the British Isles in 1981-82.
Mark Ella’s admirers will be hoping
that he re-thinks his retirement decision.
There is hope. Ella, as he does on the
field, will no doubt leave his options
open. □

TRADE
Japanese tell us
how to crack
their market
Prime Ministers Hawke and Nakasone: a new spirit of co-operation
UPI
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
A UNIQUE TRADE mission visited
Australia’s cities last week. Thirty
Japanese business leaders were here to
teach us how to sell our products to
Japan. The mission did not even try to
sell its know-how: it offered to give it
away.
Although it was lost in the flim-flam
of Bob Hawke’s re-election campaign,
the initiative may well be remembered
as one of the most important results of
his periods in office. At stake could be
the future of our industry.
Heading the team was Isao
Yonekura, president of C. Itoh and Co
Ltd, the big Japanese trading house. His
deputy was Shiro Miyamoto, executive
vice-president of the Japan External
Trade Organisation (JETRO). Both are
top names in Japan.
The mission was divided into groups
of interest, each headed by an important
Japanese businessman. The A group,
which covered industrial manufactures
and resources, was led by Yutaka
Kume, the executive vice-president of
the Nissan Motor Co and chairman of
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers’
Association.
The B group, which looked at
Australian consumer goods, from food
to hardware, was led by Shigeyuki
Tanishima, executive managing director
of the Seibu chain store, merchandising,
real estate and tourism group.
C group, business and services, was
headed by Akira Soejima. Soejima is
head of the Industrial Bank of Japan,
one of the country’s biggest and oldest
(and, incidentally a front-running ap-
plicant for an Australian banking
licence). Like several members of the
mission, Soejima has had Australian
experience, as head of the bank’s
Sydney office and a participant in
financing resource projects.
The mission’s aim is to advise
Australian companies on the types of
goods and services that can be sold to
Japan and how to go about it. Behind
the visit lies growing concern in Can-
berra about the future of the Japan-
Australia relationship.
The original trade partnership,
launched by Sir John McEwen more
than 20 years ago, envisaged Australia
as a permanent supplier of resources to
steadily expanding Japanese industry.
Ten years ago, when oil price rises
curbed world economic activity, it
became accepted wisdom in Australia
that the fall-off in sales of such resources
as iron ore and alumina, because of
reduced economic activity, would be
replaced by energy sources, particularly
coal.
Last month’s coal-sales negotiations
between Australia and Japan, at which
Australian suppliers accepted lower
prices and amounts, emphasised that
this concept had dated and Australia’s
overwhelming trade surplus with Japan
was in decline.
The Japanese have restructured their
industry, closing large segments of it
and introducing efficiencies to make
products “thinner, smaller and lighter”,
requiring less energy and fewer raw
materials. There has also been a change
of direction, for instance into
electronics, that require much less in
imported materials than the traditional
metal-eaters such as cars.
Energy-saving measures have trim-
med usage and nuclear power has
reduced the demand for coal.
Australia’s trade surplus with Japan,
which once ran at $6 billion a year, is
now down to less than $2 billion and
dwindling. Soon, like most other
countries, we might buy more from
Japan than we sell. This is the problem
Canberra addressed in 1982-3.
The answer obviously was to sell
more to Japan, which is the world’s
second biggest national market and
relatively advantageously placed for
Australian exporters. The problem was
how to identify the products that were
marketable and how to distribute them.
The Department of Trade was able
to bring more than an academic expert-
ise to this issue when John Menadue, a
former ambassador to Japan, took over
as secretary. Then Trade minister Lionel
Bowen, with his prestige as deputy
prime minister, carried the issue to
Tokyo as one of his first priorities.
But the launching pad for last week’s
mission was Prime Minister Bob
Hawke’s visit to Tokyo this year. Hawke
hit it off with Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and caught the imagination
of the Japanese.
As Australian trade officials saw it,
Japan was beleaguered by protectionist
assaults from the European Economic
Community and the United States, with
both of which it was in substantial
surplus. The strident calls for bans
against Japanese products worried the
Japanese.
Against this background, Australia
came along with a similar problem
looming in a few years but prepared to
do something about it.
The constructive approach, as it was
seen in Kasumigaseki the government
enclave of Tokyo which houses major
departments - offered a chance for co-
operation in trade. The Japanese talk a
lot about establishing relations and
seeking friendships between people,
and for many westerners it sounds like
waffle. But the Japanese are serious.
In the Japanese view, understanding
precedes friendship which incurs
mutual obligations which in turn con-
structs a framework in which business is
conducted.
Hawke was beautifully poised, with a
Nakasone visit to Australia next year, to
set in motion the wheels which rolled
out last week’s Market Access Promo-
tion mission.
The mission held sessions in Can-
berra, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney
and Brisbane. After general briefings,
the specialised groups held seminars
with business people.
If the Sydney operation, involving
the major convention floor of the


Sheraton Wentworth with a spill over to
a function floor, was any guide, the
approach was successful.
Participants were advised to practise
what Yonekura, an artist at commercial
diplomacy, described as “the three Ps.”
He advocated persistence, performance
and price.
Exporters wanting to penetrate the
Japanese market, he said, had to take a
long-term view for success. They had to
study the market, adapt products to its
requirements and establish an efficient
form of distribution, as well as after-
sales service. They had to be reliable in
supply and quality, and the price had to
be right.
Tanishima called on exporters to
Japan not only to get to know the
market but to establish personal
relationships with customers or part-
ners.
He said: “Whatever the product, the
best approach is good quality at a low
price. The Japanese market is quite
nervous and needs an identity for a
product. Australia has aimed its con-
sumer products for Asia at English-
speaking areas such as Singapore or
Hong Kong. For Japan you must set
your sights on the Japanese market.”
Soejima spoke of the growing im-
portance of tourism. At present some
80,000 Japanese a year visit Australia.
He said Japanese experience indicated
that once a level of 50,000 visitors a year
to a destination was reached, the market
blossomed quickly. He advocated more
and cheaper flights between Japan and
Australia as well as packages designeed
to get the Japanese to move around
Australia more easily. He said visitor
numbers usually moved quickly from
50,000 to 150,000 a year and Australia
should be prepared.
Yonekura later called a press confer-
ence to outline the preliminary
recommendations the mission would
make. He said Japanese government
agencies such as JETRO and MIPRO
(the associated Manufactured Imports
Promotion Organisation) would offer
Australia an export booster the
Specific Products Trade Expansion Pro-
gram.
The first of two stages would look at
various products and recommend mod-
ifications or improvements for the
Japanese market. The second stage
would include market research and
analysis by Japanese government-
sponsored researchers to launch one or
two of these products as a test case.
(Conventionally, a trade mission looks
at ways the originating country can sell
more to the host country. Here we had a
group offering to spend their taxpayers’
money on looking at a way they could
buy more from us!)
Yonekura said Japan also would
sponsor young businessmen to visit his
country in 1985 and 1986 to establish
contacts with industry and business and
also send Japanese packaging experts
and merchandisers to Australia.
Japan would also provide pro-
motional space for exhibitions of
Australian products and include
Australia in the judging for the Japan
Good Design Award.
After that, Canberra officials said last
week, it was up to Australia. Exporters
would have to take advantage of the
officially opened doors and do the hard
work of getting more Australian pro-
ducts into the marketplace.
Trade officials regard it as essentially
a long-haul program that may not
return benefits for many years. But
when Australia does crack the Japanese
market, it will be a catalyst to profound
changes in the Australian industrial
structure.
Certainly with both Hawke and
Nakasone behind the program and the
support of some of the top people in
Japanese industry and business, it is
unlikely to fizzle out in the short term.
“We and the Japanese see it as a
program for a long haul,” one senior
trade official said.
“It’s not a oncer or something like a
clash of cymbals and a bang of drums,
then everybody goes back to sleep.
“We’re doing even more than trying
to plant some seeds. First we’re identify-
ing the seeds to plant and then we plan
to put in a major and concentrated
effort over a period of years.” □

UNIVERSITIES
Student brawl
likely over
AUS carcass
By TONY ABBOTT
UNIVERSITY STUDENT leaders will
meet in Melbourne soon to wind up the
moribund Australian Union of
Students. The dissolution of the union
will be followed by a “national student
summit” to consider plans for a new
national student body.
The first meeting, to be held on
December 10, will deliver the coup de
grace to an organisation which has been
ailing for years. Ironically, the wind-up
meeting has been called by union pre-
sident Michael O’Connor.
The summit, to be held in Sydney
from December 16 to 20, is certain to
witness the kind of factional brawling
which has marred the union since the
mid-19705. Whether a replacement
body will emerge is problematical.
At the height of its power in 1977
the union had 250,000 members, a
budget of more than $650,000 a year
and at least 12 full-time officers. But the
seeds of the union’s self-destruction lay
in its very strength. It had degenerated
from a body concerned largely with
education issues and the provision of
services (including cheap travel) to
students and was channelling large
sums of money to left-wing political
causes. Once it had been a bi-partisan
training ground for future Liberal and

union organisers and ALP ministerial
staff members.
However, by 1980, its travel com-
pany, AUS Student Travel, had col-
lapsed, several big campuses had
seceded and Liberal government legis-
lation aimed at making membership of
student unions voluntary had brought it
to the verge of ruin.
AUS officers tried to improve the
student union’s image. Rumors of re-
introduced tuition fees provided a
temporary rallying point but the union’s
inability to refrain from adopting con-
troversial and extreme positions con-
tinued to alienate ordinary students;
1983, for instance, was declared “In-
ternational Year of the Lesbian”.
Earlier this year, in a renewed bout
of faction fighting, the three executive
members were sacked for encouraging
campuses to secede, while the Univers-
ity of Western Australia and the Uni-
versity of Adelaide withdrew.
O’Connor, who had led the defence
of a radical, politically active union,
suddenly changed tack in June and
called for its replacement with a new
national student organisation. Explain-
ing his dramatic change of heart,
O’Connor said his support for a
national student union had not changed
but that the disintegration of AUS
meant that there was “nothing left to
reform.”
Having tried to protect the AUS,
O’Connor is now hastening its demise.
The AUS constitution has no winding
up provision so a special council has
been called to amend the constitution
and wind-up the union. To ensure this
goes smoothly, O’Connor has switched
the special council from Sydney to
Melbourne where less disruption is ex-
pected.
In student politics, major factions
are often dominated by groups which
are little known or understood outside

the universities. As well as ALP and
Liberal factions, there are groups as-
sociated with the various communist
parties and also their bitter foe, the
National Civic Council.
The multiplicity of factions,
Byzantine conspiracy and tortuous
ideological shifts make student politics
particularly impenetrable. However,
politics is played with considerable
sophistication and attention to hard
ideological issues that parliamentary
leaders mostly prefer to ignore.
Among the 80 percent of students
who never vote in student elections it is
common to hear student activists dis-
missed as extremists or poseurs. How-
ever, O’Connor says involvement in
student politics teaches that “dem-
ocracy is not a waste of time.”
On the other side of the fence,
Thomas Bradley, one of the sacked
AUS executive members, says that
political involvement is “part of one’s
education.” He says ideologies are
formulated at university and “lesbian
posters on the wall have an impact.”
Whatever happens to AUS, student
politicians muster considerable clout.
The student council at a large
metropolitan campus will typically have
a yearly budget of more than $250,000,
while student politics remains a step-
ping stone to party or union politics.
Four major factions dominate
campus politics.
The Council of ALP Students
(CALPS) controls the remnants of AUS.
Some years ago, ALP students were split
between a right-wing group highly criti-
cal of AUS, known as Centre-Unity,
and left-wing elements aligned with
communist groups in a
faction known as the Broad
Left. However, most of the far
left radicals formed a new
faction known as the Left
Alliance and a weakened
Centre-Unity now makes
common cause with the Labor
left within CALPS.
Some indication of the
priorities of CALPS is given
by O’Connor’s statement that
peace, jobs, equality and the
chance to have an education
are the “major issues.”
The Left Alliance would
like AUS to have detailed
policy on almost every world
trouble spot as it did in its
heyday. Because student
politics is activist politics,
with a great deal of influence
accorded to self-appointed
collectives, it has a dis-
proportionate influence.
The Australian Liberal
Students’ Federation has shed
the cocktail party image as-
sociated with the Young Lib-
erals. A few years ago, campus Liberal
Clubs took no interest in student
politics or tended to adopt left-liberal
positions. Since 1977, the federation has
been a highly effective opponent of the
AUS and has approached political
issues with a tough-minded realism that
has occasionally dismayed Liberal
Party leaders.
The final major faction is commonly
labelled the Moderate Student Alliance
and is centred on the campus
Democratic clubs which are supported
by the Bob Santamaria’s National Civic
Council. Both the Liberals and the
Democrats say that the problem in
student politics is that only the zealots
are sufficiently interested to participate.
But, while Liberals tend to push
voluntary unionism as a remedy, the

Democrats have tended to support
measures which strictly limit the activi-
ties of student organisations and closely
tie them to the views of their
membership.
Their leading light, Thomas Bradley,
says that he would like to see student
organisations that are “more co-
operative than adversarial.” The per-
sistence of the Democrats is all the more
remarkable because their activists do
not have the lure of ministerial jobs or
party pre-selection for safe seats.
During the past month many cam-
puses have been voting for delegates to
the meeting in Sydney billed as the
“National Student Summit” and also on
the proposals for a new organisation
which have been put forward by the
factions.
CALPS proposes a strong national
union primarily involved in education
but also in feminist and international
issues.
But Bradley says that this would be a
“scrubbed-up AUS” with a budget of
more than $1.6 million and the
Democrats advocate a union with hon-
orary officials and policy and funding
decisions to be taken at campus level.
Somewhere between the two, the Left
Alliance supports a strong union but
wants policy to be formulated by grass-
roots groups on campus. The Liberals
have made no specific proposals and are
calling for more consultation with
students. Mud-slinging is already well
underway.
CALPS has dominated the summit
organising committee and Sydney Uni-
versity SRC president Mark Heyward
says preparations for the summit have
been a “complete farce.” First the com-
mittee incorrectly claimed that the
Australian Electoral Commission
would be involved in the preparation of
the summit. Now, the committee is
threatening not to recognise delegates
from campuses which have not put the
proposals of the various factions to a
student vote.
O’Connor says campus bodies which
do not consult the students have no
automatic right to be consulted over the
national student organisation. But
O’Connor’s opponents point out that
the disenfranchised campuses will be
those where CALPS lacks a majority
and add that a student summit makes
little sense without big campuses.
Voting for summit delegates has
attracted the usual 10-20 percent
campus turn-out. While voters have
favored CALPS’s proposals, it is un-
likely that CALPS will have a majority
of delegates.
Nevertheless, O’Connor seems confi-
dent that the CALPS proposals will be
adopted substantially. But others think
that the summit will degenerate into the
usual inconclusive factional brawl. □

Pat Cash: the money comes second
Victorian teenage tennis star Patrick Cash is at the threshold of earning a fortune on
the world circuit. But as LENORE NICKLIN reports, he is a sportsman whose
competitive urge makes winning more important than the money.
TENNIS COACH lan Barclay was
demonstrating the finer points of the
cross-court volley to a group of
Melbourne matrons when a small blond
boy poked his head through the bushes
beside the court and inquired: “How
long before you are finished with the
ladies, Mr B.?” Young Patrick Cash was
wagging it from school again.
Patrick Cash’s schooldays were only
marginally happier than Tom Brown’s
although they were rescued by
football at which he was a star, and
tennis, at which he was a champion.
He was only 13 when he won his first
Australian age group title. He was only
15 when he quit school with both
sides saying “Good riddance.”
“No, he wasn’t expelled,” says the
ever-protective Pat Cash, Snr, “but
there were, er, problems.” (Three of the
things Patrick Cash has in common with
John McEnroe are a father who is a
lawyer, who manages his career and
who has the same name.)
Looking back, Cash, Snr thinks it
would have been better if his son had
attended a school where there was
greater appreciation of outstanding
sporting ability. As it was, detention
and truancy became something of a way
of life for Cash, Jnr.
There was the occasion he took a
swing at one of his teachers an event
never known to improve teacher-
pupil relationships. Nineteen-year-old
Patrick Cash, still seethes with unforgiv-
ing anger at the things his teachers said
to him.
“One of them said to me, ‘You won’t
be good at tennis, you won’t be good at
anything, you’ll be a bum, you’re just
useless’,” he says. “If I get up to the
million-dollar prizemoney mark I will
send him a letter and say, ‘Well, there
you go mate you said I’d be a bum
and in my first year out of school I made
three times as much money as you’.”
Cash is in a business where success is
judged by dollars and the computer.
The dollars interest him surprisingly
little. What is left after the high living
expenses of the tennis circuit the
$lOOO-a-week hotel bills, air tickets,
telephone bills is handed over to his
father to invest. He lives in jeans and T-
shirts he doesn’t have to pay for, uses
sporting equipment he doesn’t have to
ROGER GOULD
Pat Cash displays his style: a trifle too wristy for the purists


pay for, and his only extravagance is his
record collection.
The computer is his real concern. It
rules his life, pronounces judgment on
him once a week.
This week it tells him he is number 10
in the world. Maybe, if he wins a major
tournament such as the Australian
Open the computer will place him at
number four or five. If he plays badly, if
he pulls a leg muscle and misses out on
a few tournaments, he can slip quickly
and easily back to the 20s and 30s.
Since the US Open in September, he
has been rated in the top 10, and as with
old-fashioned hit-parades, it is the top
10 that really counts. These are the
players who, apart from spectacular
tournament winnings, can command
millions of dollars in endorsement fees
With Pat, Snr: “I could see he was going to be a super athlete”
BRIAN FERGUSON
and big money for exhibition matches.
Cash is on the threshold of the really
big money. Last year his winnings came
to $90,000. This year they will reach
$200,000. (Ivan Lendl, whom he came
so close to beating in this year’s US
Open, has earned $632,000 so far this
year $1.7 million last year. Mats
Wilander, beaten by Cash both at
Wimbledon and the US Open, has
earned $291,997; $l.l million last year.
Bjorn Borg, the most superbly marketed
of all tennis players, was a $3 million-a-
year man who received $500,000 a year
for wearing Lila sports clothes, $600,000
a year for using Donnay racquets and
$220,000 a year for wearing Diadora
tennis shoes.)
Cash has just finalised negotiations
with Prince to use their wood-composite
mid-size racquet (he previously used a
wood-composite Slazenger). He has
also signed a contract with Nabisco Pty
Ltd he will wear their patch on his
sleeve and appear in Vita Brits com-
mercials. He already has contracts with
Tachini sportswear and Diadora tennis
shoes.
“I’ve knocked back quick bucks,”
says Cash, Snr. “I’m a lawyer, not a
marketing man but I’ve got enough
common sense to knock back the things
that are not good for him. We haven’t
chased the money because we were
more concerned about looking after his
career, but from now on the financial
possibilities are great.”
Cash, Snr played VLL football for
Hawthorn between 1951 and 1955 and
runs a small law practice in suburban
Lootscray. Now his son has become his
most important client.
Cash, Snr used to chain-smoke cigars
but Patrick objected so much that he
now chews gum. During tournaments
he’s a four-packets-a-day man. He is big
and slightly overweight with beetling
eyebrows, a forehead creased with deep
worry lines and long, unlawyerlike hair
that curls over his shirt collar.
One of his jobs is protecting Patrick
from the media, which from the Cash
side of the court is perceived to be
unfriendly. Added to which, if Patrick
has tonsillitis (which he had two weeks
ago) or changes his serve yet again,
Cash, Snr would prefer not to have
everyone know about it.
“He’s been treated badly by some of
the press and maybe we’re a bit sensitive
about it,” he said in Canberra during
the international tennis challenge which
was a warm-up for the Australian Open
now being played at Kooyong. “But the
pressure placed on that boy is almost
overwhelming. The expectations placed
in him to perform extremely well are
unreal. He’s a bit fiery, I’ll admit, but
that’s why he’s such a good competitor.”
Coach Barclay, who spent 15 weeks
overseas with Cash this year, is also
quick to defend the champion. Barclay,
a small neat, mild-mannered man with
grey hair and a moustache, is a total
contrast to his star player.
“It’s no good me or his father
suppressing his natural instincts,” he
says. “If you do you are going to
interfere with his amazing competitive
spirit. He has a form of competitive
spirit that refuses to allow anything to
stand between himself and success.”
Cash’s competitive spirit first sur-
laced when he was about seven. “I
could see he was going to be a super
athlete he was so outstanding,” says
his father. “Some people thought I was
getting a bit carried away but I’ve been
proved right. And if it hadn’t been
tennis that he excelled at, it would have
been something else.”
Cash’s younger sister Renee and
brother Daniel, both excellent tennis
players, quickly learnt that it was smart
not to beat Patrick at anything. He cared
about winning too much.
By the time he was 15 he had twice
toured Europe, won the Victorian
Hardcourt Championship and left
home to be coached at the Australian
Institute of Sport in Canberra. At 16, he
was ranked the number one junior in
the world; at 17 he won the Victorian
Open the youngest player to win a
Grand Prix tournament and at 18 he
became the youngest Australian to play
in a Davis Cup final clinching victory
for Australia with a splendid win over
Sweden’s Joachim Nystrom.
“His father brought him to me when
he was 12 and even at that age he meant
business,” says Barclay. “He wanted to
be a champion and he wanted to be a
champion in a week. He was not going
to be just a player, he was going to be a
competitor.
“As a coach I might have 200 come
to me and out of that number 20 are
going to become very, very good tennis
players but only one is going to be a
competitor. Patrick was also a per-
fectionist, he wanted everything to be
right and he was prepared to put in the
work. What more could a coach ask for
- a superb athlete, a fantastic com-
petitor and a perfectionist?
“There was no way anyone could
keep him at school. Certainly it was
difficult for me on the one hand I
wanted to discourage him from missing
classes but I also realised I had to help
him fulfill his dreams.
“Our relationship is a most unusual


With coach Ian Barclay: at 12, “he meant business”
BRIAN FERGUSON
one. I probably see more of him than his
father. As a coach you have to be
mother, father, psychiatrist. We have
had to live our lives out of each other’s
pockets since he was a little boy. We’ve
never had a cross word.
“Beneath that gruff exterior he really
does possess a heart of gold some-
thing the tennis public doesn’t see.
When he was a wee fellow he had two
close tennis mates and if he ever had
any money his uncle might have given
him $lO he would always share it. If
he bought a chocolate bar he would
always split it. He was possibly the most
unselfish kid I’ve struck in my career
and he hasn’t changed although he’s
now number 10 in the world and a
wealthy man.
“I’m one of the few people who sees
all the nice things about Cash the
generosity, the softness and they
outweigh the short fuse and the out-
bursts. He’s still only a teenager.”
Cash’s short fuse and tennis
tantrums earned him $3OOO in fines last
year. He also became the first leading
Australian to be disqualified in a
tournament for poor court demeanour.
This year he has kept his temper under
better control. When he threw his
racquet into the stand at the end of the
US semi-final, the Australian coach Ray
Ruffels said: “At least he didn’t do it till
the end: that’s an improvement on last
year.”
Barclay says: “His maturity rate in
the last six months has been fantastic
he’s really grown up.”
There are lapses. At a charity match
on the Gold Coast last month, he
walked off in the first set of the final
after slipping for the second time and
badly grazing his knee. He was down 4-
5 at the time. The crowd was angry and
so was Cash. He’d donated his earnings
to the charity. Why should he risk
further injury before something as im-
portant as the Australian Open?
“I’M PRACTISING all the time and
I’m getting better pretty quickly”.
Patrick Cash is not talking about his
serve or his overhead' smash which is
already probably the best in the world
or his powerful athletic volley. He is
talking about his original 1963 Gibson
Melody Maker guitar which Mick Cox,
formerly of Rose Tattoo and now of
The Headhunters, is teaching him to
play. In return Cash is giving Cox
tennis lessons.
Cash has been learning the guitar for
seven months and the other week he
played with the Headhunters a
rhythm and blues band at a hotel in
Bondi. “It’s the best feeling I’ve had in
my life,” said Cash, who has had his
share of spectacular highs. “Every
tennis player wants to be a rock
musician.”
Patrick Cash already looks like a
rock musician in blue jeans that he has
sprinkled with chlorine to give a
mottled appearance and a bright pink
Twisted Sister T-shirt. Twisted Sister is
one of his beloved hard rock bands “I
must have 300 records of heavy metal
bands that nobody’s heard of.”
The rock T-shirts and the Japanese-
looking tied headbands that his mother
sews out of towelling for him, have
become part of his image. On court he
sweats profusely and changes shirts
constantly. His sweat bands are twice as
wide as those of anyone else. He is
forever using his forefinger to wipe the
sweat from under his eyes and the back
of his wrist to wipe his forehead. It’s a
wonder Rexona hasn’t signed him up.
He is taller than expected. On court,
the footballer’s build and the Dean
Lukin thighs suggest chunkiness, but he
is over 6 ft (185 cm) tall. (“Still a
growing boy,” said Cash, Snr when he
noted that the official program had
given his height as a mere 180 cm.)
Like rock musicians, Cash isn’t at his
best in the early morning. His manner is
gruff, his eyes are curiously ex-
pressionless. The previous night he had
beaten the fast-serving South African
Kevin Curren at the National Indoor
Sports centre at Canberra and on the
trip back to the hotel, he and his
doubles and practice partner, Paul
McNamee, had been buzzed by a white
mini containing two young and at-
tractive occupants. (The tournament
program curiously had revealed that
McNamee once said to Cash that the
girls under 23 were Patrick’s, the ones
over 26 were NcNamee’s and the ones
in the middle they fought over.)
As with his guitar playing, Cash has
been well pleased with his tennis pro-
gress. He no longer sets goals for
himself. “This year I thought it would
be good to be in the top 30. When I was
21 I thought I’d like to be in the top 10.
It’s happened very quickly. Obviously I
want to be number one.”
He plans to get there despite the
pressure, the knockers, and the people
who keep saying he can’t get any
further. Or perhaps because of them.
He says, “I don’t think there is any


other sport with the same pressure as
tennis. There’s contract pressure, com-
petition pressure and press pressure and
pressure from Australia and pressure
from tournaments where they expect
you to do well.
“It just doesn’t stop. And there are so
many knockers too many to count.
It’s funny about Australia, I can’t work
it out. Everywhere else in the world they
are pushing their own and whether they
win or lose there’s great support for
their efforts. But you come home to
Australia and they rubbish you.
“You put an 18-year-old kid out on
the circuit and give him stick for 12
months well, I’m determined to prove
a lot of people wrong, I’m determined
to do it for me and my friends and fans
and family who have supported me.
“I’m not saying I didn’t deserve
some of the stick. But people are start-
ing to realise I’m me and that’s all there
is about it. It annoys me that other
players do things worse than me, but I
get the bad publicity.”
Not surprisingly, the player he has
greatest respect for is John McEnroe
“I relate to him, to the pressure he is
under, to the bad publicity and the way
he has come through.” Cash had not
seen on television McEnroe’s bottle and
cup smashing spree during the
Stockholm Open which had earned him
his current suspension. “But what can
you say?” he said. “You can’t knock the
guy he’s number one in the world.”
Cash practises as much as six hours a
day and Barclay on occasions has to
pull him off he court. His gutsy, high-
leaping, athletic play the delight of
spectators sometimes earns criticism
from the experts who regard his stroke-
play as too wristy and prone to error
and who feel he should aim at the more
fluent, economical style of McEnroe.
Already, however, there is more finesse,
less reliance on brute force and an
increasingly intelligent use of touch
shots.
“I’ve still got a lot to work on,” says
Cash. “My serve can get better, my
forehand can get better. Everything can
get better. I’m not one of the fittest
players on the circuit although I’m one
of the strongest.
“Getting yourself playing better is
really about knowing yourself.
McEnroe gets upset and plays better.
Borg doesn’t do a thing and plays
better. You have to learn how to play
better whether you need a bad line
call to get yourself steamed up or what.
You’ve got to be natural, you’ve got to
try to be yourself. I’ve got a naturally
quick temper but that’s my com-
petitiveness shining through.”
Asked if he had any regrets about
leaving school so early he said, “No. I
try not to do things I don’t want to do
you always regret it.” □

LIFESTYLE
Anatomy of a rural commune
University researchers have analysed Australian rural communities and come
up with some thought-provoking information on “alternative lifestyles and their
practitioners. ”BRUCE JUDDERYexamines the situation.
THE PEOPLE who live in
Australia’s rural communes
are really not so very different
from the rest of the commun-
ity. Oh, they are much better
educated and probably better
able to find work in the “con-
ventional” economy. They in-
clude very few youngsters in
the jobless 16 to 19 years age
group. And they are much
more dependent on social
welfare payments for their
money needs 46 percent of
the total.
They live, mostly, in family
groups typical of the
Australian experience
mum, dad, one or two kids,
perhaps another adult, but a
perfectly recognisable family
group, rather than the hippie
stereotype. And, like the rest
of Australia, they are heavily
into home ownership (al-
though the house itself is
likely to have cost less than
$lO,OOO and be built of mud
bricks or bush timber).
If the experience of a score
of New South Wales “rural
land sharing communities”
described in statistical detail
by a team of Australian
National University scholars for the
Bureau of Labor Market Research is to
be heeded, they offer little prospect of
providing the “supply-side strategy” for
the reduction of unemployment ad-
vocated by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
Their experience may even raise again
the “dole-bludger” rhetoric of the 19705,
as the degree to which many of these
residents of rural communes have vol-
untarily withdrawn from a conventional
economy in which they are well able to
find work to subsidise their other
pursuits (including full-time work in the
“informal” or non-monetary economy)
is recognised.
It is one thing to recognise the dole
as a compensation to those whom the
system has rejected. It may be seen as
something else in the case of people
who have rejected the system tacitly.
If the bureau’s paper does stir up this
sort of questioning, its target will not be
the stereotyped blond surfer
yesterday’s “dole-bludger” for the
Rosebud Farm, a rural retreat near Cairns, northern Queensland
PETER CRAWFORD
evidence is that the rural community
(the authors shy away from the term
“commune,” with its implication of
common ownership of all property) has
very little attraction for his (and her)
age group.
The encouragement of such rural
communities, based in part on Israel’s
kibbutzim, has been one of the in-
dividual “ideological” contributions of
the Prime Minister. In his 1979 Boyer
Lectures on “The Resolution of Con-
flict,” he advocated their development
as an alternative to “negative expendi-
ture on unemployment benefits.” Four
years later, as Prime Minister (when, as
the authors of the report point out, he
could have shelved the proposal by
pleading pressure of business), he
floated it again at an International
Labor Organisation meeting in Geneva.
At a subsequent press conference,
Hawke revealed that the emphasis of his
thinking was on rural communities
where younger members would draw
benefit from the skills and
experience of their elders.
As it has proceeded, to a
mixed reception (the NSW
and Victorian governments
are interested in the cheap-
housing potential of the com-
munities; local government
and unions distrust the whole
idea), one of the biggest gaps
has been any real knowledge
of existing communities the
sorts of people who live on
them and how they support
themselves.
The ANU academics Dr
Liz Sommerlad and Peta
Dawson of the university’s
Centre for Resource and
Environmental Studies and
Dr Jon Altman of the Depart-
ment of Social and Political
Change have gone a long
way to filling in this gap.
They admit that their
survey is not encyclopaedic
but think that the variety in
the 20 land-sharing com-
munities they have studied
makes their findings generally
applicable.
Six of their communities
were found in the “Rainbow
Region” around Nimbin,
NSW, and another nine between Taree
and Bellingen on the state’s mid-north
coast. A further four were found on the
NSW south coast and one in bushland
north of Sydney. They had been estab-
lished for from three to 12 years, an
average of seven, were occupied by
between four and 50 adults with a
mean of 11 and occupied between 40
and 706 hectares with a mean size of
about 175.
Population density ranged from one
inhabitant (including children) per 2 ha
to a high of about 54 a person. The
average was one person to 9.7 ha. The
researchers found a total of 229 adults
117 men and 112 women.
In terms of the ANU team’s age
distribution, the communities were not
at all typical an important detail if
governments come seriously to consider
promoting such communities as an anti-
unemployment specific. The 229 adults
were accompanied by 136 children 37
percent of the communities’ total


populations - all of them under 16
years of age. No members were in the
16-to-20 age group and only nine (2.5
percent) in the 21-to-25 years bracket.
The vast majority of the adults were
crowded into the 26-to-30 group (66 -
18 percent) and 31 -to-35 years (81
22.1 percent). Most of the 21 over-50s
surveyed belonged to a community of
retirees that was falling apart even as
the researchers asked their questions.
Nearly half the total were from “an
Australian urban background, confirm-
ing other findings ... that the rural
resettlement movement is part of an
urban-rural drift, reflecting a high level
of dissatisfaction with urban lifestyles.”
But not with all aspects of it. Of the
Creativity manifested at Byron Bay in northern NSW
LEE PEARCE
140 households surveyed, 17 consisted
of a couple without offspring at 12
percent, half the Australian average.
But the 45 couples with children, at 32.5
percent, was not far down on the 40
percent community norm. There were,
however, 23 single parents more than
six times the national average.
Only five households contained
more than one unrelated family. On the
other hand, 45 people or 32.5 percent
(against an average of 19.5 percent)
were living alone.
Where they did differ markedly from
the population as a whole was in the
question of education. Only 3.7 percent
of Australians hold a bachelor’s degree
(as their highest qualification): 27.3
percent of the land-sharers had them.
The 5.1 percent who held higher degrees
was just 10 times the national average.
Altogether, 64.6 percent held qualifi-
cations of some sort trade and techni-
cal, as well as tertiary against a
national average of 25.1 percent.
Most of them - 64 percent - had
been employed up to the time of moving
to their settlement, the majority in the
service sector (as teachers, nurses,
public servants and in a few pro-
fessions). Practically none, however,
had managerial or entrepreneurial
backgrounds a detail, the writers
speculate, which might be reflected in
the slowness with which most com-
munities seem to be moving toward any
kind of self-sufficiency.
Altogether, only 80 of the adults
surveyed (37 percent) worked for cash
and only 17 of those on a full-time basis,
The others worked part-time or the
majority occasionally.
That “working population” was
responsible last year for bringing just
$613,470, into_the 20 communities sur-
veyed. That was 42.1 percent of their
total cash. Another $170,340 (11.7 per-
cent) came from “other” sources, such
as nest-eggs or the occasional legacy.
But the greatest contribution 46.2
percent, $613,470 came from social
security payments and 60 percent of
that from unemployment benefits.
No community in the survey was
financially self-sufficient. More than
half the 157 “economic units” in the
survey a breadwinner (from whatever
source), with or without dependants)
were, in terms of cash income, below the
recognised poverty line.
The attitude of the communities to
their dependants is a bit ambivalent.
“For members of land-sharing com-
munities,” write the authors, “the dole
acts more as a source of minimum cash
income than as an expedient until work
turns up. To some extent, it is regarded
as a non-discretionary or civil right.” A
good many, however, are reported as
resentful of their dependence upon it.
Whatever dilemma the residents
might face, the survey points to an
equally large social dilemma: “There is
an important policy implication here: if
rural land-sharing communities are
intended as supply-sided solutions to
unemployment, then, there is an im-
plicit assumption that members will
withdraw from the labor market. Given
the educational status and investment in
human capital evidences at these com-
munities, it is questionable whether
these people, with valuable skills,
should be encouraged to withdraw from
the labor market.”
The researchers also wonder at the
ethical implications of rural
communities’ welfare depend-
ance. Victorian and NSW
state ventures in promoting
communes, they point out,
implicitly regard continued
payment of the dole as a
minimum income. Similarly,
the payment of other benefits
such as supporting parents,
invalid and sickness benefits
assumes that recipients are
not only unemployed but also
incapable of employment, due
either to child-minding com-
mitments or to disabilities.
“The important point... is
that most (rural community)
people receiving these
payments are ‘employed.’
However, their employment is
not as part of the con-
ventional labor market and is
not for cash; rather it is in the
informal sector of the
economy.”
It is not as if the land-
sharers are work dodgers. Ac-
cording to the survey, 86 of the adults
(40 percent) work full-time on their
properties, building houses, producing
food, doing maintenance and the like.
Another 56 (26 percent) put in more
than a half-week’s effort on a regular
basis.
There is, the researchers point out,
nothing illegal about eking out the dole
by gardening or fishing. In fact, the
social security system forces people into
the “informal” economy as it penalises
them for earning more than $l2 cash a
week. But they have chosen this “alter-
native” voluntarily.
“These people are intentionally un-
employed in many cases,” they con-
clude. “Their past employment status
and occupational status is high. Hence,
the surveyed population of land-sharers
must be carefully distinguished from
structurally unemployed people who
are frequently unskilled and have either
been laid off or unable to find employ-
ment since completing schooling.” □


RACING
A beer baron’s thoroughbred haven
Bigger than Randwick: the training track at “Danding” Cojuangco’s Gooree stud
DA VID McNICOLL finds pleasant surprises at the lavish stud near Mudgee
which is a haven for one of the most powerful men in the Philippines.
THE HELICOPTER swept across the
last low hill and below us was the
extraordinary sight kilometre after
kilometre of gleaming white post-and-
rail fences. They bordered paddocks
and roads, criss-crossed behind dams,
surrounded a racetrack, formed neat
little enclosures alongside the huge
barns. Even more extraordinary was the
sight of four or five people, obviously
women, assiduously painting what
seemed to be fences already glistening
white.
“It’s like your Harbor Bridge,” said
the man who greeted us as the chopper
landed between the rose beds on a green
front lawn in front of the homestead;
“it’s a never-ending job. Eighty
kilometres of fencing and when they’re
painted it has to start all over again.”
The man greeting us was of medium
height, dark, wary yet expressive eyes,
wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the
Cojuangco and his wife, Gretchen, with Gooree stallion Dash o’Pleasure


legend “Northern Cement,”
faded jeans and cowboy
boots. This was Eduardo
Murphy Cojuangco, multi-
millionaire Filipino in-
dustrialist and now owner of
Gooree, near Mudgee, NSW
a stud described by Robert
Sangster as being among the
best six in the world.
Eduardo MURPHY Co-
juangco? How come the Mur-
phy? Well, explained “Dan-
ding” (as he is known to his
friends), his mother married
an Irish American. “I have
Spanish, Irish, American
blood but mostly Filipino,” he
said.
Whatever the racial mix, it
has re-inforced Danding’s superstition.
As we entered the cool homestead, the
famous veterinarian Percy Sykes
pointed to the altered doorsteps. One
step had been filled in, so that only two
remained. “Three is bad luck,” said
Cojuangco. “In Spanish it is one, two,
three; oro, plata, muerte. Gold, silver,
death. So we don’t have threes.”
We sat a while sipping coffee.
Cojuangco’s wife, Gretchen, joined us
with his grandson Teddy, the apple of
his eye. Danding and his wife look
amazingly young to have grandchildren
With staff men, “Swannie” Rivers, Bob Stanley, Percy Sykes
and they arc fairly young. Cojuangco
is only 48, Gretchen younger. They had
arrived the day before from Manila,
about a six-hour flight in their Dassault
Falcon jet, with one stop at Darwin.
With them came their favorite servants
and cook.
Although they are in the homestead
at Gooree only a few weeks each year, it
is kept in immaculate condition by
Johnnie Veloso who is Danding’s
Filipino representative on the stud. (The
racehorse Veloso was named after
Johnnie).
Cojuangco (the name is
pronounced Co-wang-co) is a
shy man and not until we had
been together for a couple of
hours did he unwind and
agree to have a few
photographs taken and to
discuss his hopes for the fu-
ture. About the Philippines
this was not a subject for
discussion, at least on the
political level. Cojuangco has
been involved in politics, was
governor of Tarlac province
and has served as a congress-
man. He is one of the richest
men in the Philippines and
this automatically propels him
toward the limelight.
Cojuangco is the biggest
name in the coconut industry and he
controls the country’s largest
multinational company, San Miguel
Corporation.
He is a friend but not a day-to-day
associate of President Marcos and is
embarrassed that he is mentioned
frequently as a successor to Marcos.
As a man whose business activities
directly influence the lives of more than
20 million Filipinos, he is a subject of
considerable interest not only in Manila
but also around the world.

family links also stretch to the
Marcos opponents as-
sassinated Benigno Aquino’s
widow is a first cousin.
The Gooree complex is in
two parts a training and
spelling area on one side, a
breeding establishment on the
other. The immensity of the
operation for a horse stud
is staggering: a racecourse
larger than Randwick, with
grass and woodchip tracks; a
horse barn which looks more
like a comfortable hospital
and which accommodates 84
horses; a dam holding 645
million litres of water; all that
fencing, costing $l7 a panel.
The money has been poured
into Gooree with an unstinting hand but
the end result has justified the expendi-
ture.
Into the cars and away, Sykes
leading, Cojuangco following. We
wheeled up a hill to get a good view of
the spread and the dams.
The architecture of the Gooree build-
ings, at Gretchen Cojuangco’s behest,
has all been Spanish-Mexican arches,
red roofs, white bricks (all the bricks are
Mudgee manufacture a great order
for the local kilns). Apart from the fine
gums which dot the paddocks, more
Proud Gretchen Cojuangco with grandson Teddy
than 4000 trees of various types have
been planted. Two landscape gardeners
are to be added to the staff of Gooree
soon.
The staff, incidentally, numbers 63.
Most of them live in Mudgee. Their
wages plus the stud purchases of provi-
sions, feed, etc are said to mean an
infusion of $250,000 a month into the
economy of the town. The female fence-
painters are, in the main, wives of other
employees. I did not have a chance to
talk to any of them but I understand
they enjoy the work and the pay.
Cojuangco is fortunate
with his senior staff - Bob
Stanley, his general manager,
a man of long and varied
country experience; Andrew
Marsh, stud groom, a tall and
tanned young man who looks
like a rugged film star; and
Sykes, chairman of the
Gooree company, who for
years tended the horses of
leading trainers Tommy
Smith and Colin Hayes but
lives with his wife and two
small children on Gooree.
Birangambil, a few kilo-
metres from Gooree, is an-
other part of the Cojuangco
investment. That property has
3600 hectares and the main
function is the breeding of Belmont
cattle. Belmonts are an Afrikander mix
and they are 50 percent Afrikander, 25
percent shorthorn and 25 percent
Hereford. They are heavy cattle, tick-
resistant, carrying an extraordinary
amount of prime meat. Stanley is very
proud of his 2400 cattle, as he is of the
lucerne paddocks which cut 40,000
bales a year.
There are no motor-cycles on
Gooree or Birangambil. Herding cattle
and horses is done on horseback.

The “barn:” comfortable accommodation for 84 horses
Marsh told me. It is strange these days
to go to a country property where most
of the work in the paddocks is not done
on motor-cycles and I found it refresh-
ing that the stockhorse was still being
used as it should. It was one of the
pleasant surprises about Gooree. An-
other was to find that kangaroos (not in
heavy numbers) are not molested in the
Gooree paddocks. Nor are the deer
which appear timidly in the timber on
the hillsides.
An inspection morning with
Danding was a fairly exhausting assign-
ment: to the foals, to the stallion Dash
o’Pleasure, to the spelling paddocks, to
the mares awaiting service and the
mares which had been served and were
awaiting confirmation of their preg-
nancy. Not a detail escaped Cojuangco
and his soft questions to sykes, stanley
and Marsh to say nothing of Veloso
kept all of them on their toes. I think
everyone was glad when lunchtime
arrived.
Back to the homestead. The bar was
opened but soft drinks were the most
popular. Then, in to lunch, 12 of us
around a huge table in the centre of
which was a Lazy Suzan groaning with
salads and chickens and sausage and
fruits and every kind of sweet. In came
the T-bone steaks, from the Belmont
cattle and confirming in their tender-
ness the claims of manager Stanley.
Johnnie Veloso disappeared from
the dining room and reappeared with a
large painting of two roosters. They
were not ordinary roosters. “These are
my champion fighting cocks,” said
Danding, “the best in the Philippines.”
He is a cockfight fanatic, bets only on
his own birds and never on his
racehorses.
His racing career in Australia over
the past 10 years has not been
spectacularly successful. Neville Begg
had produced winners for him but not
winners of really big races. Danding is
not worried. He knows that the big
winners will come.
He paid $4.5 million last year for the
sire Tolomeo which, after service at the
National Stud in Britain, is to arrive at
Gooree next year with a service fee of
$30,000. Tolomeo is said to be one of
the best-looking sires in the world. His
racing record includes a win over John
Henry in the Arlington Million.
Cojuangco is a placid, seemingly
very contented man. He does not think
there will be catastrophic trouble in the
Philippines.
But it must be comforting for
Danding and his family to have a haven
such as Gooree in a friendly and pro-
sperous country. As he and Gretchen
waved to us when the chopper left their
lawn, they looked very much at home. □


Swiss Achievement
Longines introduce
the Conquest VHP
One quartz watch may cost
100 times as much as another. But
when it comes to performance,
how much difference is there?
Truth about accuracy.
Take it as a fact of life: a quartz
watch will vary by about two
minutes a year, regardless of brand
or price. Main reason for this
variation is the effect of the
changing temperature on the
quartz crystal inside the watch, the
heart of its timekeeping system.
Meaning of VHP.
In the Longines Conquest VHP
(for Very High Precision) a newly
developed movement largely
neutralises that effect, achieving
an accuracy of one minute in five
years. That comes to one second
per month and is, as matters now
stand, the frontier of wrist-watch
precision.
6-year battery.
A watch battery normally runs
on silver oxide and will last a year
or two. The battery of Conquest
VHP uses lithium and has a life
span of six years.
Silky hardness
Equally innovative is the
Conquest VHP case. It consists of
the extremely hard XL alloy and
has a protective layer of even
harder titanium carbide. The silky
texture of the case is due to
thousands of microscopic craters
obtained by blasting with synthetic
sapphire pellets.
Tradition counts.
The Conquest VHP is a unique
blend of craftsmanship, technology
and inventiveness.
It is probably the most
advanced watch you can own today,
even if it still shares something
with the Longines models of 1832,
namely the Swiss craftsman’s pride
in a job well done.
You may now forget everything
you ever read
about quartz watches

By the hair of my chinny-chin-chin
RON SAW
SOONER or later, unless somebody
can tell me how to grow hair on top of
my head, I shall have to grow whiskers
again.
On or under the chin, on the cheeks
or cheekbones, on the upper lip, trim-
med, tossed, blow-waved, frizzed or
fuzzed ... it sounds awful and probably
will look awful but never mind about all
that. Fashion, vanity, knows no reason.
Show me a man with a bald pate and
I’ll show you a man with whiskers or
a man who would grow whiskers if he
could.
The reasoning is simple, to him: the
foliage has gone from on top but
nobody need think that he’s not madly
masculine or that he has contracted
some frightful disease. He’ll show ’em!
He’ll grow a ziff. Or a moustache ... Or
something, even if it is only hair in his
ears.
(In Perth, I knew a bald wrestler
“bald” is an understatement: he was
naked from the eyebrows north who
grew tufts of sandy hair from his
nostrils. They were pretty good tufts,
but they grew down into his moustache,
which was black. They put me in mind
of ferrets darting from rabbit-holes. But
I digress.)
For a long time I wanted to grow a
beard, to show that I could, but I was
afraid that I might not be able to. It used
to keep me awake at nights and finally I
took the problem to an old friend.
“What it boils down to,” she said, “is
this: You want to show that you can
grow hair if you want to.”
“I suppose I do.”
“So don’t waste time grow-
ing it on your face. If you’re
so keen to show people that
you’re hairy, give ’em a look
at one of your armpits.”
“You think that might
help?”
“You might be arrested if
you went any further.” We
seemed to be on different
wavelengths.
But, as my scalp grew more
bare, I began to realise more
clearly that I would have to
try even if I failed, even if
people pointed and cabbies
shouted at me in the street.
Sailing between Darwin
and the Balinese port of
Benoa, I grew what I rather
fancied to be a pretty
handsome set of whiskers. It
was of many hues and
keeping it trimmed was much more
troublesome than shaving but the
Balinese, a comparatively beardless lot,
admired it tremendously. I took it on to
Britain, then back to Australia.
Then, one day, a newspaperman
took me by the sleeve and urged me to
shave it off.
“Things have changed since you
went away,” he said. “These days, the
only blokes who wear their beards
carefully trimmed like that are
poofters.”
“Poofters!”
“Poofters. Fags. Gay ... Well, not
literally all of ’em. But eight out of 10
neatly-trimmed beards are worn by
fags. I tell you, beard-trimming is out.
You’ll just have to let it grow in all
directions. Like the yachties.”
I didn’t want to argue about it.
Clearly, it was up to me: I could
continue to trim my beard and be ogled
by window-dressers or I could follow
what was, apparently, the prevailing
heterosexual fashion and pass among
my fellows with a face like a busted
mattress. I made a firm, courageous
decision and asked my wife.
She urged me to shave it off and as
quickly as possible.
She didn’t so much mind the beard,
she said, as that it came in six tones
black, blond, grey, mouse, ginger and
white and people who saw us together
assumed either that I was half mad or
that she, too, was a geriatric.
“I could dye it,” I told her. “All
black? All ginger? All mouse?”
“You’d look like a fag with a mousy
beard.”
“I could let it go wild and dye it
blond.”
“And look like a heap of ... of
shaved butter on legs. Get rid of the
whole thing.”
I got rid of it.
But the problem is still there and
daily it, like my scalp, becomes clearer.
I shall have to grow whiskers. But what
manner of whiskers?
■ Mutton-chops (or Dundrearys or
Piccadilly Weepers) The cheekbones
and chin are shaved and the rest just
tumbles down, often to below the
jawline. I think not. For some reason,
the style sounds like W. E. Gladstone or
Benjamin Disraeli. Or the Reverend
Fred Nile. I have nothing against any of
them. They are or were all men of the
world I have been told that the Rev
Fred plays a keen game of solitaire
but I don’t want to, look like them.
■ Buggerlugs or Bugger’s Grips:
Everything but the cheekbones is
shaved. The impression is of two
oysters, shelled, wearing a grass skirt.
Popular with the navy. So is pink gin.
■ The Vandyke: an up-curling
moustache and a beard narrowing to a
flattering point below the chin. No. A
bit too Czarist, Kaiser Billish, and so
is ...
■ The Imperial: A still-wider
moustache and a narrow beard in the
middle of the chin. UH-UH.
■ The Postiche: favored by
ancient Egyptians, who
seemed to be never less inde-
cisive than in the matter of
whiskers. It was the original
false beard but not one of
those fool things favored by
private eyes, spies and actors.
It was a magnificently stylised
thing, of the kind one sees on
mummies. But it was held on
by a gold chinstrap and,
frankly, I think I’d look pretty
damn silly with a chinstrap
going up my cheeks to my
bald head or looped over my
ears.
Perhaps it would be wiser
to give the matter deeper
thought. If I think long
enough, hats may become
fashionable again indoors
and out. Or Oxford Street
might get sick of trimming its
whiskers. □


BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
A burning desire to find another pub
THE FLAG of Eureka is Norman
Gallagher’s badge, emblem, symbol,
credo. You see it fluttering at all the best
Builders Laborers Federation sites and
would-be sites.
This drives the citizens of Ballarat to
fury, particularly, Peter Tobin, founda-
tion chairman of the Eureka Re-enact-
ment Committee and Peter Mansfield,
the Ballarat librarian. They believe the
flag has been so captured by left-wing
groups now it is probably too late to
save it. But on the 130th anniversary of
the Eureka uprising, by heavens they
are trying.
“Why should Norm Gallagher be
allowed to use the Eureka flag as his
personal badge?” asks Mr Tobin. “He
has turned it into a flag of derision,
disruption and anarchy. Its importance
in history has been destroyed.”
He said Norm Gallagher had made
Eureka the war cry for the working man
in his struggle against the capitalist
employers. “But this is nonsense,” he
said. “The miners at Eureka were all
self-employed. They were would-be
millionaires, multi-nationals. They were
latter-day tax evaders.
“Peter Lalor, their leader, was a civil
engineer, and no left-winger. He
became a member of parliament,
speaker of the Victorian House and it
was he who brought in the Chinese
strike breakers against the miners at
Clunes.”
Tobin says people from all over the
world were involved in the action at
Eureka the first time a polyglot
collection of Australians acted together.
“I think the flag should be revered and
treated with respect,” he said.
You must appreciate Eureka has
been marvellously useful for Ballarat.
This year Eureka is 130 years old and
the Eureka Re-enactment Committee
put on a great turn as part of Victoria’s
150th birthday celebrations. They burnt
down Bentley’s pub.
On October 6, 1854, James Scobie
and his mate Martin called at Bentley’s
pub for a drink. Now Bentley’s Eureka
Hotel was the largest most elegant pub
in all Ballarat and James Bentley had a
reputation for being as mean as all hell.
The hotel was closed, Bentley refused to
open it and the diggers roared abuse.
Next morning Scobie was found near
the hotel kicked to death and Bentley
was charged with the murder.
Bentley got off and the miners
thought the whole thing was rigged. In a
fit of fury on October 17 they burnt his
Diggers march to Bakery Hill in Ballarat’s Eureka re-enactment
hotel. In modern terms it would be the
equivalent of burning the Regent or the
Wentworth. This was the first dramatic
act to set the scene for Eureka.
And it is great for re-enactments.
Ballarat only does it about once every
10 years. I thought they would burn a
sort of J. C. Williamson’s stage set. No
indeed. They built a real little hotel on
the far side of Sovereign Hill Historical
Park.
It had a bark roof, real door and
windows, huge timber uprights, and the
Eureka Hotel sign up aloft. There were
history purists who complained that the
real Bentley’s was a double-storey affair
and this should have been double-storey
also. But I thought it was a pretty good
deal. The BLF might have spent six
months on the job.
Sovereign Hill’s director, Peter His-
cock, said the construction actually took
a fortnight. They used timber from two
wrecked houses and the builder,
Norman Hammond, was so in love with
it he couldn’t bear to see it burned
down, and he wasn’t there on re-
enactment night.
More than 3000 people turned out
for the burning, many of them in period
gear. Peter Tobin, a Ballarat undertaker,
was dressed as a sergeant in the 40th
Regiment of Foot, Peter Mansfield was
a miner. At 8.30p.m. Martin, a red-
headed bearded miner in black hat, red
shirt and moleskins, started hollering in
brilliant Irish brogue!
“One of our diggers has been foully
murdered. Now his murderer has been
set free. We demand justice and we will
have it.”
HOORAY! We all shouted.
“Fellows, the spirit of the murdered
Scobie is above us now, crying for
revenge, Fellows, tear the place down!”
I found it a little surprising that good
Irish cit L-ens would find it in their
hearts to ourn a drinking house, no
matter what the circumstances, but now
it v as on.
Miners were up on the roof kicking
down the hotel sign. Next the whole
place was on fire and the characters on
the roof had to jump for their live.
Burn? It burned magnificently, not just
a mean, cheap little burn, but a fire that
went for more than an hour until the
Fire Brigade had to put it out. At the
finish we had the uprights still standing
like lonely totems. Peter Hiscock was
delighted. He said: “There’s an S. T.
Gill painting of the end of Bentley’s pub
and it looks just like that.”
After the pub burning we marched
off to re-enact the “monster” meeting of
10,000 miners which Peter Lalor ad-
dressed on November 11 at Bakery Hill
with the burning of the licences. We had
to go to Sovereign Hill. These times the
real Bakery Hill is not quite so histori-
cally impressive. It is occupied by a
McDonald’s restaurant.
But the re-enactment was done with
flaming torches, a superb Eureka flag
fluttering on the platform, and I for one
found the adrenalin pumping. I was
absolutely ready to go off and burn
another pub. □

Eddie Tirado: a
master of
the mixed drink
The one thing missing from the average
Australian “cocktail party” is the
cocktail. Men and women becoming
steadily more soporific more dyspep-
tic on beer, scotch and soda and gin
and tonic, refuse to believe (or have
never bothered to consider) that there
might be something uplifting in a
number of spirits cunningly blended by
a master. Such a master is and has
been, in Sydney, for more than 20 years
Eddie Tirado. Born in New York,
where he learned his trade from Jack
Dempsey’s brother Jim, Tirado has an
Australian wife, five Australian children
and various businesses, occupations,
etc, all to do with the cocktail. Anyone
who ever drank for fun at the Chevron,
Potts Point, would know his mixes and
yet another of his books Cocktails and
Mixed Drinks (Lansdowne, $17.95)
has just been published. His Lena
Cocktail, a blend of bourbon, ver-
mouth, campari and galliano, makes it
all worthwhile.
Alexandra Joel: a
long look at what
we wore and wear
Lord George-Brown:
out of order
on three counts
Lord George-Brown, ex-deputy British
Labor leader, is the font of many good
stories. When he was at a reception in
South America the band struck up and
he asked a rather splendid figure in
purple to dance. “No,” came the indig-
nant reply. On being asked why, the
putative partner hissed: “Firstly,
because you are drunk. Secondly,
because this is the National Anthem.
Thirdly, because I’m the Papal
Nuncio.”
“Let’s do it, let’s fall in love,” sang
Linda Nagle at Kinselas, Sydney, at the
launch of Alexandra Joel’s Best Dressed,
a book detailing Australia’s fashion
history. The Cole Porter number, made
famous by Noel Coward, was pushed
further by some name changes from
Joel herself, attractive daughter of Sir
Asher. Some isolated examples:
“Andrew Peacock could ... just do it,
even Leo Schofield we assume does it.
Let’s do it, let’s fall in love.” The
personable publicity team from Collins
performed fashion tableaus in costumes
from bustled gowns to Linda Jackson’s
version of a waratah. The author, 31, a
journalist and businesswoman, said she
liked the 30s for its witty suits and bias-
cut satin backless evening dresses and
the 80s “because you can wear what you
want”. In the 13 months of research and
writing she devoted to the book, she
heard some tales. She said Ita Buttrose
was fashion editor of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph when she was pictured in the
Sydney Morning Herald, under her
married name, as a fashion winner at
the races. The Telegraph pointed to the
pic, saying “Right filly, wrong stable.”
But the best line of the function was
uttered by the publisher Richard Smart.
He quoted to the audience, which
included A 1 Grassby and Trent Nathan,
the Oscar Wilde quip: Fashion is what
one wears oneself. What is fashionable
is what other people wear.


What boy cannot run up a Mousse de
Saint Jacques with Sauce Nantua fol-
lowed by Gigot d’Agneau en Chevreuil
with two garnitures and two vegetables
and a Tarte aux Fruits for his father’s
evening snack when his mother is off
playing bridge with the girls? Such a
boy would have no future but,
fortunately, there must be few which
is, probably, why the Academie de
Culinaire de France selected that menu
as the one to be run up by competitors
for the title of Young Chef of Australia.
More than 100 young (23-30) chefs
entered in July, sponsored by Diners
Club, and six were left last week after
hot-paced cook-offs. They are Tony
Sandeberg, from Uni-Chef, NSW;
Henry Oerlmans, from the SA Hilton;
Michael Carnes, Four Seasons West
Side, Hobart; Jacques Reymond,
Minetta’s, Melbourne; Andrew Duncan,
Dud’s House, Brisbane; and Gordon
McDonald, from the Bentley Tech,
Perth. They met for the final at Ryde
College (of Cooking Studies and Hotel
Administration) and shovelled the
vittles and the winner was ... Michael
Carnes, the Hobart boy. The prize is a
trip to France to work where a gigot is
really a gigot.
The picture is either an expression of
how the artist felt after a Relationship
had Broken Up or “the shock of realis-
ing who and what I am” or a woman, of
the pleasingly Junoesque proportions
which became obsolete when the human
stick-insect became artistically fashion-
able, in the Garden of Earthly Delights.
The artist, Anna Platten, will hold still
for any or possibly all of those descrip-
tions. The model is her sister Bronwyn
and the work is one in an exhibition by
four Adelaide artists which opens at
the Woolloomooloo Gallery, Sydney,
this week. “I wanted to paint a male
counterpart to my woman in the gar-
den,” says Platten, “and I asked all my
male friends what sort of things I should
include. I made a list: razor blades,
wallets, watches, ties, underwear, socks
... the sort of things they use every
day.” The Garden was also fairly thick
with small garden beasts and assorted
bric-a-brac but the general impression is
that man, while not necessarily vile, is
certainly a bore. Every other prospect
pleases, praise be.
Deep Purple, the English heavy metal
rock band of 1969-1973, which re-
formed last March, is touring Australia
because it is warm here. That sounds
fair: the members can afford to please
themselves when it comes to making
money. Consider lan Paice, 36, the
drummer. “I’m a very rich man,” he
says and he laughs. Why wouldn’t he?
He has racehorses in training at
Newmarket, he wears a pair of two-
carat diamond rings for which he paid
$14,000 each. In the world of music, he
is a big noise. He would be a big noise
anywhere: the Guinness Book of Records
named Deep Purple as the loudest rock
group in the world. Paice says that is a
maybe. “When we toured Australia in
the early 70s with AC-DC,” he says,
“they were twice as loud.” Asked
whether all this has affected his hearing,
he cups his ear and says: “Pardon?”
Drummer Ian
Paice: “What’s that
you say?”

KATHARINE WHITEHORN
The truth behind a childhood game
IF YOU HAD to award a Nobel Prize
for happiness, whom would you
choose? Mother Theresa? The inventor
of the sewing machine? Walt Disney?
Or maybe somebody nobody had ever
heard of, who unblocked the drains for
a whole street of houses after the fifth
day?
If there were such a prize, you could
certainly nominate that splendid
woman featured recently in the papers
who broke off her engagement because
her fiance wanted children
and she did not; she wound
up as the beloved foster-
mother to a family of about
two dozen. You might pick
the woman who scrubbed the
sticky stuff off the sloping
stage at Wexford one year,
thus causing all those singers
who were not clutching on to
the scenery or one another to
slide slowly into the
footlights; all those who saw it
glow with pleasure to this day.
I would be torn, between
the Frenchman who is dishing
out food to the hungry from
his supermarket chain (and.
incidentally, increasing my
happiness by the rage of all
the other supermarketeers) and Rosie
Swale. She first made the headlines
sailing round the world in a quite
remarkably little bikini; her next ap-
pearance was in court with her close
friend and companion Tracey, who had
started out as a merchant seaman called
Bernard, and she has recently crossed
the Atlantic again alone. Whenever the
word “Swale” is seen, you can be sure
that you are in for something pre-
posterous and that the strikes and
bombs must at least have let up a little.
Peanuts, I can hear you say disap-
provingly. These are not people who
increase human happiness; rather are
they those with the far-sightedness to
launch serious far-ranging projects to
improve the human condition. But the
trouble with far-ranging projects is that
they so often go wrong.
Dams, for example: We all know
that dams are good, from the Tennessee
Valley Authority that brought jobs and
hope with Roosevelt’s New Deal, to
mighty third world constructions that
can irrigate a whole region. But it seems
that even dams are not infallible. The
Ambuklao dam in the Philippines, for
instance, displaced farmers who were
forced to move further up the slopes to
scratch a living; they cut down the trees
to make fields and now a vast quantity
of soil has eroded into, as you might
expect, the reservoir.
Or population control: It is generally
accepted that any teeming country
which could cut down the birthrate
might really stand a chance of feeding
its folk, so the Chinese are making a
mammoth attempt to get couples to
have only one child. But when Helen
Brew, a New Zealand TV producer,
took a film crew there she found not
only that a whole generation was to
grow up without sisters or brothers (I
can think of some brothers who would
think that fantastic) but also that the
babes were to be raised in antiseptic
factory creches presumably to stop
any woman ever becoming too baby-
minded.
Brew tried to convince Madame
Kang Ke Chang, the most powerful
woman in China, of the awful risk of
this kind of emotional deprivation. If
Brew has succeeded, she deserves the
happiness prize. Only suppose such
ruthlessness is needed to make the one-
child policy work at all?
Do you remember the game
Fiddlesticks, where you must take a
needle from a randomly-dropped pile
without jogging any of the others?
There is a Fiddlesticks effect which
ensures that it is almost impossible to
change anything important without
starting some quite unexpected
repercussions elsewhere. The classic
case is probably that of the Green
Revolution brought by the new seed
which crops so heavily that it seemed to
be the answer to all the world’s food
problems.
When they tried it in India and
Mexico, the results were not quite what
they had hoped for. The soil puts out
only what it contains, so you need
fertiliser for such heavy cropping. Fer-
tiliser costs money, so do the seeds; so
only the better-off farmers could grow
the crops in the first place. Their abund-
ant grain undercut the price of the crop,
to the point where the poorer farmers
could not sell theirs at all. They had to
sell their farms; landless, they worked
as day laborers for the richer
farmers. Until the rich ones
could afford combined har-
vesters; then the poor ones
ended up with nothing no
land, no jobs, no food.
Does this mean that it is
simply pointless to try, that
we should say, as Lord
Melbourne said to the young
Victoria: “Do not, I beseech
you, try to do any good; then,
at least, you may be sure you
do no harm”? Far from it. But
the industrialists who met at
the Findhorn conference
recently have become con-
vinced that small projects
which grow up through the
paving-stones of old patterns
have a far better chance of long-term
success than grandiose panaceas
imposed from above. The Fiddlesticks
effect is certainly one reason why.
With something that starts out in a
small way, you can watch out for
undesirable side-effects and unforeseen
consequences and with any luck, check
them in time instead of rubbing them
impatiently off the blueprint for fear
they should spoil the grand plan. You
win at Fiddlesticks, after all, by keeping
your eyes skinned for the shift at the
other side of the pile.
In the optimistic earlier years of the
century, we were all taught to despise
the small personal solution as half-
baked. No good handing out soup, no
good knitting toe-covers for Eskimos
when what they needed was hydro-
electric power; sheer sentimentality to
repair the old woman’s roof when the
whole slum needs clearing. Since we
now realise that the slum may not get
cleared, the piece of lino tacked across
her leaking rafters seems suddenly good
again. It leaves her at least planted
firmly in front of her telly, wondering
whether in the long run Sir Stafford
Cripps or Charlie Chaplin did more to
cheer her along. □


A new lease for the eastern barred bandicoot
DAVID McNICOLL
I’VE SEEN plenty of signs warning
motorists to be careful of itinerant
koalas and kangaroos.
But there’s a new one down at
Hamilton in Victoria, where efforts are
being made to preserve the endangered
eastern barred bandicoot. See the
picture below.
WILL THE day come when the black
people of the universe are so paramount
at athletic activities that the whites will
have to stop competing with them? The
thought buzzed into my mind while
watching those quite superb athletes, the
West Indies cricketers.
Already, blacks dominate many
sports. In boxing, there are precious few
titles still held by whites. Blacks also
dominate basketball, baseball, and are
increasingly evident in American grid-
iron and in soccer. On the athletics field,
blacks are gaining all the time, from
sprinting to highjumping to marathons.
Cricket, which was traditionally a
game at which whites considered they
would always be supreme, has taken on
a completely new look with the mag-
nificent displays of the West Indians. It
seems that only tennis and swimming
remain more or less the province of the
whites. But for how long, once blacks
get access to the same opportunities and
facilities?
Why has it happened? Several
people suggested to me that the black
surge had been caused by economic
pressure the desperate desire of the
underprivileged to achieve athletic
success and with it a better lifestyle.
Could be. But whatever the cause, we
are going to find most sports in-
creasingly dominated by magnificent
black athletes.
DON’T TELL me Australia is going to
adopt that hideous word “gotten”? I
saw it twice last week, attributed to
Premier Wran.
“Gotten” is widespread in America
(I understand it is a remnant of the
language of the Pilgrim Fathers, like
“sidewalk” instead of “footpath”).
Surely we can keep it out of Australia.
CONTRARY TO those people who
declared it a bore, I thought The Great
Debate wasn’t a bad program for a non-
rating period. What was said was fairly
predictable but it was what we saw
which made the program interesting.
First of all, the shiny goo which had
been applied to the faces of the PM and
Andrew Peacock. It was almost dazzl-
ing; had the make-up people run out of
dusting powder? Both the contestants
wore dark suits, cut in the sincerest
fashion, and both sported red ties.
The journos had been well scrubbed
up for the occasion, suits dry-cleaned,
ties properly knotted. But
it was the tonsorial artistry
of everyone present that
riveted my attention.
Debaters Hawke and
Peacock, and moderator
Ken Randall were pictures
of immaculate wave and
set perfection. Not a wisp
of hair out of place, the
Bondi breakers reduced to
small wavelets, the hair
spray keeping everything
under control.
Among the press lot, hair styles
varied. Michelle Grattan had obviously
lost a battle with her locks and was
looking like Psyche in a windstorm.
Richard Carleton and Robert Haupt
looked neat round the cranium, and
Laurie Oakes had cunningly arranged
his remaining strands over the top. Peter
Bowers appeared to be wearing a wig
made of some indeterminate rug
material. It was a relief to gaze at Ken
Begg’s honest bald dome, glistening in
the arc lights.
HAVING IN the past couple of years
nodded approvingly at the steady im-
provement in Fairfax papers, let me say
that The Sun-Herald of November 25
undid much of the good work, and
stepped into the province of Yellow
Journalism.
On Page One was a picture of Glen
Marie North, and under it “Glen Marie
North tells: Sinclair and Me.” Inside,
the “story” had been allied with another
on Susan Sangster. At the top of the
page was the proud word “Exclusive”
but in the Sangster section there was
Nile: tenebrous gasbag
hardly one word which had not ap-
peared in the papers the preceding
week.
Glen Marie’s contribution to the
trumpeted “Sinclair and Me,” came
down to a tame “she refused to com-
ment on her relationship with Sinclair.”
I fail to see how this possibly justifies
the titillating “Sinclair and Me,” aimed
to get the suckers to buy the paper.
I am not concerned with comment
about lan Sinclair he is well able to
look after himself. But this dredging up
of inconsequential material about a
woman of great charm and ability who
once happened to have had an un-
fortunate affair, strikes me as the nadir
of rotten journalism. The Sun-Herald, if
it were a person, should have had its
mouth scrubbed out.
WHAT THE hell is all this
talk about “body
language.” Would it not be
easier to refer to fidgeting,
doodling, nose picking or
whatever?
I failed to pick up any
particular language from
Bob Hawke shuffling his
pens the other night.
THE REV Fred Nile
teeters between winning
the Oscar as the world’s most tedious
cleric and the world’s leading buffoon.
The crass stupidity of his suggestions
that Paul Landa had met foul play put
the final kybosh on any claims by this
caliginous, indeed tenebrous, gasbag to
be taken seriously.
ONE DOESN’T expect much in the
way of literary flights at company
annual meetings. But Tony Grey, boss
of Pancontinental, changed all that last
week, when he addressed his share-
holders.
“While Jabiluka is still stalled in the
flailing windmills of quixotic politics,
other activities have dramatically
shifted the company’s centre of
gravity,” declaimed Tony.
“We are now in process of emerging
as a diversified mining house with
important interests in gold, coal, and
petroleum, as well as uranium.
“Earnings are no longer a silhouette
on a far distant horizon in a failing
light; they are immediate, with us now,
in the foreground.”
In other words, Tony meant things
were looking up. '□

Nivosa sails in.
On August 19th, 1984, Shell’s new crude oil carrier sailed into
Sydney Harbour.
‘ ‘Nivosa’ ’ weighs 115,000 dead weight tonnes and is
265 metres long, making it the largest crude oil carrier to
sail into Sydney or Geelong. It was necessary to have her
tailor made as the terminal at Gore Bay, Sydney, posed a length
limitation while Geelong restricted her draft.
“Nivosa’ ’ named after a volute shell found only in the waters
of Western Australia, is registered in Sydney and has an
Australian crew.
She is to be used mainly for service between Australia and the
Persian Gulf carrying crude oil for delivery to Shell Australia’s
refineries.

Thefailure of regulation.
#
A continuing theme in economic
and political debate in Australia in
recent years has been the growing
dissatisfaction felt by people
throughout the community at
the rapid growth in the rate of
reguktion-of individuals as well as
organisations-and the deadening
impact of too much regulation on
social and economic life.
This was highlighted recently by the Prime Minister
when he said:
‘ 7 am convinced that after 84 years of Federation we
have accumulated an excessive and often irrelevant
and obstructive body of taws and regulations ’
Few people would claim that government legislation
and regulation is completely unnecessary Defence, law
and order, currency supervision and the setting of a
broad economic framework are all examples of areas
where government involvement benefits society On
another level, few would disagree with the necessity for
governments to implement regulations on community
health and safety such as prohibitions on drink driving
and controlling the flow of traffic with lights.
The argument is really about how much regulation.
Those of us who criticise the current level of govern-
ment intervention in our economy do so because
regulations are often inefficient and costly, not just to
one company or another, but to the whole community.
The wide-ranging impact of excessive government
controls is the real reason for attacking the problem.
There are many examples of costly over-regulation
and they affect all Australians one way or another.
One example is the complexity of tariffprotection;
another is the bewildering and contradictory array
of regulations restricting retail shopping hours in
different States. The administration of these regulations
is expensive, and their impact on the final cost of
products and services to the consumer is substantial.
It is widely accepted that youth unemployment is one of
the gravest social problems we face in Australia. Apart
from the devastating effect of unemployment upon the
individual young people concerned, there is the heavy
economic cost and the potential for serious divisions
within our society in the future.
Youth unemployment is three to four times the national
average and there is little doubt that the need to pay
adult wage rates to young men and women is one of
the main reasons theyfind it so hard to get a job.
Any employer, no matter what industry will tell you
that this is so.
This is a good example of regulation-the minimum
wage levels established in our centralised wage fixing
system and originally designed to prevent the
exploitation of young workers-having the completely
unintended effect of making it virtually impossible for
many young people to obtain work.
There are some hopeful signs. The Federal Government
has announced that it will be conducting a review
of existing regulation, in association with business
groups and trade unions, with the aim of reducing the
burden of regulation, particularly that which does not
promote economic efficiency. The liberalisation of the
financial sector of the economy in the last year is a
most encouraging step.
In Victoria, an Opposition initiative to place a time limit
on regulations, unless deliberate action is taken to have
them extended, has been accepted by the Government,
a good example which I hope other States will follow.
I believe very strongly that democratic societies are best
served by a system which allows individuals to exercise
the greatest possible freedom of choice, consistent with
the obligation to protect the rights of others. In economic
terms, this means an essentially free market which
should be the starting point when considering whether
government intervention is necessary for the common
good.
Historical circumstances have encouraged Australians
to look to government to solve our problems, but
we now have a greater realisation of thefact that
Government-imposed solutions, no matter how well
intentioned, can too often make problems worse, or
create a new set of problems.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


The North West Shelf:
Phase One-on stream after 20years.
Guests from around the world converged on Karratha, in the
north-west of Western Australia to celebrate the inauguration of
Phase I of the North West Shelf project-Australia’s biggest
development challenge-on September 4 of this year.
Phase I supplies gas to the State Energy Commission of Western
Australia for Western Australian consumers.
Gas from the North Rankin field, 130 kilometres offshore, began
flowing into the 1500 kilometre pipeline of the State Energy
Commission in mid-August and reached consumers in and around
Perth a week later.
The State Energy Commission is contracted to take 10.9 million cubic
metres of gas a day under a 20 year contract which is effective from
January 1,1985. Present deliveries are being made under a separate
early gas agreement.
First beneficiary of the project has been the State of Western
Australia. Since construction began in 1981, the WA economy has
been enjoying a hefty boost, particularly in employment. Over
5,000 workers were employed at the peak of the construction
programme. In another, intangible form, WA has benefited through
the acquisition of technology.
But energy is the project’s reason for existence. In 1983,62 per cent
of WA’s demand for primary energy was met by oil, about two thirds
of which had to be imported, while gas supplied only 13 per cent of
the State’s needs.
By 1993, according to forecasts of the State Energy Commission,
natural gas from the North West Shelf will be providing 40 per cent
of the State’s requirements. By that date oil will provide only 36 per
cent of total primary energy and only 15 per cent of this will be
imported.
Formerly, WA had an unsatisfied appetite for gas. Those days are
gone; customers, big and small, will now move away from liquid
petroleum fuels to natural gas. More industrial customers are likely
to be attracted to the West by abundant gas supply. Another large
potential market exists in the towns and mineral processing
industries of the Pilbara, neighbours of the Joint Venture, as well as
for electricity generation.

Phase lof the North West Shelf Project.
Phase Two- goodprogress.
Meanwhile, good progress is being made on Phase 11, in which
liquefied natural gas will be supplied to eight Japanese gas and
electric utilities, commencing in the late 1980 s and extending over
twenty years. To maintain supply over that period, two more
production platforms will be brought on stream.
When production has reached “plateau’ ’ rate, the buyers will be
taking, in total, six million tonnes of LNG a year, with a fleet of seven
LNG tankers shuttling punctually between Australia and Japan.
Because of the magnitude of the investment required for the second
phase, a new ownership structure has been developed in which six
participants, including the five participants in the domestic gas
phase, will each own an equal one-sixth share of the LNG phase.
Phase II is now at the stage of completing technology, marketing,
finance and other arrangements prior to a final construction
decision.
Apart from being a participant, Shell is technical adviser to the
Project in the areas of gas exploration and production, as well as the
design, construction and operation of the LNG plant.

A New Guaranteed Service Plan from Auto Care! ’
Shell has upgraded the service available to motorists through the
Auto Care network, which includes some 300 dealers. The new
Auto Care Guaranteed Service Plan covers regular car servicing
and the key advantage is that work performed is personalised,
guaranteed and cost-controlled.
George D’Arcy, Shell’s Retail Marketing Manager, says the “Personal
Guaranteed Service Plan’ ’ has been designed to cater for a growing
need in the community for better car maintenance and repair.
‘ ‘The general attitude of Australian motorists to car servicing is one
of uncertainty, mistrust and high costs” he said.
Mr D’Arcy said research had shown that motorists feel:
-that service costs are invariably higher than they thought
they would be;
-that they are often treated as a number rather than an
individual;
-that service programmes are inflexible and largely ignore
the customer’s personal requirements.
Under the new Plan, the customer
is quoted a price for service
before any work is
commenced-and the price
quoted is the price paid.
The type of service and the length between service is decided by the
motorists and their Auto Care dealers after discussing the car’s usage
and the owner’s driving habits. Depending on car usage, services
will be performed at intervals varying between 1 and 4 months.
‘ ‘No car is the same, no driver is the same and that is why we have
tried to introduce a truly personalised service plan” said Mr D’Arcy.
Three types of service are offered;
SERVICE “A” covers 75 points and includes a full lubrication
service and checks on lights, car interior, under body,
exhaust system, suspension/steering and under bonnet
tests. The service starts and ends with a road test and costs
$47.50.
SERVICE “B” provides in addition a tune-up, wheel
balancing, an emission control service and tightening of the
engine manifold, at a cost of $95.
SERVICE “C” adds to the items covered by ‘ ‘A’ ’ and “B”
a full brake service, change of brake fluid, repacking of
front or rear wheel bearings, wheel alignment, service to
cooling system. Cost-sl6o. It can also cover at extra cost
the additional items of automatic transmission and
airconditioning-the choice is yours.
No additional work is done without the owner’s permission and all
work is covered by a national guarantee signed and stamped into a
motorist’s service book-a guarantee which will be honoured by all
300 Auto Care dealers throughout Australia.
To ensure standards of workmanship, the Institute of Automotive
and Mechanical Engineers is putting each Auto Care mechanic
through a servicing course, and each dealer is obliged to meet
standards set by a National Auto Care Advisory Council. The
Institute is also checking to ensure that dealers are using up-to-date
tools and electronic equipment.
‘ ‘lf a dealer is not up to scratch, he will lose his Auto Care
accreditation” Mr D’Arcy said.
The Auto Care Guarantee
will be honoured by
300 dealers around
Australia.

Dualprice controls reduceprofits.
The dual Federal-State price controls on petrol, which operated until
mid-1984, helped reduce the profitability of the oil refining and
marketing industry in Australia, as the recent Annual Report of the
Prices Surveillance Authority shows. The seven major oil companies
involved in refining and marketing made a combined loss of
$69 million in 1983.
After the withdrawal of three large companies from the market, the
closure of two refineries and the loss of a large number of jobs, those
State Governments which insisted on having their own, tougher
price controls have realised the negative effect of their intervention
and have withdrawn from the field, leaving the Prices Surveillance
Authority as the national body setting petrol prices.
This is a major step towards the desirable goal of allowing market
forces to operate more freely in the petroleum industry, to the
ultimate benefit of consumers. Although the market remains
oversupplied and very competitive, this is something which any
business has to contend with and Shell does not seek any protection
in the market place.
Discounting remains a factor in today’s market and, as the
accompanying chart shows, the brunt of the discounting is borne
by the oil company wholesaler and to a lesser extent by the retailer.
The government and oil producer revenue remains untouched by
price wars.

The renewed interest in the Australian film industry in recent years has
been concentrated largely on feature films, neglecting the long history of
documentary films in this country. Shell Australia founded its tradition of
documentary films with “The Petroleum Industry,” which was produced
and screened across the country in 1926.
At about the same time, the company established public theatrettes in the
Shell office in each state as well as mobile film units to travel to and screen
its growing list of productions in outback towns. Often these showings
provided the only entertainment of its type to reach the more isolated
towns.
The films were shown from trucks equipped with a generator-many
towns had no electricity-two projectors and a screen. Sometimes there
were four screenings a day, every day for months, and often 200 miles to
cover between towns. With practically no bitumen outside the main
towns, the stories of the Shell trucks being towed into town after being
bogged in the black or red soil are legion.
While the Shell film trucks toured the outback, often going for six months
without plugging into town power, films were shown in the capital cities
every night at the Shell theatrettes and in suburban clubs and schools.
In 1935, as projection equipment became more readily available
throughout Australia and the demand for films grew, a lending library was
established and by 1939, Shell had produced more than thirty Australian
documentary and educational films.
Although Shell Australia has never stopped producing its own
documentary films, a Shell Film Unit was established in London in 1933
to concentrate on the production of technical and specialised films for use
all over the world. Many of the theories and techniques now accepted on
the production and use of documentary, instructional and scientific films
were developed by that unit, the first to be attached directly to an
industrial organisation.
During World War D, Shell’s production facilities were placed at the
disposal of the Department of Information but the screenings continued,
mainly in army camps, with technical and medical documentaries being
shown to special corps in each of the state Shell theatrettes.
After the war, the Australian Film Unit enjoyed a busy production period
through until the mid 19605. Some of the memorable titles from this era
were “The Back of Beyond” “The Great Barrier Reef” “The Forerunner”
“Farming for the Future” “Two Men of Fiji” and the “Shell’s Australia”
series.
In 1949 when television first came to Australia, it was Shell which
barnstormed the country with “Shellevision” giving Australians their
first taste of a medium that was to become such a large part of their lives.
This early connection with television continued when transmissions
began in Australia in 1956, for many of the documentary films shown on
television were drawn from the Shell Film Library.
The 1950 s were also a growth period for commercial cinemas and film
makers, drive-in theatres and state film centres and suddenly, films were
no longer a novelty.
Shell didn’t withdraw from producing films in Australia. However, it did
close down its theatrettes and the mobile film shows. The concentration
was on the Shell Film Library as a place where schools and community
groups could borrow Shell films free of charge: films designed to show
the way something works or how to do something; films dealing with
achievements in lubrication, aviation, motor racing, new products, new
agricultural processes, new technology, the correct use of insecticides, the
land and its people; films designed to make a contribution towards the
solution of problems of national importance, to the development of a
greater understanding of Australians by Australians, and a better
knowledge of our country by people overseas.
Shell Australia’s latest documentary film, “Same Seasons” to be released
in early 1985, will give an individualistic view of Japan and Australia
today-the similarities and the differences between two nations that have
a common bond through trading ties.
Today’s Shell Film Library, a free lending service to schools and
community groups throughout Australia, has grown out of a service first

LPG supplies on line.
Consumers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in Sydney, Brisbane and
Adelaide can look forward to greater availability and security of
supply following major new investments in distribution facilities by
Shell and other companies.
Construction of these facilities coincides with the introduction of
new sources of LPG from Queensland’s Surat Basin and the Cooper
Basin of South Australia. They will supplement the current sources
of supply-Bass Strait and oil refineries-for the 600,000 tonnes a
year Australian market.
Peter Blundell, Shell’s LPG Manager, said, “LPG costs about half the
price of premium motor gasoline, and is an attractive, cheaper
alternative fuel, not only for taxis and fleet operators, but
increasingly for private motorists.
1 ‘Automotive use of LPG is greatest in Melbourne and is consistently
growing there by 20 per cent a year; ’ Mr Blundell said. “In other
States, which were then distant from supply sources, the market
was initially slow in taking off. After this slow start, growth in
Sydney, for example, was spectacular during the early 1980 s but it
was choked off last year simply because we had insufficient supply
capability. Not surprisingly, this led to consumer uncertainty. We are
now able to overcome this.”
Shell is sharing with three other companies in an investment of
535 million to overcome this problem by installing refrigerated

storage at Port Botany capable of receiving LPG brought from Bass
Strait or the Cooper Basin by sea. A specialised bulk LPG carrier will
complete a round trip between Port Botany and Westernport every
eight days, enabling 380,000 tonnes of LPG a year to be brought
to Sydney.
A further $7 million has been spent on a “day” storage and truck
loading facility which employs the latest technology and safety
features and is computer controlled.
Mr Blundell said that a similar lack of supply capability in Brisbane
was eased early in 1984: ‘ ‘ln January of this year a new 1000 tonne
terminal commenced operation at Pinkenba. This terminal is
extremely flexible and can both receive and export LPG by road
or sea and can be readily adapted for rail. The commencement of LPG
supply from the Surat Basin early next year heralds a new phase of
growth in the Queensland market.’ ’
“Adelaide also has benefitted from a new source of supply-the
Cooper Basin in the north of the State, linked by pipeline to the Port
Bonython terminal” Mr Blundell continued. “As well as supplying
South Australian demand, some of this LPG will be exported.’ ’
Shell’s automotive LPG is sold under the “Gogas’ ’ brand name.
In recent months, Shell acquired the 50 per cent of Gogas Australia
which was previously owned by BHP, giving Shell full ownership of
the company.

With distances measured almost in telephone numbers-Darwin to
Alice Springs, for instance, is a four day, 1519 km road haul-Shell
Australia solves the problem of distribution in the Northern Territory
with a fleet of highway giants. Five triple road trains, each with
more than 12 times the length of the average family car, are used to
deliver products from the main terminal in Darwin to depots along
the Stuart Highway to Alice Springs.
Nowadays a familiar sight in the relatively flat vastness of the
Northern Territory, the road trains are made up of three trailers
hitched to a 400 hp prime mover. Fifty metres in length, each is
capable of hauling up to 75 tonnes in weight-the equivalent of
103,000 litres of motor gasoline. All five units are on the move
every day of the week.
The Shell
Report
In turn, Shell Australia’s distributors use road trains to carry the goods
from their nearest depot to the remotest corners of the territory
and across the borders into Western Australia and Queensland.
Road trains need a special type of driver, drivers who can cope with
long periods away from the home; bed down in the sleeper compart-
ment in the truck’s cabin; organise their own meals if necessary, and
still occupy themselves to keep within sensible driving rules and
practices and to maintain the expected delivery schedules.

THE ARTS
An unusual millionaire
saves an orchestral tour
Western Australia is already in ferment over the America’s Cup challenge, with millions being
spent like water. But the Festival of Perth has been struggling. BRIAN HOAD reports on how
one of the West’s millionaires came to the rescue.
AMONG PERTH’S many multi-
millionaires, Denis Horgan has
emerged as one of the few who seem to
be making some attempt to change the
ugly face of capitalism. His latest
gesture of some $lOO,OOO or so has
saved next year’s Australian tour by the
London Philharmonic Orchestra.
Horgan is best known for the savage
mauling he received following the
McCabe-Lafranchi report on bottom-
of-the-harbor tax-avoidance schemes in
1982. He was given a clean bill of health
in the von Doussa report of 1983. A
somewhat mellower public image has
begun to emerge since.
For a start, the wines, particularly the
chardonnays from his 10-year-old,
llOOha Leeuwin Estate in the lush
Margaret River area some 250 km south-
west of Perth, are suddenly winning
accolades all around the world and
selling like hot cakes on the local
market for $2O a bottle and more.
Particularly interesting was the
recent opening of his new business
headquarters, Barrack House on Perth’s
posh St George’s Terrace. To the bewil-
derment of many a fellow millionaire,
Hogan used this prime business site to
erect a simple, single-storey, colonial
style building. Its neighbor is the old
Barracks Archway, the last pathetic
remnant of the 1860 s headquarters of
the original soldier-settlers. The juxta-
position of the two buildings in the
surrounding concrete jungle which is
now the city centre serves to underline
just how ruthless the
redevelopment of Perth
has been over the past 20
years.
And now Horgan is
causing another stir by
giving money to the arts.
The London Philhar-
monic Orchestra’s tour was
originally organised by
David Blenkinsop, the
director of the annual Fes-
tival of Perth, as one of the
highlights of next year’s
cultural binge February
Denis Horgan
The Footsbarn Travelling Theatre’s King Lear: “Rough-as-guts theatre”
15 to March 9. Like all good entre-
preneurs in the public sector of the arts,
where government subsidies are (to say
the least) unreliable, Blenkinsop lives
dangerously, making his plans first and
worrying about where the money is
coming from later.
It is no small deal shipping a 105-
piece orchestra and 30 tonnes of
baggage around the world. To make the
visit financially viable, Blenkinsop first
contacted his mates in the ever-growing
Confederation of Australian Arts
Centres. Three concerts were arranged
for Perth, two for the Victorian Arts
Centre, two for the Sydney
Opera House and two for
the Queensland Arts
Centre the first time that
Queensland has ever
hosted a major overseas
orchestra.
Yet, despite the horrify-
ing performance schedule
of nine concerts in 10 days
(the spare day being
needed to ship everybody
from Perth to Melbourne),
despite ticket prices hiked
as high as possible, the tour
still needed another $lOO,OOO or so to
make it possible.
The West Australian government
wasn’t interested, indeed hasn’t shown
much interest at all in next year’s
Festival of Perth. The Australia Coun-
cil, which is currently going through a
period of lunacy, withdrew festival
funds altogether. And it began to look
as if Blenkinsop had lost his gamble and
the tour was off.
Enter Denis Horgan.
His Leeuwin Estate is not just any
old winery but more a country retreat, a
place of great rustic charm, developed
and landscaped with love and care,
meadows and babbling brook and Karri
trees and peace and tranquility a
perfect setting, thought Horgan, for
some sort of Australian Glyndebourne.
Indeed, he had thought of asking the
Australian Opera to add substance to
his dream, but they don’t cross the
rabbit-proof fence these days. So if the
LPO would play in his vineyard, he
would ensure that their Australian tour
took place.
Blenkinsop recalls that the idea first
came as a bit of a shock to the LPO
when he put it to them over the


Medieval Players’ cast members: ancient, bawdy texts to delight modern audiences
TESSA MUSGRAVE
telephone. They had horrible visions of
being stranded in some fly-blown
desert, instruments slowly buckling in
the brazen sun. But their fears were
soon enough allayed, the tour was on
again and the LPO will now give its first
Australian concert in a meadow by a
babbling brook on February 23. To add
a special piquancy to the swelling scene,
Yevgeny Svetlanov, head of the USSR
Symphony Orchestra, has decided to
take a holiday from snowy Moscow and
act as guest conductor in an all-Russian
program on this special occasion.
Tickets are selling fast. With-a bit of
luck, Leeuwin Estate could take as
much as $lOO,OOO at the box office.
Little recognised as such in the East,
the Festival of Perth was the first major
arts festival established in Australia
way back in 1953. For years it was a
rather small-scale affair centred on the
campus of the University of WA.
All that began to change when David
Blenkinsop, a former director of the
Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra,
arrived to stage his first festival in 1977.
The Festival of Perth began to become
both more adventurous and more
populist in its approach, and more
ambitious in scope and scale.
Much like its younger, some would
say more pretentious, somewhat bigger
and certainly better-known sister, the
Adelaide Festival, the Perth festival
goes on evolving festivals within the
festival. There is the large and highly
popular film festival, the children’s fes-
tival, there are jazz and folk festivals,
even a bit of a sports festival. And next
year for the first time there will be a
“literature festival” at which that
formidable English novelist Doris
Lessing will officiate as high priestess.
But the hard core of the Festival of
Perth remains, as always, its musical
and theatrical offerings with a good mix
of local, interstate and international
contributions. Next year, for example,
the classical clarity of Frans Bruggen’s
Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century
from Amsterdam will contrast nicely
with the romantic grandeur of the Lon-
don Philharmonic. Modern
astringencies will be provided by one of
Australia’s leading contemporary
ensembles, Flederman. David Measham
and the West Australian Symphony
Orchestra will storm the
vast Entertainment Centre
for a series of entertaining
promenade concerts. Sol-
oists will include that
übiquitous guitarist, John
Williams, and local-girl-
made-good (on the in-
ternational operatic stage)
Glenys Fowles. Russian
violinist Igor Oistrakh and
French pianist Bernard
D’Ascoli will be among the
recitalists.
The eastern states may
not be much aware of the
Festival of Perth, but they certainly
benefit from its entrepreneurial flair
particularly in theatre. Two of the most
outstanding visiting companies on this
year’s national circuit, Brazil’s
Macunaima and Japan’s Teneki
Gekijyo came out of the West. And
Perth will send some colorful surprises
next year too.
England’s Medieval Players are
experts in adapting ancient (and usually
bawdy) texts to the delight of modern
audiences. A theatre collective from
Parma, Italy, is threatening to be out-
rageous with a “cheeky” version of
Macbeth. The Poppie Nongena Com-
pany from South Africa is bringing
some nightmarish impressions of black
life under apartheid. And then there is
this extraordinary Footsbarn Travelling
Theatre ...
Footsbarn doesn’t come from
David Blenkinsop
anywhere in particular anymore. It just
wanders the world with 10 actors, 11
technicians, a dozen or so children, a
couple of teachers, caravans for living
in and a large tent to perform in.
Actually, they originated somewhere in
the south-west of England, but have
been plodding round Europe and Am-
erica for years now. They will plod
around Australia next year, from Perth
to Kalgoorlie, Whyalla, Alice Springs,
Tennant Creek, Katherine, Darwin, Mt
Isa, Townsville ... And by March 1986
they should have reached the Adeladie
Festival, thanks to the Festival of Perth.
They will perform their own crazy
version of King Lear; low comedies for
clowns, troubadors and madmen such
as Circus Tosov; fairground fables such
as Chinese Puzzle. “Rough-as-guts
theatre,” says Blenkinsop, but en-
thusiastically, for here he has taken on
one of the most complex en-
trepreneurial challenges of his career.
And because most of the highlights
of the Festival of Perth, whether the
glamorous London Philharmonic
Orchestra or the rough-as-guts
Footsbarns, find their way to the East,
the East seldom goes to the Festival of
Perth. But things are changing rapidly.
West Australian Premier Brian Burke
sees tourism becoming the state’s
biggest industry by the turn
of the century. And pre-
sumably the festival will go
on growing and changing
too.
The current state of ex-
citement is focused on the
modest and friendly
clubhouse of the Royal
Perth Yacht Club at Pel-
ican Point on the lazy
Swan River. Upstairs in
the little observation room
they’ve got this large, ex-
cessively ornate and
somewhat battered 19th-
century wine jug. It’s the America’s
Cup, focal point of an unprecedented
outburst of capitalistic frenzy.
Hotels and marinas and apartment
blocks and casinos and things like that
are sprouting up all over the place, in
Perth and Fremantle and up and down
the coast. Figures fly around like straws
in a cyclone. Is it $5OO million or $lOOO
million that is being invested in these
tourist projects? Is it 500,000 or 999,000
tourists who are expected to descend on
this isolated little city in 1987? All that
is known for sure is that there’s lots of
money to be made.
And has the Festival of Perth been
told to start thinking big too? David
Blenkinsop gets a far-away look in his
eyes and explains crisply that the WA
government has not yet answered his
letters of last August asking what funds
he might expect for 1985. □


VICTORIA
Unsung hero
at the centre
of change
By MARGOT HILTON
IN ALL the hoo-ha surrounding the
opening of the Victorian Arts Centre
and the history of its creation, Eric
Westbrook, former director of the
Victorian Ministry for the Arts and the
man who wrote the original brief for the
centre, was hardly mentioned.
The initial impetus for the creation
of a Victorian cultural centre had come
in the 1940 s from composer Margaret
Sutherland, her colleagues and Sir
Keith Murdoch. Because of a rapid
succession of changes of government,
however, nothing had been done be-
yond acquisition of the site by the
Yarra.
It took the arrival of Premier Sir
Henry Bolte and then Westbrook to get
things moving again.
Westbrook picked up the baton by
persuading the Bolte government to
develop the site. In the process, he told
them what a cultural centre was, why a
need for it existed and outlined the
accommodation which ideally it should
offer to the varying art forms.
His concept came to fruition on
October 29 when the State, Playhouse
and Studio theatres were unveiled form-
ally in full working order. Ken Myer,
chairman of the Arts Centre Trust,
mentioned Westbrook briefly in the
panoply of those other (mostly dead)
people responsible for establishing the
centre. This was a marginal improve-
ment on events at the official opening of
the Concert Hall the year before when,
in five speeches (the usherettes receiving
their full measure of thanks),
Westbrook was not named.
His involvement began as newly-
appointed director of the National
Gallery of Victoria on Daryl Lindsay’s
retirement in 1956. Westbrook’s first
report to the trustees conceptualised the
new gallery as an integral part of his
overview of the cultural centre. This
report gave the trustees the ammunition
to galvanise the Bolte government into
committing funds to implementing
Westbrook’s vision.
Bolte established a “building com-
mittee of citizens” with the responsibil-
ity for getting the centre built and
Westbrook became its first executive
officer.
When the gallery was completed and
the committee poised to address itself to
the theatre projects, Westbrook was
quietly dropped. After representations,
he was invited back to continue as
Former arts supremo Eric Westbrook: little formal recognition
BRIAN FERGUSON
professional adviser a role he
maintained until his retirement in Sep-
tember 1980.
Westbrook’s intimate involvement
with the success of the Victorian Arts
Centre was only the beginning of his
substantial contribution to the state’s
overall arts scene.
When he first went to the National
Gallery in 1956, five regional galleries,
run on a voluntary basis by city council
committees, were in existence. By the
time he left to establish the first
Australian state ministry for the Arts 17
years later, Victoria had a fully pro-
fessional network of 16 regional
galleries the envy of the rest of the
country.
Moving from his work at the
National Gallery to the ministry was a
natural transition. He had been in-
strumental in steering state government
grants into the regional gallery pro-
gram; in establishing composers’
forums, concerts and poetry readings in
the context of a gallery environment; in
organising the festivities commemorat-
ing the National Gallery’s centenary.
(One of these, an extensive children’s
art activity at Kew Town Hall, was
where Australian National Gallery
director James Mollison got his first
blooding!)
Westbrook was confronted by a
mammoth task, as he told The Bulletin:
“When (former premier Rupert)
Hamer decided he would create a
ministry for the Arts, I was appointed
director and I was given two members
of staff Essie Wicks (the ministry’s
present community arts officer) and a
driver but no car! That was it! We had a
room at the National Gallery crammed
with files that every government depart-
ment thought had anything to do with
the arts just threw at us. Then we
acquired some vigorous young people
and the whole thing took off.
“As the first arts ministry in
Australia, we had no guidelines and no
policy. We were forced to be our own
salvation. I suppose my great advantage
was the fact that I’d worked for two
major governmental organisations in
Britain (the Arts Council of Great
Britain and the British Council), so I
did at least have an idea of how to go
about structuring it.”
Westbrook’s ideas on ministry activi-
ties and evolving and implementing
its policies resulted in a burgeoning of
all art forms across the state. A network
of regional performing arts centres par-
alleled his former initiatives with the
regional galleries. Music, dance, drama,
the visual arts and crafts all flourished
during the period of his office.
Given the breadth of his contribu-
tion, it is curious indeed that he has
received little formal recognition,
acknowledgement.or even thanks. □


FILMS
Drifting to
an eccentric
triumph
By SANDRA HALL
THE TITLE of Wim Wenders’ Paris,
Texas, which won the Palme d’Or at the
Cannes festival this year, is no more
than a conceit a conjunction of
European and American associations
which pleased the director
because it expresses the trans-
Atlantic nature of his attitude
to cinema.
He picked the title from a
map because he liked it and
because the United States has
22 townships called Paris as
opposed to only 16 Berlins
an arbitrary decision, if you
like, but not an especially
remarkable one during the
making of a film in which a
third of the shooting was done
before the second half of the
script was written.
Like his compatriot
Werner Herzog, Wenders
seems to get more satisfaction
out of the making of his films
than out of contemplation of
the finished article. But,
unlike Herzog, Wenders man-
ages to convey in every frame
this sensuous whole-hearted
love of cinema and all that
goes with it at least when
the luck and the money are
with him. This time, he had
both. Paris, Texas is a sprawl-
ing, eccentric triumph whose flaws are
overcome by the eerie grandeur of its
landscapes and compassionate regard
for the human beings they enclose.
Like his 1970 s trilogy (Alice in the
Cities, False Movement and Kings of the
Road), it is a road movie and Wenders
uses each of his three principal loca-
tions the Texas desert, the suburbs of
Los Angeles and the streets and
skyscrapers of Houston as a
counterpoint to the others. It is a film
about distance, employed not as a
metaphor for freedom but seen as
something perilous in which drowning
is very easy.
When the film opens, Wenders’ hero,
Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is stum-
bling into a desert settlement. He is
dressed improbably in a suit and tie
with nothing in his wallet but the
address of his brother Walt. Walt ar-
rives and patiently begins to shepherd
Travis back to life, eventually taking
him home to Los Angeles and to Hunter
(Hunter Carson), the seven-year-old son
Travis had abandoned four years before
with young wife, Jane.
Subsequently, he learns, Jane also
disappeared. Walt and his wife, Anne,
treat the boy as theirs. The couple are
terrified by the possibility that this
strange man, gradually recovering from
catatonia, may exercise his right as a
parent and take Hunter away from them
but their sense of decency will not let
them keep father and son apart.
Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clement
are tremendously affecting as this
civilised, considerate pair she hinting
from time to time at the exhaustion and
Nastassja Kinski in Paris, Texas: compensation for its faults
desperation under her Parisian grace-
fulness while he plays to perfection a
man uneasily aware that doing the right
thing is going to get him nowhere.
And, gradually, the inevitable
happens. As Travis mends, he and the
boy draw closer together. When at last
Travis decides the time has come to go
looking for Jane (Nastassja Kinski), to
try to make sense of the lost years,
Hunter goes too.
Sam Shepard wrote the screenplay,
using as inspiration some of the themes
and images he had touched on in his
book Motel Chronicles. Although it is a
story about drifting, it is also about the
enormous effort which human beings
sometimes have to make in order to give
shape and symmetry to their lives an
idea which Wenders expresses through
the film’s settings.
Walt and Anne, for example, have
settled in a house perched like a bird’s
nest above the ceaseless movement of
airport and freeway as if trying to keep
themselves safe from the confusion
below. And Travis has only one thing in
mind when he staggers, disorientated,
on to the screen: he wants to find a tract
of land he owns in Paris, Texas
bought sight unseen because he
remembered it as a place his parents
talked about and he has an idea that he
was conceived there.
Children repeat the patterns
described by their parents; the past
conditions the future and haunts the
present. In one of the most moving
sequences, Anne, Walt, Hunter and
Travis sit down together to watch a
home movie taken years before on
holiday. Jane, Travis and
Hunter are seen playing
together before the camera
and the sense of people taking
pleasure in one another’s
company is so palpable and
so poignant that when the
lights go up it has bestowed
itself like a blessing on the
four watching and Hunter
and Travis have begun slowly
to open up to one another.
The second half, in which
Travis tracks Jane down to a
porno house in which she has
a job as a flesh-and-blood
fantasy figure talking by
telephone to customers who
study her from behind a pane
of one-way glass, is less suc-
cessful. It suffers from all
those script changes.
Wenders’ nonchalant attitude
to logical plot development is
more noticeable here and
Hunter has become not so
much a character as a pawn in
the storyline.
Yet, even this lapse does
not detract from the film’s
emotional resonance. Although the
script requires Stanton to move through
extraordinary changes in mood and
personality, his quiet, deliberate, strung-
out style makes Travis work as a
character as well as a catalyst and
Kinski’s luminous child-woman looks
are perfect for Jane who is an emana-
tion as much as a character talked
about and visualised as a symbol of all
that Travis has lost, long before she is
confronted.
Paris, Texas doesn’t take much an-
alysis. The faults are obvious if you
want to consider them. But, if you can
take it on its dreamily illogical terms,
the compensations are marvellous.
Paris, Texas: in Sydney at the Roma and
the Village, Double Bay; in Melbourne at
the Rivoli. Soon for other states.

TELEVISION
Why a
politician
needs a mate
By RON SAW
IF TELEVISION proved anything at
all during the wretched electoral cam-
paign, now mercifully over and done
with, it proved that politicians are lucky
with their wives.
Never mind about the so-called
Great Debate: it might have been
scripted during a morning tea session in
one of the greyer, redder-taped, duller
departments of the commonwealth
public service and touched up by a
cliche machine from the Politicians’
Smug Club.
Every few minutes, one candidate or
the other made it “ perfectly clear’’ when
it (the matter under discussion) was
perfectly obscure. Both indicated when
they could have said. Peacock won the
debate but only because his team
make-up, hair-styling, direction was
better.
But consider the really good TV
appearances that had been made by:
■ Hazel Hawke, with Terry Willesee:
quiet, dignified and sincere on the awful
subject of her family and drugs.
■ Margaret Peacock, whose in-
terviews on the ABC and other channels
showed her to be quick-witted yet light
as thistledown where Andrew tends to
be plummy, ponderous and shallow-
profound.
■ Rosemary Sinclair, who was
described by Mike Willesee as her
husband’s greatest political asset. When
lan Sinclair tried to get away with
nothing more than.a hide like a blue-
swimmer crab and very nearly lost, she
polite, frank, as beautiful as ever
saved him, beat Willesee in a canter.
They take no part in “real,” ie, Pooh-
bah, politics but they win votes if only
because Fred Nurk-in-the-street tends
to say that anyone who can pick a
missus like that must be a good bloke.
ONY a few years ago, in the good old
wowser-time, differences between the
sexes if, indeed, there were any had
nothing to do with Sex.
If two Persons were on a bed
together, one had to have a foot on the
floor. The Pecksniffs were pretty sure
that, with only three legs, nothing Like
That could take place.
Then TV brought ads for underarm
deodorants (the armpits never hirsute,
though: God forbid!); and next came
wet T-shirts and knobbly eeehl nipples.
Now we have ads for unguents which
show 20 degree views of eeehl female
breasts; and there is still worse. In The
Love Boat (9), we had a “comedy
situation” based on a man being in the
sack with a naked woman not his wife
eeehl And the situation wound up with
this same hog wandering around weak-
kneed after a night of exhausting
passion with his wife eeeeehl eeeeehl
THE CHANNEL 10 (Sydney) poll,
Doctors v Government, may have been
on the level. From 48,000 calls, 53.1
percent were pro-doctor and 46.9 anti.
Those with a snout on the doctors
were asked to call one number, those
agin the government to call another. I
tried both and even with 180 lines
available, could get neither: no answer,
busy line or “This is a Telecom record-
ing. Check the number ...” And per-
haps a dozen who called me, complain-
ing, said that they had been trying to get
the anti-doctor number, 11-622.
A dozen. So a dozen voices in such a
big poll is significant?
If they take the trouble to call the
press, a dozen represents a lot.
EXERCISES in futility (cont): The
news-hawks were conned again by the
threat of a brawl between the Reverend
Fred Nile, the great Sydney Pecksniff,
and homosexuals outside a steambath
and/or love nest in gay, giddy Oxford
Street. Oh, boy!
One of Fred’s soldiers a grizzled,
grumpy woman and a young, good-
looking, exasperated man shrieked un-
intelligibly at each other and all around
them arose a hissing as from a pit of
serpents. There must be more edifying
events to film.
AND there must be things more edify-
ing, or soul-straightening or interesting
or even less laughable than Max Walsh
reporting (ABC) that Bob Hawke and
his boys had a $l5O-a-head luncheon in
Sydney with (gasp, unusual widening of
eyes) bankers, brokers and others
demonstrably not of the good old
bowyang brigade.
It would not do for “Nugget”
Coombs, said Max, somehow managing
to suggest that he Max (or Nugget, if
you like) gave at least half of his vast
salary to the wurkiz. And, if that ever
comes to pass, I’ll sign up with the
aforementioned Nile.
AS LONG as 1 have heard it from
Australians, Poms and, most important,
West Indians the name of Gordon
Greenidge, the great Windies opening
bat, has been pronounced Gren-ij.
But the Nine Network’s Tony Greig
insists on making it Green-ij. In
heaven’s name, why?
Greig has' been a distinguished
cricketer. He has probably known
Greenidge since he was a boy in short
pants. If Greig hears as he must so
many others pronounce it properly, why
on earth can’t he?
SLOWLY but surely, newspaper news
and news-feature-gathering is being
beaten into dreariness by TV. As a
journalist who started in newspapers, I
hate it but it’s true.
During the Brisbane Test, lan
Chappell interviewed Wes Hall and
produced a nice little offbeat story
about Hall’s son Shaun who is a hoop.
He rode a favorite into second place on
the Gold Coast.
The newspapers ignored it, did not
give the story to a good color reporter,
did not acknowledge that anything on
TV might be worth following up.
They’re crazy. □

BOOKS
Gift buyer’s guide to the big books
It has been a big year for major book projects. PATRICIA ROLFE, in the
first of a series, looks at the big format books you can buy to read over
the holidays or to give as an ideal gift.
IN RECENT years, it may be that more
large format books have ended up on
remainder tables than on coffee tables,
There are some signs that the floodtide
of 1970 s over-production is receding
although, every time you decide that
(when another chain of discount shops
goes bust), a new shop opens down the
street -
In spite of this, it has been a good
year for major projects which need
talent and labor as well as capital and
which should remain the standard work
for years. Top of the list for entertain-
ment is Stephen Murray-Smith’s
Dictionary of Australian Quotations,
from Heinemann at $45 with a limited
edition of 150 copies at $l5O. Hutchin-
son have issued a two-volume, major
revision of Alan McCulloch’s Encyclop-
aedia of Australian Art at SBS. Collins
have a useful one-volume Australian
Encyclopaedia at $49.45.
The Reader's Digest Book of the
Great Barrier Reef at $35, is wonder-
fully detailed and as beautiful with
more than 800 color photographs as
its subject. The book was designed and
produced by Mead and Beckett.
Reader’s Digest believe it uniquely
combines a general introduction to the
subject with scientific detail.
The shelves which must baffle the
Christmas shopper are those of
Australiana. We are up to our eyeballs
in large-format books. Just run along
the shelf: Australia: Image of a Nation;
Australian Historical Landscapes;
Australia’s Natural Heritage; Australia’s
Natural Wonders (there are two of these,
both new )\ Australia: Portrait of a Con-
tinent; Australia: The Timeless Con-
tinent; Australia: The Beautiful Wilder-
ness; Our Australia; Australia’s
Heritage; Australia: A Way of Life;
Australia: A Land Down Under;
Australia’s Wilderness Experience;
Australia’s Living Heritage; Australia: A
Celebration; The Colors of Australia;
Australia: A Special Place; Wild
Landscapes of Australia; Australia:
Land of Many Dreams; This Is
Australia; Australia: People and Places;
Australia in Pictures; Presenting
Australia.
(That’s enough Australia - Ed.)
And that does not include books on


cities, houses, harbors, homesteads,
wars, events, discoveries, history, art,
etcetera. Most of these books are good
of their type; at least, few are poor.
The trouble is that, these days, every
bushwalker carries a camera in his
backpack. The countryside is crawling
with people learning more about it.
Clearly, we cannot reach the point when
more people are producing books about
Australia than are reading them. And
we cannot rely on Paul Hogan’s tourists
to pay excess baggage to cart them away.
Intelligent planning does not always
ensure that publishers reach the market
with the right book at the right time,
Other publishers plan intelligently, too.
This year, there are a lot of new books
on birds.
Neville Cayley’s classic What Bird Is
That? has been issued in a lavish new
edition by Angus and Robertson at
$59.95. It includes more than 400 pre-
viously unpublished paintings. Oxford
have done a facsimile of volume 1 of
North's Nests and Eggs of Australian
Birds ($80) which dates from 1901. They
plan to do the whole work.
The Birds of Australia (Currey
O’Neil Ross, $35.95) has illustrations by
Nicolas Day and field information
edited by Ken Simpson. Melbourne
University Press have The Atlas of
Australian Birds, by Margaret Blakers,
Stephen Davies and Pauline Reilly at
$49. This sets out in detail distribution
of species through Australia, both those
which breed here and regular visitors.
Nelson have Birds of Prey of Australia
with photographs and text by David
Hollands at S4O. Australia’s 35 species
are included. Lansdowne have In Quest
of Bower Birds by Norman Chaffer at
$29.95. Chaffer’s quest has been a 60-
year one.
Fashion or costume (there A a differ-
ence) also receives attention. Cedric
Flower’s Duck and Cabbage Tree was
virtually alone for years. Kangaroo
Press have revised and updated it as
Clothes in Australia ($25). Collins have
Best Dressed by Alexandra Joel (soft
cover at $19.95) which concentrates on
fashion in the 20th century. Oxford
have at S4O Costume in Australia by
Marion Fletcher, former curator of
costume at the National Gallery of
Victoria. Kevin Weldon has his dashing
The Great Aussie Fashion at $24.95.
One of the oldest tricks in the busi-
ness is the illustrated edition, aimed
sometimes at making a mediocre text
look more interesting. This time, how-
ever, two of the best books to appear in
this country in decades have had rather
splendid treatment from their
publishers. Viking have a new edition of
A. B. Facey’s A Fortunate Life at $29.95
and Angus and Robertson have redone
Eric Rolls’ They All Ran Wild at the
same price,
Nelson have published Tlte ll-
lustrated Treasury of Australian Verse
($25). Beatrice Davis, friend and editor
of many of the poets, chose the verse,
Paintings, drawings and photographs
add a new dimension to the familiar,
Two English books also have been
dressed up in fancy new editions. Elm
Tree/Nelson have George and Weedon
Grossmith’s The Diary of a Nobody at
$25. Laurie Lee’s Cider with Rosie his
story of growing up in a Cotswolds
village in the first decades of this
century has been issued by
Doubleday, illustrated and cased in
green fabric with white spots at $24.95.
In the 25 years since it was first
published, Cider with Rosie has sold
more than two million copies,
Another compendium of the familiar
is Masterpieces of Australian Painting
(Bay Books, $29.95), selected by Martin
Terry. Lin Bloomfield’s Norman
Lindsay: Impulse to Draw is also from
Bay Books, at $39.95. Lindsay used a
pencil from childhood to old age. Im-
pulse to Draw has pencil drawings from
1889 when Lindsay was 10 to 1968, the


year before his death at 90. There are
plenty of nudes but sketches of animals,
of a young Douglas Stewart, of Balzac’s
house and of the boxer Tommy Burns
give a clearer idea of his lively mind.
The photography book to give this
year probably is Cameraworks by
English artist David Hockney (Thames
and Hudson, S9O), although William
Yang’s Sydney Diary 1974-1984 (James
Fraser, $45) will give it a run for its
money. More modestly, the National
Library has re-issued its fine Cazneaux
photographs, selected by Max Dupain,
at $25.
Diane Arbus is to the average
photographer what a caricaturist is to a
watercolorist. Arbus goes for the most
unappealing result, in many ways no
more “real” than the retouched flatter-
ing picture. Diane Arbus is published by
Aperture, distributed by Allen and
Unwin and is $39.95.
Two new books are on male dance:
Men Dancing by Alexander Bland and
John Percival (Hodder and Stoughton
$39.95) and Dancer: Men in Dance by
Mary Clarke and Clement Crisp
(BBC/Pitman, $29.95). Pavlova: Impres-
sions, presented by Margot Fonteyn
(Hodder and Stoughton, $35) is the
latest on the great ballerina.
Among good-looking new books are:
■ Lives of the Indian Princes
(Doubleday, $29.95) in which Charles
Allen (author of Plain Tales of the Raj)
and Sharada Dwivedi helped by color
pictures tell the story of the
Maharajas who, Kipling wrote, were
created by Providence “to offer man-
kind a spectacle.”
■ Pastoral Properties of Australia
(Allen and Unwin, $29.95) in which
Peter Taylor describes the lives and
houses of the nearest we have gone to
princes. Decorative Cast Iron in
Australia (Currey O’Neil Ross $39.95) is
a definitive book on the most distinctive
feature of our Victorian architecture.
■ The Stockman (Lansdowne, $35)
takes you to the other end of the scale.
■ Cartier: Jewellers Extraordinary
(Thames and Hudson, $75) in which
Hans Nadelhoffer tells the story of the
company which went from a small shop
in Paris to predominance over the world
of fashion and which, in turn, designed
and made jewellery for tsars, maha-
rajahs, European royalty, state and
opera stars to today’s supermillionaires.
■ Above Sydney (Kevin Weldon,
$29.95) which is a romantic look at a
beautiful city; Gordon Benningfield’s
Hardy Country (Allen Lane $29.95), a
romantic re-creation of the people and
countryside of Thomas Hardy’s
Wessex; and Castles (Bantam, $29.95)
by Alan Lee, a romantic look at castles
as they never were. □

Janet Frame: engagingly honest
NZ HERALD/AAP
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
To the ls-land and An Angel at My
Table, parts one and two of an
autobiography by Janet Frame.
The Women’s Press, $12.95 and
$19.50
WITH A THIRD volume to come
(perhaps others), the remarkable New
Zealand writer Janet Frame takes us
into her 30th year. She is on board
the steamer Ruahine, rolling from
Wellington to Southampton to continue
what she calls her “life of literature”.
Writing from school “compositions”
to the publication of her first book, a
collection of short stories called The
Lagoon was her life and, not to put
too sensational a point on it, also saved
her life.
She was about to undergo a
leucotomy (an incision into the white
tissue of the frontal lobe of the brain to
relieve some cases of disorder) in a
mental institution familiar to her, Sea-
cliff Hospital, when the medical
superintendent appeared with news-
paper in hand to tell her that she had
won the Hubert Church
award (of which she had
never heard) for prose. No
reading material was allowed
in her ward.
The super, impressed, told
her: “We are moving you out
of this ward. And no
leucotomy.”
There had been a hard sell
on the leucotomy; “Don’t you
want to be normal? We had a
patient here for years and
then she had a leucotomy and
she’s normal, she’s selling hats
in a hat shop.”
Frame writes surprisingly
little about insanity or the
presumption of insanity and
the awful places, with awful
people, to which it gets you.
Frame says that she has done
that, in her 1961 novel Faces
in the Water. She does appear
to have been born with one or
two skins fewer than the rest
of us and that is what the “life
in literature” is all about.
The Frames were a railway
family in the South Island,
always poor, moving from a
rented railway house in one
hamlet or another as the
rosters decided, finally settl-
ing at Oamaru. The four
clever girls went on to high school and
did well.
The mother and father loved one
another, though unable to express their
affection, and they loved and cared for
their children. The mother did so with
stories and meals and treats to offset her
casual housekeeping; the father with
jokes, warnings and sometimes the
strap.
Janet was accepted at teachers’ col-
lege in Dunedin but not accepted into
the big world she was timid, reclusive,
a self-dramatiser nor even into the
little world. One day, when an inspector
visited the school where she was
working as a pupil-teacher, she made an
excuse and walked away forever.
Alternately for 10 years, she either
was employed in laundries and hotels
always writing in her spare time or
was a patient in one or another of
various mental homes.
I have to say that I do not recognise
the people of her New Zealand; only
the landscape. Perhaps I left too early,
for Australia. But what is clear is that all
schoolchildren, whether state or private,
received the same literary and historical
input (for want of a better word) and it
came from Britain.
Freed from the care of that only
fairly enlightened doctor, Frame was
luckily taken into the literary and hu-
man care of the poet Alan Curnow and
novelist Frank Sargeson who believed

in the talent of their own country. But
she was still at this time essentially a
displaced person, as much as anyone in
a refugee camp. Two of her sisters were
dead, her mother was dying of heart
disease. She went to stay with her
surviving sister, married with children,
and became an uneasy presence in the
regulation household. The children
asked, “Who is she?” and wondered
why she ate alone ... “Experience in
hospital where I had been dragged by
the hair to the table made me reluctant
to eat in company.”
There is nothing depressing about
these books. They are engagingly hon-
est, idiosyncratic, often satiric and even
have funny bits. Frame is a winner.
Though never a best-seller, she has
written 10 novels, published four collec-
tions of short stories and poems and
picked up a swag of awards the latest
being the $20,000 Turnovsky award (the
donor is a New Zealand industrialist
who was a Czech immigrant) and a
CBE royal honor.
She is 60 years old, sometimes travels
abroad but mostly lives “quietly” (a
word that means little, since what is
quiet to one may be turmoil to another)
in Wanganui.
Some imaginative writers can be
separated from their personalities, their
“real” lives; not so Janet Frame. These
volumes of autobiography should win
enormous readership for her novels,
which is good. Her aim always was not
only to write but also to be read.
The glory of
yesteryear in a
Victorian garden
By CAROL HENTY
The Cottage Garden Revived,
by Trevor Nottle. Kangaroo
Press. $14.95.
TREVOR NOTTLE of Adelaide was as
a child a collector of roadside weeds
and plant oddities, a snipper of cuttings
from overhanging plants on garden
walls. He developed his talents as a
gardener’s boy in a splendid garden of
vinery and compost bins, pit-conserva-
tory and potting shed, became “caught”
and delved into all available garden
literature. He founded the Heritage
Roses of Australia, in 1979 produced in
1983 Growing Old Fashioned Roses In
Australia And New Zealand and has
now written as timely a garden book as
any on the market.
Subtitled Attitudes And Plants Essen-
tial For Nineteenth Century Gardens, it
catches the wave of interest in garden
A wisteria-covered pergola
history by providing the “feel” of a
Victorian cottage garden through the
philosophy and social and commercial
events of the times. This, he says, is
more important than is a detailed and
precise script when reviving and restor-
ing a garden appropriate for a 19th
century terrace house, cottage or sub-
urban villa.
He takes the reader into typical
sections of the small 19th century gar-
den the front with its oversized
conifers and palms; the side, verandah
overflowing with potted plants; the
back yard and the outhouses re-
creating the original planting and use of
the spaces, sprinkling through the text
specific plant suggestions and general
social information gleaned from his
researches into garden magazines and
archives of the times and from current
plant catalogues.
What plants they had! Agapanthus
came not only in today’s blue and white
flowers with green leaves but also in a
silver variegated leaf form, a gold one; a
dwarf form in double blue and pink and
a deciduous deep blue form. Pansies,
universally popular in the 19th century,
were produced in legion varieties in-
cluding “Bugnot’s Superb Blotched
Exhibition,” “Non Plus Ultra,” “King
of Blacks,” “Silver Edge” and “Gold
Lace.” Pelargoniums were golden tri-
color and silver tricolor; golden, bronze
and silver bicolor.
Some of the original forms are still
available from specialist nurseries but
modern hybrids often will do just as
well. Nottle’s point is that there must be
masses of plants and masses of different
varieties in a 19th century garden to
create the impression that the cottage
gardener is in the thick of the explosion
of botany as a science and responding
to it with gusto.
Never before had the common man
such a wealth of species and varieties to
garden with. The development of
Wardian cases in the second half of the
century miniature glasshouses
enabled plants to be transferred living
across oceans. European breeders were
«achieving astonishing results from
hybridising original species. The plant
hunters of England, France and
Germany were daily discovering
thousands of species new to science in
the wildernesses of China, Japan, South
Africa, South America, Australia and
New Zealand, India and Malaya to
be acclimatised in European botanical
gardens and disseminated round the
world. Nurseries as industries were
booming and their catalogues and
plants were distributed worldwide.
With such bounty, the Victorian cot-
tage dweller who had not the space nor
the means to create the pinetums, the
alpine gardens, the rhododendron
glades and heated conservatories of the
fashionable rich in England (and, to a
certain extent, here) created a garden of
floral tapestry.
Encouraging him were the periodi-
cals of the time, available at popular
prices and full of news of the latest
fashions in design and plant varieties

dener’s Chronicle, Garden And Field and
Garden’s Illustrated, all carrying

moral. Proclaimed a leader in the Gar-
den And Field of October 5, 1875:
“Gardening has an elevating tendency”
and “is a simple and innocent recrea-
tion not enjoyed by one whose only
pastime consists of loitering round the
public house bar.
“Everything which will tend to the
promotion of it is worthy of support
and commendation.”
Generally, Nottle lends his support
throughout the book to keeping the
atmosphere of each compartment of the
garden as it was originally with the
exception of the back yard. Here, the
outhouses and utilitarian function of
clotheslines and woodsheds no longer
apply and he suggests the area be turned
into a “potager” for exotic and useful
vegetable varieties or, failing that, a
place for beds of flowers. Modern
shapes such as the kidney swimming
pool and the swirling, paved patio are
out of place visually but may be dis-
guised by fencing covered with masses
of creepers.
In all, square shapes and straight
lines are more 19th century in the
garden than are free-form curves. Sim-
ilarly, he says, not all modern plants can
be easily accommodated into the style
of the Victorian cottage garden.
Reticulata camellias, for example, are
too gross where an equally modern
plant the Camellia lutchuensis, grafted
on 150 cm standards with weeping
bronze foliage and small white per-
fumed flowers seems just right. It is a
question of style.
He gives a valuable suggested plant-
ing for that awkward narrow sliver of
land in front of terrace houses and is,
above all, a knowledgable plantsman.
Though not in the garden business he
is a teacher his material, I would
think, would be apt and readable out-
side Australia.
The book, could, though, be more
visually attractive and the black and
white woodcuts sit oddly with the
modern color photos. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Enterprise - ABC profit ship
by Patricia Rolfe
GLENN HAMILTON has
hauled the ABC a long way
toward money-making since
1959 when, as a publicity as-
sistant working under Charles
Buttrose, he published the first
Boyer lectures by David
Forbes-Martin, called Aust-
ralia In the Space Age. Hamil-
ton has published the lectures
every year since. He has taken
Enterprise, the product-
developing and profit-making
arm of the ABC, to a $5.6
million turnover this year.
Enterprise now has its own
premises and, despite some
restrictions under the ABC
act, soon may publish its fig-
ures so that comparisons of
performance can be made
with other publishers.
With books, Hamilton has
some advantages. He can sell
off ideas to other publishers,
do co-productions which
spread financial risk or he can
produce a book and sell it
through Pitman with which
Enterprise has a basic contract. He can
mine the ABC for ideas and authors.
The ABC is not and is unlikely to
become a general publisher. Titles are
related to programs, even if tenuously
for example, Changi Photographer,
pictures by George Aspinall which Tim
Bowden unearthed while doing his radio
series.
Major books coming up next year
are Australians Under Nippon, based on
Bowden’s series on prisoners of war;
one on Italians here to go with Gian
Franco Cresciani’s TV series; one on
South America, another major TV
series, and, in February, one from long-
term Asia correspondent Bob Wurth,
called This Turbulent Priest. The ABC is
confident that Wurth’s long and close
knowledge of the Philippines will give
the book a quality to outdo any quick
books on the Father Brian Gore episode.
A BRITISH autobiography which
should have some interest here is David
Leitch’s Family Secrets, coming from
Heinemann next month. Leitch worked
here as a journalist some years ago and
was married to Jill Neville.
Neville’s novel Last Ferry to Manly
has been one of the most engaging
published this year. Leitch discusses his
marriages in Family Secrets, so it will be
read by people who believed they
Glenn Hamilton: showing what the ABC can do
recognised themselves in Last Ferry to
Manly.
Some years ago, in God Stand Up For
Bastards, Leitch described how his
mother gave him away as a baby by
advertising in the London Daily Express
personal column. After this book was
published, he met his mother and found
a sister. Leitch had Family Secrets ser-
ialised in a London Sunday paper in the
hope of finding another sister. So far,
the serialisation has turned up only a
first cousin of his mother.
BEARING Australian books bought
with a grant from the Literature Board
color transparencies of Aboriginal art
and, for good measure, some seeds of
desert wildflowers, Anne Fairbairn takes
off again this week as a sort of roving
cultural ambassador to the Arab world.
She will lecture and give poetry read-
ings, as before, but the major project
will be to help along an Australian
edition of a literary journal emanating
from Damascus university.
On her previous visit to this univers-
ity, she rather upset people by laughing
when told that Steele Rudd was the only
Australian writer known there. “There
are 700 universities in the Arab world,”
she said, “and the journal goes to all of
them, so we should sell some books out
of this.” □

NEIGHBORHOOD
The new Anzacs build a
de facto federation
The distinction between Australia and New Zealand is rapidly becoming blurred.
BRUCE JUDDERY tells how the two nations have built an entente cordiale
unmatched anywhere else in the world.
DOES Australia already have
a de facto seventh state?
Trends in Australia-New
Zealand relations suggest that
proposals for trans-Tasman
confederation most recently
advanced by former federal
Law Reform Commission
head Justice Michael Kirby
and Mebourne University his-
torian Professor Geoffrey
Blainey already may be
obsolescent.
New Zealand’s out-going
High Commissioner in Can-
berra, Sir Laurie Francis, is
predictably scornful of formal
confederation propositions
although his reasoning
touches a sore point with
traditional diplomats (he is a
former National Party pre-
sident and a political ap-
pointee) on both sides of the
Tasman.
“Why buy a cow,” asks the
Dean of the Diplomatic
Corps, as he girds himself for
another of the series of fare-
wells at the hands of every state govern-
ment and most Canberra diplomatic
establishments, “when you can get your
milk for nothing?”
His attitude reflects the unpreceden-
tedly intense political and economic
relationship between Australia and
New Zealand a relationship that the
Senate Standing Committee on In-
dustry and Trade, in a report tabled just
before federal parliament rose for the
federal elections, wishes to make even
closer on the economic front than the
bureaucrats already had in mind.
Accustomed to dealing with trans-
Tasman relations in a compart-
mentalised fashion with Closer
Economic Relations (CER) as distinct
from co-operation in tourism or in-
dustry co-ordination, for instance it
may be passing over the heads of
politicians in both countries (not to
mention their electorates) that, in many
significant respects and notwithstanding
New Zealand High Commissioner Sir Laurie Francis
JOHN ELLIOTT
issues such as access to nuclear-
powered and/or armed vessels, the dis-
tinction between the two countries is
becoming blurred.
Recently, for the first time, the New
Zealand desk of the Department of
Foreign Affairs in Canberra did a count
of the number of “significant”
ministerial visits each way scheduled for
the following month and found that
they came to a round dozen.
Australian officials count no fewer
than 22 federal-state ministerial coun-
cils on which New Zealanders sit either
as full participants or as observers a
distinction that frequently makes very
little difference. “It’s unique in terms of
Australia’s relations with any other
country,” they concede.
Growing intimacy between the
countries has dictated to the New
Zealanders that their new high com-
missioner should not be another politi-
cal appointee a practice maintained
by the Hawke government
which sent former Labor
minister Les Johnson to New
Zealand this year but a
professional diplomat and
trained economist with Can-
berra experience during the
19605, Graham Ansell. Can-
berra, the New Zealanders
freely admit, is the most im-
portant of their diplomatic
missions.
Whether Ansell will be as
apt or as well-equipped as
Francis at operating at the
second level of New
Zealand’s Australian diplo-
macy remains to be seen. In
his eight years in Australia,
Francis has maintained
relations not only with the
national but with the six state
governments and that of the
Northern Territory as well.
“I think it is very germane
that, in every state bar one, in
the past six years, there has
been a change of govern-
ment,” he notes. “The incom-
ing governments have in no way
questioned the relationships between
New Zealand ministers and state and
federal ministers and have adopted
them.
“To me, that has been one of the
most far-reaching things in my time as
High Commissioner. Certainly, CER
has been a highlight but the feasibility
of CER was oiled by the access of all
New Zealand ministers to their
counterparts including officials.
“The entente cordiale presently en-
joyed by both countries is a unique
example of something that I think is
non-existent elsewhere in the world.”
Australian officials tend to agree and
the Senate committee in its preliminary
report on CER seems determined to
make it even more so.
The committee, chaired by Labor’s
left-wing Senator Ruth Coleman, is
anxious to light a fire under both
Australian business leaders and the


buregucracy to ensure that the benefits
of CER are not monopolised by New
Zealanders. As a consequence, it is
urging that lagging steps to harmonise
industry and standards laws be given
the spur.
The committee’s first report was a
rushed affair, intended to assure
Australians that CER issues would not
be buried until after the elections.
The original schedule set by the
committee (all submissions were to be in
by the end of September) has been
recognised as wildly unrealistic (the
committee’s own reference dates from
only August 24) and it is open for
submissions to the end of the year.
The preliminary report is a quite
deliberate attempt to disabuse officials
on both sides of the Tasman of the idea
that the “second generation” issues that
they quite deliberately put on the back
burner during negotiation of CER, for
fear that these would monopolise atten-
tion and prevent conclusion of the basic
agreement, can be left there indefinitely.
“Second generation” issues include
external trade and investment policies,
taxation, trade practices, standards, in-
dustry assistance, banking and finance
and employment policies the bulk of
those areas in which the economic
“sovereignty” of nations is measured.
It is just because of that sensitivity
that they were put aside. It
is because of their status
that resolution of them
would eliminate many of
the effective (as distinct
from formal, con-
stitutional) distinctions be-
tween the two countries.
The Senate committee
carefully re-assures New
Zealand that it does not
seek to pre-empt the
scheduled 1988 review of
CER but insists that out-
standing issues cannot be
left until then: sources close to the
committee report concern that CER
plus other developments in the trade
patterns of the two countries, notably
New Zealand’s recent devaluation and
its greater celerity in grasping some of
the notionally mutual advantages from
the scheme, will generate ultimately
ruinous resistance to it in Australia.
The “back burner” philosophy of the
negotiation phase is seen as entailing a
“Catch-22” effect whereby, if nettles are
not promptly grasped, “CER will go
only so far down the track before the
hiccoughs become more frequent and
louder.” The challenge is for further
urgent co-ordination of financial,
competition and trade systems.
The report lays into Australian busi-
Graham Ansell
ness for tardiness in
responding to the op-
portunities of CER.
“Australians should not
criticise New Zealanders
for being better prepared,”
it says. “On the contrary,
Australians need to work a
lot harder to explore more
fully the scope for trade
expansion that is now
available. . .
More generally, it raises
questions of co-operation
in developing third-
country trade, the costs of trans-Tasman
freight and subsidy schemes.
The few specific recommendations
reflect the limited number of advisers
from whom the committee has heard so
far, all in confidence. Australians
should be educated about the Exclusive
Australian Licensing Scheme (grievous-
ly under-utilised); standards, labelling
and so on should go to a joint national
inquiry; deadlines should be set for
resolution of how product groups such
as iron and steel, ball-cocks (truly!) and
so on should be phased in.
The impact of Senate committees is
mixed but this one’s sense of urgency
adds another element to a relationship
the pace of whose development has
been overlooked by many Australians

and New Zealanders. It seems un-
changed by present political strains
between the respective governments,
notably over the ANZUS defence
treaty.
According to Francis: “The empathy
of this present government is profound.
I feel closer on New Zealand’s behalf to
the Hawke government than with the
exception of Doug Anthony I ever
did to the Fraser government.” Officials
in Canberra tend to agree with him,
drawing a marked contrast with the
attitude of the Whitlam government
which assiduously sought to avoid “en-
tanglement” with its smaller trans-
Tasman relation.
Says one senior Foreign Affairs
official: “I think we will remain two
countries but, if we keep going down the
current track, we will end up being
effectively one country. The question of
political union is of secondary import-
ance.” □
NEW ZEALAND
Muldoon one of
the few with
a moist eye
By IAN TEMPLETON
THE KNIVES have been flashing
within New Zealand’s National Party
since Sir Robert Muldoon massively
miscalculated the mood of the country
in July.
Finally, on the ninth anniversary of
the day he became Prime Minister, they
cut him down. He could not survive
even the first ballot when the par-
limentary caucus put the leadership to
vote.
Out went Muldoon: in came his
deputy Jim McLay, the 39-year-old
lawyer. And few could doubt that the
National Party has reached a watershed
in its history.
Muldoon has been the dominant
figure in New Zealand politics for a
decade. He revived the party’s fortunes
when he took over as leader in 1974. He
stumped the country month after month
attacking the Labor government, and in
1975 swept to power.
Party propagandists invested him
with superhuman qualities and certainly
that landslide victory lent him an aura
that only slowly tarnished, despite his
failure to deliver economic miracles.
In a moment of unusual modesty
Muldoon once admitted that the most
important thing he wished to be
remembered for was: “That when I go I
left this country at least as
good as when I took it over.”
Historians have yet to
chew that over: Certainly his
opponents are quick to say
that he left the country in
desperate financial peril,
bitter, divided, sour. His
admirers argue that Muldoon
carried New Zealand through
the longest recession in its
history and protected the
living standards of his
countrymen.
Muldoon had his own in-
dividualistic style of politics.
He thrived on confrontation.
For him: “strife is the essence
of politics, it’s been so
throughout history.” His
pugnacious, abrasive, ag-
gressive personality appeared
to revel in the destruction of
political opponents.
So long as he was winning,
true-blue conservatives within
his party tolerated him even
though he trampled over their cherished
ideals.
But in his latter years in power,
Muldoon became increasingly
autocratic and interventionist and the
business community turned away from
the apparent inconsistencies which blew
the best-laid corporate plans apart.
He frequently over-rode the advice
of Treasury and the Reserve Bank,
ignored his ministers and turned his
government into what many perceived
to be a one-man band.
In one of the great political ironies of
New Zealand history, Muldoonism
created the electoral opening for Labor,
Sir Robert Muldoon: a rare display of emotion
offering it the platform of reconciliation
and consensus, which in the 1960 s had
been the trademark of National’s Sir
Keith Holyoake.
Labor under David Lange was able
to regain the middle ground, presenting
itself as the “caring” party. And yet it
had been Muldoon who had always
claimed he understood the “ordinary
bloke,” who could empathise with the
aspirations of the average Kiwi.
Muldoon knew before caucus met
that he faced defeat. Yet he did not
withdraw and leave the field clear for
his successor.
Momentarily, the pugnacious mask
New National leadership: president Wood, Opposition leader McLay and deputy Bolger


dropped. Journalists swore
that they detected tears as
Muldoon betrayed the kind of
emotion no-one had sus-
pected the strong man of New
Zealand politics was capable
of.
If those were the tears of
sadness or frustration, within
the party there was a sense of
relief. Party president Sue
Wood confessed she was
“thrilled to bits.”
McLay promises a “new
ear and a new style.” His first
priority is to weld together
again the parliamentary party
and the organisational wing.
McLay aims for an open-door
policy of consultation, a
“free-wheeling” caucus, and
promotion of MPs on merit.
Each of those points carries
an implicit criticism of his
predecessor.
McLay has clearly a
shrewd political brain. But even some of
his henchmen question whether he has
leadership “charisma.”
Then there is the problem of his
voice. It has the tendency to crack under
pressure. It did so again on his first
major speech in parliament as leader.
That can be fatal for a politician.
If however McLay can win back the
National supporters disenchanted with
Muldoonism then he will have a solid
start to winning back the Treasury
benches. □

Prem’s royal
backing staves
off Thai coup
By DENIS REINHARDT
SYMBOLIC INTERVENTION by the
Thai royal family appears to have
averted a further showdown between
Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanond’s
government and Thailand’s military
chiefs and confirmed the political im-
portance of its rule.
Last month when Prem returned to
his desk after a month’s medical treat-
ment he was confronted by a grave
political crisis springing from his
cabinet’s decision to devalue the baht,
the Thai currency.
Matters came to a head quickly with
an extraordinary outburst from army
commander and supreme commander
General Arthit Kamlang-Ek. Arthit
went on the two army-run television
The King and Queen of Thailand: subtle intervention
networks to demand the immediate
revaluation of the baht to its former
level and a cabinet reshuffle.
Behind Arthit’s emotional and sym-
bolic outburst he wore army fatigues
was military concern at the 14.9 per
cent devaluation on an already pro-
vocatively expensive arms procurement
program.
Clearly the devaluation would sink
the drive by Arthit and air force com-
mander Air Chief Marshal Praphan
Dupatemiya for a SUSSOO million
purchase of 16 American
FI6A tactical fighters, adding
further to a billowing SUSI 2
billion external debt.
Arthit and five other senior
officers sent their demands to
Prem in a letter published in
the Bangkok dailies even be-
fore it reached Prem. But
within five days Arthit had
backed down as the extent of
Prem’s support both within
the Thai establishment and
the military became obvious.
However the mood for a
coup prevailed and the
defence ministry issued orders
that regional military com-
manders could only move
their forces on orders from the
military itself.
Diplomatic observers in
Bangkok began to take posi-
tions on when the coup might
come. On November 16 Prem
flew to northern Thailand for
an audience with the king and
queen, a visit expected to last
no more than a day.
Although the Thai royal
family is a constitutional
monarchy, it is a persuasive
force in Thai politics. Prime
Minister Prem went to the
summer palace ostensibly to
make his monthly report to
their majesties.
He did not return to
Bangkok for nine days and
when he did it was on a
Boeing 737 piloted by crown
prince Vajiralongkorn who
also drove the 64-year-old
prime minister to the door of
his home. Prem explained
blithely the next day that the
royal family had insisted that
he rest under their care and
take time to recover from his
illness.
Prem had been given the
royal imprimatur so that any
coup launched by Arthit
would also be an affront to the
Royal wish.
Although Arthit remained
publicly silent during the pro-
longed royal audience, Prem’s
two deputy prime ministers denied
widely-published rumors that Arthit
was about to be sacked.
Aides to Prem announced that his
first duty on resuming work would be to
chair a meeting of economic ministers
at government house.
Last Wednesday Prem flew north
again for another audience with their
majesties, who it was announced would
host a banquet the following evening
for senior army officers including
supreme commander Arthit. □

Together we’re finding the answers. Honeywell
is supplying many of the products and services that
will enable The Australian Bicentennial Authority to
successfully complete the strategic planning and
implementation of Australia’s Bicentenary in 1988.
It will be a great and historic event in Australian
history. To bring 16,000,000 Australians together -
an enormously complex programme of activities is
being planned systematically: multi-cultural events;
conferences; festivals; displays; educational
schemes; community endeavours and projects that
will remain as enduring legacies. So that these plans
can be evolved and put into production, a mass of
information is being collated, stored and
disseminated. Using Honeywell computer systems.
The Australian Bicentennial Authority chose

The philosophy behind Amway’s
basement-to-penthouse success
Founder Richard M. De Vos has been in Australia to further the Amway direct
sales crusade which produced local turnover of some $7O million last year. BRUCE
STANNARD examines the phenomenon and talks to the prospering faithful

of the Hordern Pavilion, Mr Amway
Richard M. De Vos looks and sounds
very much like a born-again evangelist
straight out of the US mid-west. Against
a Citizen Kane-style backdrop of his
own gigantic and faintly smiling photo
portrait, he prowls about pursued by a
relentless pale blue spotlight and a
battery of video cameras.
With all the considerable skills of a
veteran performer, he shouts
and whispers and scowls and
smiles as he waves his arms

financial salvation according

products from a basement in

Amway has become a
direct-selling giant which is
flourishing in 14 countries,
has an annual turnover es-
timated to be in excess of $1.5
billion and is ranked among
America’s top five companies
still in the hands of the
original owners.
De Vos has flown in to
rally the faithful and tonight
he is giving them the good old
“You Can Do It” speech.
Four thousand distributors
are sitting spellbound in the
gloom.
“Amway,” he says, “is
much, much more than a
marketing strategy.” He
pauses and allows the tension
to build as if he is about to
confide some innermost secret
... “It’s an idea!
“It’s an idea that is much
bigger than all of us. The idea
is that you can rise. The idea is
that you can believe in
yourself. I believe that
Amway is the greatest force in the world
today to help people believe in
themselves. With a force like that, we
can change the world. We will take
those who are hopeless and give them
new hope. We will take those who are
discouraged and give them new joy. We
will take those who feel they are
defeated and fill them with a sense of
achievement.”
The words gushing out with so much
Richard M. De Vos at the Hordern: spellbinding in the gloom
DAVID WALLACE
forceful down-home sincerity sweep the
audience to its feet and De Vos is
applauded with the fervor which one
usually associates with a Billy Graham
crusade. There is a very real religiosity
in Amway.
Company executives say that
perhaps 75 percent of their distributors
have some religious affiliation. Starting
from scratch in Amway, the executives
say, requires much the same sense of
commitment and faith.
The De Vos portrait in the
lobby of the company’s Castle
Hill, Sydney, headquarters
shows the president resting on
a group of books including
the Holy Bible and one
entitled How To Save Free
Enterprise flanked by Liber-
ty Bell bookends.
When faith and commit-
ment eventually turn into suc-
cessful sales figures, Amway
also bestows an elaborate
series of rewards in the form
of pins ruby, pearl,
emerald, diamond, double-
diamond and crown.
In often emotional rallies,
the recipients are encouraged
to come up on stage to be
recognised after they have
told the stories of their
struggles along the path to
Amway success.
Some 300 full-time and
35,000 part-time distributors,
85 percent of them husband
and wife teams supplement-
ing their regular weekly
incomes, have taken up that
challenge since Amway
started in Australia in 1971.
According to company fig-
ures, they are servicing some
800,000 customers around the
country.
Amway’s motto is “Shop
without going shopping.”
Customers order the goods for
home-delivery.
Retail- turnover last year


Supersalesman David Comyns: from windshield-wiping to the symbolic Mercedes
was reported to be more than $7O
million. Net profit was put at $3.8
million with much of it being ploughed
back into capital investments in
warehouse facilities in Sydney,
Adelaide, Perth and Launceston.
Distributors have to be sponsored
into the business by existing ones. The
newcomers obtain their supplies of up
to 150 homeware-homecare and
cosmetic products through their
sponsors and receive a 35 percent com-
mission on every sale. Bonuses are paid
according to volume.
Amway distributors can do as little
or as much business as they choose to
but higher profits clearly lie in becom-
ing a direct distributor one who, with
his sponsored group, turns over more
than $12,000 a month for three con-
secutive months.
Bill Duncan, Amway of Australia’s
corporate affairs manager, is quick to
deny any link between the company’s
marketing strategy and the notorious
“pyramid” selling schemes which have
cost Australians millions of dollars in
recent years.
“The pyramid operations were run
by shysters and crooks,” he said. “They
were frauds from the start and, un-
fortunately, they often piggy-back on
our reputation by telling people they are
‘just like Amway.’ By the time people
discover the truth, the crooks have got
their foot in the door, their fists in
people’s pockets and they’ve gone.
“We started right in the middle of all
those cowboys in the marketplace and
in the early years they created real
problems for us because people wrongly
assumed we must be some kind of
pyramid. Pyramid selling is a head-
hunting exercise. It’s profiteering out of
getting people in. Amway is a retailer.
We are interested in selling products to
customers and nobody in this organisa-
tion makes a red cent until a customer is
a satisfied purchaser.”
David and Nadia Comyns are
Amway of Australia’s most successful
distributors. They are known as crown
direct distributors, which means that
they have sponsored at least 20 couples
who each have a retail turnover of at
least $12,000 a month. Together, the 20
couples each with their own groups of
distributors have a retail turnover
approaching $2O million. As a result,
the Comyns’ Christmas bonus this year
is a tidy $92,000.
David Comyns, a laconic 47-year-
old with a penchant for heavy gold
chains and Thai-silk shirts, admits to an
annual turnover in excess of $200,000.
Fourteen years ago, when Comyns and
his wife were struggling to find the
deposit on their first home, his Aunty Vi
told him that he need not bother day-
dreaming about matching her account-
ant son’s shiny new Mercedes. Comyns,
she said, had no hope of ever amount-
ing to anything.
“That really hurt, coming from my
favourite aunt,” he says with a wry
smile. “I went away and sulked for a
week or so and then her words began to
act as a kind of cruel catalyst.
“We set out to get a car and we
worked our hearts out to get it.
Everyone poured scorn on us at the
start. They were all convinced we would
fall flat on our faces.
“Amway had only five homecare
products in those days and I was pretty
hopeless as a salesman. I went into my
next-door neighbors and said, ‘Oh, hi,
Mrs Gaffney; I’m flogging this Ameri-
can stuff. Do you want to buy some?’
She turned me down and so did all the
other neighbors. I nearly died.”
But, like all good salesmen, Comyns
discovered that a little showmanship
goes a long way.
On the way home from his job in a
city jewellery store, he used to pull out a
spray can of polish and give his shoes
an instant shine. “Pretty soon, everyone
in the carriage wanted shines and the
orders started to come in,” he says.
During his lunch break, he took his
sandwiches and a spray can of window
cleaner into Hyde Park. When motorists
pulled in to park in surrounding streets,
he leapt out and demonstrated on
grubby windshields. His mates
nicknamed him “Soapy” and implied
that he was perhaps not the full quid.
“It was very hard work,” he said,
“but we stuck at it. Now, when I go
back to that jewellery store and spend in
one purchase what I once made in a
year, my old workmates the blokes
who thought I was a ratbag won’t
even look me in the eye.”
These days, Comyns drives a top-of-
the-range Mercedes and owns a beef


cattle property outside Wagga
Wagga. He says that he has
not really been working in the
business for three years but
still conducts seminars, rallies
and what he calls “re-charge
sessions” at his Sydney home.
There, the distributors
whom he has sponsored into
the business men and
women who would like to
emulate his success attend
to pick up details of new
products and to watch the
master in action, demonstrat-
ing with apparently in-
exhaustable enthusiasm the
cleaners, polishers, scrubbers
and bleaches.
Bruce Shankland, Amway
of Australia’s managing
director, went to one of those
meetings at the Comyns home 12 years
ago. “They were just kicking off in those
days,” he said, “and the business was
very small but I remember thinking
that, if all the reps at the company I then
worked for were half as enthusiastic as
this guy, we could double our business
overnight. What we have in Amway is a
one-eyed determination to achieve the
goal.
Local Amway chiefs Bill Duncan and Bruce Shankland (glasses)
JOHN ELLIOTT
“We want a better life for ourselves;
it’s as simple as that. All we are saying
to people is, ‘Here is a system which will
work if you are prepared to put in the
effort’. It’s not a short cut to wealth but
there is money to be made by anyone
with the will to achieve.”
Shankland says that, although
Amway products are initially slightly
more expensive than comparative retail
lines, the American products
(85 percent of them are
imported) last longer because
they are more concentrated.
Amway provides a money
back guarantee with every
product and, according to
Shankland, less than 1 percent
of all goods are returned.
“We don’t have any sales
quotas,” he said. “There aren’t
any swords hanging over our
distributors’ heads if they
don’t sell. Our entire market-
ing system is based on the
good old Aussie philosophy
of ‘’Ave a go, mate!’ and if
you can do it, terrific.”
Duncan stressed that
Amway was strictly a cash-on-
delivery business. “We try to
keep it as simple and as clean
as possible,” he said. “There is no
credit, no bad debts, no complications.
“Some distributors do nothing. They
just sit there, for one reason or another,
until the time is right for them to move.
We don’t hassle them. We don’t care if
they sit there for a million years and do
nothing. When the time is right, they
will get motivated.”
Shankland said that Amway had
plans to expand in line with the Ameri-
can experience in which customers
could choose from a catalogue listing
more than 5000 products including
television sets, washing machines, cloth-
ing, sporting goods and refrigerators. A
complete range of home-safety alarms is
to be introduced in Australia within the
next two months.
Amway of Australia also is looking
for partnership possibilities for the
marketing of Australian-made products
of high quality. “We have a worldwide
marketing system at our fingertips,”
Shankland said, “so we know, if we can
get the products, we can sell them.” □
An investment by the helmsman
RICHARD De VOS is not a gambling
man but he is having what amounts to a
significant each-way bet on the outcome
of the America’s Cup races in 1987. De
Vos, who is finance chairman of the
New York Yacht Club’s America II
syndicate, is considered to be a major
sponsor following a donation of around
5300,000. But he has also given his
blessing to an Amway of Australia plan
which aims to raise some $5 million
over the next two years for Alan Bond’s
Australia 111 syndicate.
“This is what I call a win-win situa-
tion,” he said. Amway distributors will
be asked to sign up members of the
America’s Cup Defence Club, a fund-
raising mechanism through which Bond
hopes to tap the enormous national
enthusiasm which followed Australia
IT s cup win in the United States last
year. Membership will cost about $lO.
De Vos has a particular admiration
for Bond’s determination to achieve. “I
met him on an aircraft 10 years ago,”
the Amway founder said, “and he had
just lost. He wasn’t the slightest bit
dejected. He just said ‘l’ll be back.’
That’s the kind of spirit we recognise in
Amway.”
De Vos said the America //syndicate
had no intention of indulging in com-
mercial exploitation of the cup. “We
don’t plan to have corporate logos
plastered all over the boat,” he said.
“And, yet, there is a certain rub-off that
happens in association with an event of
this sort. Advertising, per se, is getting a
little dull. It may be that the PR thing is
at least as important as the straight-out
ad in a magazine or on television.” □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Why a hi-tech stock levitated
AMONG THE few stocks to defy
gravity in last week’s market shakeout
were the “high-technology” hopefuls.
One company, with the blatantly
trendy name of Hitek Ltd, put on 20c to
close at $1.32. It has been in a continual
rise since it listed in late September with
an issue of shares at 50c.
Hitek is in the business of launching
what has been described as a re-
volutionary plastic can-making process
destined to seize a share of the tin can
market. It is well connected, having
arranged a 50:50 joint venure wih ACI
International to market the processes
outside Australasia. Within Australia
and New Zealand, ACl’s subsidiary
Nylex Corporation holds exclusive
rights.
In the past week or so, the talk has
been hot that Hitek is about to pull off a
vast deal with the world’s largest food-
packaging company, Continental
Packaging Co, of the United States,
which has an annual turnover of SUSS.S
billion. Hitek has built and sold one of
its plastics forming machines to Con-
tinental for production tests.
The company was floated to take
over the processes and patents
developed by the investors and their
associates. In 1977, two mechanical
engineers Robert Bogwitz and
Anthony Flecknoe-Brown founded
Australian Applied Research Centre and
obtained exclusive rights from ICI Ltd
to develop applications for a process
first devised in the chemical giant’s
laboratories to shape products con-
tinuously from a hot or molten web of
thermoplastics.
A report included in the prospectus
from PA Consulting Services estimated
the available world can food packaging
market at $8.2 billion a year. From five
products made by the Hitek process, the
Hitek-ACI joint venture could expect to
collect $783,000 in royalties for each 1
percent of market share gained. Other
products are to be developed.
I decided to get with the strength and
buy 100 shares.
There were few bright spots in the
rest of the market last week and the sell-
off slashed more than 10 percent from
the value of the portfolio. Nevertheless,
with gold stocks taking a beating,
possibilities began to emerge following
the principle that one should buy straw
hats in winter.
Central Victorian Gold made little
impression on the market when it re-
vealed that it was about to re-open the
old Poverty Mine at Tarnagulla, 40km
west of Bendigo.
The Speculator first wrote about the
search for the “lost” Poverty Reef in the
edition of June 12, when a drilling
program began near the old mine shaft
which has been sealed up for years. The
reef was once the richest in the world
and in 14 years from its discovery in
1852 it yielded 360,0000 z or 11 tonnes
of gold. In 1866 the reef was lost on a
fault below 200 m.
Last week the company revealed
values of up to 41 gm/tonne from the
sixth exploratory drill hole and con-
firmed that the lost reef had been
located and the old mine shaft would be
re-opened to the first subsurface ex-
ploration since 1899.
At 11c a share, the company is
capitalised at $3.25 million and has
$2.48 million in cash. The 12.5 million
December, 1986, options at 4c have a
long life and lots of leverage.

The attraction of the stockmarket is a powerful one.
Fortunes can be made in a day, but success is not a
foregone conclusion. Success requires up-to-the-minute
knowledge and quick, sophisticated reactions to
movements in the market.
Success also benefits from size. Money can indeed make
money, with the big investor reaping the full benefit of
his investing power, leaving the smaller investor eager
but unrequited.
Not any more. The J. B. Were Investment Trust can
endow small investors with all the capability and clout of
the big investor. This is done by pooling the resources
of the smaller investors and applying the pool to a spread
of stockmarket investments under expert professional
management.
The Trust is open to any investor with $l,OOO or more.
Although its objective is to make high capital gains,
income will be regularly distributed to investors.
As experienced investors know, a market such as we
have at the moment can be the most profitable time to
strike. We believe there’s low downside risk with the very
real potential of high capital growth.
The Manager of the Trust is Invia Limited, a company

WILDCAT
Bank bids lead to boardroom shuffle
MORE CAPTAINS of commerce are
likely to ease themselves out of prime
board seats in the wake of the scramble
for new banking licences.
One potential conflict of interest to
come under scrutiny must be the posi-
tion of Brian Quinn, the exceedingly
capable managing director of G. J.
Coles and Co Ltd who also sits on the
board of the Reserve Bank.
Australia’s second largest retailer
and the world’s second-largest bank
Bank of America last week revealed
details of their joint application for a
banking licence.
The marriage of the two, which
would operate through 30 retail outlets
most in Coles stores looks promis-
ing but Quinn could find himself in a
ticklish situation. He was appointed to
the Reserve for the unexpired period of
the term of the late Sir Phillip Lynch,
which expires in August 1986.
The Reserve Bank is clear on dual
banking roles by directors. A clause of
its Act states that: “A person who is a
director, officer or employee of a
corporation (other than the bank) the
business of which is wholly or mainly
that of banking is not capable of ap-
pointment or of continuing to act as a
member of the board.”
Directors of other groups after one
of the six or so banking licences up for
grabs who have found themselves in
positions of potential conflict have
resigned from boards. The latest is the
chairman of the National Mutual, Gerry
Niall, who sought leave of absence from
the ANZ Banking Group Ltd. The life
company has lodged a bank licence
application in concert with the Royal
Bank of Canada.
Niall followed David Anderson,
chairman of the AMP Society, who
resigned from the board of the National
Australia Bank in September to avoid
any conflict of interest as AMP seeks a
licence with the United States’ Chase
Manhattan.
Last week Sir Robert Law-Smith,
chairman of the National Australia,
retired from the AMP board and BHP
chairman, Sir James Balderstone,
resigned as a director of Westpac, elect-
ing to keep an AMP position.
Bigger reserves
LAST WEEK’S Wildcat column
understated the gold reserves at Pan
Australian Mining Ltd’s Mount Leyshon
prospect, in Queensland due to a
typographical error. Assessed reserves,
in fact, are 7 million tonnes of
2gm/tonne ore within a larger probable
and possible resource of 16.5 million
tonnes of I.sgm/tonne material.
War in the air
COPIES of a letter purportedly from Sir
Peter Abeles, who runs Ansett Airlines,
look like causing rival Trans-Australia
Airlines some diabolical trouble.
Abeles last week was not available to
comment on the letter.
The letter not only says that Ansett
will continue to employ its present flight
engineers for the rest of their working
lives but also that, in any future
purchases of aircraft with a capacity of
more than 120 passengers, Ansett will
order a three-man flight deck requiring
an engineer in the crew.
The letter comes as TAA continues
its consideration of plans to buy a new
medium-capacity aircraft to use on
domestic routes. It is looking at planes
with a capacity of from 100 to 180
passengers to supplement its A3OO Air-
buses and eventually to replace its 140-
passenger Boeing 727 s and McDonnell
Douglas DC9-30s.
The official word from TAA is that it
is in no great hurry to make a decision.
But, unofficially, airline sources say a
decision is getting closer. The main
driving force for new aircraft would be
their greater fuel efficiency. But, with
fuel prices stumbling on world markets,
the efficiency gain has'to be weighed
against the high capital cost of new-
generation types.
TAA’s DC9s and 8727 s are well
down the depreciation scale but still
have plenty of life left. Consequently,
TAA enjoys some lower costs than does
Ansett.
The reported Abeles letter has given
the flight engineers considerable heart
and the inspiration to call last week’s
one-day stopwork.
Their morale nose-dived when
Qantas ordered Boeing 767-200ERs for
its relatively long-haul regional routes.
Although these are of the same family as
Ansett’s flagships, Qantas insisted on
and got two-man flight decks and an
operating agreement with the engineers
and pilots.
One reason for the Qantas success is
that the overseas airline will have con-
siderable opportunities for flight
engineers in its 21-strong Boeing 747
fleet which is designed to have a three-
man crew and will continue to have an
engineer even when the new-look ver-
sions on the drawing-boards come into
service.
This leaves the TAA engineers at
“Miss Huntswell, I’d like some paper clips, staples, glue,
pencils, erasers, memo paper - all arranged in an atmosphere
of creative clutter. ”


present flying the A3oos and the 727 s
which provide the heart of the airline’s
fleet.
If, for instance, TAA replaced its
older Airbuses with the new smaller and
more efficient A3lO model which
requires a two-man crew and bought
one of the modern 150-seaters such as
MD-80 or the Boeing 737-300 for its
medium-sized fleet, its flight engineers
would become redundant.
As a result, engineers (who have
generally enjoyed pilot support) are
threatening to strike TAA before or
during the Christmas rush unless they
get a declaration that the airline will
continue to use three-man crews.
As it costs an estimated $2 to $3
million to convert a two-man flight deck
for three-man operation and as extra
operating costs could come close to $1
million a year, TAA has been standing
firm on the Qantas precedent.
The pressure became intense late last
week, before the election. The engineers
and their allies had commanded union
support for their case and, as a result,
political pressure was also being
applied to TAA.
With the election over, the rules have
changed. TAA will probably bid to stare
down Ansett and hold out for two-man
crews at some indefinite date.
But the industrial threats have been
flying. The engineers and their allies
have little to lose by a stoppage. The
airline’s recovery, which hinges on its
peak earning holiday period to drag in
the revenue, faces some real problems.
THE CHARTIST
Sarich tech surges on full throttle
by Russell Lander
THE BOOM in high-tech stocks in
Australia in 1983-84 was brief, with a
number of participants having halved in
price since their highs. However, there is
often an exception which proves the
rule, this role now being played
superbly by Sarich Technologies Trust.
The units were listed on August 30,
1984, so that the accompanying Bridge
Data daily bar chart covers all trading
in STT from the first sale. STT is
entitled to 25 percent of all payments
made to Orbital Engine Company Pty
Ltd (OEC) for the sale or grant of
technology rights and to 40 percent of
the “operating result” of OEC, whereas
BHP the other shareholder in OEC, is
entitled to all dividends paid by OEC.
The company was formed in 1973 to
develop the Sarich orbital engine in-
vented by Ralph Sarich back in 1969
but is now concentrating more upon
fuel injection technology than the or-
bital engine per se.
The units made an unobtrusive
debut, early prices being around $1.20
which would have temped some sub-
scribers to cut and run for a 20 percent
profit. The stock firmed through Sep-
tember to around the $1.30 mark and
moved up to $1.60 in October where it
stayed until the middle of November.
As our chart illustrates there has since
been a price explosion which has
carried the units to around $2.80 in only
seven trading days.
This is reminiscent of the great per-
formance by Vapocure early in the year.
There does not appear to have been any
clear-cut explanation for STT’s price
leap but the prospectus did give an
approximate guide to the sort of royalty
income which could accrue annually to
OEC were it to gain 10 percent of the
world market in its various products.
These royalty figures were SAI2 million
a year for the orbital fuel injection
system, $43 million a year for the two-
cycle engine technology in the
automotive market (and $3 million a
year in the marine engine market) and
$2 million a year for the Orbital Power
Booster in the marine engine market.
Sometimes charts do not lend
themselves to price projections and so it
is with the daily graph on STT.
Nevertheless, in simply highlighting
unusual happenings on the
stockmarket, charts serve a very useful
purpose. Any stock which can perform
like STT in an otherwise jittery stock
market and can command a market
capitalisation of $lOO million is worthy
of the closest inspection.

THE MODEST FARMER
Ivory tower needs thumping
by Bert Kelly
ECCLES SELDOM takes me to his
ivory tower. He sometimes used to when
I was still in parliament and, so, was a
minor power in the land. Then he would
take me round in an embarrassed kind
of way, saying to his colleagues: “This is
my friend Bert Kelly. He is a member of
parliament but he means well. You
might perhaps think it worthwhile to
explain university matters to him at a
fairly low level.” But, now that I am
washed up on the political beach and
am sunburnt and scruffy looking, he
seldom takes me to his academic haunts.
The other day, however, he made me
clean my nails and took me to lunch
with some of his more distinguished
colleagues. They were a stimulating lot
though, in appearance, they really were
not much more imposing than Fred or I.
But it soon became clear that they
breathe a purer air than we do; they see
things from a loftier level.
Probably because they had been
briefed by Eccles or they may even
have been reading this column the
conversation soon got around to the
adverse effect of high youth wages on
youth employment. With typical mod-
esty, I offered the tentative opinion that
youth wages were too high in relation to
adult wages and that this was the reason
for the tragically high level of youth
unemployment. As you know by now, I
seldom have original ideas but I skim
the cream of other peoples so I
quoted from Clyde Cameron’s book
Unions in Crisis. He says, recounting his
experience as minister for Industrial
Relations in the Whitlam government:
“We have not helped the young by
demanding that they not be employed
unless paid excessive wages. We priced
them out of the labor market and we
deserve no thanks for that. We forgot
also that there is a generation gap
between young job-seekers and those
who do the hiring which means that,
when labor is plentiful, employers will
opt for experience and maturity.”
I thought that this judgment from
such an eminent authority would be
accepted by everyone but it had little
effect on Eccles’ colleagues who
demanded more concrete evidence. One
of them asked, looking down his nose:
“Which university did this Cameron
man attend?” When I muttered some-
thing about “hard knocks,” they were
clearly unimpressed. I admit that they
have a splendid view from the windows
of their ivory tower; you can see for
miles into the distance but not down to
the grassroots where Fred and I live. If
they really need concrete evidence to
demonstrate that lower youth wages
would increase youth employment, they
clearly do not understand the rough
cruel world.
I attended a taxation seminar in
Canberra in 1980 and heard two very
prestigious academics say that there was
no concrete evidence of a taxation
revolt. This startled me because even I
knew that the taxation world reeked
with big and little taxation revolts, so I
told them that they reminded me of the
madame who was playing the piano
downstairs in her brothel during a
police raid and telling them that she did
not know what was causing all those
thumping noises upstairs. I thought that
this would put the two in their place but
not a bit of it. One of them sidled up to
me later and asked: “What was making
those thumping noises, Bert?”
Of course, we cannot get hard
evidence that a sensible reduction in
youth wages would increase youth
employment for the simple reason that
their wages are not allowed to fall to the
market level but are held artificially
high in order to protect the wages and
employment of adult workers.
I have before me the transcript of a
telephone conversation between an
officer of the Victorian Equal Op-
portunity Commission and a staff
member of the fast-food people
McDonalds, who employ a lot of young
people. The commissionman said: “We
are investigating apparent age dis-
crimination in your employment
practices in Victoria. It is obvious that
you sack people at 20 and replace them
with 16-year-olds, thus effectively dis-
criminating against older people.” So
there it is, straight from the bureaucratic
mouth a deliberate effort to protect
older people at the expense of the kids.
Former federal Treasury chief John
Stone puts it more powerfully. He says:
“Overwhemingly the most important
reason for it (youth unemployment) is
the barrier to their employment which is
represented by the minimum wage rates
which their employers are legally
required to pay them .. . The truth is
that our system of wage determination
constitutes a crime against society. It is,
starkly, a system of wage determination
under which trade union leaders and
people preening themselves as ‘justices’
of various arbitration benches combine
to put young people in particular but
many others also out of work.” □


PIERPONT
The fallen idol
THE ONE TIME Pierpont ever visited
Bangkok he discovered that of all the
city’s manifold tourist attractions, the
only one suitable for an elderly gentle-
man of more or less unstained character
was a tour of the city’s temples.
So Pierpont spent three hours look-
ing at Buddhas. There were big
Buddhas, small Buddhas, stone
Buddhas, gold-plated Buddhas and
reclining Buddhas. The tour guide
promised Pierpont that he would see
something like 99 Buddhas, but your
correspondent called a halt somewhere
in the low 80s and told the driver to take
him back to the hotel for the largest
pink gin in Asia.
Your correspondent cannot say he is
a total expert on Buddhas, but he has
seen as many as he wishes to for the rest
of his allotted span Your typical
Buddha is plump, sitting in the lotus
position and has a wide, bland smile
that indicates either deep inner serenity
or the recent consumption of half a
crate of Bollinger. There were no angry
Buddhas, or sad Buddhas or Buddhas
biting their nails during a rough day on
the futures market.
Anyway, Pierpont left Bangkok with
the firm conviction that he had seen
every type of Buddha available and
would never have to inspect another in
his lifetime. In this your correspondent
was, for once, wrong. There is another
type of Buddha which might he
described as the declining or shrinking
variety and it can be found in the 1984
annual report of Buddha Gold Mines No
Liability.
Buddha Gold was launched in Sep-
tember 1980 on bright hopes. It had the
Dittmer gold mine, west of Proserpine
in Queensland.
Roughly, the Dittmer mine consisted
of a horizontal adit driven into a hillside
to intersect a steeply dipping vein of
gold. This mine had been worked since
1935, producing over the years a total of
1700 kilograms (55,000 ounces) of gold.
The consulting geologists, Douglas
McKenna & Partners Pty Ltd, reported
in the prospectus that:
■ The undeveloped part of the fissure
structure above the No 7 level was
thought to contain some 20,000 tonnes
of mineralised vein material, of un-
known grade.
■ Each level developed below No 7
was expected to provide a further 6000
tonnes of mineralised material, also of
unknown grade.
■ Dumps and tailings at the surface
amounted to 20,000 tonnes calculated at
averaging 5.5 grams per tonne.
■ A potential 60,000 tonnes of
mineralised stope fill (broken rock lying
around the underground bits of the
mine) of similar grade existed
underground.
On this, Buddha 20c par value shares
(issued at 50c), shot to $1.50 after listing,
capitalising Buddha at $lB million and
giving stags some nice profits.
The share price then sagged, as share
prices will, and Buddha had meanwhile
discovered that it had not raised enough
capital in the float and needed more.
By March 1982 Buddha was looking
for a loan from Hill Samuel, who as part
of the deal appointed Terrence Willsteed
& Associates to assess the Dittmer mine.
The mine was familiar to Willsteeds,
who had been consulting mining
engineer to the underwriters in the
original float.
Willsteed’s geologist spoke mostly in
terms of Dittmer’s “resource,” which
under Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy definitions carries a different
meaning to “ore.” He estimated the
resource to be:
■ 8700 tonnes of proved ore at 8.7
grams a tonne.
■ 100,900 tonnes of probable
resource at an assumed grade of 8.7
grams a tonne.
■ 86,800 tonnes of possible resource,
also at 8.7 grams.
■ 20,000 tonnes of surface dump
material average 5.5 grams.
■ 61,000 tonnes of stope fill material
with a grade of 6 grams, of which it was
assumed half could be mined and pro-
cessed.
The zone with the biggest potential
was No 7 level, which contained 46,800
tonnes of the probable and 52,500 of the
possible resource. A further 8500 tonnes
of probable resource was estimated to
be below No 7 level.
It is an illustration of the perils of
mining that the company has been
unable to recover gold at economic
grade from the mine. This becomes
apparent from the Buddha’s 1984
annual report, which is grim reading.
Apart from being hit by an iceberg,
Buddha seems to have suffered every
calamity conceivable.
They set up an assay laboratory at
the mine, which gave them misleadingly
high readings. These were not detected
until smelter assays were received some
three months after concentrate
shipments had been made
The mine and surrounding targets
were geologically mapped, but none of
the exploration targets yielded ore
grade material. Yet another consulting
geologist, Dr D. M. Ransom, inspected
the mine and reported it contained four
types of mineralisation.
The greater part of the rich ore had
been removed in mining between 1935
and 1947, but since the mine reopening
in 1981 the mining of the other three
types had predominated. As mining had
expanded outwards from the rich
mineralisation along the structure, head
grades had fallen off. The last two types
of mineralisation rarely showed values
greater that 2 grams a tonne.
Dr Ransom concluded that “present
indications suggest that ore below the
No 7 Level is of the low grade type,
hence potential in depth is uncertain.”
He further concluded that “potential
for a repetition of the Dittmer structure
close to the present mine is also low.”
Following Ransom’s dismal news,


the company put the mine on a care and
maintenance basis. They treated the
dump material on the surface. “It
should be mentioned that the grade of
5.5 grams per tonne ... has not been
achieved,” directors told shareholders.
“The grade to date has averaged 2.7
grams per tonne.”
The basic error appears to have
occurred in the assay labs. Terry
Willsteed tells Pierpont they had only a
couple of days to report on the mine
and time and money did not permit
them to take check assays of their own.
Pierpont merely cites the Buddha
case as a neat example of how
seemingly scientific reports on potential
mines are not always borne out when
the company starts digging up the rock
to make a dollar. It is not an uncommon
hazard in the mining game, but one that
is seldom recognised.
To complete Buddha’s misfortunes,
the company is also concerned about
$850,000 of its cash. This money was
raised by a share placement in April
1983, and placed on unsecured deposit
with Australian Asiatic Corporation Ltd.
Two Buddha directors (now former
directors) were at the time also directors
of Australian Asiatic.
On August 31 this year, Buddha
obtained a judgment against Australian
Asiatic for the return of the $850,000.
In September, receivers were ap-
pointed to two major subsidiaries of
Australian Asiatic and the company
asked for trading in its shares to be
suspended.
Buddha’s annual report says the
company is still seeking a declaration
that the two former directors were
jointly and severally liable to indemnify
Buddha against any loss arising from
the deposit of the money with
Australian Asiatic. Proceedings are con-
tinuing.
The annual report says the year to
June unfolded “a sorry state of affairs,”
so Pierpont can at least say he has now
seen a sorry Buddha. □
CHESS
Short cuts to the top
by Terrey Shaw
THE POPULAR image of a
grandmaster is of a seasoned, battle-
scarred veteran who has digested more
enemy pawns than most of us have
eaten peanuts at parties.
Now, I would be the last person to
want to shatter this illusion. I realise full
well that many readers probably feel
that just a few more games under their
belt will give them enough accumulated
wisdom to have a crack at the title.
However, the sad truth is that
statistics show that the average garden
variety grandmaster earns the title be-
fore the age of 30. Bobby Fischer was
hardly out of short pants when he
qualified for the title at 15.
Until recently, the honor of being the
world’s youngest active grandmaster
belonged to 21-year-old Garry
Kasparov of the USSR. But his name
has just been erased from the record
books by 19-year-old former dance
band leader Nigel Short of Lancashire,
England.
Short satisfied the final leg of the title
requirements by winning the North Sea
Cup in Esbjerg, Denmark, scoring five
wins, five draws and only one loss. He
has confirmed his status by winning the
British championship.
I cannot help feeling that 19 is just a
trifle young to be able to have the
magical “GM” appended to your name.
But perhaps I’m only envious. I seem to
remember that I was having difficulty
moving the Knights at that age. (Now
that I think of it, I still can’t get the
wretched creatures to behave.)
Short disposed of the pre-tourna-
ment favorite in Esbjerg, English
grandmaster Tony Miles, in the follow-
ing testing struggle.

ASIA
Opening China’s Cities
New reforms could spark the most sweeping changes since Mao’s takeover.
“We are embarking on another
ambitious program. We regard it
as a kind of revolution ...”
Mention his name almost anywhere in
rural China and watch the smiles
spread across the peasants’ faces. Deng
Xiaoping: the little man with the rasping
Sichuan accent, who took the communes
out of communism, brought back the family
farm and has given a welcome dose of pros-
perity to the four-fifths of China’s 1 billion
people still tied to the land. Now that blunt,
80-year-old politician, who reigns over Chi-
na with a handful of unassuming titles, is
turning his hand to the nation’s cities. It is a
more daunting and, perhaps, an ultimately
more rewarding task.
The “kind of revolution” Deng outlined
in some seemingly offhand remarks two
months ago may well portend the furthest-
reaching, longest-lasting changes to sweep
China since Mao Tse-tung’s victorious
troops hoisted the Red flag over Peking 35
years ago. Only days after Deng spoke, the
Chinese Communist Party’s central com-
mittee approved a landmark economic plan
that spells out the reforms: China’s sprawl-
ing, often antique but always muscular ur-
ban economy will be pried loose from its
rigid state controls—and pointed along a
path whose signposts are distinctly capital-
ist in everything but name. The young man
selling noodles on the street and his factory-
manager comrade rolling by in a limousine
are already seeing their lives and livelihoods
profoundly affected, albeit in radically dif-
ferent ways. Even freebooting foreign busi-
nessmen are being invited to join in. “Social-
ism Does Not Mean Pauperism”—so runs
the current official slogan. And China’s
cities, after decades of bolted doors and
barred windows, are suddenly being opened
to the winds of sweeping change.
Wrecks: To be sure, the wrecks of similarly
grand schemes —Mao’s Great Leap Foward
in the 1950 s stands out —are strewn through
recent Chinese history. Nor will anyone old
enough to have lived through it easily forget

the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when a
high party official named Deng Xiaoping
was purged by “ultraleftists” who had the
foresight to know a “capitalist roader”
when they saw one. The new drive to open
China’s cities, Deng says, will yield “im-
pressive results” within three to five years.
Presumably he plans to live long enough to
see, and if necessary protect, those gains.
Given the economic miracle he has already
worked in the countryside, it would be hasty
and probably unwise to bet against him.
The northern port of Dalian—Dairen to
old China hands—is one of 14 coastal cities
named by Peking six months ago to lead the
way in attracting foreign investment and
trade. “ We’re full of old products right
now, ” says Deputy Mayor Hong Yuandong,
41, whose office looks out on a promenade
that is still called Stalin Square. “A city must
produce its best products fast and more effi-
ciently, or it will lose out. ” Hong and other
Dalian officials have already laid plans to
convert 30 square miles of barren swamp and
farmland into a high-tech industrial park
featuring 500 factories and 6 hotels, and
employing half a million people—more than
a tenth of the city's present population. To
keep everyone else out, the entire zone will be
surrounded by a 32-foot moat.
Many of China’s biggest cities—Shang-
hai among them—owe their very develop-
ment to the old “treaty port” system of
foreign-owned enclaves, on the country’s
DENG’S URBAN SCHEME
Coastal cities have been designated to lead the
way in luring foreign investment.


coast and rivers. It was not, in-
deed, until 1949 that China defi-
nitively threw off what had by
then been more than a century of
domination by companies—and
armies—from Japan and from
Western nations including Great
Britain, France and America.
There is just the slightest whiff of
those bad old days of economic
colonialism in the air again today;
not coincidentally, all 14 of the
newly declared “open cities” are
the former sites of foreign “conces-
sions.” But no one is expecting a
return to the time when the signs in
a Shanghai park warned bluntly:
“No Dogs or Chinese Allowed.”
The difference, of course, is that
China today is not a waning, impo-
tent empire but a tightly con-
trolled modern state. The new
rules for the coastal cities, based in
part on Peking’s experience with
four “special economic zones”
started in 1979, offer some pleas-
ant advantages—cut-rate corpo-
rate income taxes, duty-free im-
ports of special machinery and raw
materials and limited access to
China’s own domestic market. But
they are not offering anyone a free
ride. “Yes, the French are back,”
says Zhang Qufei, an official in the
former French concession of
Zhanjiang, from which a subsid-
iary of Compagnie Franqaise des
Petroles is currently exploring
nearby Tonkin Gulf oilfields.
“Now, however, they are working
on the basis of mutual benefit.”
Unenthusiastic: The real prob-
lem is probably not whether the
foreigners will behave themselves.
International businessmen have
also changed since the 19th cen-
tury. But whether they can be
lured at all, especially in the droves
Deng has in mind, is a different
matter. Direct foreign investment
in China has not been especially
enthusiastic: $3.3 billion over the
last five years, much of it from
Hong Kong. The new rules are
designed to change that, and Japa-
nese companies in particular may
take the bait. Others, though, may continue
to be put off by experiences like that of a
Western diplomat who set out to inspect the
newly “opened” port city of Nantong—and
reached it only after a seven-hour ride on a
fourth-class boat. His report: “Who wants
to plunk down a million dollars for that?”
Shanghai wants you—to visit, to buy and
sell or to set up your own factory or restaurant
in one of the world's biggest cities. That
invitation is rolling like a wave across China,
where for three decades the basic rule for all
but a luckyfew was: stay where you are. Since
its doors were flung open two months ago,
WALLY McNAMEE—NEWSWEEK
A young couple out on the town: ‘Socialism Does Not Mean Pauperism ’ is the new message
Shanghai has teemed with gawking visitors
who sport provincial haircuts, lug huge bags
and, as often as not, look to do a little busi-
ness. Officials now say that 700,000 visitors
are in town on any given day—nearly double
the figure of a year ago.
Foreign trade may be the future, but the
real business of China is still done over-
whelmingly at home. Even before Deng’s
October “revolution,” the ties that had
barred a generation of Chinese from private
enterprise were already beginning to loos-
en—and the effects could be seen as millions
of shops, impromptu bazaars, tiny restau-
rants and even miniature factories blos-
somed in homes and along city streets. De-
spite tacit official encouragement, much of
that activity has had a vaguely illicit air. No
more. Now the mightiest state corporation
and the lowliest high-school dropout alike
are hearing the same message from the top:
get ahead and get rich, whatever way you
can —within certain bounds.
But the big news out of Deng’s reforms
eats at the heart of China’s economy: cen-
tral planning. Over the next several years
more than a million state enterprises and
factories are to be cut loose from the web of
official production quotas and subsidies,


and left instead to make their own decisions
according to patterns of supply and de-
mand—thriving or failing on their own
merits. Managers are expected to be given
far greater power to hire and fire, and to
reward or advance especially valuable
workers without concern for egalitarian pay
scales. Full-fledged “privatization” of
state-owned companies remains out of the
question, for ideological as well as practical
reasons: private capital in China is simply
too scarce. Profits, which have been consid-
ered “surpluses,” are another matter: in-
stead of being handed over as a lump to the
government, they will simply be taxed, with
the remainder available for reinvestment.
It will be months, probably years, before
the full force of these changes hits home.
Among the key measures is one that relaxes
rules confining companies to a particular
location: managers of a Shanghai shoe fac-
tory, for instance, will be free to set up their
own new plant in other provinces, if that is
where their market or materials or a plenti-
ful source of workers happens to be. Others
are already planning everything from trans-
lation services to restaurants in the special
economic zone of Shenzhen, on the border
with Hong Kong. Another likely possibility
is the breakup of some of the biggest na-
tionwide enterprises. CAAC, the state-
owned —and notoriously inefficient—air-
line monopoly, is reportedly on the verge of
a sweeping reorganization that aims to chop
it into nearly half a dozen potentially com-
peting regional companies based in Shang-
hai, Canton and other major cities.
Wang Qidong, 17, is one of9oo inmates at
the Shanghai School for Juvenile Delin-
quents. That is not the sort ofplace a former
choirboy and son of a party cadre normally
even knows about. But a year ago Wang

temptingly visible through an open window.
He was caught trying to steal it, even though
his own family already had its own set. “7

Crime, corruption, capitalist-style con-
Taking Stock in China
Even for the Chinese, the ultimate symbol of capitalism—
public ownership of corporate stock —might seem too much for a
communist state to swallow. But Deng Xiaoping doesn’t do
things by halves, and his capitalist road has now found its way to
stocks. It may yet reach a stock exchange.
Before the 1949 Communist takeover in China, Zheng Chang
Ming ran a pharmaceuticals factory that was listed on the
Shanghai Stock and Bond Exchange. Today, at 67, Zheng is at it
again. When the Shanghai People’s Bank of China announced
last August that private companies would be allowed to sell
stocks, Zheng’s new firm —the Hua Ning Industry and Com-
merce Corporation—became the first Shanghai company to
issue public stocks in 35 years. The shares, valued at $39 each,
quickly sold out, and the 462 shareholders have received more
than a piece of paper from the company’s CEO. “Whatever our
stockholders want us to do,” promises Zheng, “we’ll do it.”
From the boulevards of Shanghai to the byways of China’s
hinterlands, the country’s new
generation of commercial en-
terprises are beginning to go
public. Since they obtained
government approval in July,
more than a half dozen com-
panies have sold stocks, or
gu-piao. The reason is clear:
savings deposits have kept pace
with ballooning incomes, tri-
pling over the last four years to
a total of $43 billion. Much of
the wealth belongs to the bur-
geoning class of getihu, or
individual entrepreneurs, who
have returned to the financial
marketplace since their perse-
cution as “capitalist roaders”
during the decade-long Cultur-
al Revolution.
With its newfound interest
in the efficiencies of the private
sector, the Peking government
wants to redirect savings into
enterprises that can help spur
China’s commercial develop-
ment. “We are exploring ways
to funnel society’s funds into
modernizations,” says Zhang
Jibin, general manager of Tian
Zhang outside his Peking department store: Modernizations
MELINDA LIU—NEWSWEEK
Qiao Merchandise Co., the first Peking company to issue stocks.
For Chinese investors, the prospects for profit are attractive.
Gupiao mature in one to three years and olfer guaranteed
dividends that average about 5.5 percent a year—higher than
the prevailing bank interest rates for one-year, fixed-time
deposits. Some firms also offer a potential dividend based on
the company’s annual profits, though in the case of Zheng’s
company, the People’s Bank of China has set a 15 percent
ceiling on those sums.
Wild: China remains a long way from becoming an interna-
tional financial center. There is no central stock exchange; shares
can now be bought and sold among individuals. Peking is wary of
setting up a New York- or London-style market, mindful of the
wild speculation and cutthroat intrigues of the pre-1949
Shanghai exchange. But government and think-tank analysts
have not ruled out a stock market revival. Last June, an analyst
from the Shanghai Finance Research Institute suggested that
China establish a “socialist monetary market” that would han-
dle stocks and securities in Shanghai. And last month, Shang-
hai’s Liberation Daily newspaper ran a front-page article with
the headline, shanghai
SHOULD BE BOLD ENOUGH TO
SET UP A STOCK EXCHANGE.
The prospect of dealing in an
open market excites entrepre-
neurs like Zheng. “We com-
peted for many decades in the
preliberation market,” he
says. “Now we must have
competition to serve the peo-
ple—and our stockholders.”
Zheng has already collected
French and American designs
for the $20,000 jewelry store
that he plans to open next
month. His firm is also accu-
mulating foreign samples for a
$150,000 garment factory; it
has purchased five sedans to
use in a hotel and transporta-
tion service and is launching
a mail-order service in con-
sumer goods—“just like
Sears,” he says. If nothing
else, Zheng is determined to
give his new Chinese capitalist
shareholders a good run for
their money.
MARILYN ACHIRON with
MELINDA LIU in Shanghai


sumerism and a horde of other urban vices
are presumably among the things Deng’s
newly opened cities would prefer to keep
out. That could be a vain hope. But even so,
those are the problems of riches—and a
country whose per capita GNP stands at
only $3lO annually may be more than will-
ing to have the chance to worry about that
kind of problem.
Traumatic: Inflation is another matter —
and something that may be only a distant
rumor to most Chinese of less than middle
age. They had best start reading up. “Price
reform” is the official designation for new
policies designed to gradually eliminate
many official subsidies and ceilings, and to
let some prices seek their own levels in the
marketplace. That could be a traumatic
process, given the absurdly low prices Chi-
nese consumers pay for essential goods and
services. As Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang remarked last week: “Some prices
will go up, some will drop.” He also pledged
to ensure that “wage rises will precede price
adjustments.” Free-market boosters say
that will happen anyway, especially as re-
laxed controls and greater incentives spur
production that causes prices to drop. But
the man in the street does not seem quite
convinced: the simple announcement of
“price reforms” has already set off waves of
panic buying in a number of Chinese cities.
For China’s most pressing current urban

EVE ARNOLD— MAGNUM
Peking women in the latest fashions: Get ahead and get rich —within certain bounds
problems—crowding, unemployment and
underemployment —the short-term bene-
fits are likely to be equally mixed. A sale of
private apartments in Shanghai in October
fetched prices as high as $lB5 per square
meter, roughly half a year’s wages for the
average worker (most of the buyers were
overseas Chinese). By contrast, a five-room
state-subsidized apartment can be had for as
little as $4 a month. Rents undoubtedly will
soon begin rising toward more realistic lev-
els; prices for private flats may drop as more
come on the market. But it will be a long time
indeed before that combination of forces
puts owning a home, or even renting an
unsubsidized apartment, within reach of
any but the most successful few.
Tron Rice Bowl’: The outlook may not be
much brighter for jobs, or at least not until
the expected boom in new enterprises gets
going—a development that could take
years. If all Chinese managers were to act
immediately on their newly won permission
to fire lazy or incompetent employees, mil-
lions of nominal workers would suddenly
find themselves on the streets. (Some, in-
deed, may now be paying more attention to
their jobs, and not only with an eye to a
possible bonus —which certainly should
count as a plus.) It is still too early to tell
how serious Deng and his colleagues are
about letting state factories and companies
sink or swim, whatever the consequences.
But they must certainly know that the “iron
rice bowl”—the long-held right of workers,
to their jobs—is a concept that many Chi-
nese will not part with easily.
So far, however, Deng’s stunning success
with reform in the countryside may be giv-
ing him some leeway. There will certainly be
some foot-dragging. Diehard Maoists can
hardly be pleased at having nascent capital-
ism invited in through the front door. Xeno-
phobes with bad memories of old Shanghai
are undoubtedly gnashing their teeth at the
prospect of foreigners getting rich off the
sweat of honestly toiling Chinese. And in
practical terms, the worst resistance will
probably come from party functionaries,
especially those being asked to surrender
their once iron rule over even the minutest
aspects of the country’s economic life. What
do you do with a jobless commissar?
Two years ago the Yong Jiang Instrument
Factory in Guizhou was named a national
model of a “well-managed enterprise. ” Qin
Shimin, whose efforts as manager had trans-
formed the plant from a debt-ridden disas-
ter, got the sack for his pains. Qin, his superi-
ors said, had committed “violations of
discipline”—including such unorthodox
measures as trimming front-office staff and
hiring temporary workers. Recently the Peo-
ple ’s Daily plucked his case from obscurity to
make a point. “Reformers like Qin, ” the
commentary said, “may find difficulties or
even misfortune in their path, but they are
bound to succeed in the end. ”
Deng Xiaoping has clearly thrown in
China’s lot with the Qin Shimins of this
world —although the People’s Daily coyly
omitted any mention of whether or not he
ever got his job back. The Chinese leader is
also clearly betting on many of the same
ideas that power the greatest economies in
the world. If China is to rise to that stature
some day, as Deng Xiaoping clearly hopes,
its cities will be the key. The question now is
how they take to being freer.

Training the New Managers
PHOTOS BY MIAO MING
Planning a Western-style curriculum, a Dalian classroom: Charting a capitalist road toward growth and industrial vitality
Chairman Deng Xiaoping’s capitalist
road toward growth and industrial vi-
tality lacks one obvious asset —well-trained
capitalists. That may now change. Two
months ago, Peking unveiled a sweeping set
of reforms in an attempt to encourage pri-
vate enterprise and put China into the first
rank of industrial powers by the year 2000.
And to implement the reforms, China has
embraced yet another capitalist tool: an
American business school that will operate
on Chinese soil.
Starting next May, 40 of China’s most
promising factory directors, industry lead-
ers and government officials will be taught
the mysteries of Western management,
marketing, accounting and strategic plan-
ning. The program, sponsored by the Chi-
nese and the U.S. Commerce Department at
a cost of $2 million, will be conducted —in
English—at the National Center for Science
and Technology at Dalian, on the northeast
coast of China. The instructors will be pro-
fessors from the State University of New
York (SUNY) in Buffalo. The three-year
program ends with a final semester of study
in the United States. Then the newly minted
Chinese managers will return home with a
SUNY M.B.A. in hand and, if all goes well, a
bright future ahead.
The American M.B.A. program at Da-
lian could not have been better timed. Deng
has already ordered party officials to pre-
pare the way for younger, college-educated
professionals in all sectors of China’s gov-
ernment and industry. Of the nearly 2 mil-
lion cadres now employed in the state’s
financial and commercial sector, fewer than
4 percent hold college degrees. In addition,
roughly two-thirds of the country’s present
managers are nearing the mandatory retire-
ment age of 56. Deng has also voiced con-
cern that China’s present executives still
rely too much on Soviet-style management
methods that have hampered the country’s
growth. To boost productivity and innova-
tive management techniques, China’s Cen-
tral Committee recently declared: “It would
be wrong to. . . rest complacent about expe-
rience that is no longer applicable. Our
urgent task is to promote boldly thousands
upon thousands of young and middle-aged
managers and take steps to train them.”
Success: Dalian figures large in that plan;
indeed, it shows every sign of becoming the
“Harvard Business School of China.” The
school was opened in 1980 as a six-month
training course, and the list of its graduates
reads like a Who’s Who of China’s up-and-
coming leadership. The brightest success is
Wang Zhaoguo, who caught the eye of Chi-
nese leaders after he launched a whirlwind
of reforms at one of China’s largest auto-
motive plants. By setting up an aggressive
sales force and upgrading services, Wang
tripled the company’s revenues. He was
named head of the 48 million-member Com-
munist Youth League and has been at the
side of China’s top leadership ever since.
Ye Qing, who entered Dalian’s initial six-
month course when he was a high-ranking
official in Heilongjiang Province, is now the
vice minister of China’s coal
ministry. And Hong Yuan-
dong, a former plastics-factory
director, is now deputy mayor
of Dalian, a major industrial
port. Hong put his Dalian les-
sons to work when he conduct-
ed a marketing survey of the
city’s garment industry. After
learning that factories were
churning out goods designed in
the 19505, many of which were
no longer in demand, Hong en-
couraged shops to manufacture
more Western-style clothing,
He went on to order up surveys
Wang: The brightest
for other industries. As for his alma
mater, Hong has nothing but praise. “It’s
not entirely true that Dalian’s training was
the reason for our promotions, but it
helped,” he says.
Though most of Dalian’s M.B.A. candi-
dates are in line for plum jobs and quick
promotions after graduation, they do face
some obstacles. It’s not clear just how much
clout the new breed of professionals will
carry when they return to the factories.
Deng may have promised China’s young
managers more responsibility and latitude,
but that doesn’t guarantee that the coun-
try’s existing managers are going to make
room for them. It is also unclear how far
Peking plans to take its management re-
forms. It would be one thing for the govern-
ment to clear out middle managers; it would
be quite another for China’s leaders to chal-
lenge the country’s more senior officials and
managers. As always, the Communist Party
will determine the timing and manner of any
such shifts. As Frank Jen, the SUNY profes-
sor in charge of the program, puts it: “Chi-
nese leaders keep saying that they want to
improve management. But are they willing
to share power?”
Despite such reservations, other coun-
tries are following America’s pioneering
success at Dalian. West Germany and Japan
are planning similar training
centers, though smaller in
scale, and Canada and the Eu-
ropean Economic Commission
have set up schools for manag-
ers of small businesses. Chinese
officials emphasize they will be
very selective in adopting
Western management tech-
niques, but the very fact they
are learning and listening un-
derscores how much Peking’s
attitudes toward the West have
changed in recent years.

U.S. AFFAIRS
Embassies Under Siege
The rubble in Colombia: The drug traffickers responded to pressure by threatening an indiscriminate slaughter of Americans
A week of alarming incidents focuses attention on the threat to U.S. diplomats.
Sunday, Nov. 25: As a car speeds by the
American Embassy in Lisbon, a passenger
hurls four grenades over the six-foot embas-
sy wall. Only one explodes, causing minor
damage to an embassy vehicle.
Monday, Nov. 26: Twenty-two pounds of
dynamite explode in an automobile double-
parked across from the heavily fortified
American Embassy in Bogota. Six persons
are injured, and a Colombian woman’s neck
is severed by falling glass.
Tuesday, Nov. 27: Italian police announce
they have foiled a planned attack on the
American Embassy in Rome and arrested
seven Lebanese whom they accused of “pre-
paring a massacre.” The suspects are said to
be members of the Islamic Holy War, the
group that claimed responsibility for the
suicide bombings of the American Embassy
and Marine barracks in Beirut.
Thursday, Nov. 29: The U.S. Embassy in
San Salvador is strafed by machine-gun fire
from a passing car. No one is injured.
The log grows more and more frighten-
ing as one U.S. embassy after another
comes under siege. Administration officials
recently reported that since the Sept. 20
bombing of the embassy annex in Beirut,
government agencies have been receiving
about 100 threats against American instal-
lations abroad each week. Rand Corp. ter-
rorism specialist Brian Jenkins has predict-
ed that there will be several hundred attacks
against U.S. foreign facilities within the
next four years. Based on the odds, he fore-
saw 40 to 50 American casualties and four
to eight incidents that will have major diplo-
matic consequences for the United States,
U.S. officials insist that they won’t be in-
timidated. But “the American public has to
be prepared to know that there is a growing
risk,” warns Assistant Secretary of State
Robert Lamb, who is in charge of embassy
security. “U.S. embassies and U.S. diplo-
mats abroad are on the front line of a new
kind of warfare.”
Washington has responded to the threat
with a major new emphasis on embassy
security. For the current fiscal year, Con-
gress has earmarked $475 million to fortify
embassy structures or build new facilities
where fortification is not enough. In addi-
tion, the National Research Council of the
National Academy of Sciences is trying to
develop a new kind of architecture that is
safe and blast-resistant but still embodies
the air of openness that Washington at-
tempts to project abroad. But low-key forti-
fications and shatterproof glass will hardly
end the risk. In recent months, for example,
the American Embassy in Bonn has been
made almost impregnable with 10-foot steel
gates, metal detectors and very suspicious
guards. Just two miles north, however, lies
an American compound comprising a com-
missary, a U.S. post office, a movie theater
and American schools, sports facilities, res-
taurants and bars. They are poorly protect-
ed and easy targets for terrorist attack,

larly tight around the American Embassy in
Cairo, which has had more than its share of
threats. Last month, when a Newsweek
employee had the misfortune of having her
car break down in front of the Cairo embas-
sy, she was rushed by about 20 policemen
shouting, “ Mamnua! Mamnua /” —“For-
bidden! Forbidden!”
The variety of last week’s threats and
attacks illustrates a central difficulty of
providing protection: terrorism can erupt
almost anywhere for any number of ob-
scure motives. Claiming credit for the at-
tack in Lisbon was a leftist organization that
hardly seemed a match for embassy securi-
ty. In late October the group, which calls
itself the Popular Forces of the
25th of April (FP-25), planted a
crude homemade bazooka on a
hillside across the road from the
embassy. But when the firing
mechanism failed to work, the
group alerted the police because, it
said, it feared for the safety of chil-
dren playing in the area. Military
experts who examined the bazoo-
ka said that it was highly unlikely
that it could ever have hit its tar-
get. Last June Portuguese police
made a major sweep of the organi-
zation, arresting 51 suspected
terrorists, including a two-time
former presidential candidate, Lt.
Col. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho.
The attacks on the American Em-
bassy, police believe, were intend-
ed simply to prove that FP-25 still existed.
The bombing in Bogota, on the other
hand, constituted an open declaration of
war. There was little doubt that the attack
was the work of Colombia’s drug Mafia,
which was retaliating against stepped-up
American efforts against the cocaine and
marijuana trade (box). Bombs had already
exploded outside the official residence of
American Ambassador Lewis Tambs, and
the drug traffickers promised that five
Americans would die for every Colombian
extradited to the United States. The threat
so alarmed the State Department that it
withdrew 10 American diplomats and their
families and warned its remaining personnel
in Colombia to stay close to the embassy or
their well-guarded homes.
Panic: The bombing set off a wave of
panic in the American community in Bo-
gota. A number of American businessmen
said they expected to be transferred home.
Ambassador Tambs, who is clearly at the
top of the drug runners’ hit list, vowed that
the U.S. government would not relent in
“the common fight against drug traffickers
and terrorism.” But the Colombian mafia
has never had any second thoughts about
murdering those who stand in its way. As
well organized as any legitimate corpo-
ration, the Colombian traffickers have
enough money to buy as many weapons and
hire as many killers as they need.
Even more threatening was the apparent
plot in Italy. The first tip-off came on Nov.
18, when police at the Zurich airport arrest-
ed a 21-year-old Lebanese carrying two
pounds of explosives concealed in a cloth
belt. Among his effects, Swiss police found
an address in Rome. They quickly alerted
Italian authorities who followed the trail to
seven young Lebanese holed up in the small
seaside town of Ladispoli, north of Rome.

walls and evaluating whether they could

What was particularly frightening was
the meticulous manner in which the plot
was allegedly planned. The seven Lebanese
had been living quietly in Italy for almost a
year. Police speculated that the team was
being supplied with explosives by a series of
international couriers, and they were inves-
tigating the possibility of a link between the
Lebanese and an Arab who was arrested last
August on a train in Trieste with 15 pounds
of explosives. Whatever the case, Italian
authorities insisted that the alleged plot was
close to execution.
It was unclear how the police had con-
eluded that the arrested men were
members of the Islamic Holy War.
“The Shiites tend to be pro-Kho-
meini types,” said one American
Embassy source, “and that alone
does not tell us who was behind
it.” Nonetheless, the same diplo-
mat insisted, “there is an organiza-
tion; there A direction.” American
officials claimed that they felt
“reasonably secure” that any at-
tack would not have penetrated
the cement pillars, pneumatic
metal barriers and other protec-
tive devices surrounding the em-
bassy. That, however, was small
comfort for the Italians. The

plosion there could do incalculable damage.
Even the strictest of precautions are no
real deterrent to international terrorism.
On Tuesday, Nov. 27, Percy Norris, the
British deputy high commissioner in Bom-
bay, was being driven to the consulate when
two men disguised as joggers shot him
through the head and heart. The next day, a
man calling from Bucharest, Romania, in-
formed European news agencies that the
killing had been carried out by the “Revolu-
tionary Organization of Socialist Mus-
lims,” a shadowy group believed responsi-
ble for the June 1982 shooting of Shlomo
Argov, the Israeli ambassador to Britain,
and the murder of another British diplomat
in Athens in March of this year. Norris was
by no means an important diplomat, and his
murder was evidently motivated by the jail-
ing of three Arabs for the wounding of
Argov halfway around the world. The im-
plication was that as long as terrorists can
obtain passports, no diplomat anywhere is
entirely safe. “There are constant reminders
from around the world that this is a danger-
ous profession,” says an American Embas-
sy official in London. “When we read about
the murder of someone like Percy Norris, it
reminds us that this is not the quiet and
peaceful job it was when many of us first
joined the service.”

Bogota’s Drug Wars
The Tranquilandia bust: Taking on the drug traffickers —army for army
PHOTOS BY ESPECTADOR— SYGMA
It is—quite literally—a drug war. For almost a decade, Co-
lombian Mafia chiefs —or capos —have run a huge percentage of
the world’s cocaine and marijuana out of the dense Andes jungles
with the help of planes, hired killers and an arsenal of deadly
weapons. Pitted against them has been the U.S. Drug Enforce-
ment Agency (DEA), the government of Colombian President
Belisario Betancur and his national Army. So far, the traffickers
are still winning. But DEA officials believe they have the drug
kings on the run —and that the attack on
the U.S. Embassy in Bogota was a sign of
their growing desperation.
One measure of its success, the DEA
says, is that the Colombian traffickers
have shifted much of their refining and
storage operations to the United States.
Officials see this as a direct result of recent
drug busts inside Colombia—the most no-
table of which came last March, when
government troops and narcotics agents
raided a multibillion-dollar cocaine com-
pound called Tranquilandia in southern
Colombia. By October, U.S. agents had
discovered and closed down more cocaine
labs in the United States than in all of 1983.
Just last week, a local deputy sheriff came
upon an abandoned airstrip near Yucca,
Ariz., and his men found 1,500 pounds of
cocaine in 700 red, green and silver Christ-
mas packages—one of the largest U.S.
Cocaine haul: A booming business
seizures ever. On the streets, the crackdown has
driven up cocaine prices in Miami, New York
and other key markets.
Pressure to bring more traffickers to trial in
America has also shaken the drug kings. Since he
arrived in Bogota in 1983, U.S. Ambassador
Lewis Tambs has insisted that Colombia honor a
1982 extradition treaty with Washington. The
extradition issue may have been behind the assas-
sination of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo
Lara Bonilla last May: at the time, Lara Bonilla
was the only member of Betancur’s cabinet who
strongly endorsed the treaty. Since then, the
traffickers have issued repeated death threats
against Tambs, against other embassy personnel
and against the new justice minister, Enrique
Parejo Gonzalez. Bogota has begun processing
requests for 120 Colombians; 6 extraditions have
been approved. Among those on the list: Pablo
Escobar and Carlos Lehder, two top traffickers
who are both in hiding.
Newsweek has learned that the DEA has
also added a new offensive to its drug blitz. Code-
named Operation Chemcon, it is aimed at shutting off the supply
of two chemicals needed to refine cocaine—ether and acetone.
The DEA has persuaded major U.S. and European producers of
the chemicals to report all orders of five gallons or more. With
this information, they have tracked chemicals to Panama and
Colombia, where local authorities have seized more than 13,000
55-gallon drums of ether and acetone so far. Since the project
began, the price of ether has risen as high as $7,000 a barrel on the
Colombian black market. Traffickers have been unable to find
effective substitutes for the chemicals.
Whether the drug war can do more than just rattle the capos,
however, remains to be seen. Despite the
recent crackdown, their business is still
booming. Colombia continues to account
for two-thirds of the marijuana and co-
caine entering the United States and for 80
percent of the cocaine sold worldwide. A
sweep by the Bolivian Army after Lara
Bonilla’s murder failed to capture any
high-level Mafia chiefs. And last month, a
U.S. Coast Guard attempt to blockade
drug ships olf the Colombia coast yielded
meager results. As long as the drug busi-
ness offers overnight riches, there will be
no shortage of recruits in a country where
two-thirds of the population earns less
than $ 100 per month. Like so many other
problems in South America, the traffick-
ing is rooted in poverty —and that will only
make it harder to defeat the drug kings.

Debating the Military Option
Weinberger: The real issue is not battlefield flexibility but firm political support
“The hard reality is that diplomacy not
backed by military strength is ineffectual, ”
the policymaker warned. Power and diplo-
macy “must go together, or we will accom-
plish very little in this world. ”
The words were tough enough to suit any
Washington militarist. Surprisingly,
the power merchant was none other than
George Shultz, Reagan’s sober secretary of
state, addressing the Trilateral Commission
last April. Defense Secretary Caspar Wein-
berger nursed his rebuttal for months. But
when he finally spoke up last week, the
normally acerbic Weinberger sounded posi-
tively dovish by comparison. “Commitment
of U.S. forces to combat should be a last
resort,” he told the National Press Club —
“to be used only when other means have
failed or have no prospect of succeeding. ”
A secretary of state posturing like a com-
bat general? A secretary of defense resonat-
ing cautious diplomacy? Had the Reagan
administration gone through the looking
glass? The reality was more substantial.
Their dueling speeches signaled that a deep-
seated philosophical debate between Shultz
and Weinberger had broken into the open at
last. In one sense, the issue is familiar: nearly
a decade after the fall of Saigon, Washing-
ton’s policymakerssnV/are debating the uses
and limits of American military power—
not only in the realm of nuclear weapons,
about which talks with the Soviets are just
about to begin again, but in much grayer
areas. The question: how and when should
U.S. military might be used to combat global
terrorism, revolution and other crises that
fall short of total war but still challenge
American interests?
The Shultz-Weinberger contretemps has
thrown off its hottest sparks over the disas-
trous Marine mission to Beirut. When the
U.S.-backed Lebanese Army began to col-
lapse, Shultz argued that U.S. credibility
was on the line and persuaded Reagan to
unleash American firepower to support the
beleaguered Lebanese —an effort that ulti-
mately failed. Weinberger and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, for their part, insisted from
the start that Lebanon’s problems were po-
litical—and insoluble by the
limited U.S. forces in the area.
Taking up the challenge,
Shultz fired off his public rebut-
tal in April. Military power and
diplomacy must go hand in
hand, he argued. “It was pre-
cisely our military role in Leba-
non that was problematical,
not our diplomatic exertion,”
he said. In an October speech to
a Jewish group, he further sug-
gested that the nation must
drop its reluctance to use mili-
tary force against terrorist
groups—even though a U.S. as-
sault might lead to the death of
soldiers and innocent civilians.
‘National Will’: Shultz ’s case
for the military option has not
convinced the Pentagon. Weinberger began
writing his contrary brief over the summer,
but decided to postpone his speech until
after Reagan’s re-election. He discussed the
work in progress several times with the
president, and cleared the final text with
the National Security Council the day be-
fore its delivery. Weinberger also gave
Shultz an early copy—at their breakfast
together only four hours before he read the
words publicly. Without mentioning the
secretary of state by name, Weinberger’s
speech gave a point-by-point rebuttal of
Shultz’s arguments. The real issue, Wein-
berger maintained, is not U.S. military flexi-
bility, but rather U.S. willingness to support
a military intervention. “Unless we are cer-
tain that force is essential,” he said, “we run
the risk of inadequate national will to apply
the resources needed.”
Fight: Weinberger suggested “six major
tests” to govern a U.S. commitment of com-
bat troops to a crisis: the use of force must be
a last resort, the objective must be vital to
U.S. interests, there must be “the clear in-
tention of winning,” leaders must clearly
define the nation’s political and military
goals, they must be flexible enough to reas-
sess the size and disposition of the force, and
the American people and Congress must
support the effort. Looking toward the fu-
ture, Weinberger said that the United States
will not be pulled piecemeal into Central
America as it was into Vietnam. “These
tests can help us to avoid being drawn inexo-
rably into an endless morass, where it is not
vital to our national interest to fight.”
In a larger sense, the Shultz-Weinberger
debate mirrors broader divisions on how to
combat terrorism and brush-fire challenges.
In Lebanon, the administration drew up at
least two plans to retaliate against terrorist
strongholds but abandoned both for fear
that the action would merely prompt fur-
ther attacks against Americans. In Central
America, Reagan’s team is encouraging ne-
gotiations with Nicaragua while simulta-
neously supporting rebel attempts to over-
throw the leftist regime. In the future, any
U.S. military action to preserve even such
strategic assets as the Philippines and South
Shultz: Power and diplomacy must go hand in hand
Korea could be controversial. Direct U.S.
involvement in support of other key re-
gimes, in southern Africa or Pakistan,
would prove even more difficult. Of course,
Shultz, Weinberger, Congress and public
opinion have agreed on the use of force in one
recent case. Unfortunately for the United
States, the world presents few military ob-
jectives as easily mastered as tiny Grenada.

The First-Family Feud (Cont’d)
Ronald Reagan took time from building
a budget and prepping for arms talks
to undertake a third touchy round of negoti-
ations last week —with his own son. The
president’s aim was to cap a First-Family
Feud between Michael Reagan, 39, and
stepmother Nancy that flared in the media
for the second week running.
The noisy quarrel preoccupied
the president, reduced Nancy to
tears and threatened to tarnish
Reagan’s Inaugural celebration.
In round two Michael showed
up on the NBC and CBS morning
news shows to lament the “mis-
communication” that had led
Nancy to pronounce him “es-
tranged” from his father (News-
week, Dec. 3). Then Reagan’s
elder daughter, Maureen, came
to Nancy’s defense—complain-
ing that her brother’s “vendetta”
had left the president and First
Lady “just agonized.”
The family divisions seemed
to grow sharper after what an
aide described as a “miserable
Thanksgiving” for the Reagans in Califor-
nia. Their children, Ron and Patti, attended
the family gathering at Santa Barbara along
with Maureen, a child of Reagan’s first
marriage to actress Jane Wyman; only
Michael, adopted by Reagan and Wyman,
made other plans. And the president him-
self was still fuming over Michael’s sugges-
tion that Nancy’s bump on the head on the
Sunday night before Election Day had
prompted her talk of family estrangement,
The First Father wanted to defend his wife
publicly, but deputy chief of staff Michael
Deaver talked him out of it.
Reagan did call his son—but Michael
hung up on him, according to the White
House, which also reported that Reagan
subsequently called Michael daily from
Washington to try smoothing over family
WALLY McNAMEE —NEWSWEEK
Maureen and Michael Reagan: Charges of a ‘vendetta’ as the quarrel simmered on and on
differences. The president failed to per-
suade his son to drop his television appear-
ances, but Michael moderated his com-
plaints on the air. “The feeling was his
father’s call did some good,” says one aide.
Relations have always been strained be-
tween Nancy and her husband’s adopted
son in California. Among other things, Mi-
chael “makes these flip remarks that he
thinks are funny but that hurt people,” says
a Reagan aide. A photograph showing Mi-
chael wearing a T shirt that proclaimed
“I’m Not the Dancer”—which Nancy took
as a jibe at Ron, who danced for a time with
the Joffrey Ballet—only made matters
worse. In addition, sister Maureen com-
plained that Michael had joked about
Maureen’s previous marriages and her way
of lecturing audiences. Michael denied he
meant to ridicule Ron or Maureen.*
In the latest scenario for rapprochement,
Reagan’s aides hope to arrange a family
meeting when the Reagans visit Los An-
geles in early January. “The president very
much wants [Michael] to come to the Inau-
gural,” said one close adviser. “If I had to
bet, I’d bet he’ll be here.” Michael himself
suggested a family get-together at Christ-
mas. Will he attend his father’s Inaugu-
ral? “1 have no problem. I was at the last
one,” he told Newsweek late in the week.
“Yeah, I don’t see any reason why not.”

Washington and MARTIN KASINDORF in Los Angeles
*Maureen’s outburst may have hampered her role as the
family envoy who has tried persuading Michael—without
success—to seek professional help. “We call it ‘guidance’,’’
said an aide, but even the suggestion “makes him angrier.”
Heavyweight Politics
Political wisdom around Boston and Washington has long
held that if Teddy Kennedy loomed large physically, he was no
threat politically. The theory was that extra weight reflected
more concern for good food and other pleasures than for the
rigors of politics. By that standard, every Democrat with nation-
al ambitions should be feeling pretty safe these
days: Kennedy has never seemed to loom so large,
every button in his wardrobe threatening to pop
under the strain. So dramatic is his expanding
girth that a Boston Globe political columnist
named Mike Barnicle recently gibed: “When the
Republicans talk about cutting fat. . .Teddy takes
it personally.” And: “He gets group rates from
Delta Air Lines.”
Kennedy matched gibe for gibe in his answer to
the Globe last week. “I am sure I have the sympa-
thy of all those who have a similar problem,
including some members of the Globe staff,” he
wrote. “But when I get down to my fighting
Kennedy: Equal time?
RON GALELLA
weight, which I plan to do, I would hope the Globe’s policy of
fairness will entitle me to the same expansive coverage.”
In fact, Senate insiders say that Kennedy’s current appetite
for ice cream, alcohol and other earthly delights is apparently
not connected with any serious emotional crisis or self-destruc-
tive drinking, as it has been at times in the past. Rather he is
“unwinding. .. after a tough campaign in which he hit 21 states
in 30 days,” according to one old friend. And the extra pounds
have not prevented Teddy from keeping a heavy
schedule of public appearances. Last week he
spoke to the African-American Institute in New
York—announcing one of two planned trips to
Africa in coming weeks —as well as to the Anti-
Defamation League of B’nai B’rith in Los Angeles
and the Arms Control Association in Washing-
ton. “He is really excited about the movement in
the arms-control field,” said one Kennedy aide.
Associates say the senator will lead the drive for
cuts in defense spending, to ease the pressure on
social programs, and that he will work to rebuild a
broad-based Democratic Party—whatever his
own presidential plans for 1988 may be.


EUROPE
Mitterrand’s Winter of Woes
Kanak separatists after taking over a police station on New Caledonia: Already beset by economic troubles, Mitterrand has lately
At the midpoint in his term, the president is reeling from a host of problems.
Now is the winter of France’s discontent
with Frangois Mitterrand. At the
dreary midpoint of his seven-year term, the
French president’s approval rating has
plunged to an all-time low of 25 percent.
Beset by economic woes that have forcibly
turned his socialist experiment into a classic
conservative austerity program, Mitter-
rand has been plagued in recent weeks by
diplomatic gaffes and charges of fuddled
leadership from the dust of Chad to the
erstwhile island paradise of New Caledonia.
And last week, with yet another inconclu-
sive diplomatic venture —to Syria—going
sour, the normally argumentative French
could for once agree: Mitterrand was in
deep trouble.
The rush of events last week did nothing
to reverse that slide. Tensions on New Cale-
donia escalated dramatically when separa-
tist militants declared a provisional govern-
ment and murdered a white farmer during a
daylight raid. Mitterrand’s response to the
turmoil looked weak and vacillating. Then
he set off on a two-day trip to Syria for talks
with President Hafez Assad. Mitterrand’s
obvious intent was to demonstrate that he
was a statesman. In fact, he appeared to be
cozying up to a country that has been linked
to last year’s bombing of the French bar-
racks in Beirut that killed 56 soldiers—with
no more tangible results so far than the
cutting of an arms deal. Meanwhile, the
president’s supporters were cringing and
his opponents crowing over Libyan leader
Muammar Kaddafi’s latest strategems in
Chad. “In the face of Libya, Syria and New
Caledonia, France has appeared as a coun-
try without will, without dignity,” editori-
alized the opposition newspaper Le Quoti-
dien. “Once is all right. Three times, and
here comes disaster.”
One dissenter from the popular wisdom is
Mitterrand himself. In a conversation last
week with Newsweek Paris bureau chief
Fred Coleman, Mitterrand appeared re-
laxed, upbeat and showing no signs of any-
thing approaching a bunker mentality.
Leaning back on a Louis XVI settee in his
ornate office in the Elysee Palace, Mitter-
rand smiled broadly as he spoke of his ad-
ministration’s accomplishments. The presi-
dent did admit at one point that he had not
met all of his goals, particularly one that he
considers very important. “We have not
improved the unemployment situation,” he
said. “That is my great regret.” But he ruled
out any major changes in economic or dip-
lomatic policy in the coming year. “The
polls are serious,” he said. “[But] we will
continue our work as we started it. Once the
French reap the fruits of our actions, I think
their opinions will change.”
Mitterrand’s optimism is in sharp con-
trast to the generally gloomy prospects that
confront his government. High unemploy


been plagued by a series of diplomatic reversals
SYGMA
ment and sluggish economic growth are
virtually certain to prevail through next
year, increasing economic hardship and
forcing even some middle-class families into
poverty. That prospect, naturally, does not
augur well for the Socialist Party’s chances
in the 1986 elections for the National As-
sembly. But Mitterrand’s advisers are al-
ready drafting contingency plans. Despite
Prime Minister Laurent Fabius’s public
claims that the elections are still “winna-
ble,” Newsweek has learned that top aides
at the Elysee have written off any chance
that the Socialists will gain an absolute
majority. The new goal of the party strate-
gists is to cobble together a coalition
government.
In the field of foreign policy, Mitter-
rand’s government has appeared to be par-
ticularly inept of late. One notable gaffe
was its hasty—and inaccurate —announce-
ment that Libyan troops had left Chad at
the same time that French forces departed.
The public embarrassment over Libya’s
continuing occupation of northern Chad in
defiance of the mutual withdrawal agree-
ment with Paris has undermined Mitter-
rand both at home and abroad. News-
week has learned that while Mitterrand
intends to pursue all diplomatic options for
getting the Libyan troops out, he has
bluntly told Kaddafi that France will ap-
ply military force if necessary. Despite the
risks of such a course, Mitterrand might
have to do what he said he would do.
As Mitterrand was wrestling with his
north African problems he was also scram-
bling to deal with the troubles in New
Caledonia. Aside from killing the white
settler and announcing a breakaway gov-
ernment, Kanak militants occupied several
police stations and apparently detonated a
car bomb in the capital of Noumea. While
deploring the violence, Interior Minister
Pierre Joxe simply dispatched a senior
“ombudsman” to conduct further meet-
ings with Kanak and white leaders. Late
last week the French government appoint-
ed a high commissioner for the island,
whose duties were to prepare a set of
recommendations for Prime Minister Fa-
bius within two months.
Headache: For all of his foreign-policy
problems, the French economy has
emerged as Mitterrand’s biggest headache.
It has been a chronic source of trouble since
he took office in 1981. At that time, the new
president confidently predict-
ed that the country would be
able to pull itself out of reces-
sion through the application of
classic socialist policies. He
talked about huge increases in
government spending, sharp
increases in taxes for the rich
and wholesale takeovers of pri-
vate industries and banks. But
the results were nothing short
of disastrous: the rate of infla-
tion stayed as high as before,
the trade deficit soared and the
foreign debt reached record
levels. Early on in his term,
Mitterrand was forced to de-
value the franc three times. To
his credit, he did not hesitate to
react to reality and change his
strategy. Mitterrand reversed
his field and imposed a series of
conservative measures that
quickly brought down social
spending and promoted pri-
vate, entrepreneurial initiative.
Mitterrand did have to pay
a steep political price for his
new policies. The austerity
measures have landed hardest on the presi-
dent’s main constituency, the urban work-
ing class. More than 2.4 million French
workers are currently unemployed—over
10 percent of the country’s work force —
and another 100,000 workers are expected
to lose their jobs in the coming months.
Unions have staged a series of enormous
demonstrations in major cities to protest
the layoff's. The rest of the population has
also felt the pinch. Recent government
figures showed that consumer purchasing
power had dropped for the first time in
almost 30 years. Overall economic growth
is a dismal 1.2 percent and is expected to
rise no more than 1.8 per cent next year.
Mitterrand’s policies have angered both
his allies on the left and, understandably,
his adversaries on the right. “The Social-
ists say they are being rigorous,” contends
Alain Juppe, who is Gaullist leader
Jacques Chirac’s chief economic adviser.
“But we are in a bad situation.”
Bad, but well short of disastrous. Com-
pared with such economic powerhouses as
West Germany, France is admittedly still
hobbling along. But a growing number of
economists have begun to argue that Mit-
terrand’s policies have achieved at least a
modest degree of success. Inflation has
dropped from 14 percent in 1982 to 6.9
percent today, and it is possible that the
government’s goal of trimming inflation to
5 percent next year can be achieved. Bol-
stered by reduced budget deficits, the franc
has held steady for 20 months, with no
imminent threat of any further devaluation.
Even the country’s foreign trade deficit,
which once seemed ready to spin out of
control, has dropped to a little more than $2
billion for the first 10 months of this year.
“Mitterrand has tightened the belt, and it’s
With Assad: Another inconclusive diplomatic venture
PAVLOVSKY— SYGMA
working,” says J. Paul Horne, the chief
European economist for the brokerage
house of Smith Barney in Paris. “The infla-
tion and trade figures are the proof.”
The Socialists have also made neces-
sary—if painful—cuts in some of the coun-
try’s nationalized industries. By curbing the
rampant featherbedding in mining, steel,
autos and shipbuilding, the government
hopes to make those businesses competitive
once again. So far, the results have been
promising. Losses from the nationalized
sector have been cut recently from $l3 bil-
lion in 1982 to $6.2 billion. Mitterrand has
also promoted modernization of facilities
and the export of high-tech goods.
Mitterrand has tried to use a series of


diplomatic successes abroad to distract
public attention from his domestic woes.
Some of his shuttling has produced impres-
sive results. During his tenure as the presi-
dent of the Common Market, Mitterrand
visited all 10 of the member countries for
talks; by almost all accounts, his ener-
getic lobbying helped pave the way for the
budget agreement that was announced at
last June’s Common Market summit in
Fontainebleau. Recently, however, Mitter-
rand’s travels seem to have created addi-
tional problems —and embarrassments.
There are signs that the French public’s
patience with his road show may be wearing
thin. On a visit by Mitterrand to London in
October one of the men in the president’s
police detail planted a phony bomb on the
grounds of the French ambassador’s resi-
dence in an effort to “test” British security
precautions. The British were outraged by
the slight; Tory MP Eldon Griffiths
charged that “the French have brought in-
spector Clouseau of the Pink Panther to
Britain.” No such escapades bedeviled last
week’s trip to Syria. But all the same the
notices in the French papers were decidedly
negative. “It is a good thing we haven’t
discovered an inhabited planet at the end of
the solar system,” Serge July, an editor of
the left-wing daily Liberation, wrote last
week. “Inevitably Mitterrand would have
made a trip there by now.”
By far, Mitterrand’s most embarrassing
moment in his recent ventures into the
world of foreign policy was his encounter
with Libya’s devious leader, Muammar
Kaddafi. After arduous talks, Libya and
France had apparently agreed to a mutual
withdrawal of all of their troops from Chad.
It was not to be. Mitterrand withdrew the
French forces; Kaddafi, for all his promises,
kept most of his Libyan soldiers in Chad.
The Squabbling Right Wing

(Clockwise from top left) Barre, Chirac, Mauroy, Giscard, LePen with supporters: Can the opposition gain from Mitterrand’s troubles?
These should be joyous days for
France’s right-wing politicians. Socialist
President Franqois Mitterrand’s popular-
ity is dropping ever lower, unemployment
is inching correspondingly higher and the
opposition’s chances to gain ground have
never looked better —in theory. There is
only one hitch: the parties of the right may
be too busy squabbling among themselves
to capitalize on the opportunity. “We have.
not yet won,” Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac,
a presidential front runner, told his Neo-
Gaullist Party recently.
The “opposition” is essentially a hodge-
podge of parties. None of the principal
figureheads—former President Valery
Giscard d’Estaing, former Prime Minister
Raymond Barre and Chirac —is likely to
bow to another before the 1988 presiden-
tial elections. This lack of unity has kept
the right from reaping the full benefits of
Mitterrand’s woes. The influential conser-
vative magazine L’Express asked in a re-
cent cover story, “Is the opposition credi-
ble?” Only 31 percent of those polled
thought it was.
In addition, the right is also suffering
because Mitterrand’s Socialists have co-
opted many conservative economic poli-
cies. That was hastened when the president
replaced left-wing Prime Minister Pierre
Mauroy with the more conservative Laur-
ent Fabius. Since then, Mitterrand’s stiff
austerity program has put the right in a
painful dilemma: as it pinches, it makes the
right’s policy less attractive; but if it works,
there is no need for an alternative. The
right now finds itself in the awkward posi-
tion of demanding that the Socialists go
even further —reduce taxes and spending
even more and push for still more industri-
al restructuring.
Since their economic philosophies are all
cut from the same cloth, the big three
opposition candidates are scrambling to
differentiate themselves in other areas.
Giscard, 58, recently won back his old seat
in the National Assembly and is now trying
to woo back his centrist support. Chirac,
52, the most vociferous critic of the Social-
ists, has fashioned a platform combining
intense devotion to the free-market system
with a conservative approach to civil
liberties.
But Barre, 60, may be the man to watch.
He has gone from being a particularly un-
popular prime minister to the leading op-
position candidate. According to the latest
poll, he would now get 33 percent of the
French vote, edging out Chirac (28 per-
cent) and Giscard (22 percent). When
Barre left office as Giscard’s prime minis-
ter, he was known as the advocate of aus-
terity—a policy that Mitterrand later
adopted. As a result, Barre has now been
able to skillfully position himself as the
man who said “I told you so.”
If the right wins the 1986 legislative
elections, Mitterrand would be obliged to


For reasons known only to himself, Mitter-
rand chose to pretend briefly that nothing
was wrong. ButU.S. intelligence analysts—
and their French counterparts as well —
publicly contradicted French claims that
most Libyan forces had left Chad. At a
summit with Mitterrand on Crete three
weeks ago, the Libyan leader denied any
attempt at a double-cross. But Kaddafi’s
protestations of good faith —and Mitter-
rand’s credibility—were looking thinner by
the day. Last week Western intelligence
sources said that at least 3,000 —and per-
haps as many as 4,500 —Libyan troops were
still in Chad. If those estimates are correct,
it means that Kaddafi has yet to pull out any
significant number of his men.
Along with provoking a new round of
scornful attacks on the government from
conservatives, the Chad debacle left Mitter-
rand with two uncomfortable choices. The
first was to turn the other cheek and hope
that Kaddafi would keep his troops under
control. The second was to redeploy French
troops in Chad. Neither choice was politi-
cally, or diplomatically, feasible for Mitter-
rand. At this time, the French president
probably cannot risk a fight with the Lib-
yans, a fight that might set the stage for a
disastrous military stalemate in the deserts
of Chad. Mitterrand’s best hope is that
Kaddafi will simply decide to withdraw his
forces and claim a propaganda victory. But
even if that happens, Mitterrand’s waffling
on the issue has compounded the growing
questions about his leadership in foreign
policy. “The French [did not] trust the
president for his handling of the economy
but they gave him credit for maintaining
France’s international rank,” says Jean-
Pierre Soisson, a centrist opposition deputy
in the National Assembly. “Now he risks
losing that last area of credibility.”
Turmoil: As if the Chad fiasco was not
enough, the unexpected and rather bizarre
turmoil in New Caledonia threatened to
stoke those doubts even further. In recent
years, the island’s 60,000 Melanesians —or
Kanaks as they call themselves —pushed
for independence from Paris. New Caledo-
nia’s French inhabitants, who total about 40
percent of the population, oppose the equal-
ly numerous Kanaks. Over the objections of
conservative opponents in the National As-
sembly, the Mitterrand government passed
an autonomy plan for the island this year
that included provisions for a referendum in
1989 to decide on full independence.
That did not appease the Kanaks. Fearful
that the plan would be scrapped if the So-
An antiausterity protest: Hitting hard

cialists lost power in France, militant
Kanaks demanded that the vote on inde-
pendence be held no later than 1986. They
also called for a boycott of the November
elections for a territorial assembly, the first
stage in the Mitterrand government’s pro-
posed plan. Then this summer the newly
formed Kanak Socialist National Liber-
ation Front sent 17 of its members to Libya
for what it called “security guard training.”
Aside from reinforcing its own contin-
gent of gendarmes on the island, the Mitter-
French troops pulling out of Chad: The first mistake was to trust Kaddafi
appoint a prime minister from the center or
the right. France would then face the un-
wieldy prospect of a right-wing National
Assembly with a left-wing presidency.
Both Giscard and Chirac believe they
would owe it to the voters to share power
with Mitterrand until 1988. Barre, on the
other hand, argues that the opposition
should refuse to take power in an attempt
to force Mitterrand to step down.
Despite their substantial political repu-
tations, all three front runners are feeling
pressure from Jean-Marie Le Pen, 56, lead-
er of the extreme-right National Front
Party and the only new face on the French
political scene. Le Pen, who has built his
platform on law-and-order and racist is-
sues, scored a startling 11 percent in last
June’s elections for the European Parlia-
ment. One survey showed that 27 percent
of all voters polled agreed with Le Pen’s
hard-line anti-immigration program.
Coalition? The Socialists have recon-
ciled themselves to losing the 1986 legisla-
tive elections. But they still calculate that
they can hang on to power by capitalizing
on the right’s disarray. The most talked-
about tactic is replacing France’s two-
round majority-voting system with some
form of proportional representation.
Then, even if the right wins in the legisla-
tive elections, the fringe parties might still
collect enough seats to allow the Socialists
to form a working coalition. Despite their
internal feuds, the leaders of the right are
so far unanimous in rejecting any form of
proportional representation. In their view,
a coalition government could well plunge
France back into the political chaos of the
Fourth Republic.
As things stand now, the parties of the
right still have the time and the opportuni-
ty to present a credible alternative to the
Socialists. But they will need a significant
margin of victory in the legislative elec-
tions to create the image of a unified politi-
cal bloc. If Barre, Chirac and Giscard con-
tinue to treat the legislative elections as a
warm-up to the race for the presidency,
they may all end up confronting a tougher
Mitterrand than they expected.
MICHAEL A. LERNER in Paris


rand government reacted cautiously to the
growing unrest. But tensions began boiling
over during the territorial elections last
month. A majority of the Kanak communi-
ty stayed away from the polls, and bands of
militants destroyed ballot boxes, set up road
blocks and clashed with riot police. As last
week’s incidents demonstrated, the wave of
violence shows no signs of subsiding.
Conservatives in France worry about an
Algeria-style sellout of the island’s white
settlers, and have called on the government
to respond forcefully to the new threat.
Under questioning from conservatives in
the French Senate, Georges Lemoine, the
secretary of state for overseas territories,
suggested that the win by the settlers in the
territorial election might be annulled and
the referendum on self-determination be
moved up to next year. That drew an angry
attack from five former Gaullist prime min-
isters who warned Mitterrand against “en-
gaging in a process that would flout the will
of the [New Caledonian] majority [and] be
contrary to French interests in the world.”
Realism: Aides argue that Mitterrand’s
greatest strength is his hardheaded realism.
When the Socialists came to power, there
were dire predictions of crippling national
strikes, appeasement of the Soviets and civil
disorder. Nothing of the sort happened.
Instead, Mitterrand firmly established the
Socialists as the party of the responsible left.
In the process, he deftly outmaneuvered the
French Communist Party and shored up
relations with the rest of the Western Alli-
ance, most notably the United States.
But Mitterrand has his work cut out for
him if he expects to keep his policies on
track after the 1986 elections. Recent pub-
lic opinion polls show that only 21 percent
of those surveyed support the Socialists.
“It is doubtful that Mitterrand can last on
such a narrow base,” says political analyst
Jean-Frangois Revel. As it stands now,
however, no single party seems likely to
win an outright majority in 1986. Even if
Mitterrand’s opponents on the right are
able to put together a working majority of
their own, there is more than a remote
chance that such a coalition would have to
include the neofascist National Front. In
that case, Mitterrand could simply appoint
a conservative prime minister to run inter-
ference against National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen.
All in all, the president seems up to the
challenge he faces. For all his donnish
eccentricities (he does not even wear a
watch), Mitterrand has proven himself a
determined politician. He spent 16 years in
political limbo, and failed twice before
winning the presidency on his third try. He
never gave up. ‘He likes a battle,” says one
aide. “The greater the difficulties, the more
he will put his head over the parapet.” If
so, then Mitterrand is likely to find himself
frequently on the firing line in the
months ahead.

The ‘New Poor ' of France
Two years ago, Andre R. earned a
$38,000 salary as export manager
for a machinery maker in Paris. Then
the company declared bankruptcy, and
Andre, 48, lost his job. He has not
worked since, and his income ceased
altogether when his unemployment
benefits ran out eight months ago. Now,
Andre’s debts total more than $B,OOO,
and he is one of France’s “new poor,”
making the rounds daily of grimy un-
employment centers and charitable as-
sociations that pass out free meals. “I
was an executive,” he says, “ but now
I come to eat in the canteen.”
In today’s France, there are a lot of
people like Andre. Though President
Frangois Mitterrand raised the mini-
mum wage and improved most social
benefits after his election in 1981, the
problem of widespread poverty has con-
tinued to get worse rather than better.
Some 6 million French now live below
the Common Market’s $5-a-day pover-
ty line. In Paris, an estimated 22,000
homeless men and women live on the
streets and in the subways, up from
8,000 in 1982. Soup kitchens, closed
since the 19505, were reopened last win-
ter throughout the country.
The austerity measures adopted by
Mitterrand’s socialist government last
spring have only aggravated the prob-
lem. Changes in unemployment-insur-
ance legislation not only reduced bene-
fits by an average of 14 percent, but cut
the number of weeks in which people
could receive payments. “The long-
term unemployed easily slip into
becoming the homeless, and then
tramps,” says Michel Lefebvre, secre-
tary general of the charity organization
Emmaiis. “And once you become a
tramp, it is practically a miracle if you
ever leave that class.”
Hopeless: The new poor consist large-
ly of two groups: chronically out-of-
work youth (40 percent of the jobless
are under 25) and unemployed white-
collar workers whose benefits have run
out. For both groups, life has become a
constant struggle that they have little
hope of winning. Many of the young
stand little chance of finding permanent
jobs. For those who have had —and
lost —jobs, the slide into poverty may be
even more painful. Many who cannot
keep up their rent or mortgage pay-
ments are being evicted from their
homes. In a report entitled “Attention
Poverty,” the country’s Catholic bish-
ops said, “Poverty can no longer be
considered a marginal problem. It is
affecting the very fabric of society and
threatening its stability.”
The increase in poverty is providing
ammunition for Mitterrand’s critics;
Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris and
a leader of the right-wing opposition,
charges that the government is “pau-
perizing France.” Mitterrand’s govern-
ment has reacted to the problem by
announcing that it will aid those unable
to make rent and electricity payments,
and will distribute thousands of tons of
food to the needy. The government also
will start paying a modest $4 a day to
the long-term unemployed over age 50,
who have until now been ineligible for
such benefits.
But critics say the steps are too little
and too late. “You’re not going to solve
this problem by distributing carrots,
potatoes and turnips,” says Maurice
Begging for money: Nojob, and few hopes
RICK [?]ROSEN—SIPNSPECIAL FEATURES
Pagat, who runs a private association
for the unemployed in Paris. “Drastic
decisions must be made, but the govern-
ment is twiddling its fingers.” Last Oc-
tober, on a visit to the Aquitaine region
in southwestern France, Mitterrand
seemed clearly troubled by the dimen-
sions of the problem. “In a rich country
like our own,” he said, “no one should
go hungry and no family should find
itself in the street.” But they do, and the
coming winter can only make the suf-
fering worse.

ITALY
A Harsh Drug Cure on Trial
At San Patrignano: The Italian authorities have displayed an ambivalent attitude
PHOTOS BY FERDINANDO ROSSI— TEAM
The testimony has been dramatic,
emotional —and strikingly contradic-
tory. In the northern Italian city of Ri-
mini, Vincenzo Muccioli, director of San
Patrignano, the largest drug-rehabilitation
center in Europe, stands accused with nine
of his staff members and four former addicts
of kidnapping and mistreating the center’s
patients. Witnesses have told chilling tales
ofbeing chained and beaten in tiny cells. But
even more startling, perhaps, have been the
accounts of former patients who have
praised Muccioli’s harsh methods. “When
they freed me [from the chains], I was con-
vinced all that was done for me had been for
my own good,” testified former patient
Mauro Farnetti, 22. “Otherwise, I would
now again be the larva I once was. They
gave me life.”
Many of the basic facts in the case, which
has stirred a nationwide controversy, are
not in dispute. After Muccioli founded San
Patrignano in 1979, he took drastic meas-
ures to prevent several patients from escap-
ing and returning to drugs: they were con-
fined to pigeon coops or small rooms where
they were chained and slapped. Muccioli
himself has admitted that most of the events
occurred, but he has vigorously denied any
wrongdoing in his handling of patients.
“The chaining of people was unfortunately
necessary . . . and if I gave a few slaps, I
never stopped loving these kids,” he said in
court. “A slap, you know, sometimes helps.
It makes a person who wants to escape turn
against me, and this helps to make him
forget the need for heroin.” Muccioli con-
tends that over the last five years, 200 ad-
dicts have successfully “graduated” from
the center and returned to lead normal lives.
His accusers take a different view. “He
forced me to stay there —it was like an
obsession,” said Maria Rosa Cesarini, 23,
who was a patient in 1980. “I was held in a
pigeon coop for 16 days. I was destroyed.”
Cesarini escaped and took her complaints to
the police, who raided the center and found
several others who were similarly confined.
That led to Muccioli’s detention for 35 days
and finally to the current trial. Maddalena
Sgnaolin, mother of former patient Walter
Mosca, who died of a heroin overdose after
he left the center in 1981, charged: “That
place is a nightmare. If I wanted to talk to
my son, I couldn’t do it freely because some-
one was always nearby who was listening
and would report what was being said.” The
father of another patient, whom the police
had found chained and sent home, testified
that Muccioli had prevented his son from
getting proper psychiatric care. (The son
was later found dead on a railroad track,
though it was not clear whether his death
was the result of an accident or suicide.)
In public, at least, Muccioli’s defenders
have outnumbered his critics. “I had chains
on my arms, right where there are marks of
the injections,” said Alberto Bernardi, 25, a
former patient. “Now I don’t take drugs
anymore.” On a popular weekly television
talk show last week, actor Paolo Villaggio,
whose son is currently a patient at San
Patrignano, proclaimed: “Bless Muccioli’s
chains, which free these people.” But Mario
Picchi, a Roman Catholic priest who heads
a drug-rehabilitation center in Rome, ques-
tioned Muccioli’s methods. “I don’t know if
a little violence helps,” he said. “In my
experience, and with my patients, I don’t
think it would. Our methods are different,
but so is our center.”
Mysticism: Muccioli himself is as contro-
versial as his treatment. Born to a wealthy
family in Rimini, he dabbled in mysticism
and worked as a hotel manager before start-
ing the center. After the raid in 1980 Muc-
cioli stopped using chains, though he has
continued to order round-the-clock vigils
for patients who appear likely to flee for a fix.
The Italian authorities have displayed an
odd ambivalence toward San Patrignano.
Justice Minister Mino Martinazzoli visited
the center in September and lauded its ac-
tivities, which include workshops in pho-
tography and carpentry and chores on the
center’s 445-acre farm. While prosecuting
Muccioli, the state has continued to send
addicts from prisons to San Patrignano,
which is the only Italian rehabilitation
center that is willing to accept some con-
victs. “This is an absurd contradiction,”
says Turin University Prof. Guido Neppi
Modona, a penal-law specialist. As for
Muccioli, he betrays few signs of nervous-
ness —only impatience at a trial that could
go on until early next year. “Here I am
wasting my time,” he said as he left the court
after one recent session. “In San Patrig-
nano, I save lives.” The question for the
court: does the end justify the means?

MEDICINE
‘I Have Him
Back Again’
The controversial operation behind him, the world’s
second artificial-heart recipient faces a new life.
From a tangle of hoses and tubes, amid
the gentle whirr and hiss of pumps,
William J. Schroeder stood up and took a
few steps last week, a sight to make every-
one’s heart skip a beat—everyone’s except
his own. Sterile, inert, indifferent to the
nerves blinking unanswered in his chest, his
man-made heart beat to its own implacable
rhythm. For the second time in history,
there is an externally powered human being
among us, an electromechanical chimera,
riveting us with his courage—and forcing
us by his presence to think about the lives we
are changing with our machines.
For his surgeon, Dr. William C. DeVries,
it was a small step toward proving that man
can make a heart almost as good as any that
grows, and a vindication of his own contro-
versial decision to move into private prac-
tice at the Humana Inc. hospital in Louis-
ville from the University of Utah Medical
Center where he performed the first artifi-
cial-heart implant just two years ago. For
society at large, it raised troubling ethical
questions, different but no less pressing than
the ones posed by the unsuccessful baboon-
heart transplant into Baby Fae just four
weeks earlier. For Schroeder, a retired gov-
ernment worker from Jasper, Ind., it meant
a strange new sensation in his chest and a
new sound to grow accustomed to, the reas-
suring click of the metallic valves that meas-
ure out his life’s blood. In “All the King’s
Men,” Robert Penn Warren writes about
driving down a country road in the rain, the
windshield wipers “making their busy little
gasp and click like something inside you
which had better not stop”; which of us, if he
could hear his own heart valves open and
shut, would ever listen to anything else?
Still, the remarkable thing was that
Schroeder was alive at all. He was a Class
IV heart patient when surgery began
early Sunday morning—bedridden, gasp-
ing, his heart barely pumping, scarred (de-
spite a double-bypass operation in 1983)
into uselessness by a chronic shortage of
cardiac circulation. Without the new heart,
Schroeder—at 52, two years over the usual
limit for a human-heart transplant—would
probably not have lived out the weekend. As
it was, he had a close call the evening after
his surgery, when a suture where the heart
joined the aorta sprang a leak, and, before it
could be repaired, spilled eight pints of
blood into his chest. Four days later, his
wife, Margaret, appeared at a press confer-
ence with all six of their grown children and
said she hadn’t seen her husband looking so
good in months; he had been “fading away
from me,” she said, “and now I feel I have
him back again.” While authorities in the
field of medical ethics gravely weighed his
“quality of life,” the patient himself, irrele-
vantly glad just to be alive, was toasting his
recovery with a can of beer.
Pressure: Later in the week he grew tired,
though, compounding the problem his doc-
tors faced in arriving at any useful progno-
sis. There were reasons to be hopeful: in
the laboratory, the artificial heart has
shown it could work for as long as five years.
The first one to be installed was still beat-
ing after 112 days when the patient, Seat-
tle dentist Barney Clark, died of circulatory
collapse. Schroeder started out healthier
than Clark, and he benefited from coming
second. Clark had suffered grave seizures
not long after his surgery, apparently the
result of pressure on his brain caused by
too much cardiac output. Schroeder’s heart
was adjusted to avoid this problem. Yet
every time DeVries’s colleague Dr. Allan
M. Lansing, who heads the heart institute at
Humana Hospital-Audubon, appeared in
the press center to report another milestone
in Schroeder’s recovery, he tempered it with
a warning that Schroeder’s situation could
change for the worse at any moment. “I’ll
worry about infection as long as he’s
alive,” DeVries admitted; “I worry about
valve breakage, and as long as he’s alive I’ll
worry about that.” Or, in the words of the
heart’s inventor, Dr. Robert K. Jarvik,
speaking about heart-implant patients gen-
erally, “It’s not very likely these people will
die of cancer.”
The heart Schroeder received was a
Jarvik-7, virtually identical to the one im-
planted in Clark. It is about the size of a
human heart, and consists of two hollow
chambers of polyurethane and aluminum

(diagram), each containing a flexible plastic
diaphragm. Two plastic hoses, routed
through incisions in the abdomen, carry
compressed air to the heart, alternately
swelling and collapsing the diaphragms to
pump blood through the pulmonary artery
to the lungs and the aorta to the body. When
and if Schroeder leaves the hospital, he will
spend most of his time tethered by six-foot
hoses to a large and cumbersome air com-
pressor, which must be wheeled from room
to room. For up to three hours a day,
though, he can plug his hoses into a battery-
powered Heimes portable driver that
weighs less than 12 pounds and is no bigger
than a camera bag. Symbion, Inc., the Salt
Lake City company that developed the
heart, has a brochure showing a handsome
middle-aged man with a Heimes driver
slung jauntily from a shoulder strap, the
hoses disappearing discreetly behind his
necktie; Mrs. Schroeder speculated wistful-
ly at her press conference about her hus-
band going for drives with his portable com-
pressor. The Heimes unit, which had never
before been used on a human patient, was
connected to Schroeder’s heart twice last
Friday, once for 22 minutes and later for an
hour. In switching drivers there is a mo-
ment when the heart must be disconnected
from any power source, a situation that
apparently is less nerve-racking than it
sounds. Schroeder’s heart missed only two
or three beats in the process, and he didn’t
feel it, according to the developer, West
German inventor Dr. Peter Heimes. “I
think you [can miss] many more beats than
you think you would need,” Heimes said.

Schroeder walking and quenching his thirst: A new chance to enjoy the simple pleasures
Humana chain of private hospitals (box)
with which DeVries became affiliated last
August. He has found the efficiency, and
beneficence, of the private sector a hearten-
ing contrast to the frustrations of academic
medicine. “My view,” he said, “is that I
have been able to set up this project exactly
the way I wanted to, and there have been no
questions about what devices cost.” That
did not, however, stem the criticism from
the medical establishment of the propriety
of involving a private corporation in basic
research. Arthur Caplan, a senior staff
member at New York’s Hastings Center,
points out that Humana’s offer to pay for
100 heart implants gives them a potential
windfall starting with the 101st patient. Al-
though the surgical techniques (unlike the
heart itself) cannot be patented, the exper-
tise Humana will develop may give it a
virtual monopoly on a market Caplan esti-
mates at more than $5 billion. This could be
a powerful incentive to keep trying the op-
eration until it works. “If this company was
genuinely interested in advancing medical
knowledge,” says Dr. Arnold Reiman, edi-
tor of the New England Journal of Medi-
cine, “it would build a research institute.”
Plaque: There are, moreover, those who
believe that the artificial heart should never
have been developed at all —that it is a
“melodrama,” in the words of Prof. Nor-
man Scotch of the Boston University School
of Public Health, which distracts from more
important but less glamorous medical ef-
forts. “The three major breakthroughs [in
cardiac care over the next 15 years] are
going to be prevention, prevention and pre-
vention,” says Dr. Thomas J. Ryan, presi-
dent of the American Heart Association.
He has in mind developments such as drugs
to dissolve plaque deposits on arteries, a
project that probably could
make use of the $2O million
Humana is prepared to
spend on implants.
To some theorists the
real danger with artificial
hearts is that they will work,
presenting the unwelcome
choice of saving the lives of
only those who can afford
the operation or making
them available to everyone,
at a potential cost of billions.
Medicare will not pay for
implants for the foreseeable
future; they are considered
an experimental procedure,
as are human-heart trans-
plants, despite their impres-
sive success record in recent
years. The memory is still
fresh, however, of the trage-
dy of kidney patients who
were condemned to a slow
death because they could
not afford dialysis—a situa-
tion that moved Congress,
in 1972, specifically to au-


thorize Medicare to cover them. Atthetime,
it was expected to involve 5,000 patients at a
cost of $135 million a year; currently, more
than 70,000 patients are covered and the
cost is $2 billion and growing.
Consent: The most intractable ethical
debate seems to center on the question
of “informed consent”—the patient’s ac-
knowledgment that he is undertaking a pro-
cedure that not only has a high risk of
failure, but may leave him miserable even if
it succeeds. The issue of whether Baby Fae’s
parents should have been allowed to choose
to prolong her life with the experimental
baboon-heart transplant was complicated
by the refusal of the hospital in that case to
make the informed-consent form public,
Schroeder, of course, made the decision
for himself, and he signed—twice, a day
apart—a 17-page document that could not
have left much room for optimism. But
getting informed consent from a dying man
is a delicate proposition, warns John Arras,
philosopher-in-residence at Montefiore
Medical Center in New York, in light of the
“real potential for them to grasp at straws.”
Was Barney Clark’s ordeal—four oper-
ations in 112 days—worth it? DeVries him-
self has come down on both sides of the
question. Speaking about implants before
the Schroeder case, he admitted that “if I
thought a patient was going to spend the rest
of his days in a hospital, I would think twice
about it.” Yet, earlier, discussing Clark, he
said firmly that “to say to only live an
additional 112 days is unsuccessful is ridic-
ulous. His case was succcessful because he
was going to die that day, and he saw Christ-
mas and his birthday and his anniversary,
and even the Brigham Young-University
of Utah basketball game on television.”
Schroeder’s family, as it happened, taped
several Indiana basketball games for him to
watch when he recovers.
In the end, of course, only the patient
knows how much suffering it is worth to
reach another birthday, and DeVries has
been careful to choose patients with a
strong will to live. To exist at the end of a
plastic hose for the rest of one’s days re-
quires emotionally stable, tough-minded
candidates with loving, supportive fam-
ilies. Yet even Clark, described by his doc-
tors as a “rugged old Rocky Mountain
sagebrush,” at a difficult point after the
operation asked his doctors, “Why don’t
you let me die?”—and in one moment of
brief irrationality feared that someone was
going to shut off the air supply to his
artificial heart. The faster Schroeder re-
covers, the sooner will come the day when
he goes home to the new house near the
hospital where he will be required to live.
He will have his family there, of course;
there may well be another can or two of
beer opened in celebration. And then he
will go to his bedroom. He will lie down in
bed next to his wife. He will switch off the
light, close his eyes . . . and listen.

Operating for Profit?
The event was planned with all the care of the average media
extravaganza —right down to the handout press photos of Wil-
liam Schroeder’s discarded natural heart. But for Humana Inc.,
America’s second largest investor-owned hospital chain, last
week’s second artificial-heart operation constituted more than
just a bid for publicity. The $2.6 billion company has sought for
years to blunt criticism of for-profit medicine and build its share
of the health-care market. Humana hopes its promise to perform
and pay for as many as 100 artificial-heart implants will help in
achieving those goals. “We’re making a major contribution to
the advance of science,” says David Jones, Humana’s chairman.
“The gain can only come to our reputation.”
The operation may also provide a shot in the arm to
Humana’s business. In recent months, the shape of the
economy, as well as changes in health insurance and medi-
cal practices, have caused the number of hospital patients
to dwindle nationwide. David Lothson, an analyst at Paine
Webber Inc., estimates that so-called patient days at Humana’s
89 hospitals fell roughly 10 percent during the quarter that
ended last August; he predicts that additional declines will hurt
Humana’s healthy profit
margins next year. In the
face of those pressures, the
company has pushed hard
to raise market share— in
part by trying to establish
its hospitals and other
medical facilities as a
nationally recognized
“brand name.” Because
Humana has spent heavily
on that effort without
proof that such “brand-
ing” works, it may be a
risky strategy. All the
same, says John Hinde-
long, director of research
at Dillon, Read & Co., last
week’s artificial-heart op-
eration was a relatively

low-cost way to buy “literally priceless” advertising for patients.
The procedure also fits in neatly with other aspects of Hu-
mana’s strategy. Like some of its competitors, including Ameri-
can Medical International, Humana has sought to deliver ad-
vanced, high-technology medical care in selected hospitals that it
calls “Centers of Excellence.” While the centers specialize in
everything from diabetes to ophthalmology, the Humana Heart
Institute International in Louisville may be one of the most
promising. Roger Evans of the Battelle Human Affairs Research
Centers in Seattle estimates that 15,000 patients each year could
be candidates for new hearts —a number that far outstrips the
supply of human hearts available for transplants. Should artifi-
cial-heart implants one day become routine procedures fully paid
for by government and private insurers, it’s possible that only the
most experienced and efficient hospitals—such as Humana
hopes to become —will be reimbursed for performing them.
Slack: Such a prospect is probably years away, however, and
for the moment Humana has more immediate concerns. By
funding the artificial-heart program and the work of leading
researcher Dr. William C. DeVries, who performed the surgery
on Schroeder, it has addressed some of the complaints of critics
that hospital companies allocate very few resources to advanc-
ing the science of medicine. More important, the company is
helping to take up the
slack at a time when public
funds available for such
experimentation come no-
where near meeting the
need. “You’ll see more
and more medical re-
search done by private en-
terprise, because it’s going
to have to be done by [us],”
says George Atkins, a
spokesman for Humana.
And it won’t be by acci-
dent that prospective pa-
tients will be hearing more
and more about Humana
as well.

Hong Kong’s California Stake
San Francisco’s Chinatown: Strong cultural ties to the colony—and no need for English
JAMES COLBURN—PHOTOREPORTERS
Every Thursday morning, about 50 of
San Francisco’s powerhouse real-es-
tate investors get together to bid on the
week’s hottest properties. Over coffee and
doughnuts at Gerald Jackson’s American
Real Estate Exchange, the brokers and fin-
anciers listen to Jackson reel off dozens of
offerings, worth an average of $4 million.
The bidding is friendly and unhurried. But
each week, a few unassuming Chinese regu-
lars sit among the group. They pay careful
attention, but never show an interest in a
property. “The Hong Kong people bid pri-
vately later,” says Jackson. “They have a
penchant for secrecy.”
These days, they also have a penchant for
buying. Spurred both by worries over Chi-
na’s 1997 takeover of the colony and by the
prudent desire to diversify their invest-
ments, Hong Kong residents are pouring
huge amounts of money into the United
States. Much of it goes into California real
estate. Exactly how much, no one knows;
but estimates exceed $2 billion. Today, of
the $3 billion in office construction under
way in the state, one deal in five may be
financed in part by capital coming from—or
channeled through—the British colony.
Hong Kong investors have always shown
a mercantile eagerness to expand their ac-
tivities. But the current wave of California
spending includes a new crop of players.
“The fabulously wealthy families have been
investing all over the world for some time,”
says Peter Guttridge, president of IHR
America, a Los Angeles real-estate-invest-
ment firm. “The people who are nervous
now are the middle rich—those who have
made $5 million to $5O million. They are the
ones we now see buying up condominiums
or investing in commercial real estate.”
To some extent, Hong Kong’s elite is
shifting part of its wealth out of the colony
for fear of what will happen after China
takes over. Last September’s Sino-British
agreement supposedly ensures that Hong
Kong’s freewheeling economy will survive
for at least a half century. But some resi-
dents —mindful of what happened in China
after communists took over in 1949 —worry
that Peking will nationalize the colony’s
private businesses. “A lot of them have lost
one fortune,” says John Parkes, an execu-
tive in the Honolulu headquarters of the
First Hawaiian Bank. Even so, Hong Kong
investors are equally drawn by California’s
strong economy. “We are talking about very
sophisticated investors who want to hedge
their bets,” says Kevin Haggarty of Cush-
man & Wakefield, the huge New York-
based real-estate firm.
Secrecy, as much-as sophistication, is a
trademark of almost all Hong Kong invest-
ments in California. It is standard proce-

dure for investors to buy and sell property
through dummy corporations in the tax-
haven Netherlands Antilles islands of the
Caribbean. This not only allows them to
hide their identity, but also makes it possible
to avoid American capital-gains taxes.
Family: The fondness for secrecy may be
surpassed only by the preference for keeping
business dealings in the family. Hong Kong
investors generally shy away from partner-
ships with Americans. “The typical thing,”
says American Asian Bank President Robb
Evans in San Francisco, “is to enroll a kid at
Stanford or UC-Berkeley and buy a condo
for him. Both are investments.” The result is
a new generation of young Chinese entre-
preneurs overseeing huge investments. Ca-
leb Chan, the lead partner on the new $ 150
million to $2OO million Ramada Inn project
in downtown San Francisco, is a3l -year-old
Berkeley graduate who came to the United
States for his high-school education.
California’s Hong Kong investors gravi-
tate to San Francisco, where the cultural
links with the colony are strong. The city has
one of the largest Chinese populations out-
side Asia. Visitors from Hong Kong can
conduct their business in Chinese restau-
rants, deal with Chinese bankers, visit a
Chinese herbalist or acupuncturist if they
feel ill—all without speaking a word of Eng-
lish. In such familiar environs, residents of
Hong Kong have invested in numerous
large commercial projects. Their presence is
so great that the gyrations of the colony’s
economy can be felt clear across the Pacific,
affecting property prices in San Francisco.
Profits: Despite their preference for
northern California, Hong Kong investors
are increasingly looking south to the fast-
growing region around Los Angeles. There,
they tend to look for quick profits rather
than long-term investments. “Chinese in-
vestors like to be first into an area,” says
Guttridge. “They like to buy raw land when
no one else is interested and then make their
profit and go on when the land has appreci-
ated.” Five years ago Guttridge put together
a large parcel of land on the outskirts of
downtown L.A. and sold it to two Hong
Kong buyers. Today, a $5OO million office
project is planned for the site.
More often, however, Hong Kong inves-
tors in California are looking for a home
away from home that will appreciate in
value —and be there if they decide to leave
their own homes one day. “You are seeing a
lot of Hong Kong Chinese buying up single-
family residences in the more prestigious
areas,” says Elliott Feinman, president of
Merrill Lynch Realty in ritzy Beverly Hills.
“They tend to buy there because, let’s face it,
these people know real estate, and they want
to put their money in places where they
know the values won’t go down.” For many
of Hong Kong’s wealthy residents, Califor-
nia seems to be just the place.

Grace’s Debt Crusade:
It’s a Crying Shame
As far as J. Peter Grace is concerned, the
problem created by America’s budget defi-
cit is scary enough to upset even the coun-
try’s youngest citizens. He is making his
point dramatically in a $2.6 million ad
campaign (underwritten by W.R. Grace &
Co.) that is the latest volley in his war
against waste in federal spending. The 60-
second TV spot shows a newborn baby
being told that it is starting out life with all
the rights of any American—including a
$50,000 debt to the U.S. government.
“Waaaahhhhh!,” it replies, as a voice-over
urges viewers to help solve the problem by
writing to Congress. “Companies have a
responsibility to speak out,” says the 71-
year-old Grace. “I think it’s public-spirit-
ed —unless you hate babies.”
Grace escalated his crusade because
some members of Congress have been criti-
cal of the report he released last January
detailing how $424 billion could be
trimmed from the federal deficit. The
Grace Commission’s 2,478 recommenda-
tions ranged from collecting $3B billion in
past-due bills to saving $600,000 at the
National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration by using more outside contractors.
So far, the White House has implemented
17 percent of the commission’s proposals.
But Congress must approve most of those
that remain—and critics on the Hill say
many may be rejected.
Grace is confident that he can win this
fight by rallying the public. The ads may

LARRY DOWNING—NEWSWEEK
already be paying off. According to a No-
vember Gallup poll, more than 70 percent
of the 400 viewers shown the ad said that
they thought something should be done
about the federal deficit. Grace has also
teamed up with newspaper columnist Jack
Anderson to form Citizens Against Waste,
which will publicize the cause. If this fails to
produce a more thrifty Congress, Grace has
another plan that might do the trick —he
may form a political-action committee to
defeat big spenders.

Texaco Swallows a $765 Million Pill
Texaco Inc. made it plain last week
just how far the mighty oil industry has
fallen. Facing up to industrywide over-
capacity and falling prices for crude,
the company decided to write off $765
million against its fourth-quarter prof-
its. Other major oil companies have
taken similarly hard looks at their trou-
bled operations this year: Atlantic
Richfield took $785 million in write-
offs related to its mineral businesses,
Ashland Oil wrote off $270 million from
its chemicals operations and last week
Exxon faced a write-off as the result of its
planned exit from the office-equipment
business. But Texaco was the first to take
accounting losses stemming from its
bread-and-butter oil operations—and it
may not be the last. “This
is the first definitive step in
cleaning up major losing
oil operations,” says Timo-
thy Quaid, an analyst with
F. Eberstadt & Co. “There
are going to be even bigger
TEXACO
write-offs in the next year or so.”
Texaco’s decision reflects the contin-
ued reshaping of the oil giant that began
early this year with its $lO.l billion pur-
chase of Getty Oil, a move that more
than doubled the size of Texaco’s domes-
tic oil-and-gas reserves at a fairly cheap
price. Part of the write-off —$210 mil-
lion—was a real surprise: it recognized
the reduced value of certain exploration
properties in light of reduced prices for
crude. “Here you’ve got a major oil com-
pany for the first time writing off explo-
ration acreage because of a downgraded
forecast for the future price of oil,” says
First Boston analyst William Randol.
Other companies might be well ad-
vised to emulate Texaco, taking their
medicine now and building
from here. It’s a measure of
the residual strength of Big
Oil that even after its big
write-off, Texaco is still ex-
pected to earn about $3OO
million this year.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
New Ways to Administer Drugs
Even the best drug is useless if it is not administered
effectively. Each of the standard methods carries its own
problems. Pills are convenient, but many drugs—including
insulin and other protein-based medications—cannot be ad-
ministered in pill form because they are destroyed by the
stomach before they can reach the bloodstream. Injections
bypass this problem but tend to be expensive and painful.
And most common ways of taking drugs do a poor job of
keeping a constant level of medication in the body at all
times. New techniques, however, promise to provide a more
effective “delivery” system.
Looking for an alternative to taking drugs by mouth, many
researchers have moved up—to the nose. The large blood
supply carried in the latticework of capillaries in the nose
allows drugs to enter the bloodstream quickly—just as fast, in
many cases, as an injection. Yet unlike most injections, a
nasally administered drug can be taken without help from a
doctor. The principal problem in
giving drugs through the nose
has been getting the nasal mem-
branes to absorb enough to be
effective.
Help for Diabetics
Researchers at Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston have devel-
oped a nasal-spray version of
insulin that may enable diabet-
ics to avoid at least some injec-
tions. Working with California
Biotechnology, Inc., of Moun-
tain View, Calif., the Beth Israel
researchers have devised a pro-
prietary compound that allows
nasal membranes to absorb in-
sulin without irritation. Some
researchers in the field disap-
prove of adding artificial substances to such medications
before science fully understands how the nose works. But the
developers of the nasal insulin expect to begin clinical tests
with diabetic patients sometime next year.
Nastech, Inc., of Hauppauge, N.Y., has devised a nasally
administered progesterone compound called Pronasone. The
hormonal preparation can relieve the headaches, depression
and other symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The
University of London Health Center is comparing the effec-
tiveness of Pronasone with that of progesterone injections and
suppositories.
Nasal drugs may work wonders where pills cannot. But
given a choice, scientists maintain that patients would rather
swallow than sniff. Pennwalt Corp. of Philadelphia, Pa., has
developed the Pennkinetic system, an improved system for
preparing oral medication. Liquids, tablets and capsules using
this system release their active ingredients more steadily and
over a longer time than do ordinary oral drugs. With the
Pennkinetic system, molecules of a drug are chemically locked
with molecules of a special polymer. The compound is then
sealed within a cellulose coating that controls the release of the
drug. As many as a million of these tiny units can be contained
Patient uses PCA device: Personal control over pain
in a single Pennkinetic dose. In the gut, naturally occurring
ions pass through the cellulose membrane and displace the
drug molecules. The drug is released slowly and surely, and the
polymer passes harmlessly through the digestive tract. The
system has two major limitations. The drug used must have a
natural electric charge since it must react with the polymer;
certain medications, such as alcohols, carry no such charge. In
addition, the Pennkinetic system is best suited to low-dosage
drugs; some drugs might require a 10-capsule dosage.
In certain medical situations, neither the mouth nor the
nose will do. With some flesh wounds, for example, antibiot-
ics must be delivered directly to the injury almost instantly,
though at a controlled rate. Moleculon BioTech, Inc., of
Cambridge, Mass., has come up with a dressing that can
protect a wound and deliver two antibiotics simultaneously—
each at a different rate. The material, called Poroplastic,
appears as an extremely thin but solid membrane. Actually,
the material is dotted with sub-
microscopic pores that can ab-
sorb and hold a great deal of
liquid. By carefully balancing
variables such as the thickness
of the membrane, the precise
size of the pores and the formu-
lation of the antibiotics used,
scientists at Biotech enabled
Poroplastic to simultaneously
release each drug at a different
rate. Biotech officials say they
plan to begin human testing of
Poroplastic by next June.
Easing the Pain
Traditional intramuscular in-
jections still seem to be the best
way to administer such pain-
killers as morphine. But these
injections tend to subject patients to periods of overmedica-
tion directly after the injection followed by periods of under-
medication. Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, 111., has
recently developed a machine that allows patients to adminis-
ter their own pain medication easily and steadily. The Pa-
tient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) system includes a device
about the size of a portable radio that is connected to an
intravenous tube. A doctor loads the PCA device with a
quantity of the requisite painkiller. The doctor then pre-
scribes the dosage size and the dosage interval, from 5 to 99
minutes. The patient himself dispenses the medication by
depressing a button on a handheld controller whenever pain
surges. Relief comes almost instantly. Because a micro-
processor in the device remembers the doctor’s maximum-
dosage settings, the patient cannot administer an overdose.
Studies with such devices have shown that patients receive
less painkiller when they administer it themselves; patients
apparently feel more at ease if they know that they have some
control over their pain. The PCA system costs about $3,000;
a similar device called Prominject, made by Pharmacia AB of
Uppsala, Sweden, is under development.

INTELLIGENCER
Gough in thick of UNESCO row
GOUGH Whitlam, Australia’s
most colorful diplomat, last
week accused the US am-
bassador to UNESCO of
trying to influence opinion in
Britain in favor of withdrawal
from the international or-
ganisation. However, the
week before, Whitlam had
defended UNESCO and its
controversial director-gener-
al, Amadou Mahtah M’Bow
in a BBC interview described
as an attempt to “influence
British public opinion against
the withdrawal.”
In his 12 months as am-
bassador to UNESCO, Whit-
lam has been an active
supporter of the organisation.
Earlier this year, Liberal MP
Peter Lengyel, an Australian
who had worked for
UNESCO for more than 30
years, charged the M’Bow
administration with gross mis-
management. In federal par-
liament, Liberal MHR Peter
Coleman claimed that
Whitlam had explained
Lengyel’s charges as those of
a “foreign-born naturalised
Australian,” and said that
Whitlam had suggested that
“naturalised Australians in
UNESCO have a resentment
of delegates and officials from
Third World countries.”
While Whitlam has
supported the organisation
and strongly criticised the
British and American with-
drawals, Australia’s official
stance differs in nuance.
A statement endorsed by
Foreign minister Bill Hayden
recognised that UNESCO had
“many problems of a mana-
gerial and policy nature” and
added: “We accept that the
US and the UK have a right to
leave UNESCO if they wish,
but believe that as founder
members, leading con-
tributors and major western
countries they would have
done better to stay in and
work for reform.”
It has been suggested that
Whitlam’s criticisms of the US
withdrawal may be influenced
by antipathy towards the pre-
vious ambassador, Owen
Harries, now a consultant for
the US Heritage Foundation.
Last week Whitlam accused
the foundation of running
a “destabilisation and
disinformation campaign”
against UNESCO.
A departmental spokes-
man said that Whitlam was
“too big a fellow” to be
engaged in a personal feud.
He added that there was “no
suggestion” that that the
government had asked
Whitlam to moderate his
stance and that Whitlam’s
view is “not inconsistent with
our general approach.”

Landa victim
of ‘guilt’ by
association
FORMER NSW attorney-
general Paul Landa, who died
last week, was the NSW
politician named in the
unpublished volumes of the
Costigan Royal Commission
report.
Landa, who in the weeks
before his death was subjected
to a vile rumor campaign
based on the Costigan re-
ferences, was not referred to
adversely by the royal com-
missioner. While on a visit to
Israel, Landa found himself
travelling with a former
childhood associate who came
under Costigan’s notice for
some supposedly illegal
dealings. When the man, who
was on the same aircraft as
Landa, eventually returned to
Australia and was charged
with offences, he apparently
tried to get Landa to intervene
on his behalf.
Landa did not do so but he
certainly suffered from the
guilt by association that
Costigan provoked by even
mentioning his name.

For Bob the smile, for Andy the plaque
LIBERAL leader Andrew
Peacock was not an all-round
loser in the election.
Liberal federal director
Tony Eggleton and the staff at
campaign head-quarters pre-
sented him with a plaque for
the Best and Fairest Player.
It was inscribed, “Andrew
Peacock 1984, for the
leadership he provided in very
difficult circumstances.”
Somewhat
soggy image
THE BRIGHT, bronze
Australian image in Britain
has been smudged somewhat
of late.
First, the Poms could not
believe their eyes when they
saw Prime Minister Bob
Hawke cry. Last week they got
a more serious shock when the
BBC’s Panorama current
affairs program depicted a
tangled web of corruption out
here, involving unions, racing
identities and people in legal
and political circles.
To cap it all, Britons last
week also saw former
Australian cricket captain
Kim Hughes do a weepy as he
announced his resignation.
The next morning one of the
papers ran the headline
“Weeping Matilda.”
But Hughes found an ally
in Barry Humphries. Hughes’
tears, he suggested, were the
result of nothing more than
too tight a cricket box.

NT News, November 11
AFTER the butter mountain
and the beef mountain, the
European Economic Com-
munity now has a public ser-
vants mountain. The EEC is
currently trying to retire pre-
maturely 120 middle-aged
scientific researchers in order
to make way for younger
employees. As an incentive
the 120 are to receive 70 per-
cent of their current salary
until they reach normal retire-
ment age.
As some of the staff are
earning up to £40,000 a year,
this means they will be paid
up to £28,000 for doing
nothing. And some of them
will be receiving the money
for 10 to 15 years.

Big bird in PNG skies
BIG BIRD has acquired a
new dimension. The design
Air Niugini has adopted for
its first A3OO Airbus features a
huge bird of paradise, running
the length of the fuselage.
The Airbus is on a three-
year lease from TAA. The
Australian airline had leased
two of its five Airbuses
because it could not operate
economically in Australia.
First they went to the
German charter operator
Condor. On their return, one
was repainted in Melbourne
in the striking new color
scheme and handed over in
Sydney to Air Niugini, which
is running into its holiday
rush season.
The other has gone back
into service in a con-
ventional color scheme to
help TAA meet its expected
Christmas rush.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
YOU ALWAYS have to treat end-
game situations with the utmost
caution when your opponent is
lurking in your home board.
Utmost caution, however, does
not necessarily mean “playing
safe” on every roll you have to
plan and provide for the future.
Consider the illustration:
White is almost at the bearing-off
stage; he produces a 4-2. What is
the play?
A novice might move as per
the solid arrow, bringing home the
single man from the 8 to the 2
point and maintaining the 6 point
prime. It is the wrong play not
the safest.
If White makes the play, he
could find himself in trouble on
his next roll. Suppose White were
to roll next a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 or 6-5
he would be forced to leave a blot.
Black then would need a direct 6
(if white was forced to leave a blot
on the 7 point) to hit.
So, in order for White to get
hit, he would need to leave a blot,
then Black would have to produce
the 6. White’s odds of leaving the
blot are eight in 36 (28:8) or 7:2
against. To roll the 6 Black needs
to pull off a 25:11 against shot.
Combined odds make the hit 7:1
against.
Suppose though, White made
the dotted line play. If Black
misses the blot, no roll will force
White to leave a blot on his next
roll. He has left one this roll
though; Black needs a 6-1 to hit.
The odds of Black now hitting are
exactly 17:1 against, a lot longer
than 7:1.
Leaving a blot when you don’t
have to, paradoxically can often
be the safest play it most
certainly is in this case.

Opening lead king of
diamonds.
SOLVING an entry problem is
often a decisive factor in the play
of a hand.
For example, consider this
deal where the defence starts off
with two rounds of diamonds.
South ruffs and would like to take
two heart finesses, as well as lead a
club to his king. Since he has only
two entries to dummy to launch
these three plays, South has a
problem of logistics to solve.
The best way to resolve the
problem is to play a trump to the
king at trick three and return a low
heart, finessing the jack after East
follows low.
West take the queen and can
do no better than return a dia-
mond. South ruffs, returns to
dummy with a trump and leads
the 10 of hearts finessing again
after East follows low.
This is declarer’s second lead
from dummy and when the finesse
succeeds he discontinues hearts
and leads a club to the king. Since
East has the ace, South ac-
complishes his mission; his only
losers prove to be a heart, a
diamond and a club.
Note that, if East covers the 10
of hearts with the king on the
second round of the suit, South is
able to return to dummy with a
low heart to the nine to make the
crucial club play toward the king.
Note also that if South starts
playing the hearts by leading the
10'from dummy, instead of the
deuce, he later runs into a dead
end. The next time he gets to
dummy with a trump, he can lead
a heart or a club but cannot do
both. As a result, he finishes down
one.
