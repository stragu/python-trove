THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Protecting the stones
The Strehlow Foundation, of Adelaide,
is to be commended for the prompt
action taken to prevent the world’s most
priceless collection of Aranda history
from falling into the hands of people
who could exploit its possession to the
limit (“Flight of the sacred stones,” B,
November 13).
As a former protege of the late
Professor T. G. H. Strehlow and as one
who was deeply indebted to him in the
days of my research into the history of a
little-known tribal group on the far west
coast of South Australia, nearly 30 years
ago, I would say that the greatest
tragedy in Aboriginal affairs today lies
in the blunt refusal of a gaggle of
successive political leaders to acknowl-
edge and accept the unquestionable
authority of the one man competent to
advise them on the complexities of
Aboriginal society in central Australia.
T. G. H. (Ted) Strehlow should have
been knighted during his lifetime for the
outstanding contribution he made to an
understanding of Aboriginal man, not
vilified long after his death by those
whose efforts to get their hands on his
priceless records have been frustrated
just in the nick of time.
Much of the mounting racial ten-
sions now evident in Australia could
have been avoided quite easily (and
never surfaced) if the politicians and the
lawyers had listened to Strehlow . . . and
the news media had learned to differen-
tiate between the valid “lands rights” of
the direct descendants of Australia’s
former indigenes and the spurious
“Thank God. I think it’s a vegetarian. ”
“land claims” being pursued by those
who, for no other reason than personal
profit, voluntarily elect to self-identify
as “Aboriginals.”
Perhaps my forthcoming book
Aboriginals by Decree but not Aborigines
by Birth, based on knowledge gained
from T. G. H. Strehlow and my own
Aboriginal elders, may help to overturn
some of the cartloads of utter rubbish
voiced and written on the subject by
many least qualified of all to express
any opinion on the complex issues of
“Aborigines” and their undeniable
rights and “Aboriginals” and their
questionable claims.

Funding the arts
I am writing to acknowledge and thank
John Cargher for his most positive
review of the recent Australian Dance
Theatre Melbourne season (B, Sep-
tember 25).
Since the Victorian decision to alter
the basis of its funding to the company,
I have written both to the Victorian
Premier and his minister for the Arts to
express the South Australian govern-
ment’s strong disappointment with
Victoria’s precipitate action in with-
drawing from the funding partnership.
As you rightly point out in your
review, this partnership had enabled the
company to develop to the point where
it was one of the major forces in modern
dance in Australia. In addition, a recent
overseas tour brought the Australian
Dance Theatre considerable inter-

Few people can experience the regal quality you'll
find in Toyota Crown Royal Saloon.
It's not just that it is a very exclusive car, Crown also sets
very high standards.
The fact is, for all their princely price tags, a lot of
so-called luxury cars offer you relatively few standard
features.
Our crowning glory is that Toyota Crown is one of the
few offering a complete set of standards, each a gem of
luxury and engineering.
Such as our full frame chassis. A feature shared with only
a few other cars in the world, one of them being the
Rolls-Royce.
Combine this with fully independent suspension with
Toyota Suspension Tuning and Crown
becomes one of the smoothest, quietest
cars on the road.
Whilst exterior styling is elegantly understated, the
interior is quite palatial.
You're pampered with such luxury features as
power windows, automatic air conditioning, moquette cloth
seats, electronic AM/FM stereo cassette with motorised
antenna and six speakers, central door locking, cruise
control, full instrumentation and a telescopic tilt steering
column.
There's even a small refrigerator to keep drinks cool!

6 CYLINDER EFI PERFORMANCE
Now that you're comfortable you can enjoy the
royal performance.
Crown features Toyota's Super
Responsive 6 cylinder engine with Electronic
Fuel Injection.
This power is matched with ventilated four wheel disc
brakes and four speed automatic overdrive transmission.
And handled with a minimum of fuss with speed
sensitive power steering.
But, possibly our crowning achievement is that Crown
is eminently affordable. It's not often that you can enjoy the
luxury standards fit for a king ... and queen.

national exposure and critical plaudits.
Unfortunately, the recently announ-
ced 1985 Theatre Board grant to the
company in no way ameliorates the
tightness of the financial predicament
facing the company. My department for
the Arts is determined to maintain the
pressure on both the Victorian ministry
for the Arts and the Theatre Board in
order to re-iterate the obvious point that
an organisation of Australian Dance
Theatre’s standard and ability to service
a large proportion of national needs in
modern dance demands to be funded
on a proper basis.
The artistic progress of the
Australian Dance Theatre cannot be
halted and the South Australian govern-
ment has allocated a significant increase
in funds to the company to this end in
the current financial year. This we have
done despite strong constraints on ex-
penditure increases across the board
and in all areas, as an indication of how
strongly we feel that a company of the
Australian Dance Theatre’s stature and
potential must be allowed to continue.
Once again, thank you for your most
positive contribution to the general
public’s awareness of the issues.

If you prefer a drier white wine than riesling

Naturally Krondorf Chablis is also full bodied

A commercial break
I thought a slightly dignified silence was
the best way to answer the slightly
unseemly and, in Les Beard’s case,
slightly ungrammatical (“of we poor
mortals,” B, November 13) demand to
know who the hell is Larry Foley
which this department seems to be
encouraging. But perhaps I should grab
the chance to air an idea which would
break new ground and make this jour-
nal even more widely renowned.
First, to answer the question that
would seem to be on everybody’s pen:
Who Larry Foley is is, thanks to the
alarming readiness of editors to run his
stuff, just the nation’s most highly
unpaid writer that’s who.
Well, that takes care of that. Now,
let’s get down to the brass ...
Devotees of That’s What You Say
will have noted how hard it has become
to find and track the letters through the
mass of ads. In the November 13 issue,
for example, TWYS ran from page 4 to
page 21 inclusive but a total of only
about four pages of that space was
letters and cartoons. The rest? All ads.
Now, look at the stars’ section:
Phillip Adams-Ron Saw-Batman-David
McNicoll, pp 118-126, nine pages, of
which only two were devoted to ads. I
don’t have to spell it out. But I will.
Advertisers go where the viewers and
listeners and readers are. In The
Bulletin, that clearly means TWYS.
Hardly surprising.

When you’re late for the dance,
you’d better have a very good reason.
The party started about three years
ago for the personal computer.
And there was dancing.
But there wasn’t much talking.
Because as more and more computer
companies arrived,
there were some very
real compatibility
problems.
Until one latecomer
arrived. Sperry.
With a remarkably
simple solution. The

It was able to run
all IBM compatible

And, with the flick of a special

the additional ability to

of an organization—the

that system was IBM or

Or both.

But when you get there late, you’d
better have something important to
bring to the party.

“That’s more like it - breast-prints!”
I am not divulging state secrets in
asserting that no other weekly journal
remotely approaches TWYS in scope,
literacy, readability and entertainment
value. (And if that bit of crawl-crawl
doesn’t get this letter in, nothing will). In
other words, if TWYS were a television
program, it would be on at peak viewing
time; it is obviously the peak reading
section of The Bulletin.
Yet, here is Kerry Packer paying
colossal sums to the Adams-Saw-
Batman-McNicoll push (quite justifi-
ably, let me hasten to add) while we
mere readers who produce the peak
reading pages get nowt. Nowt!
Well, here’s my original, remarkable,
world-of-journalism-shattering idea:
THIS SPACE AVAILABLE
How does that grab you, Trevors
Kennedy & Sykes, huh?
A teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy commercial
snuck in somewhere between the lines
of each letter? Split the proceeds?
Youse and us both?
No?
Oh.
Ah, well. Just thought I’d ask.
LARRY FOLEY
Townsville Qld
(I had taken a sacred vow to bar Larry
from the columns for six months, to cure
him of over-exposure, but his letter raises
some worthwhile points. He is correct that
our letters column is the most entertain-
ing in Australia but, as he realises, we
have jammed enough advertising around
it for the time being. Larry’s letters make
it more often than most because unlike
far too many of our correspondents he
is short and to the point. Having said
that, / might bar him for a bit anyway
while I see if any of our other letter
writers can achieve the same economy.

The individual viewpoint
There is an ominous and disturbing
trend to political debate in Australia. It
is exemplified by the Prime Minister,
practised assiduously by various one-
issue and special interest groups and
supported from time to time by most
political parties. It goes something like
this ...

particular proposition being put for-
ward, you are at the very least
“confrontationist,” “divisive” and pro-
bably stupid. Depending on the issue in
question, you are also a racist, a sub-
versive, anti-Australian, a “baby-killer,”
etc, etc. The Russians have carried this
trend to its logical conclusion whereby,
if you oppose the government of the
day, you are by definition certifiable and
are put in a psychiatric institution.
In western societies, those who
choose to offer a different opinion are
increasingly subjected to vilification
if not actual physical violence.
In Australia, we are well along the
road. The right to disagree is being
progressively attacked and curtailed.
The Bill of Rights will be used as one of
the principal weapons in this campaign.
We do not want “ideological purity,”
political conformity or even consensus
if that means giving up our right to
constructive dissent and personal liber-
ty. We want a pluralistic society, open
and healthy debate, respect for the other
person’s opinion and acceptance that
others may choose to march to a differ-
ent drummer.
The use of legislation to inhibit the
individual and force him or her into a
desirable mould is becoming in-
creasingly prevalent. There is only one
endpoint to such a course, as George
Orwell knew only too well.

Peter Gruening
I knew Peter Gruening (B, November 6)
during the Korean war and sub-
sequently when he was the United Press
bureau chief in Singapore and I was the
Australian Associated Press and Reuter
counterpart.
As David McNicoll states, there was
never any doubt in the minds of people
who knew him that he committed
suicide.
He was a sensitive, intelligent young
man who always seemed to be in the
wrong league. He aspired to the role of
a tough, hard-bitten Unipresser but just
did not fit in. He could be described as
“on the outside looking in.”
Nevertheless, he was a very good
companion.
Another story from his Sydney days
might be of significance.
At the time (comic strip artist) A 1
Capp included in his Li’l Abner series
the daily doings of the bald iggle. This
charming, little coconut-like creature on
two legs and with one eye caused
politicians and others subjected to his
gaze to tell the truth. A 1 Capp made
wonderful, cynical use of this in his
daily strip.
The United Press had a good idea
a round-up of world leaders comment-
ing on the bald iggle and his operations.
It was an obvious attempt to get world
leaders to talk about the hypocrisy of
politics.
A contribution from Menzies was
called for and, for one reason or an-
other, was not forthcoming until very
near the deadline when cables began to
arrive from New York urging Gruening
to provide the story. The disastrous
upshot of it all was that, through a chain
of accidents, Gruening finally reached
the prime minister of Australia by
getting him out of bed in the middle of
the night after a heavy cabinet meeting.
Menzies’ explosion could only have
confirmed Gruening’s deep-seated
worries about his ineptness in the hurly
burly of newsagency journalism in
which he found himself.
For what it is worth, I am now a
psychiatrist and I believe that if Peter
Gruening could have found a therapist
he might have been able to re-muster
into a field where he could be himself
and exercise his high intelligence and

That happy knack of being

We’ve introduced leg-rests to

And if you’ve ever put your

deep, comfortable recliner, you’ll
know just how conducive to sleep
leg-rests can be.
Of course, they’re the kind of
thing you can rely on with Qantas.

Natural justice
In dealing with, inter alia, individuals’
common law rights, the Costigan royal
commission has thrown the principles
of natural justice out the window.
The Australian Commercial Diction-
ary defines “natural justice” as “the
rules and procedure to be followed by
quasi-judicial bodies, as opposed to the
strict procedure of purely judicial tri-
bunals. Such bodies must act fairly,
judicially, bona fide, without bias, give
each side opportunity of stating its case
and not hear one side while refusing to
hear the other.”
Why shouldn’t individuals unjustly
libelled by the Costigan report be
entitled to sue for damages to their
reputations in the likely event that many
of the report’s allegations are found to
be wrong and unfounded?
On what responsible basis can par-
liamentary privilege attach to a report
which manifestly ignored the hallowed
and sacrosanct principles of natural
justice?

Picking up the tab
The Modest Farmer (B, November 6) is
wrong when he says “the protected
industries, particularly the metal in-
dustries, are usually the first to give in to
extravagant demands because they
know the export industries will have to
pick up the tab ..
The last occasion the metal industry
faced extravagant demands for a $5O
a week increase and a 35-hour week
was during the months prior to the
Metal Industry Agreement in December
1981. The basis of that agreement, when
it was finally negotiated, was a 38-hour
week and a $25-a-week increase for the
fitter.
Employers in the metal industry
agreed to negotiate with the unions only
after 18 months of industrial turmoil,
during which metal industry companies
were under vicious and prolonged at-
tack by way of strikes and bans. Our
companies received no community
support (even from the free trade lobby)
during their stand and the then-federal
government refused point blank to use
legal sanctions to compel the unions to
abide by a full bench decision that a 40-
hour-week should apply in the metal
industry.
The agreement was reached five
months after the collapse of wage in-
dexation, by which time wage increases
ranging from $l5 to $45 a week had
already occurred in 256 other awards.
Hours had been reduced below 40 a
week in 300 awards.
The agreement, which followed three
months of negotiations under the chair-
manship of Mr Justice Williams, was
later ratified by a full bench of the
Arbitration Commission.
It is often conveniently forgotten
that, since 1969, employers have had
absolutely no protection from the ex-
cesses of union power. The 1981 agree-
ment was reached after 18 months of
bitter confrontation and long after other
industries had succumbed to union
pressure.
Coming back to the present, I
remind the Modest Farmer that the
members of my association have been
leading the fight against the im-
plementation of the termination, change
and redundancy decision which
imposes heavy additional costs on
employers and that they are about to be
subjected to national stoppages because
of their stand.
I wonder if The Farmer is Modest
enough to admit he is wrong or


“But couldn 't you get your speech writer to knock
off a little light conversation?”
prepared to put some facts to justify his
uncalled-for attack on metal industry
employers.

Farmer’s harvest
I have been a reader of The Bulletin for
two years now and have long been
biting the bullet reading such rubbish as
Bert Kelly gets away with. Now I can
bite no longer.
Does he really think people are as
stupid as it seems, or are his articles
deliberately provocative? Mr Kelly
often employs the well-known ploy of
putting others down, dismissing their
opinions as rubbish in the vain attempt
to elevate his own standing in his
readers’ opinions. He ridicules the
“ordinary citizen” as foolish and ignor-
ant and persuasively writes “most think-
ing people agree with us” (B, November
6) in such a see-through appeal to the
vanity of intelligence that even a year 10
clear-thinking student could easily iden-
tify it as such.
Not only does the immaturity of
writing style not appeal but Mr Kelly’s
supercilious and patently misguided
or biased attitude to “greenies” (an-
other poor attempt at a put-down)
makes me see red every time I think of
it. Don’t get me wrong I am no
member of Greenpeace myself and I
agree that conservationists tend to
choose the extremist response to their
consuming passion but this does not
mean, to my mind, that all con-
servationists are militant, long-haired,
halo-wielding fools determined to
thwart the backbone and mainstay of
Australia the Modest Farmer!
In the ever-raging debate between
conservationists and farmers and
miners, if I may borrow a little from R.
J. Hawke, we need “consensus and co-
operation” rather than the schoolboyish
mud-throwing Mr Kelly is party to.
Perhaps next issue my dream will be
realised there will be no Modest
Farmer column and in the “That’s what
you say” section there will at last be an
answer to that haunting question: Who
is Larry Foley?!

Surprising Saw
Ron Saw has been a delight for decades
because his humor and compassion are
combined with zest and style and with a
splendid impatience with those who
lack them. A fine, sweeping intolerance
often reflects a more generous spirit
than does meek compliance.
The more surprising, then, that he
wrote “quite as importantly, my weight
had dropped ...” (B, October 23). Did
his doctor tell him, “It is importantly for
you to lose weight”?
I would be expecting Mr Saw to be
mounting posses to hunt down such
solecisms, rather than have them sneak
under his guard.

Oils disturb
Last Saturday night (November 3),
along with a few thousand other people,
I saw Midnight Oil here in Adelaide. It
was vintage Oils power and passion
the crowd lapped it up. The songs were
about commitment, justice and change
but 1 wonder how many people will
have really changed after the concert.
I can’t help but think that any energy
that could have been directed towards
any meaningful political action (ie
thought, debate, VOTES) was instead
used up in dancing, singing, drinking,
smoking and generally getting off on the
band. When Peter Garrett asked for and
got applause for “all of those people
still outside Roxby Downs,” I asked
myself how many of those cheering had
actually supported the Roxby blockade
and how many had seen the TV and
press reports and, rather than being
moved to support the protesters at
Olympic Dam, thought “What a bunch
of dick-heads.” To how many people
there was uranium mining an important
issue? Was it, or is it, as important as
their jobs or finding one? Was it or is it
as important as saving for their trip to

Individual, progressive, active,
competitive, dynamic. Such are the
qualities of the successful.
These are the people who set the pace
and standards for others. They seek
distinction, not status.
Yet, there is really only one car that
reflects the individuality, excellence and
dynamism that such people demand.
The BMW 735 i.
Through more than half a century of
automotive experience BMW has learned
what it takes to satisfy the aspirations of
these demanding people.
Certainly, the BMW 735 i has the latest
that advanced design and technology can
offer. From electrically-operated front
seats, to the most sophisticated computer
controlled engine management system in
the world.
But a BMW offers you more than that.
Sheer driving pleasure.
The sporty personality of the BMW
735 i has been formed through a long and
successful involvement with motorsport.
Two key attributes that you will enjoy as a
result, are responsiveness and agility.
Another reason for the superb drive-
ability of the BMW 735 i is the safest
braking system in the world - ABS.
Such features of the BMW 735 i are
but a few examples of a desire to raise the
design of the automobile to new heights,
in the constant pursuit of excellence.
That is why BMW cars have always
satisfied even the most discerning drivers.
The choice of a BMW reflects their own
personal qualities, to which they - like
BMW - owe their success.

Bali? Was it or is it as important as
getting to a concert to go apeshit over a
band?
Going into US Forces Garrett says,
“If they don’t dig it up they can’t put it
in the bomb.” I thought, Christ, it’s a bit
late for that. Does he really believe that
keeping Australian uranium in the
ground will do anything to keep the
major powers from the brink of nuclear
war?
Kosciusko , land rights and again the
crowd gets into it. But how many there
would take the land rights issue ser-
iously? How many support the land
rights cause? It’s easier to go along to a
concert, listen to a record or the radio,
sing along with a song for a few lines
and feel better for having done that
rather than giving an issue serious
support or thought. How many there
have not smirked at or told a racist joke,
called blacks “coons” or “boongs?”
I didn’t enjoy myself at the Midnight
Oil concert because all of these things
kept running through my head. Maybe I
should thank the Oils for that and hope
that a few other people had the same
problem.

The Maori problem
lan Templeton’s report (B, November
13) on the Maori crisis presents a
typically biased view upon the Maoris.
Certainly, racial equality in
Kiwiland is a myth but not in the way
he describes it! The facts are that the
Maori enjoys many privileges not avail-
able to the pakeha (whites).
As one who has lived in many
countries, including South Africa, I can
say without fear of contradiction that
the Maori in NZ is the most spoiled and
best-looked-after non-white race on the
face of the earth. To my personal
knowledge, Maoris have enjoyed the
benefit of compulsory schooling for
more than 60 years. They have enjoyed
exactly the same opportunities in life
including the workplace as every
white, yet only a tiny proportion have
made the grade. This is not due to an
unfair system but simply because so few
have had the energy and ambition to
take advantage of a system which pro-
vides everyone a fair chance if they are
prepared to work.
It is a sad commentary upon the
current situation that the majority of
middle-class New Zealanders are today
fed up with the continual bleatings by
the “do-gooders” here (Maori and
pakeha) who keep on telling the Maoris
how they have been cheated by the
pakeha. Bunkum! The Kiwi judges
people not by color but by his or her
behaviour.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Judge charged
JUDGE John Foord of the
NSW District Court has been
charged with attempting to
pervert the course of justice
in relation to a committal
hearing and a trial of charges
against the Sydney solicitor
Morgan Ryan.
Damages award
A SUPREME Court jury of
four men awarded Alan
William Webster, 50, the
Willoughby (Sydney) Coun-
cil’s chief health and building
surveyor, $39,000 damages
against Sydney architect
Harry Seidler. The jury found
that Seidler, in publishing
two letters in which he
criticised Webster, had acted
maliciously.
AIDS committee
THE federal government
has established an AIDS
(Aquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome) advisory com-
mittee to advise all Health
ministers and inform the com-
munity of the problems con-
nected with the disease.
Sydney radio personality Ita
Buttrose heads the committee.

Landa mourned
NSW Attorney-General Paul
Landa, 43, collapsed and died
probably of a heart attack
while playing tennis at a
friend’s court in the Sydney
suburb of Vaucluse. He was a
brilliant self-made man o who
started life in strained cir-
cumstances: his father died of
heart failure when Paul was
eight and he had to earn
money to help the family at an
early age but went on to study
Law at Sydney University. He
became an ALP member of
the Legislative Assembly in
1973.' Between 1976 and the
end of 1982, Landa served as
minister of Industrial Rela-
tions, Education, Energy and
Planning. Promoted last year,
he had been tipped as a suc-
cessor to Premier Wran. He
left a wife and daughter.
Hayden coup
FOREIGN Minister Bill
Hayden announced that the
United States’ President
Reagan and Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko
had agreed to send a delega-
tion each of arms-control
experts to Australia to discuss
separately problems of
disarmament. The experts are
to be officials, not politicians.
THE WORLD
Arms talks
IN a move to ease high ten-
sions between the two super
powers, United States
Secretary of State George
Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko
have agreed to meet in
Geneva on January 7 and 8 to
resume arms control talks
without pre-conditions. The
talks were suspended at the
end of last year when the
Soviets walked out in retalia-
tion for NATO deployment of
new nuclear weapons in
western Europe.
‘New alliance’
IN an analysis of the in-
ternational political situation,
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden: arms talks
Soviet news agency Tass
reported formation of a
military alliance in the Pacific.
Led allegedly by the US and
Japan, it would (said Tass)
include South Korea,
Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the ASEAN
pact countries (Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand).
Blast horror
A HUGE explosion in a
natural gas plant in a
working-class suburb of
Mexico City killed more than
400 people, seriously burned
at least 2000 others and
injured many more thous-
ands. More than 100,000
people had to be evacuated as
the flames, which consumed
80,000 barrels of liquid gas,
threatened their dwellings.
Bowing out
PROFESSOR Jeane Kirk-
patrick, 58, the United States’
out-spoken representative at
the United Nations for the
past four years, said in New
York that she would “return
to private life” after the
current session of the UN
General Assembly which ends
in December. Kirkpatrick, a
registered Democrat, is es-
pecially popular with the
Republican Party's con-
servatives who have pressed
for her appointment to even
higher office.
Gandhi theory
INDIAN Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi said in New
Delhi that the two assassins
who killed his mother did not
act alone but were part of a
conspiracy against the nation.
It was the first time he had
mentioned a conspiracy but
he still failed to point out
whom the conspirators might
have been.
Strike split
THE biggest split in Britain’s
37-week coal strike emerged
when union leaders in
northern Wales declared that
the National Union of
Mineworkers’ area executive
no longer backed the action.
According to the National
Coal Board, 10,500 men have
returned to the pits since
November 5 and 63,000 of the
union’s 180,000 members are
working.
Diplomat killed
TURKISH diplomat Evner
Ergun, 52, attached to the
United Nations office in
Vienna, was shot in the head
by a young man witnesses
described as “dark-skinned.”
The diplomat was killed as he


drove his car in the Austrian
capital. The Armenian Re-
volutionary Army claimed
responsibility for the murder.
Mass defection
ALMOST one-third of the 608
passengers of the Polish cruise
liner Stefan Batory did not
return to the ship from a
sightseeing trip in the West
German port city of Ham-
burg. Forty of the 192 Pole£
have asked for political asy-
lum.
Poll annulled
THE French government an-
nounced plans to annul the
New Caledonian election
which was boycotted by
Kanak nationalist groups.
Fresh elections will be held
for an assembly which will
draw up a constitution for an
independent New Caledonia.
The constitution is to go to a
referendum on October 25.

BUSINESS
Bank licences
WHEN applications for new
banking licences closed, the
federal government had heard
from 42 bidders. Treasurer
Paul Keating said 18 applica-
tions involved Australian
equity, either through joint
ventures or possible issues to
the public. The level of local
equities proposed ranged
from 20 to 50 percent. The
number of successful applic-
ants is expected to be six
although 10 to 15 appears
possible.
Smelter setback
BHP withdrew as a potential
partner in the proposed
West Australian aluminium
smelter, clouding its future. A
project consortium including
Reynolds Aluminium, Kukje-
ICC of South Korea and the
Perth Griffin Group waits on
confirmation from other com-
panies which had expressed
interest in taking equity in the
project. These include the
Bond Corporation Ltd and
Elders-IXL Ltd. A satisfac-
tory arrangement on power
prices is yet to be reached with
the state government.
New bank chief
WILL Bailey took over as
managing director of the
ANZ banking group follow-
ing the recent death of John
Milne. Bailey was chief gen-
eral manager, domestic.
Brewer bids
SA Brewing Holdings Ltd
launched a $175 million cash
and share bid for leading
winemaker B. Seppelt & Sons
Ltd, starting from a 19.9 per-
cent equity base acquired
from the winemaker’s unsuc-

AUSTRALIA
Final poll: it’s Labor with
a wildcat Senate
The final Morgan Gallup Poll shows Labor will comfortably regain government but with
a hostile Senate. RICHARD FARMER analyses the figures and details the new
political forces with which Prime Minister Hawke will have to contend.
AUSTRALIA’S eight weeks of election
campaigning appear to have changed
little about the prospects in Saturday’s
election. Labor is still in the same com-
manding position the Morgan Gallup
Polls have indicated for months. Prime
Minister Bob Hawke remains far more
popular than Opposition leader
Andrew Peacock despite the Liberal
leader struggling back by last weekend
to an approval rating of 38 percent. The
key issue continues to be economic
management where Labor is seen as the
best party for the job.
The only beneficiary of the millions
of words uttered and millions of dollars
spent since the election date was set in
October is the fledgling Nuclear Dis-
armament Party. They gain two Senate
members one in New South Wales
and possibly one in Victoria. Along
with the Democrats, who are also doing
well enough in the poll to have hopes of
winning Senate seats in five states, and
the likely independent victory in Tas-
mania, the NDP will smash Labor’s
chances of even getting close to control-
ling the Senate.
For Hawke the election result, while
being a great personal triumph, will

Of ALP voters, 93 percent (un-

bring home the difficulties of governing
with a bicameral parliament. On the
latest Morgan Gallup Poll figures show-
ing Labor with a House of Representa-
tives vote of 51 percent and with over 55
percent after distributing preferences of
minor parties, the likely lower house
majority is 50. The government would
have 99 seats to the coalition’s 49, an
increase of 10 on the number of seats
notionally held after distributing elec-
torates for the new and enlarged house
on the basis of 1983 results.
Yet in the Senate a massive 21 per-
cent of Australians surveyed by Morgan
last weekend said they intended to vote
for a minor party compared with 42 per-
cent for Labor. Given the numerous
variables involved where seven senators
are returned from a state-wide elector-
ate, prediction is especially difficult. But
on the figures it is unlikely that Labor
will win four out of seven in any state. A
best guess in the Senate lottery is that of
the 46 Senators to be elected, 20 will be
Labor, 18 Liberal-National Party, five
Democrats, two NDP and one Indepen-
dent.
Combined with the 30 Senators not
up for re-election, the state of the upper
house would then be: Labor 34, L-NP
31, Democrats 7, NDP 2 and Indepen-
dent 2. Hawke would be back to relying
on Democrat support to govern which
will severely limit the options on such
things as changes to taxation.
It is hard to think of a better recipe
for unstable government than 11 minor
party members urged on by conserva-
tives. Bob Hawke might now be saying
that the next parliament will go its full
three year term but there can be no cer-
tainty of it.
This makes the first of two refer-
endums to be put on Saturday extreme-
ly relevant. If passed it would force a
government to have a half Senate elec-
tion whenever it called a House of
Representatives election. The Morgan
Poll suggests that 62 percent of people
support the change, 27 percent oppose it
with 1 1 percent undecided. Although
the number of “Yes” votes is down from
73 percent in early November and the
Liberal How to Vote Card will
recommend a “NO” vote, there looks to
be even money chance of the con-
stitutional change being made.
If it is then Hawke at least will have
one weapon to hold over the Demo-


HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
The results of the latest poll come
from asking 3415 electors on the
weekend of November 24/25 which
party would receive their first pre-
ference “at the election for the House of
Representatives on Saturday week,
December 1.” Of those surveyed, only 3
percent did not state a preference for
the House of Representatives.

Analysis by age of Senate voting patterns shows 19 percent of electors aged 18-24

tional Parties are successfully linking
this constitutional change to the threat
of state governments being given the
power to levy indirect taxes, such as a
sales or value added tax, or even a capi-
tal gains tax or worse. That is a measure
of one success that Andrew Peacock has
had in this campaign. Fears about
Labor’s tax plans have been planted in
the community and it is only Hawke’s
personal popularity and the confidence
that he will stop Labor doing anything
silly that has prevented the issue biting.
That it has not bitten shows clearly in
the pattern of voting intentions re-
corded by Morgan for the House of
Representatives. In the seven days be-
tween polling on the weekend of
November 17/18 and last weekend
(November 24/25) the Liberals have
made no headway. The gap between
Labor and the coalition which was nine
points a fortnight ago was 1 1 points last
weekend. □
New tax ideas
are unpopular
A LARGE majority of Australians dis-
approve of death duties and gift duties
and more than half disapprove of a
capital gains tax. Opinion is more
divided on the issue of a wealth tax.
Australian Labor Party supporters are
more likely than others to approve each
of those forms of taxes, the Morgan
Gallup Poll finds.
These results come from interview-
ing an Australia-wide cross-section of
1462 electors on the weekend of
November 10/11.
People surveyed were told:
“Recently, there’s been much discussion
about new forms of taxes." They were
then asked whether they approved or
disapproved of a capital gains tax, gift
duties, death duties and a wealth tax.

THE PUBLIC SERVICE
Threat to poll
a bad omen
for the accord
Finance minister John Dawkins: a disturbing analysis
By RICHARD FARMER
SATURDAY’S federal election was
very nearly the one without candidates.
In what has been a well-kept secret,
Electoral Office returning officers
threatened to strike on the days when
candidates were due to nominate.
Under the Electoral Act, they have to
accept nominations personally. They
tried to use this fact to have their jobs
re-classified to a higher salary level.
Only a last-minute promise to negotiate
on the claims prevented the election
becoming a farce.
The action of the returning officers is
one of many attempts by com-
monwealth public servants to blackmail
the Hawke government into granting
salary increases.
The Administrative and Clerical
Officers Association, the principal
union representing public service clerks,
has been trying to get its members to
work to rule in the closing days of the
campaign. The aim has been to obtain a
wage rise of some 8 percent outside the
guidelines of the prices and incomes
accord. One result of this campaign has
been a serious disruption of imports
because of delays caused to customs
clearances.
The government has managed to
contain the industrial problem but the
attempted militancy of white-collar
government workers augurs ill for the
continued success of the accord.
Behind the threats of the returning
officers is a resentment by them at being
left out of what in the past 10 years has
been a common way of making a
mockery of wages pauses and restraint.
In most government departments,
jobs have been re-classified upward. For
doing the same work, thousands of
public servants have managed to have
themselves paid more.
The classification creep (perhaps
“gallop” would be a more accurate
description) coincided with attempts by
the former Liberal-National Party
government of Malcolm
Fraser to impose ceilings
on the number of public
servants. Figures produced
last week by federal
Finance minister John
Dawkins show clearly how
those ceilings were largely
cosmetic in nature.
To keep down the
growth in the public ser-
vice, departments wielded
their axe from the bottom.
Base grade clerks, typists
and temporary employees
were dismissed or were not
replaced when they left but upper
echelons of the public service expanded.
Nowhere was this trend more pro-
nounced than in the Treasury.
The figures Dawkins released last
week show that, from the end of
December 1976 (following the split
which created the department of
finance) to the end of 1982, staffing at
the Treasury grew by 30.6 percent
compared with a growth in the public
service as a whole of 6.2 percent.
During the same period, the second
divison (basically the senior manage-
ment structure) of the public service in
total grew by 7.2 percent. Yet Treasury’s
John Stone
growth in second division officers was
36 percent. Senior Treasury staff
defined as classes eight to 11 —at the
end of 1976 was 36.75 percent of total
staff. Junior staff classes one to four
was 22.2 percent. By the end of 1982, the
senior staff proportion in Treasury had
become 44.9 percent while junior staff
had fallen to 12.4 percent.
The Treasury reduction in employ-
ment of young people was mirrored in
the public service as a whole.
The Dawkins figures show that the
number of people under 21 in the public
service fell by 36 percent between
December 1978 and December 1982.
Whereas those under 21 represented
11.3 percent of total commonwealth
employees in December 1975, they were
only 6.6 percent by December 1982.
In the face of that decline, Dawkins
can perhaps be forgiven for the ironic
reception which he gave to comments
by former Treasury chief John Stone in
a recent speech about the plight of the
teenage unemployed.
While Stone argued that high junior
wage rates were the reason for the
problem, Dawkins rather bitterly made
the case that senior public servants
added to the problem by axing juniors
while upgrading positions at the top.
One measure of the extent of that
classification creep is the increase in
expenditure on salaries, wages, allow-
ances and overtime for public servants
from $1.63 billion in 1976-1977 to $3.10
billion in 1982-83. After adjustment for
inflation, that was a cost increase in real
terms of 9 percent while
total staff in the period
increased by only 1 percent
(or about 6 percent after
adjusting employment fig-
ures for movements of staff
into and out of Public Ser-
vice Act coverage over the
period).
An even starker picture
of the way public servants
have managed to look after
themselves during the
supposed years of restraint
comes from looking at the
changes in classification
profiles of key public service staffing
groups from 1976 to 1982.
Before going to the details, a short
explanation of the way the public ser-
vice is organised: At the bottom of the
totem pole is the clerical assistant struc-
ture with grades from one, with a salary
of $6059, to eight with a salary up to
$21,281. Next is the clerical
administrative structure once known
as the third division with 11 grades
and pay rates from $BllO for a class one
to a maximum $38,413 for a clerk class
11. Close to the top is the senior
executive service once known as the
Second Division with six levels of


officers. A level one officer is paid
$43,974, rising to $65,417 for a level six.
At the top of the heap are departmental
heads.
In the second division (now renamed
the senior executive service), the total
number of staff increased by 7 percent.
Yet, in its highest levels that is, from
four to six the increase was 55
percent. During 1983, the number of
staff in the Second Division increased
by 65 or 4.9 percent and the
numbers in levels four to six by 9.4
percent.
In the clerical administrative struc-
ture of the commonwealth service, the
total number of officers increased by
16.3 percent from 1976 to 1982. Yet the
number in the highest three levels,
classes nine to il, increased by 38.5
percent compared with a 10.7 percent
increase in classes one to four. During
1983, the size of the structure increased
by 5125 or 9.6 percent and the number
of officers at classes nine to 11 also
increased by 9.6 percent.
A similar pattern of employment has
been evident in the clerical assistant
structure. From 1976 to 1982, the overall
increase was 19.9 percent with the
senior levels grades seven and eight
going up by 73 percent and the junior
levels, grades one and two, growing by
only 17.6 percent. During 1983, the size
of the structure increased by 2024 8
percent.
The Public Service Board, which
prepared the figures for Dawkins, com-
mented: “Growth in the senior levels of
APS staffing structures tended to be
indirectly encouraged by the staff
numbers controls (such as staff ceilings)
operating in the mid to late 19705. These
controls did not have any profile or
direct cost restraints linked to the
employment of staff.”
In the light of what has happened
around them, those returning officers
can at least be understood for trying to
get on the bandwagon. Their jobs were
not among those re-classified for doing
the same work in the period covered by
the figures released by Dawkins. Yet
their chances of success in the promised
negotiations which led to the last
minute calling off of their planned strike
are not good.
Dawkins, who combines being
Finance minister with being minister
assisting the Prime Minister on public
service matters, has decided that the re-
classification game must end. Yet, when
that is understood throughout the public
service, the pressures for salary in-
creases will certainly increase.
While the Administrative and Cleri-
cal Officers Association might have had
only limited success in its work-to-rule
campaign on the eve of an elecion, the
association may well do better once the
poll is over. □
HUMAN RIGHTS I
Storm over
report on
affirmative action
Dr Gabriel Moens: his major report rejected
STUART SPENCE
By TONY ABBOTT
THE HUMAN Rights Commission
recently has been bitterly attacked by
conservative academics. Now, the com-
mission has rejected and refused to
publish a major report which it commis-
sioned on the issue of anti-discrimina-
tion and affirmative action.
People associated with the burgeon-
ing rights protection industry are angry
with the report’s author Dr Gabriel
Moens, a lecturer in law at the New
South Wales Institute of Technology.
Moens, in an analysis of anti-dis-
crimination programs currently operat-
ing in Australia, concluded that they
discriminated against men and other
“non-preferred” groups.
His report is highly critical of the
philosophy behind many of the
affirmative action programs currently
being promoted, and its publication
would have severely embarrassed the
government, particuarly those ministers
most identified with affirmative action,
Attorney-General Senator Gareth
Evans and the Minister Assisting the
Prime Minister on the Status of Women,
Senator Susan Ryan.
Moens’ report, described by
members of the Human
Rights Commission as “ten-
dentious,” has been defended
by senior academics as a work
of “academic scholarship.”
One said that the “worst you
can say about it is that it’s
boring.” Certainly, the report
is a sustained critique of the
concept of affirmative action.
Affirmative action is a gen-
eral term covering measures
to improve the status and
particularly the employment
opportunities of people
belonging to groups which
have been discriminated
against, particularly blacks
and women.
Moens says in his report
that different forms of
affirmative action raise differ-
ent philosophical issues. The
affirmative action programs
currently operating in
Australia, “wittingly or un-
wittingly implement the ideal
of equality of outcome even
though they claim to imple-
ment the ideal of equality of
opportunity.” He says that
“the two ideals of equality are confused
and the legislature would make clear
which ideal of equality it wants to see
implemented.”
Moens told The Bulletin that the
replacement of the ideal of equality of
opportunity with that of equality of
outcome was “the most important social
chance since the second world war.” He
added: “This is a rather disturbing
development in our society. It interferes
with the right of people not to be
discriminated against and interferes
with their legitimate expectations to be
treated on the basis of merit.”
Moens says that, despite claims to
the contrary, affirmative action pro-
grams in Australia are developing along
the American pattern. In the United
States, affirmative action programs have
resulted in a number of highly
publicised and controversial court cases
in which jobs and university places have
been given to women and blacks rather
than to considerably better qualified
white males.
In his report, Moens says that most
people believe that discrimination is
illegitimate if a selection is made on the
basis of irrelevant criteria. Job pre-
ference (say) for a woman would be
illegitimate if being female had nothing
to do with the performance of the job.
However, it would be legitimate to
prefer a woman for a job, for instance,
that involved working with women.
Moens distinguished between “soft”
and “hard” affirmative action. “Soft”
affirmative action involves the removal
of artificial barriers to employment and


does not allocate jobs on the basis of
race, sex etc. It is compatible with the
ideal of equality of opportunity.
However, because it takes time for
the operation of these programs to
produce a social order free from the
marks of the discriminatory past, many
activists support “hard” affirmative ac-
tion. In employment, this usually in-
volves quotas the reservation of
places for members of minority groups
in proportion to their representation in
the general community. “Hard” pro-
grams, which do regard race, sex etc as
relevant to job selection, are consistent
with ideal of equality of outcome.
Moens says that the key issue in the
debate is the attempt by policy makers
and legislators to replace “soft”
affirmative action with “hard”
affirmative action and therefore to
replace the ideal of equality of op-
portunity with that of equality of result.
The most important Australian
affirmative action programs operate in
the NSW and Commonwealth public
services. There is also a Commonwealth
“pilot scheme” involving a number of
large private employers. All operate on
similar lines. The NSW government’s
Affirmative Action Handbook specifies
that government employers are to
develop “equal employment opportun-
ity management plans” including the
“setting of goals and targets (in female
and minority employment) as well as
timetables for the achievement of goals
and targets.”
The NSW program stresses: “Targets
are prime motivators and guides . . . not
mandatory quotas . . . Quotas imply
proportional hiring . . . Targets, on the
other hand, express the expectation that
desired numerical outcomes will be
achieved by means of positive remedial
programs.”
However, Moens says that this dis-
tinction between targets and quotas is
“a distinction without a difference” and
cites in evidence the fact that the NSW
program says that “in the end, the
success or failure of affirmative action
depends upon statistical results.”
It appears that the federal govern-
ment is confused over whether it is
supporting “hard” or “soft” affirmative
action and therefore whether it is ad-
vocating equality of opportunity or
equality of outcome. Prime Minister
Hawke, in his forward to Affirmative
Action for Women, the paper that ac-
companied the announcement of the
commonwealth pilot scheme, disclaims
the use of quotas and insists that jobs
are to be awarded on the basis of merit.
But later in the document he is quoted
as saying: “It is not enough to simply
say there should be equal employment
opportunity. We need to be able to say
to employers that there are certain
things that they need to do to make sure
that they have a deliberate policy of
employment of women.”
Moens, since the rejection of his
report, has dropped his academic
restraint and circumlocution and has
broadened his criticism of the thinking
of the “rights industry” and particularly
the Human Rights Commission,
He says that the arguments he
developed “didn’t fit the present bias of
the commission and were therefore
rejected out of hand.” He claims that
the commission is not interested in
encouraging philosophically informed
debate and that some of the reports the
commission has published are
“shockingly inadequate from an in-
tellectual point of view.”
Moens says: “Affirmative action is in
danger of becoming a racket. The only
real beneficiaries of affirmative action
may turn out to be women and
upwardly mobile, middle-class women
at that. A man who wants to deal with
this issue is treated as a trespasser . ..
He might have ideas incompatible with
those of the feminist groups.” Moens
says that during the writing of his
report, his researchers were hampered
by the non-co-operation of women’s
groups and the ethnic lobby.

What particuarly disappoints him is
the responsiveness of the Human Rights
Commission and the federal govern-
ment to what he calls self-interested
pressure groups. Right from the begin-
ning, he says, elements in the commis-
sion were unhappy at his selection to
write the report and delayed for two
months the signing of his contract. Then
Senator Evans, at the instigation of
Senator Ryan, questioned the ap-
propriateness of his appointment.
Moens now says that it is “absolutely
disgusting” that the Attorney-General
should try to interfere with the work of a
statutory independent body.
Dame Roma Mitchell, chairman of
the Human Rights Commission, told
The Bulletin she had nothing to say
about Moens that was fit to publish.
A spokesman for Evans said the
commission had been approached at the
request of Senator Ryan and added that
the government had “complete confi-
dence in the Human Rights Commis-
sion and rejected any claims of chronic
bias.” A spokesman for Ryan said
Moens’ appointment had been queried
because he had a “pre-existing pre-
judice” against affirmative action. D
HUMAN RIGHTS II
Extraordinary powers planned for new body
THE HUMAN Rights Com-
mission will become a power-
ful national organisation
under the government’s
proposed Bill of Rights. It will
have the power to investigate
commonwealth and state de-
partments, Acts and practices.
It will have the power to
hear public complaints, call
witnesses, including federal
and state ministers and public
servants, to impose fines and
to jail people.
Attorney-General Senator
Gareth Evans had hoped to
keep the Bill secret until after
the elections. Drafts were sent
in strict confidence to state
attorneys-general.
However, the proposed
legislation worried the
Queensland and Tasmanian
governments and Queensland
Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-
Petersen condemned the legis-
lation in a statement to the
Queensland parliament.
The Bill of Rights is drawn
up under the Foreign Affairs
power of the constitution, fol-
lowing Australia’s adherence
to the International Conven-
ant on Civil and Political
Rights.
It is aimed to over-ride all previous
commonwealth legislation, any conflict-
ing state and local government laws and
ordinances and the Common Law.
Legal argument is to be resolved in
federal courts.
Evans has set up a task force to
recommend on proposals for
reconstituting the Human Rights Com-
mission, in readiness for its role under
the proposed Bill of Rights.
The Bill appears to give homosexuals
the right to marry and have families, by
adoption or by artificial insemination.
The International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights provides for the
rights of men and women to marry and
to found families. Evans’ Bill changes
this to the rights of “every person” and
Gareth Evans: sharp teeth for the Human Rights Commission
removes all reference to men and
women.
The convenant provides for the
rights of the unborn child. Evans’ Bill
omits this reference.
It provides for the right to join a
trade union, but makes no provision for
the right to refuse to join a trade union.
It also makes no reference to the right to
own property. It provides for the “liber-
ty” of parents to ensure that the
religious and moral education of their
children be “respected.”
Bjelke-Petersen told his parliament:
“It gives the commonwealth the power
to over-ride the states in almost every
essential aspect of decision-making.”
Opposition leader Andrew Peacock
said: “This attempt to subject state and
local government to wide and
unprecedented investigatory
powers is unparalleled in any
western democracy.”
The legislation, said
Peacock, did not confer a
single right or freedom which
did not already exist, usually
under a state law.
The power which the
reconstituted Human Rights
Commission will have is an
important element of the Bill.
The commissioners or
commission staff members or
other people designated by
them are to have the power to
examine state Bills and draft
legislation, to require federal
and state ministers and public
servants to give evidence be-
fore them on oath, and to
impose fines and jail terms for
non-compliance.
The commission members
will have the right to require
the production of documents,
to take possession of them,
and to retain them.
People who defy such
summonses will be liable to
fines of $lOOO and jail for
three months. In the case of
corporations the fines will be
$5OOO.
Federal cabinet and executive coun-
cil documents will be protected as will
communications between the federal
government and state governments
which would “prejudice relations.”
But people will not have the right to
refuse to produce a document or to
answer questions on the grounds that
this would contravene another Act, or
would incriminate him, or would make
him liable to a penalty. However, such
information would not be admissable in
proceedings against him.
The commission is to be the body
which hears complaints under the Bil.
Where it considers rights have been
infringed, it is required to take evidence
from the person alleged to have com-
mitted the infringement before it reports
to the attorney-general.


The commission wil be empowered
to recommend on any legislation or
proposed legislation which it considers
infringes the Bill, and to report to the
minister concerned on its recommenda-
tions to prevent infringements.
If after 60 days it is not satisfied that
reasonable steps have been taken, the
commission may then report to the
Attorney-General. The second report
would incorporate the first report.
In the case of state legislation, the
state attorney-general is to receive a
copy of the second report and to be
allowed 60 days before the second
report is made public.
Other reports are to be tabled in
parliament within 15 sitting days.

FAMILY LAW
The no-fault
divorce court
under siege
By CHRIS ASHTON
ONE OF the basic precepts of the
Family Faw Act, the no-fault principle,
is under challenge from within the ranks
of the Family Court of Australia.
Doubts are being voiced about its fair-
ness, as a reaction to the hardline stance
in its support by the Family Law Coun-
cil — the Canberra-based umbrella body
which monitors the operation of the Act
and reports on it to the federal At-
torney-General.
At Attorney-General Gareth Evans’
request, the council has circulated a 36-
page questionnaire and discussion
paper to 750 individuals and groups
professionally involved with the Family
Court. Comments are invited on such
issues as court dress and procedure, the
need for clearer separation of counsell-
ing and judicial functions by the court,
accreditation of lawyers specialising in
family law, streamlining of court
administration and more
effective channels for com-
plaints against operation.
The report will go to the
Attorney-General next
February.
What stuck in the
throats of some Family
Court registrars the
senior legal officers of each
court responsible for its
day-to-day running was
the preamble to the discus-
sion paper which expressly
excludes any discussion of
the no-fault principle in
consideration of property,
custody, access and
maintenance in dispute.
Registrars of the Sydney, Parramatta
and Brisbane courts Len Gilroy,
David Halligan and Peter McManus
together with some deputy registrars
have called on the council to re-think its
position on the no-fault principle, argu-
ing that it is out of touch with commun-
ity attitudes and can result in flagrant

The no-fault principle is a no-win
issue. Injustices will occur whether it is
retained or discarded. The thinking
behind the no-fault principle when it
was enshrined in the Family Law Act of
1975 was that judges could never hope
to establish who was at fault in the
breakdown of the marriage. Questions

of property, maintenance, custody and
access would be settled according to the
interests of any children involved and
on the means and needs and suitability
of spouses.
Chief Family Law Court judge
Elizabeth Evatt and the former head of
the Federal Law Reform Commission,
Justice Michael Kirby, are un-
compromising supporters of the no-
fault principle as are
some other judges and
registrars who spoke to The
Bulletin. They point to the
Matrimonial Causes Act
and some demeaning
muck-raking in the divorce
courts of those days.
“No one who ever
worked in those courts
would ever want the fault
principle revived,” said the
Adelaide registrar, Ms
Wendy Purcel.
Advocates for re-in-
troduction of the fault
principle in determination
of ancillary issues relating
to divorces argue that its exclusion
results in injustices.
To the argument that judges cannot
hope to fathom the causes of a marriage
breakdown and have no business trying,
they argue that other arms of the
judiciary are required to determine guilt
and innocence in cases quite as complex
as the failure of marriage.
Controversy over the no-fault
principle is symptomatic of the in-
tensive soul-searching in which the
Family Court is engaged. Counsellors
and registrars of the southern states
meet in Dandenong, Victoria, this week
to question and review the court’s
operation. Last week, those of the
northern states met in Brisbane. The
week before, the Family Law Council
held a conference in Hobart to grapple
with issues such as matrimonial pro-
perty, child support a private or
public responsibility? - alternative
methods for the settlement of disputes,
preparation of divorce petitions, ad-
vocacy in family law and default in
maintenance payments.
The shockwaves from bombs set off
against courtrooms and judges
leading in July to the killing of Mrs
Pearl Watson, wife of one of the judges
are still reverberating through the
Family Court.
When enacted, nine years ago, the
Family Law Act was hailed as a model
of enlightened and progressive legisla-
tion a “caring” act which took ac-
count of changes in social and moral
attitudes.
“There’s a siege mentality now,” says
Ms Gabrielle Trainor, media liaison
officer to the court.
Judges arrive and depart with a


phalanx of police escorts. New South
Wales Premier Neville Wran has ap-
pealed to the news media not to identify
judges or their homes in pictures. The
court is finding it hard to recruit suitable
applicants for vacancies on its bench.
For the current fiscal year, the At-
torney-General’s department has ear-
marked more than $1 million for ad-
ditional costs in guarding court pre-
mises and judges’ homes. The bulk of
this $700,000 is to be spent on
renovating the complex of courtrooms,
judges’ chambers and court offices in
the Temple Court Building, King Street,
Sydney. It was not designed for court-
rooms and is shared with non-govern-
ment tenants. The threat of violence,
especially to judges, requires that they
have separate access to courts and a
separate lift to protect them from
embittered litigants.
Five of the nine Family Law courts
in the Sydney registry have been closed
for security reasons since August. Some
hearings have been transferred to pre-
mises in Newcastle, Wollongong, Woy
Woy and Parramatta, or to courtrooms
borrowed from other branches of state
and federal judiciaries. Thirty-five
hearings have been cancelled and, ac-
cording to one Sydney barrister, the
waiting time for a hearing has
lengthened from 15 to 18 months.
The corridors of Temple Court and
the adjoining La Salle Building where
the court also has premises brim with
security guards searching with
electronic scanners anyone without
identity cards.
None of this is to suggest that the
Family Law Act has failed. This is
notwithstanding the publicity given to a
few embittered divorce litigants after
the July bombing and sections of the
legal profession claiming that
obedience to judicial rulings by Family
Law judges has been undermined by the
informal style of their courts.
Law reformers and officers of the
court resent any inference that the
murderous attacks demonstrate a fail-
ure of the Act.
One in every 2.6 marriages in
Australia breaks down. The court pro-
cesses an average 40,000 divorces a
year, of which between only 5 and 10
percent require judicial intervention in
disputes over custody, access, mainten-
ance and property.
The court calculates that those 40,000
divorces affect the lives of 120,000
people in the families involved. No
other branch of the judiciary permeates
so many lives.
With 43 judges, 17 registries and sub-
registries and 100 counsellors, everyone
involved in administering the Act is
over-extended. Their grievance is a lack
of money and manpower to do the job
better. □
MEDICINE
Why the funds
are mounting for
AIDS research
By GLENNYS BELL
AIDS has been described as a highly
political disease, never more so than in
the past two weeks when everyone from
Prime Minister Bob Hawke to moral
crusader the Reverend Fred Nile has
made it a topic for platform and pulpit.
Only a year ago, it was so iw-
fashionable that the National Health
and Medical Research Council could
not give away 5100,000 in research
funds for the disease. Now, govern-
ments are lavishing money on com-
mittees, studies, reference centres and
screening tests. The federal government
tops the list with a grant totalling $3
million.
In many ways, AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is fol-
lowing a predictable course established
in the United States where it was first
detected. There, it infected government,
religious and medical circles in much
the same way as has become the case in
Australia.
Yet AIDS continues on its relentless
way in the US. Thirty-
seven new cases were
reported in the first week
of November last year. The
corresponding figure in the
same week this year was
173. The prevalence of
AIDS has been doubling
every six months and the
death rate following
pattern. After one year,
more than 50 percent of its
victims are dead; after two
years, more than 70 per-
cent. The death rate ap-
Dr Julian Gold
ROBERT MORT
proaches 100 percent after three years.
Leading epidemiologist Dr Julian
Gold says that AIDS will be a big cause
of death among male homosexuals,
haemophiliacs, others who receive blood
transfusions and among drug addicts.
In the US, it was the main cause of
death among prime risk groups within
five years of the disease emerging and
Gold expects the same to happen here.
“At the moment, there is no vaccine;
there is no treatment. Everyone who
gets the disease will die,” he said.
As its name suggests, AIDS is an
acquired — rather than inherited —
disease which leaves its victims unable
to withstand infections because of the
breakdown of their immune system.
They become susceptible to a range of
debilitating, often deadly, diseases.
Researchers at the US National In-
stitutes of Health, led by Dr Robert
Gallo, have isolated a virus — HTLV-3
— which is the third member of the
family called human T-cell leukemia
virus. Gallo believes that the ancestor of
the virus came from Africa.
What is different in Australia is the
virulence of the disease. The country’s
climate has long caused medical con-
cern that AIDS would spread faster
than in America and indications are
that this is happening.
So far, 26 cases of AIDS have been
reported but the number of AIDS-
related diseases is proportionately more
than reported in the US at
the same stage in the
spread of the disease.
The main hope, accord-
ing to Gold, is not in com-
mittees or political solu-
tions: “It can’t be seen as a
political problem. In the
United States, when politi-
cal committees were set up
there were about 500 cases.
Now, there are nearly
7000.” Rather, the solution
lies in interrupting the
transmission of the disease.


This can only be done through
understanding the disease and treating
it in much the same way as any natural
disaster, such as a bushfire or
earthquake.
One of the main sources of informa-
tion on the character of the disease in
Australia is the Sydney AIDS Risk
Study begun this year. The study is a
collaborative effort between the Com-
monwealth Institute of Health where
Gold heads the surveillance unit, Saint
Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney where
Professor Ron Penny leads the team
which first started investigations in
Australia, the New South Wales Health
department under Dr Tony Adams,
some medical practitioners who have
homosexual clients and the Gays
Counselling Service of NSW.
More than 700 homosexuals have
volunteered to take part in the study. It
is designed to investigate both their
health and their lifestyles, including
sexual practices, and to discover and
treat symptoms of AIDS and related
disorders. The study is expected to
continue for at least two years and is
unique: it is the first chance to carry out
a controlled investigation of AIDS.
The data from the study should help
epidemiologists, immunologists and
virologists trace specific risk factors and
predict where AIDS may strike. It
should also help the specialists treat it
and control its spread.
The results so far, based on six
months’ study of 289 people, show a
difference between Australia and Am-
erica in terms of spread.
For example, as Gold points out, a
US study at about the same stage
showed that fewer subjects about 5
percent had been exposed to the
virus. “We have indications that about
30 percent of people in our study have
signs or symptoms of an AIDS-related
condition."
These signs and symptoms are not
AIDS but, rather, a condition known as
lymphadenopathy. The symptoms
range from fever lasting more than
seven days in the previous three months
to unexpected weight loss of five
kilograms or more, to swollen lymph
nodes (these are in the neck, armpits
and groin) or diarrhoea lasting seven
days or more. Of those who have such a
condition or show antibodies to the
AIDS virus, only a small percentage are
likely to develop the full-blown disease.
As far as specific risk factors are
concerned, such as who is most likely to
develop AIDS, not enough firm in-
formation is yet available.
In the US, more than 75 percent of
those with the disease are homosexual.
In Australia, it seems that the figure is
higher around 85 percent. One thing
which Gold believes heightens the risk
factor is travel to the US and contact
with American homosexuals.
Another finding of the study is that
some 30 percent of those enrolled have
lived in the “fast lane.” This means
multiple sexual partners and regular use
of “recreational” drugs such as nitrites,
cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana.
The “fast lane” is not necessarily
typical of the general homosexual
population which is estimated by the
Gays Counselling Group to be around
250,000 in Sydney, 200,000 in
Melbourne and 50,000 each in Brisbane,
Adelaide and Perth and Hobart.
One of the biggest problems facing
workers on AIDS is separating the
politics from the public health aspects.
Lex Watson, co-convenor of the
Australian AIDS Action Committe and
a homosexual community spokesman,
has referred to discrimination against
homosexuals and the political fall-out
that results from AIDS as major issues.
In the medical world, AIDS is
equally political. Honor and glory will
attend the scientists who discover the
cause and the cure of the disease.
However, until a vaccine is found,
the major action lies in controlling the
disease.
Gold said: “We need anew ap-
proach to the disease but it has to be a
public health approach. We have a
science called epidemiology which is
concerned with controlling epidemics.
It’s already been used to control others
everything from smallpox to
legionaires disease and toxic shock syn-
drome. Now, we have to try to do the
same with AIDS.” □

PICKERING’S ELECTION


COVER STORY
The economy is firmly
back on the boil
Our national psyche is all too reluctant to accept cheerful economic indicators but
JOHN EDWARDS has five sound arguments for quashing the doomsayers.
THE ECONOMY has been so well-
behaved this year that Australians are
inclined to think something big must be
about to go wrong. Much of this
pessimism is temperamental and needs
no evidence at all but, when spelled out
usually asserts that the economy will
soon go bad because:
1. The United States economy is
about to fall off the cliff.
2. If the federal government budget
deficit does not ruin us, the current
account deficit will.
3. Wages will go through the roof,
anyway.
4. Hawke will not be able to fulfill his
three election promises about the
federal budget.
There is precious little evidence (or
theory, for that matter) to support these
four arguments. Our national psyche
skips over the evidence of the first year
of recovery which suggests that fun-
damental changes have occurred within
the Australian economy - in favor of
pessimism about a lot of things that
have not happened and probably will
not happen.
Instead of those four gloomy pro-
positions, there is plausible argument
for five cheerful ones:
1. Hawke’s three promises about the
federal budget over the next three years
can probably be achieved without too
much difficulty. (Treasurer Paul
Keating’s one promise about next year’s
deficit, however, probably can not be
achieved).
2. Evidence so far suggests that the
wage/price accord is holding up pretty
well, and there are sound reasons (in-
cluding continuing high unemployment
and low inflation) to think that wages
will not explode.
3. The US economy is not about to
fall off a cliff and the slowdown is good
for us.
4. Australia’s deficit will not come
down much, if at all but the economy
will keep growing. The current account
deficit will not fall much either and we
shall survive that, too. The current
account deficit is actually pretty good
for Australia.
5. Australia has the best chance for
years for sustained, mild growth which
will boost incomes and employment.
(But growth will probably not be fast
enough to push unemployment down
and unemployment may even go up.
Interest rates will stay up and price
inflation will stay down. This means no
real estate boom and no share market
boom. So long as world commodity
prices are depressed, it also means no
resources boom.)
Contrary to expectations a year ago,
almost all the numbers describing the
Australian economy today are so good
that it is hard to imagine them being
much better. Not only has growth been
rapid but it has been increasingly well
balanced.
We shall not have the September
quarter figures until next month but


Treasurer Keating: his promise at odds with those of Hawke
ROB WALLS/RAPPORT
what indications we do have suggest
that growth continues fairly strongly,
Investment was down in the September
quarter, after a strong June quarter, but
it will be up over the full year.
Retail sales are up motor vehicle
registrations are up, and construction is
still strong.
Exports were down in October but
still well above the value of exports a
year ago. Imports were also down, so
the net deduction fiom growth is pro-
bably not increasing.
Over the whole year, Australia has
had its best price performance and best
growth performance since the ’6os. The
rate of recovery of wages in this
recovery has been lower than in past
recoveries and price inflation continues
to fall. Now for the threats to this
expansion.
Will the US economy collapse and
take us with it?
The US third quarter gain of 1.9
percent in annual terms is such a sharp
slowdown that special factors may have
been at work. One was a downturn in
construction, after a summer of high
interest rates. Another was a downturn
in consumer spending, which is volatile.
Another is a deterioration in net
exports. Deterioration in growth result-
ing from an import surge does not have
the same implications for growth as,
say, a collapse in private investment.
Most US forecasters still predict a
growth rate next year of 3 to 4 percent,
and forecasts of that kind are
strengthened by the continuing high
budget deficit holding up demand and
the new willingness of the Federal
Reserve to ease up on the money supply
and interest rates.
For Australia (and for the US, for
that matter) a US slowdown is not such
a bad thing. It means there will be less
pressure on US interest rates next year if
Australian growth falters.
If US interest rates do trend down
next year while the trade gap continues
to increase, the US dollar will decline
against other currencies. This will give
Australia a little more room to bring
interest rates down or let the Australian
dollar slip if necessary.
Will our foreign trade blow out?
Australia’s economic policy is so
similar to America’s that we are seeing
the same concerns which arise in the
US. In both countries, the effect of big
government borrowing is mitigated by
importing other countries’ savings.
The only way we can do this is by
running a current account deficit, which
will usually show up as a surplus of
imports over exports.
In our case, much of the increase in
imports has been in producer equip-
ment and partly-produced goods -
which are exactly the kind of things we
should be importing. So the Australian
current account deficit is not a bad
thing, a point underlined by the good
performance of Australian exports
during the past two years.
Will the pay/price accord blow out?
Wage growth has been close to the
rate of growth of award wages, which
has been bang on the national bench
indexation decisions. The profit share
has increased. The rate of growth of
nominal wages is below the sum of price
increases and productivity increases. If
we accept that the fastest part of the
recovery is over and that we shall be
lucky to sustain a 4 percent growth rate
over the next year, unemployment pro-
bably is stuck above 8 percent. These
are not propitious circumstances for a
wages push outside the Arbitration
Commission.
Can Hawke carry out his three budget
promises?
The Prime Minister has achieved the
great feat of promising very little and
appearing to be restrictive. His own
promises (as distinct from those of
Keating) are not to increase public
spending as a percentage of output, not
to increase tax as a percentage of output
and not to increase the deficit as a
percentage of output. None of these is
very restrictive.
The pessimistic response by com-
mentators is an example of the way
ideas about the Labor Party have not
changed as quickly as the party has.
The growth of federal spending in
this financial year is lower than it was in
either of the last two Fraser government
budgets. The deficit as a proportion of
national output is lower than it was in
the first three budgets of the Fraser
government or in its last (one reason
why Fraser can take some of the credit
for recovery).
And spending would have been
much slower this year if we exclude the
one-time addition of Medicare to the
federal government budget. It added
about 2 percentage points of the 6
percentage points of increase in spend-
ing after inflation.


Hawke’s spending promise allows
room for spending growth equal
to the rate of growth of the economy,
which next year could be around 4
percent exactly the rate of growth of
spending this year minus Medicare.
This year, spending on public debt
interest is contributing about 1.6 per-
cent of the growth of total spending
and will be well down next year. This
year’s increase mostly reflects the big
bulge in borrowing for the 1983-84
deficit. Next year, the increase will be
less because the deficit this year is less.
Next financial year, public debt in-
terest could contribute something more
than 0.8 percent of the 4 percent growth
allowable. Another 1 percent will be
contributed by the full year cost of this
year’s programs. That leaves a real rise
of 2 percent spread over remaining
programs. The government has not
committed itself to new programs which
will jeopardise the ceiling.
On the receipts side, Hawke will be
helped by another swift rise in tax
collections. Because of marginal tax
rates, income tax collections will pro-
bably rise a good deal faster than the
rate of growth of the economy which
means that Hawke will need to give tax
cuts in the next budget.
Hawke’s promise also allows for a
substantial rise in the deficit. If inflation
is 6 percent next year and real growth is
4 percent, the deficit can increase by
nearly $7OO million and still be within
Hawke’s current set of promises. $o he
can increase spending next year by as
much as this year (after deducting
Medicare), he can give tax cuts and he
(a) Consumer price index adjusted for introduction of Medicare
can increase the deficit all within a set
of promises that strangely have been
interpreted as restrictive.
Increasing taxes in a downturn is not
a great idea. If the economy crashed, no
doubt the deficit would increase but
maybe not much further than is allowed
by Hawke’s promises (compatible with
a deficit of around $lO billion by the
end of three years).
The real problem for the Hawke
government is in reconciling the Hawke
(a) Value in the six months to the month shown
promises with the Keating promise to
reduce the deficit in the next budget
that is, to reduce it as a dollar amount.
Keating has said several times that
he will do this and he continues to say it.
This does not contradict Hawke but the
only way the three Hawke promises can
be reconciled with the single Keating
promise is by a much more savage cut in
spending. This is because the Hawke
promises cut off the normal way of
reducing deficits in recoveries, which is
through a faster rate of growth of tax
revenue than general economic growth.
If taxes are not to increase as a
percentage of output and the deficit is to
be reduced as a money amount, spend-
ing must go down as a percentage of
output. This is because the deficit is the
difference between spending and taxes.
The gap between the least restrictive
interpretation of the Hawke promise
and the least restrictive interpretation of
the Keating promise is spending equal
to the increase in the deficit if it were to
remain at its present proportion of
output about $7OO million. This is
about 1 percent of spending next year,
so Keating’s promise halves the allow-
able rate of growth of spending after
deduction of interest payments and the
extra full-year cost of programs in-
troduced next year.
This also assumes that Keating is
making only a tiny cut in the dollar size
of the deficit. If he wants to make a
substantial cut of the order of this
year’s cut the spending increase in
next year’s budget will be negative in
real terms, after payment of interest and
the full-year cost of this year’s pro-
grams. That would hurt. □

It still does.
When Thomas Cooper first
started making his unique ale
in 1862, electricity was just a
futuristic dream. Even with
time on his side, what Thomas
didn't know, would never have
helped him. Because Thomas
made his brew using a
centuries old method known
as the naturally conditioned
top fermentation process. In
this natural process the ale is
brewed in open vats, then
transferred to oak casks to
ferment After a week in the
casks it is bottled with added
sugar and yeast, and left for six
weeks to naturally carbonate
and mature. Which accounts for
its unique cloudy appearance.
Only then, after a full seven
weeks, did Thomas
finally release his
brew to the public.
And though the
Gooper brewing
business has stayed
in the family for four
generations, not one
descendant has seen
fit to change the
original recipe or
methods.
Which is why,
without aid of
electricity, carbon
dioxide, preservatives,
speed additives or
aluminium cans, a
single bottle of
Gooper's Ale still takes seven
weeks to make. And why today
you can still enjoy a traditional
family ale, with a real family
tradition. As long as the lights
let you find the fridge.
Coopers Ale.
Taste the difference family tradition makes.

RESTAURANT OF THE YEAR
Nominations
reflect changing
tastes and skills
Fanny’s Bistro, last year’s Bulletin/Quelltaler Restaurant of the Year
DON McPHEDRAN
By LEN EVANS
THE LATE Rudy Komon was shown
an aged bottle 30 years ago. “Have you
shaken it?” he asked the young waiter.
“No sir,” he said, “but I will, I will!”
Times, gastronomically, were hard.
So were the staff attitudes and the steak.
It was the hands-up-for-porridge era;
this room is for eating and that one for
drinking; the train leaves at 7pm sharp
and everyone has had their tea by then.
We rose above it all on occasion.
Though I was present when a steak
tartare was returned because it was
underdone (not the same man who
ordered a bottle of Chateaubriand), a
chap at another meal watched most
attentively while his was mixed in front
of him from time to time, having
added a little more of this or that and
then he ordered it back to the kitchen to
be cooked. “Only way I can get a decent
hamburger,” he explained.
Rudy Nureyev wanted his steak as
rare as possible. So I served him a slab
raw. “That man knows how to cook,” he
said.
The travelling companion of a
famous British property magnate
ordered a “bowl of caviar and some
pink champers” and threw a fit when
the champagne arrived unblushing
white. So, we soaked the label off a Dorn
Perignon, added a drop of cochineal
and served it “straight from the man-
ager’s private reserve”: Honor satisfied,
humor restored and heavens above.
I once arrived in Coonawarra with
less appealing (and, in truth, less
demanding) companions to seek food,
drink and shelter at the Penola Hotel.
At 6.10 pm a beer. At 6.15, another.
“Can you put us up for the night?” “No
sweat.” Another beer at 6.35. Finally:
“Can we get a feed at the pub?” “No,
mate, the dining-room closes at 6.30.”
The fish is off, the lamb is off and so
am I.
Things have changed and very much
for the better. Australian ingredients
always have been first-class and a new
breed of younger chefs has learned how
to handle them. We have gained all
sorts of ethnic influences, not only from
Europe but also from Asia and the
Americas. Our national cuisine will
become a mix of many countries, based
on fine ingredients and simplicity of
presentation.
The Bulletin/Q uelltaler Best Restaur-
ant Quest will continue to support this
improvement. After three years, they
have become most sought-after ac-
colades both at state and national level
and this is due largely to the awards
coming from the people who really
count the customers.
Because of our tremendous distances
between drinks, it becomes very difficult
and costly to organise a team of pro-
fessional inspectors. Hence, we base the
selection process on those made by
Bulletin readers discriminators all
ratified by professionals in each state.
The 1984 quest has already produced
thousands of nominations. The follow-
ing restaurants are among the front
runners in their various categories. I
thought that I would let you know, so
that you support them even more or
suggest others which you prefer. (The
categories are, respectively: Best Food,
Best Steak, Best Seafood, Best Chinese,
Best Ethnic other than Chinese, Best
Wine.)
PLEASE REMEMBER AND
NOTE: Jean-Jacques (Victoria) sea-
food, Vlado’s (Victoria) steak and
Milano (Queensland) wine are no
longer eligible since each has won three
national titles and they have been
removed to a sort of dining-room of

receive many votes, these become in-
formal.

Times are still changing but not
everything is perfect yet. Recently, I
went to a prominent restaurant as a
guest of two of my former employees
who wanted “to buy the old b... a
couple of good bottles (the restaurant
being noted for its cellar).” The first
white selection was unavailable, the
second oxidised. We settled for a fresh
young white which one can buy
anywhere. The first red selection an
ancient Bordeaux was brought to the
table in a cradle, then lifted out with
vigor to be uncorked. Result: One very
cloudy, very expensive wine. The
second red was brown, tired, flat. We
consoled ourselves with a splendid
champagne ...

THE LAW
Costigan inquiry:
a blow to
natural justice
By JOHN SPENDER
FRANK COSTIGAN QC’s final report
into the Painters and Dockers raises
issues of profound importance to in-
quisitorial investigations into criminal
activities and the administration of
justice in Australia.
I shall take three related issues: the
application of the rules of natural
justice to inquiries of the kind under-
taken by Costigan; the public exposure
of suspected criminal activities in
privileged reports; and what may be
called basic notions of fairness. Each is
starkly illustrated by Kerry Packer’s
situation.
On the subject of natural justice I
confine myself to one matter: Costigan’s
failure to allow Packer to know the
substance or outline of the
matters alleged against him
and to afford him an op-
portunity to answer those
matters.
On this issue, Costigan
stated his conclusion in these
terms:
“My reason for not al-
lowing the effective im-
plementation of the
principles of natural
justice was that in almost
every case the result of my
deliberations was the re-
ferral of the matter to
ordinary law enforcement
agencies. Once in their
hands, and following their
initiating process, the full
requirements of natural
justice would be met. In
none of the matters did I
expect that an opportunity
would not be presented at
some point, albeit long

distinguished career at the bar,
beginning in 1960.
after I had completed my part of the\
task. It was therefore unnecessary to
give an opportunity; and it was
inimical to the success of the investi-
gation both as done by me and as to
be done by the law enforcement
agency to which I intended to report
the matter.” (Volume 1, paragraph
2.036)
Two things may be said of Costigan’s
argument that at a later stage the full
requirements of natural justice would be
met. Firstly, it is not really a question of
the rules of natural justice being applied
after criminal proceedings have been
initiated; rather, it is the application of
the ordinary rules governing criminal
prosecutions, which is really a quite
separate matter. Secondly, it is quite
beside the point that at some later stage,
if charged, a defendant then gets, as part
of the administration of criminal pro-
cedures, the benefit of the rules of
natural justice. The question is: should
he have had them beforehand?
Costigan was engaged in what was
undoubtedly the widest investigation by
a royal commission of criminal activi-
ties in Australia. He is concerned that
criminal investigations should be suc-
cessful, and the guilty punished. I share
his concern. But concern that the guilty
be punished does not prevent one from
being, at the same time, concerned
about the conduct of inquisitorial inves-
tigations.
Inquisitions are still the exception to
the general rule in this country. If
interviewed by the police, a citizen has
the right to remain silent. Nor can he be
compelled to give evidence against him-
self in a criminal trial. Undoubtedly
these rules help criminals: but that is not
their purpose. They are part of the
balance struck over the centuries, be-
tween the powers of the state and the
rights of the citizen who is by general
presumption innocent of criminality
until proven guilty beyond reasonable
doubt.
Investigations of the kind conducted
by Costigan are very similar to special
investigations into companies of the
kind which occupied some two years of
my professional life. Of these kinds of
inquiries, a very eminent jurist, Lord
Denning, said in 1970 (in re Permagon
Press):
The inspectors “have to make a
report which may have wide
repercussions. They may, if they
think fit, make findings of fact which
are very damaging to those whom
they name. They may accuse some;
they may condemn others; they may
ruin reputations or careers. Their
report may lead to judicial pro-
ceedings. It may expose persons to
criminal prosecutions or to civil ac-
tions.”
He went on to point out that the


report might be published to the public
at large and then said:
“Seeing that their work and their
report may lead to such con-
sequences, I am clearly of the
opinion that the inspectors must act
fairly. This is a duty which rests on
them, as on many other bodies, even
though they are not judicial or quasi-
judicial, but only administrative ...
The inspectors can obtain informa-
tion in any way they think best, but
before they condemn or criticise a
man they must give him a fair
opportunity for correcting or con-
tradicting what is said against him.
They need not quote chapter and
verse. An outline of the charge will
usually suffice.”
This description of the consequences
that may flow from special investiga-
tions is a remarkably apt description of
Costigan’s investigations. Lord Den-
ning’s views provide a sound general
approach to such investigations. They
reflect well established principles of law
and accord with ordinary notions of
fairness, especially when a report is to
be made public a decision that is very
much in the hand of the person prepar-
ing it. It can also be highly unwise for
an investigator, as well as highly damag-
ing to the object of his investigations,
not to follow the course proposed by
Lord Denning. There may be answers
that have not occurred to the investiga-
tor, or evidence of which he is unaware,
or has overlooked, or has mis-
understood.
Where, because of very special and
exceptional circumstances, this kind of
course cannot be followed the material
should in all respects remain confiden-
tial and out of the public arena. But it is
extremely difficult to accept that all
matters allegedly concerning Packer
could fall into such a special category.
This brings me to the question of the
public exposure of those allegedly
engaged in criminal activity. Costigan
appears to support, in principle, the
exposure of individuals convicted in the
minds of those conducting inquisitorial
investigations presumably without
first allowing them an opportunity to
answer the charges to be publicly made
against them. Certainly, this is a course
he seems ready to adopt in practice. He
supports (Volume 5, paragraph 8.009)
public hearings of a Crimes Authority;
the quality of the membership would
ensure that it would not “in-
discriminately and haphazardly dis-
seminate information publicly.”
Is this really the path we should
take? Are we to substitute trial by public
interrogation for trial by the courts? If
we do, what person, or institution, or
reputation however blameless will
be safe?

the investigators may be dismissed. In
the blaze of a public hearing even the
best intentioned and most scrupulous of
men can be led astray. And, the very
fact of being called to give evidence
will, in many cases, be sufficient to
cause great damage to individual
reputations.
I now turn to the question of basic
fairness, which brings me directly to
some of the things said by Costigan
about Packer. In part, Costigan was
answering Packer’s public attack arising
out of the documents leaked to The
National Times. However it was that
those documents came into the hands of
The National Times, two things are
indisputable: the original source was
the Costigan Inquiry and their leaking
did immediate damage to Packer as he
was by widespread rumor identified as
the Goanna.
Having been the cause, if in-
advertent, of this damage, common
fairness required that Costigan should
do his best to minimise that damage.
Yet the report that he knew would be
made public made things far worse. I
quote:
“There were a number of people
subject to those investigations who I
feared, if they knew the extent,
would seek to frustrate them. Mr
Packer is one such person.” (Volume
1, paragraph 3.010)
By itself this would be bad enough.
But there were far more damaging
things yet to come:
“All other matters (i.e. involving
Mr Packer) including the drug
matter, were done in private.”
(Volume 1, paragraph 3.021)
The implication: Packer was, in
some unspecified way, involved in a
drug matter, presumably illegal.
“The inquiries into Packer related
matters quickly expanded, taking
into their breadth a number of com-
plex land transactions, and the death
of Mr Coote. These, and other
matters, are reported upon in detail
in Volumes 9, 10 and 11. A perusal of
those matters quickly reveals their
great ambit. Any one of them
warrants a major inquiry. None of
them has been finally completed. All
require further investigation. Upon
completion I expect there to be
proceedings in the courts for some or
all of the persons involved.” (Volume
1, paragraph 3.024)
And again:
“Matters touching upon Mr Packer
occur in three principal volumes, and
to a lesser degree in sub-chapters in
other volumes. In one volume my
recommendation is that there be a
further murder investigation followed
by an inquest. Mr Packer may attend
that if he wishes, and he will there
learn all he wishes to know.” (Volume
1, paragraph 3.051)
To make these kinds of statements,
concerning matters which on Costigan’s
own admission had not been fully
investigated, constituted a grave, funda-
mental, and inexcusable affront to
ordinary notions of fairness. The in-
nuendoes and the inferences to be
drawn from these kinds of statements
are all too clear and all too damaging.
One can only presume that this was
what Costigan intended, since these
were not casual throw-away lines, but
parts of what should have been a
carefully and judiciously prepared
document. By making these kinds of
statements, Costigan has done great
damage to Packer’s reputation, damage
that may prove quite irremediable. The
gravity of the damage, and the grossness
of the violation of Packer’s reputation,
are both greatly enhanced by the source
from which they come: a royal commis-
sion, with all the high authority such a
body possesses, or should possess.
It is ironic, if not comforting to
Packer, to turn to one last passage:
“To suggest... that lam acting in
a fashion similar to Senator [Joseph]
McCarthy (now deceased) of the
United States is patently ridiculous.

At no time have I published Mr
Packer’s name or suggested that he
be dealt with by public denigration
in preference to the ordinary course
of the law. I still do not do so. To the
extent that he warrants investigation,
I recommend it be done; to the
extent he warrants prosecution, I
urge that it be done.” (Volume 1,
paragraph 3.045)
The internal inconsistency is strik-
ing. The direct and obvious effect of that
passage was to do just what Costigan
claimed he was not doing: publicly to
denigrate Packer.
The Costigan Commission should be
an object lesson to us all. The time has
come to cease trail by tribunal; sus-
pected or alleged criminal actions are to
be tried by the courts and nowhere else.
Investigations have a very valuable role
to perform, but findings made in investi-
gations, so far as those findings con-
stitute directly or by innuendo or by
implication findings of criminality, or
suspected criminality, against in-
dividuals, should remain wholly confi-
dential.
Lest it be thought that I am a recent
critic of Costigan’s work, I refer to my
speech in the House of Representatives
of September 14, 1982. I was critical of
the report by Costigan then before
parliament, and in particular, of some
of the findings in that report. I refer to
one, which Costigan himself corrected.
In his report Costigan had stated that a
Mr Taylor was convicted of murder; in
fact, Mr Taylor had been acquitted
hardly a trivial error. I ended by saying:
“I hope that in the further reports that
come to the House individuals are not
identified. ”
My hopes have been disappointed by
Costigan’s final report; my views have
been greatly reinforced. □
OPINION

a ‘constructive’
use of fear
PUBLIC OPINION
The Bulletin has asked prominent people
from outside the mainstream of politics
for their opinions on the federal election.
Political analyst FRANK KNOPFEL-
MACHER considers the options.
AS A central European survivor of both
Hitler and Stalin, I am an “ideological”
voter. That is, my voting style is similar
to that of most American
Jews. The distinction between
“pragmatic” and “ideologi-
cal” made no sense in the
formative period of my life
when getting the wrong ideo-
logues into power meant total
personal destruction. This was
actually so everywhere: only
in liberal and very powerful
societies such as in the British
empire or the United States
were the reigning assumptions
totally irremovable, thereby
giving the illusion of being a
part of the landscape,
unrelated to one’s “private”
interests.
Different parties thus
became different cosmetic
variants of the same power
structure. Thus the illusion
that there are such things as
“unpolitical” issues was born
and with it the distinction
between “pragmatists” and
“ideologues.”
Within the Australian context, this
meant voting for the party which ap-
peared least likely to tamper with our
defence arrangements against the Soviet
Union and her permanent or temporary
allies.
From my arrival here in 1955, I
simply copied the Democratic Labor
Party ticket on my ballot paper without
even looking at the candidates.
In 1972, I gave my second pre-
ferences to Whitlam and voted Liberal
from November, 1975. I voted straight
Labor in the latest Victorian state elec-
tion and would have voted for Bob
Hawke in 1983. But I did not. For the
first time in my life, I voted non-
ideologically: Being then the father of
two young children, Labor’s fiscal

Labor seen as the
best economic
managers
A MAJORITY of voters believe a
Labor government, if elected, would be
best at managing the economy.
In addition more voters believe a
Labor government would do more for
the aged than would a Liberal-National
government, and would spend
taxpayers’ money more wisely.
Opinion is evenly divided on which
of the parties would be the better for
reducing taxes, the Morgan Gallup Poll
finds.
These findings come from interview-
ing, on the weekends of November
3/10, an Australia-wide cross-section of
2201 voters.
The respondents were asked to think
about the Liberal-National Party Coali-
tion and the Australian Labor Party,
and then asked:
“After the coming federal election,
which political party, if elected, do you
think would be best for reducing the
taxes you pay a Labor government, a
Liberal-National government, or no
difference?
“And which party, if elected, do you
think would be best for spending tax-
payers’ money more wisely a Labor
government, a Liberal-National govern-
ment, or no difference?
“And which political party, if
elected, do you think would be best for
doing more for the aged a Labor
government, a Liberal-National govern-
ment, or no difference?
“And which party, if elected, do you
think would be best for managing the
economy a Labor government, a
Liberal-National government, or no
difference?”

policies on education scared me (or,
rather, my hip-pocket nerve).
Well, my first sally into pragmatism
resulted in a howler. I shall, of course,
vote Labor on December 1.
Like other political parties the
Australian Labor Party is a coalition of
diverse interests: trade unions, led at
times by robber-barons almost as bad as
the hit men of the medical profession
and at most times by plain people with
normal business-like wheeling and
dealing inclinations. There are the
“fabians,” the machine politicians of
the NSW Tammany kind, a new,
mushrooming and largely parasitic
state-bourgeoisie, in the public service
and in quangos such as the universities
and, finally, there are the communists
open and covert divided into sects,
whose main citadel is in Victoria. Bernie
Taft’s liquidation of the outdated
“bolshevik” model of party organisa-
tion will remove the last vestige of
stealth from communist movements
within and into the ALP.
Of the merely diverse interests within
the ALP, only two are absolutely in-
compatible: those between the majority
no matter whether they be tough
unionists or donnish fabians who
desire to work within our pluralist-
democratic system and whom one may
call “social democrats” and the
Marxist-Leninists (“the Corns” of old)
who look toward various countries of
the mind which happen to bear the
names of actual slummy police states
(Albania, Libya, the Soviet Union, etc)
for help. Their base is the socialist left in
Victoria.
Two risks are associated with voting
Labor. One is that Prime Minister
Hawke may slip on one of the many
banana skins constantly tossed his way
by sections of the Fairfax press and the

The Mercedes-Benz 190 E is not
just a new car, it is a totally new class of
car: the first compact car ever built to
Mercedes-Benz standards. Unlike cars
of similar size, it is engineered without
compromise in any respect. As such, it
will stand as an evolutionary achieve-
ment in the history of the automobile.
Within its lithe, compact dimensions
are hidden awe-inspiring technological
breakthroughs in suspension design,
in performance characteristics, in
space utilisation and also in safety
engineering features.
As a result of its ten years of

intensive development it is the most
agile, most dynamic Mercedes-Benz
saloon ever built.
However, the most exciting dis-
coveries of all are only revealed when
you experience the 190 E from the
drivefs seat.
The q uickest reflexes of
any Mercedes-Benz.
The authoritative American
magazine Road & Track has said of the
190 E: “It’s clear that Mercedes spared
no expense in designing the suspen-
sion of this agile road car - it may well
be the best-handling automobile that
Mercedes-Benz has ever built?
What brings about such unguard-
ed admiration is the quite revolutionary
Mercedes-Benz multi-link rear sus-
pension system. Its ‘spatial kinematics’
Mil*
design locates each wheel by five
independent links that correspond to
the five separate forces operating on it
at any given time.
Not only does it endow the car
with obviously impressive handling but
with ride characteristics that make
comparison with previous compact cars
impossible. Road & Track once again:
“If you were blindfolded and placed
inside this car, you would swear
that you were riding in a (Mercedes)
380SEL7 High praise indeed.
The 190 E musters dynamic
performance from an outstanding new
two-litre power plant.
This turbine-smooth
engine develops remark-
ably high torque in every
speed range. It has a
cross-flow head and new
electro-mechanical fuel
injection. The Mercedes-
Benz four-speed auto-
matic transmission features
manual over-ride for
spirited driving.
A hydraulic dual-circuit braking
system places discs at each of the four
wheels to retard its headlong progress
with cool Teutonic efficiency. As an
option, the anti-lock braking system
(ABS), introduced to the world by
Mercedes-Benz, is also available.
The evolution
of a new class of Mercedes-Benz.
For a full twelve months, the
190 E was meticulously honed in the
wind tunnel to produce not only an
aggressive wedge profile but a superbly
low co-efficient of drag (0.33) as well.
But this aerodynamic efficiency
is only a part of the engineers’ skill.
The car’s unusually long wheelbase
provides a remarkable amount of its
total space for the passengers.
Front seat occupants enjoy similar
legroom to that offered in “S-Class ’
saloons, whilst the back seat comfort-
ably caters for two adults.
Inside the car are the familiar
Mercedes features dictated by ergono-
mic engineering. The dash design is
gimmick-free, easily read and easily res-
ponded to. The atmosphere is controlled
by a sophisticated heating, ventilation
and totally-integrated air-conditioning
system for your driving comfort.

The first compact car with a
Mercedes-Benz standard of safety.
The 190 E is unmistakably a
Mercedes-Benz in every detail,
including its uncompromising safety
standards. The 190 E does not merely
comply with Australian safety regu-
lations. It meets the more stringent
requirements of Mercedes-Benz.
Naturally, the 190 E’s quick and
predictable reflexes are its primary
defence against accidents.
But the forty years spent by the
company pioneering safety have pro-
duced a unique system of defences for
this new car including the Mercedes
‘safety cell’ and cmmple zones, a mo-
nocoque body welded at no less than
4,745 points, and the use of costly,
high strength/light alloy metals.
The 190 E is as safe as any
Mercedes production car ever built.
The tradition finds new expression.
The 190 E must rightly take its
place ahead of all other compact cars
because there will always be one irrec-
oncilable difference: the 190 E is a
Mercedes-Benz.
As such, it inherits a one hundred
year old tradition of quality. But in a
package so advanced that it will be emu-
lated for years to come.
The 190 E is indeed a testament
to the company’s founding credo:
“The best or nothing’.’
Engineered like no other car.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
thereby producing (after a brief socialist
left interregnum) another Liberal-
National Party dark age of many years’
duration. The other is a defence-related
traffic accident, which may be preceded
either by Hawke’s elimination from
leadership or by a misjudgment on his
part of a serious military risk thereby
New Zealandising Australia. The latter
may produce a serious emergency for
our protecting power, which is
notoriously inept in handling such con-
tingencies, and de-stabilise the US posi-
tion in the Pacific.
I regard the first risk as being greater
than the second but with much less
serious consequences. Thus, it is more
likely for a Hawke government to come
to grief over a stunt or scandal and be
replaced by an L-NP government than
to blunder SEATO or ANZUS into a
catastrophe in our strategic vicinity.
In any case, there is no alternative to
Hawke. The L-NP coalition is not
viable.
Ever since the formation of his
government, Hawke has faced a de
facto alliance of the L-NP and the
socialist left. The alliance was not only
notional for, during the Combe-Ivanov
scandal and during the subsequent
“consorting” scandals, there was
evidence of traffic in anti-Hawke dirt
between our “monetarists” and our
“socialists.” By taking repeatedly and
in public Combe’s side against the
Prime Minister during the Combe-
Ivanov affair, the L-NP front-bench has
confirmed strongly what many of us had
suspected (at least since Gordon
Freeth’s notorious speech in 1969 on the
“constructive” role of the Soviet navy in
the Pacific): It is, simply, that the
defence/foreign policy complex of con-
cerns displayed since the Labor split
which kept the L-CP in power until ,1972
was a stunt to hang on to office under
false pretences without a shred of
genuine conviction to back them up.
It did not apply to many L-CP
politicians personally and certainly not
to Malcolm Fraser. I am not so sure,
though, about (Sir Robert) Menzies
whom I had a chance to watch as
chancellor of Melbourne University in
rather delicate situations.
Hawke, in every respect since his
election as prime minister, when
questions of external and internal secur-
ity were at stake, conducted himself
with exemplary skill, courtage and in-
tegrity. This was publicly acknowledged
by a then-key member of the Reagan
team, Jean Kirkpatrick, among others.
True, Hawke has been lucky. Economic
recovery co-incided with his assump-
tion of office. Yet it would be churlish to
deny that he displayed leadership
qualities unique in Australia since the
war. While power may at times corrupt,

it may also bring out unsuspected
reserves of skill and courage.
Hawke’s main internal problem is
how to rein in the left. He does it by
retaining control of what he regards as
the fundamental issues - foreign policy,
the American alliance, labor relations
without class warfare demagogy and
he keeps the socialist left happy by a
combination of duchessing, splitting
and symbolic gratifications.
The perks of office have turned many
a revolutionary tiger into a pussycat.
And, as for symbolic gratification, the
libbers, homosexuals, animal liberators
and whales have never had it so good.
The money seemingly wasted on them is
protection money well spent, which
may even do some occasional good in a
country where male piggery and even
racism are still entrenched.
Hawke’s main problem in this field
hinges on the definition of what con-
stitutes a mere symbol factory. It seems
that he over-extended the thing a bit by
including the ABC and the universities,
for both are controlled on the middle-
management the program-controllers
and senior teachers from which politi-
cal propaganda emanates, by Hawke’s
most dangerous and articulate enemies.
To dislike, say, Fraser or (B. A.)
Santamaria comes naturally to the left
intelligentsia: it is like hating a bossy
parent.
Yet Hawke is the adulterous seducer
of the woman of their dreams, the Labor
Movement, the archetypal social fascist
and American lackey.
Hawke is Judas. I have always felt
that the persistent harping on Hawke’s
alleged “love for Israel” has deeper
psychopathological roots among some
of his detractors.
Hawke is by far the most hated
politician in Australia among the left
intelligentsia I have ever seen here.
It is a sound (though not infallible)
rule to regard everything these people
know personally and hate as being good
for the country.
The news media and the universities
will eventually supply the banana skin
which will topple Hawke’s regime. It
would, therefore be prudent on his part
to change their hate into fear.
Grovelling for acceptance will
merely increase their appetite for ag-
gression.
To seek love among the unstable
supporters of Stalin, Ho, Castro,
Gadaffi, and Liberation Theology
would be a particularly unpleasant form
of suicide in any case.
The people concerned constitute a
minority within a minority and they are
largely . . . let’s say . . . unbrave. They
are small and soft just like banana
skins.
It shouldn’t be too difficult to put the
fear of Hawke into them. □
ANALYSIS
The age
of Robert
Gordon Hawke
By DON AITKIN
THE LONGER this election campaign
continues, the stronger grows my feeling
that I have been through it all before
and a long time ago.
Once before we had a party leader
who successfully distanced himself
from his party. His henchmen got on
with the often grubby business of
politics, but he was allowed to be a
statesman. He had a grand vision: it was
not ever a very precise vision, but in it
Australians lived at peace with one
another, there was a chicken in every
pot, and kiddies were safe playing on
the street.
He was understandably annoyed at
those who wished to pursue sectional
claims and causes: they missed the point
that there was an over-riding national
interest, of which he was the guardian.
He had no patience with those who
wished to redistribute wealth and
income tomorrow. The correct strategy
was to make a bigger cake, and then
everyone could have a bigger slice. That
way lay social harmony.
He was scathing when his political
opponents sought to buy votes with
extravagant election promises. “Where
is the money to come from?” he would
ask of this proposal or that proposal.
The answer, which no one ever needed
to give, was that money would have to
be taken from widows and orphans.
He himself promised very little. He
stood on his government’s record. In
particular, he asked for trust. This was
no time for specific undertakings; the
important thing was that at the helm
there was a man whom the people could
trust. He in turn regarded his office as a
kind of trust, exercised for the good of
the people.
His party had its own views about
him. Many thought he had a swelled
head, and others actively disliked him
for this or that incident in the past. The
leader had an extensive past. But the
great majority agreed that he had an
uncommon touch with the electorate
and that was what counted. He could
win elections, and that meant they were
in government. You could put up with a
lot for that.
He was not a conservative. If there
was need for action, he would take it.
He was undogmatic enough to adapt
useful ideas generated by his op-
ponents, and to backtrack if he sensed
that public opposition was growing too
strong. Above all, he wished to be in
power.
He had from an early age seen
himself as a future Prime Minister. He
thought he ought to be in power, and he
thought his party ought to be in power.
He and they were, as far as he could see,
the natural ruling party of the country.
For his opponents he had little but
contempt: they were a rabble, devoid of
ideas, dwelling in the past prone to
acts of folly. It sometimes amazed him
that sensible people could vote for them
at all.
That leader was Robert Gordon
Menzies, but in every respect the above
description has begun to apply to
Robert James Lee Hawke. There are no


doubt other resemblances, too, but the
ones I have listed have to do with
political style and apparent goals.
And the paradox, of course, is that
Hawke is a Labor leader. All of this is
understandable in a leader of a party of
the centre or the right. But historically it
is inapplicable to a Labor leader. Until
now.
What makes it possible? There are
several causes. Like Menzies, Hawke is
an utterly familiar but larger-than-life
public figure. He has been on Australian
television longer than Bert Newton; his
private life has been almost as public as
Elizabeth Taylor’s; his virtues and
faults are almost prototypically Aus-
tralian.
To have become prime minister is to
have received the ultimate accolade. I
think it is almost certainly true that
more people will vote for this prime
minister’s party because of the man who
is prime minister than at any time since
Menzies occupied the office. When men
such as these are prime minister, our
elections approach presidential elec-
tions, despite our parliamentary forms.
Labor would have won in March
1983 without him, though that sobering
fact is receding into history. But he
probably gave his party a more
resounding victory than it might have
enjoyed otherwise. Now his position
within his party is supreme, and he can
appeal from his office directly to the
people without having to summon the
party to his aid. He is better liked
outside his party than inside it.
All of this is very odd, in terms of
Australian politics. How long can it
last? Well, Menzies was not expected to
last for long, especially when inflation
galloped into Australia because of the
Korean War. He had a tight run in 1951,
was very lucky to win in 1954 (when
Labor actually won a majority of the
vote), and came within a whisker of
losing in 1961. But all told, he held the
highest elective office for a shade more
than 16 years and his party stayed in
power for another seven years.
It would be miraculous if the other
Robert could equal that feat, the more
so because the ALP has not been
renowned as a successful power-seeking
organisation. But there seems every
likelihood that he has that ambition,
and his party has changed its spots. It
now likes office every bit as much as the
Liberals do, and is beginning to adopt
some of its rivals’ self-justifying at-
titudes to power.
Assume, reasonably enough, a win in
1984, assume another in the euphoria of
bicentennial 1988 (he can last for three
years and three months before he has to
hold an election), and Labor is still in
office in 1991. That’s a run to equal that
of Curtin and Chifley combined. And
Hawke would only be 63. At that age
Menzies still had another nine years of
prime ministerial office ahead of him.
For Hawkophiles it’s a wonderful
prospect. But it would have its costs.
One is the dreadful boredom and waste
of unending years of rule by someone
whose primary interest is staying in
power. The 50s and 60s were felt to be
over-cautious, unadventurous, dull.
That had more than something to do
with the style of political leadership.
The other cost would be the
emasculation of the Labor Party. The
present government has shown itself
surprisingly indifferent to Labor’s
traditional role as the champion of the
underdog, and not much interested in
forward planning, another charac-
teristic pre-occupation of the ALP.
If that continues and Labor grows
steadily more convinced that the middle
is the right place to be, it’s hard to see
what the genuinely disadvantaged
groups in our society will do. Perhaps
we will see, for the first time in
Australian history, the emergence of a
relatively popular socialist party, and
something that looks like a multi-party
system.
But of course, that’s for the future. In
the meantime we have the Hawke
circus, and the likelihood that on
December 1 Hawke will achieve a
victory in its own way as impressive as
that of his good friend over the water,
Ronald Reagan. □


CANBERRA
Local strife
worries Labor
in the capital
ALP candidate for Fraser, John Langmore (left) and member for Canberra Ros Kelly: self-government threat to majorities
By BRUCE JUDDERY
THE STORMCLOUD of self-govern-
ment looms over the Labor Party’s
campaign to retain its two House of
Representatives seats and one Senate
place in the Australian Capital Terri-
tory.
The secretary of caucus, Ros Kelly,
will not lose her seat of Canberra, south
of Lake Burley Griffin, Ralph Willis
aide John Langmore will pick up the
even more devoutly Labor northside
seat of Fraser and Minister for Educa-
tion and Youth Affairs, Susan Ryan, will
be returned to the Senate despite grow-
ing agitation against her by the ACT
Teachers’ Federation and local academ-
ics. But there is a growing fear that all
three will have their majorities dented
by what is likely to prove the most
divisive political issue in the national
capital’s history — a move to territorial
self-management that Labor backs but
which was rejected, two-to-one, at a
1978 referendum;
At the heart of the issue is whether
Canberra’s residents will be required to
pay more for their city’s admittedly high
level of amenities or — the likelier bet,
according to the smart money — accept
lower standards in the event of self-
government.
Perhaps as important is how the
administration of the proposed city-
state would be ordered and whether
public servants (and police) would con-
tinue to enjoy present conditions and
rights to move between “local” and
“national” departments.
ALP election canvassers have been
counselled to play the issue coolly, to
point out that no decisions will be made
for many months and that the financial
implications — despite the completion
in July of a Commonwealth Grants
Commission study of ACT financing —
have yet to be clarified.
Kelly, whose campaigning was in-
terrupted only briefly by the birth of her
second child in early November, has
adopted a shrewd ploy that no one
doubts could add years to the gestation
of self-government: she demands that
the bits and pieces of more than a dozen
departments with a hand in Canberra’s
management be merged into one dis-
crete administration before further steps
are taken to turn the local House of
Assembly into a real parliament, with its
own executive.
Labor’s discomfort at the high profile
of the “Referendum First” lobby which
claims more than 20,000 signatures to a
petition to that end (which means “no
self-government”) and which is fielding
a team for the Senate (although the
Liberals already have embraced the
referendum message) is ironic, given the
origins of the original impetus behind
the ALP’s drive for self-government.
In 1975, Labor Attorney-General
(and, earlier, Minister for the Capital
Territory) Kep (now Mr Justice) En-
derby lost the hitherto solid seat of
Canberra in what was widely in-
terpreted as a backlash against the
Whitlam government’s management of
the city. (Enderby also was on the
receiving end of a bitter campaign by
local police incensed by his plans as


federal minister in charge of police for
amalgamating the local and com-
monwealth forces).
The solution which pleased both
the left who wanted a measure of local
power and the pragmatists who wanted
to keep the federal seats safe was to
press for self-government.
The Hawke government’s Minister
for Territories and Local Government,
Tom Uren, plunged into the evo-
lutionary process manfully. Arguably,
he put the cart before the horse when he
asked Albury-Wodonga Development
Corporation chairman Gordon Craig to
head a task force on self-government
which reported in May two months
before the Grants Commission inquiry,
set up by the Fraser government but
starved of resources.
The upshot has been procrastination.
Craig has recommended that the pre-
sent 18-member House of Assembly
(nine representatives elected by pro-
portional representation from each of
the two federal electorates in the ACT)
be replaced by a 15-member chamber of
five each from three electorates. This
predictably has met with approval from
the ALP and to a lesser extent from the
Liberals while infuriating the gaggle of
independent and special interests who
have done well and, with the Liberals,
control the house.
The Grants Commission proved
unable to state unequivocally whether
Canberra runs at a loss partly because
many departments cannot provide
breakdowns about the allocation of
their funds inside and outside the
capital. Unlike the states and Northern
Territory, Canberra receives no set per
capita grant from the commonwealth
only a “subvention” to balance its
books.
The commission did not tackle the
thorny question of the commonwealth’s
contribution to the maintenance of
facilities for its own use. Much of the
most desirable office and industrial
space in the city area is occupied by the
commonwealth itself, which pays no
rates or payroll taxes.
It has been argued locally that its
avoidance of rates on, say, the Com-
monwealth Centre and GPO in Sydney
amounts to an anomaly; to pay nothing
for the Australian Mint, Canberra’s
largest factory, and the many office
blocks it owns in the capital amounts to
an iniquity.
In talks with local unions, Craig has
outlined a much slower approach to
introduction of self-government than
earlier envisaged. His task force is
trying to sort out the financial mess and
to prepare a white paper on im-
plementation by May 1985. Cabinet is
supposed at mid-year to make a deci-
sion on the form self-government will
take.
The 1985 federal budget is supposed
for the first time to identify all expendi-
tures in the ACT as local, territorial and
national.
Even that slower timetable, however,
is unlikely to be met. The NSW right
and other party factions are less than
enchanted by the prospect of the ACT’s
left-wing ALP branch dictating policy
to a local administration assuming
that the ALP managed to win a majority
in a remade House of Assembly.
The national capital almost certainly
would be designated a nuclear-free zone
as a first step, in terms unpalatable to
the government’s diplomacy.
Nor has Henry Lawrence, the hard-
left ACT delegate to the ALP’s national
executive, won himself any friends
among the majority on that body with
strident criticism of the Prime Minister
and government policies.
Self-government is likely to remain a
twinkle in the local party’s eye until it
adopts a stance more suited to the
ALP’s national power-brokers. □

SPORT
A raucous circus for the city of piety
By ALAN KENNEDY
A ROUND of the Formula One grand
prix championship will be run through
the streets of Adelaide on October 13
next year. The city will never be the
same again.
It is an historic event for the whole
country and a coup for South Aust-
ralian Premier John Bannon who has
worked for many months to make it
happen. But do Bannon and Adelaide’s
city fathers know what they are letting
themselves in for?
Of course, the Formula One “freaks”
are delighted, but the people whose lives
are to be interrupted by the week-long
practice sessions and then race day may
have other ideas.
Bannon has said that disruption to
the city will be minimal but some roads
will be closed and the noise will surprise
many.
Few Australians have been
closer to a grand prix than the
Nine network telecasts from
around the globe and these
insulate you from the noise,
speed of the cars and the
circus which surrounds such
an event.
Australia has been trying
for years to host a world
championship round and
Melbourne’s Sandown Race-
way, which has just spent
millions of dollars upgrading
facilities to satisfy the
Formula One Constructors
Association (ruled by the
enigmatic and idiosyncratic
Bernie Ecclestone), can feel
justly miffed at having missed
out.
Logic would suggest that
Formula One cars, incredibly
powerful and twitchy beasts,
should be confined to a pro-
perly constructed circuit. But
Ecclestone is known to favor
street circuits and this no
doubt swayed the decision.
It is a tribute to Bannon
that he made his way through
the association’s maze to
snare a grand prix. That
body’s power was illustrated
this year when the 1985
Formula One calendar came
out and Monaco was not on
it. For the Formula One en-
thusiast, Monaco is one of the
year’s set pieces one of the
last street-racing circuits,
around the picturesque casinos, hotels
and waterfront. But a dispute had flared
over television rights and the associa-
tion said no Monaco.
Formula One is big business and the
association did not allocate Adelaide a
date until satisfied that sponsorship had
been tied up. The reputed “few million”
which the Nine network paid for televi-
sion rights would have helped. As a
television event, Formula One racing is
just behind the Olympics, soccer’s
World Cup and last two days of
Wimbledon tennis in viewing audi-
ences. These figures take on a different
perspective when you consider that
there are some 16 races every year as
opposed to four-yearly intervals for the
Olympics and World Cup and annual
Wimbledon.
A grand prix racer in full cry at Monaco
JEFF HUTCHINSON/MODERN MOTOR
But if Bannon is expecting such an
audience to be watching the grand prix,
with Adelaide in all its glory as the
backdrop, he could be disappointed. An
association official said in Germany last
month that the event was highly un-
likely to be telecast live to Europe. It
would be coming through in the wee
small hours and television unions there
did not do late shifts. He said that
highlights probably would go to air at a
more civilised hour later in the day.
For the city of churches, Sunday
October 13 is not going to be a time for
quietly communing with God. A warm-
up starts around 11 am for sorting out
the cars just about the time that
Adelaide’s faithful will be heading for
matins. The noise these cars put out is
often above the threshold of pain and
you quickly learn that the
designer earplugs hanging
around the necks of spectators
are not merely a pose.
Bannon may well be
wondering by 5 pm about the
vote-catching ability of grand
prix racing and about his
agreement with the associa-
tion, which commits him to at
least another two years.
Strangely, for a country
which has produced two
Formula One champions and
other competitive drivers,
open-wheel racing is not our
premier form of motor sport.
That is left to the Com-
modores, Fords and Mazdas
which have their annual ritual
at the James Hardie 1000 at
Bathurst. In Europe, this type
of racing is decidedly small
time. That is not to say that
Australian drivers such as
Peter Brock, Dick Johnson
and Allan Moffat would be
out of their depth in Formula
One. They, naturally, have
chosen the sport where the
sponsorship is. It is with
Formula One in Europe and
the heroes are the drivers.
The huge television audi-
ence explains why sponsors
are so eager to have their
names on the side of a car.
The cigarette companies, such
as Marlboro (McLaren team)
and John Player (Lotus) see it
as an ideal medium.
The cars run without their


The Adelaide grand prix circuit which will allow speeds higher than other city circuits permit
sponsors’ names in Germany where
cigarette advertising is banned, their
transporters have cigarette logos
removed and even the mechanics have
logos taped over. But Marlboro’s red
and white and the black and gold of
John Player are so distinctive that the
message still gets across.
The Formula One circus will arrive
in Adelaide in the week before October
13. It is a strange mixture. The McLaren
team current world champions with
Niki Lauda and Alain Prost driving
and other top teams including Ferrari,
Williams and Lotus spend up to $5
million a year to win. The drivers can
earn about $1 million each just for
driving and then come sponsorship
deals, endorsements and personal ap-
pearances. The Formula One driver has
a following similar to that of a pop star.
His comings, goings and love affairs are
reported avidly in Europe’s news-
papers. The top ones are cosseted. Some
have personal chefs.
When not driving, the stars are rarely
seen about the circuit. They seek the
peace and quiet of the team trailer or
tent while the army of mechanics tweaks
the cars and gets them running sweetly.
For Adelaide the teams will fly in
their giant pantechnicons which carry
cars, parts and tyres. The entourage of
beautiful and not-so-beautiful camp fol-
lowers also will be on hand to add to the
chaotic mixture.
At the other end of the scale are the
new drivers. For a new boy to pay for
the privilege of a drive is not unheard of
but the rookies usually receive a small
stipend. The reward comes when
someone notices them and signs them
up for one of the big teams.
All the drivers have one thing in
common, however their size. The
modern car has a tiny cockpit and our
most recent Formula One champion,
Alan Jones, reportedly had to diet in
order to fit into it. The bantam drivers
look ill-suited to the cars which are
temperamental, do not suffer fools glad-
ly and can be very dangerous. Once you
see them suited up and in their cars,
however, your admiration grows.
Germany’s Nurburgring circuit
turned on its traditional wet, cold and
foggy weather for the European Grand
Prix last October. Watching these men
drive at speeds up to 300km/h in
marginal visibility, one could readily
appreciate why they earn the money
they do.
Formula One regulations make the
America’s Cup racing look like a picnic
but this does not deter teams who
devote much time to trying to cir-
cumvent the rules. The Tyrrell team was
caught this year for an infringement
regarding engine specifications and was
barred from the remainder of the year’s
racing.
The rules govern engine size, fuel-
tank capacities, body weight and body
design. Many of the regulations are
aimed at slowing down the cars.
Ground-effect cars were all the rage
some years ago. These effectively were
designed in such a way as to form a
vacuum under the vehicle and “stick” it
to the road. The cornering speeds
became frighteningly quick and the G
forces on the driver were approaching
astronaut levels. And ground effect did
not mean that you could corner at any
speed you liked. In the end, the car
would let go and the speed was such as
to ensure a sickening accident in that
event. The ground effect went but the
cars still go very quickly. On some
circuits, corners have been tightened to
slow the cars down.
To satisfy the understandably safety-
conscious drivers, Adelaide will have to
upgrade roads and put in adequate run-
off areas for the track which in-
corporates city streets and some of
Victoria Park racecourse. The city will
have to build temporary pit areas and
put up a grandstand capable of holding
about 50,000 people.
Bannon envisages the venture bring-
ing in some $lO million in tourist
dollars (motel accommodation is filling
fast) and putting Adelaide on the map
internationally.
What God thinks of having His
Sunday, in Australia’s most pious city,
disrupted in such a way is not known.

SPECIAL REPORT
For Ethiopia, it is too little too late
The face of famine: children are dying while food is banking up in congested ports
Belatedly, some of the mountains of food in the Western world are being sent to Ethiopia.
But, as TESS LA WRENCE reports, for thousands upon thousands, it has come too late.
I SAW THE child just lying there,
dying. It’s head had fallen back off its
mother’s arm, like a distended spring. I
thought the head was limp through
weakness. Later I learned that the heads
of starving children grow big and heavy,
out of proportion to the rest of the body,
and cannot be supported by the neck or
shoulder tissues. If you try to straighten
the head, it simply lolls aimlessly.
The child’s mouth was open in readi-
ness of death, to give its last breath free
passage. Around the mouth was the
death elixir of pus and foam. The flies
fed busily on this indecent banquet,
trafficking from mouth to throat, throat
to mouth.
The eyes, too, were open in the
readiness of death, alarmingly clear
unblinking. Even when the flies
wandered over them, drinking, the child
did not flinch.
The tiny body was inert. It looked
like Spielberg’s creation ET, only it was
The Addis Ababa Hilton swimming pool: a luxurious retreat for the media corps


a creation of our own world. Like ET’s,
the swollen head was wrinkled and old.
The hands were large, with accusatory
fingers that slowly clawed the air, grasp-
ing for a mother’s breast that had long
since ceased to give milk.
The child’s backbone was a rude
serration that protruded like deformed
teeth out of its back. Its torso and limbs
were skeletal. There was no muscle
tissue. Under the buttocks, the skin
puckered, like oversized cushion covers.
The skin had simply become a thin
carry-bag in which was gathered a
handful of brittle bones.
The child’s mother was in a state of
shock, a sort of paralysed despair.
Somewhere in her dehydrated body,
enough moisture came for the tears. She
rocked to and fro, already in mourning
for the fourth of her children to die
within the past 18 months. She was
bleeding from within. She felt, she said,
like a messenger of death, bringing her
children into the world, simply to throw
them into the grave. Why? she asked.
Why?
For a long time I could not speak. I
thought of our supermarket shelves and
the neatly sealed cans of pet food and
all the effort that went into their market-
ing. I thought of my rubbish bin and the
surplus of rotting food it so often
contained. I thought of all my pithy
indulgences and the bottle of Chanel
No 5 lodged between my notebooks and
cameras.
The mother tapped my arm and
turned her baby over. From his anus
was a protrusion, of what I first thought
were worms, but it was part of his large
intestine and the perforations and ulcers
were evident even to my unskilled eyes.
There was blood on the rags in which he
was swaddled.
The child must have been in
unspeakable pain. He made a cackling
noise, trying to cry. His chest started to
quiver. His rib cage was so hollow you
could have slipped your hand under it
and used it as a handle to carry the
child. The mother made a sign to me,
motioning that the intestines had come
from the child’s stomach. She begged
me to push them back inside her baby
and grabbed both my hands, my
notebook falling to the ground.
I told her I was not a doctor, but that
I would try to find one. But I knew she
was squatting beyond the barbed wire
fence that surrounded the feeding
centre and that those beyond the barbed
wire fence got no food and rarely any
medical assistance. The decision had
already been made, that these were the
ones to die.
The child started clawing the air
again. He was faced downwards on his
mother’s knee. Suddenly he stilled, his
arms outstretched. His mother turned
him over, quickly. Still his hands were

raised. His fists clenched, like those of a
little champion in a victory salute. He
was dead.
The mother let out a disconsolate
wail, throwing her mouth on her baby’s.
It too became ringed with the pus and
foam. She screamed and called on God
to identify himself. The sacrifice, she
said, was too great a price. He must
know that. She punched at her breasts,
cursing them for failing her. Failing her
baby. She would die, now she said. She
would die with her son. Don’t wait for
me to die, she said. Bury me now she
said, while she was alive, for she was
already dead in her heart. Some
tribeswomen came and led her away.
She would not give up her baby. Not
yet.
Days later, back in Addis Ababa, the
horrors of the Korem feeding centre in
Ethiopia haunt one still.
The Addis Ababa Hilton has become
a luxurious bunker for another kind of
refugee in the war against starvation in
Ethiopia. This is where representatives
of the press, the civilian relief organisa-
tions (known as NGOs), governments,
and all the other groupies of The Great
Famine gather. Some are there to spy,
some to exchange information, some to
do both; others to wave their country’s
philanthropic flag.
It must be the only Hilton Hotel on
earth that squats under a neon sign
proclaiming “Peace, Friendship, Sol-
idarity.” The tepid Marxist government
of Comrade Mengistu, that pays tip
service to Moscow, is a dab hand when
it comes to collecting the capitalist’s
dollar.
Only government-run taxis all
Mercedes are allowed to transport
you to and from the hotel, at exorbitant
fixed prices. The documented bookings
also give a convenient record of the
guest’s whereabouts and appointments.
From the hotel windows, you look
down on the turquoise glory of the
natural hot springs pool. You have only
to turn your head slightly to see some of
the city’s many slums. Their “hot
spring” is the foul-smelling water-
effluent that winds through this com-
pound of misery.
The homes are an ill-fitting jigsaw of
corrugated iron, cardboard, sacking,
weed and mud. But the children smile.
They live in luxury compared with their
cousins in centres such as Korem, Batin
Alamata.
In the sky, one of the heavyweight
Russian Antonov 22 transports cruises

MlB helicopter, capable of lifting 1.5
tonnes. The USSR had pledged another

The Soviet Union had virtually been
politically shamed out of its inertia and
reluctance to help Ethiopia. The in-

publicity proved too embarrassing for
the USSR. Too many people, including
the locals, wanted to know why they
weren’t pitching in. Hitherto Big
Brother couldn’t be bothered. Anything
other than military aid isn’t really
Russia’s bag.
They were hesitant philanthropists.
Especially since Comrade Mengistu
and his junta already owe the Kremlin a
reputed SUS 3 billion. It is no secret that
the Antonov’s have also been offloading
armaments as well as aid. Mengistu’s
government has hardly endeared itself
to the people. All around Addis Ababa
huge unsmiling portraits of the leader
overlook them. So, too, do portraits of
Marx, Engels and Lenin, and while
some of the city people know who they
are those in the rural areas wouldn’t
have a clue.
Ethiopia forks out about $500,000 a
day trying to subdue the various guerilla
forces that chew away at its boundaries.
There is the 23-year-old Eritrean War,
and south of Eritrea, the Tigre Province
has spawned the Tigrean People’s Lib-
eration Front. The West Somali Liber-
ation Front is fighting Ethiopia for
control of the Ogaden region, so
Ethiopia has its holsters full.
The guerillas hit short, and
sometimes sharp and more often than
acknowledged. The wounds are not
deep enough as yet, to wound the
Ethiopian lion but are enough to
infect its paw.
As well as the famine victims who
swarm in their thousands to the govern-
ment feeding stations, there are the
political refugees from these troubled
areas. Both the government and the
United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees have implemented schemes
for voluntary repatriation and are
working against the odds to depoliticise
the issue.
It is impossible accurately to es-
timate the numbers who have died from
the famine. Feeding centres and relief
organisations have been trying to keep a
count and it is estimated that by
Christmas, one million Ethiopians will
have died. But there is no way of
knowing those who have died in the
inaccessible regions. Many of the tiny
villages have become tombs for those
too sick and too weak to leave to seek
food.
Even their corpses may never be
found. Some of the Ethiopian terrain is
extraordinarily mountainous, and there
are no roads, just foot paths that often
meander over hill and valley for hun-
dreds of kilometres. Sometimes, the
mentally retarded and the infirmed are
the only occupants of these villages.
They wait for death, sitting in their
thatched huts.
One of the saddest aspects of the
famine is the plight of the elderly and

A doctor weighs a young famine victim: for many there is no choice but death
old who already have survived other
catastrophes. Their extraordinary life
force fuels them for enormous dist-
ances. Sometimes it takes them months,
hobbling along at snail’s pace. When
they finally make it to the camps, hardly
any of them will be fed. The young must
be fed first. And there is the attitude that
the old ones have lived their life and
should concede to youth. You see
hordes of them, sometimes blinded,
emaciated and crippled, covered in
scabies and other skin diseases, leaning
on sticks, often pressing up against
barbed wire barriers. The old ones say
they have never experienced anything
so bad.
Flying over some regions of Ethiopia
you would be forgiven for mistaking it
for the land of plenty. In some regions,
there appear to be hectares of green,
lush crops. But the sight is cruelly
deceptive. The crops have failed to
reach maturity and some of it is not
even good enough for animal fodder.
Once on the ground, you can see the
crops are actually seared by the sun.
Little wonder, the nickname, “The
Green Famine.”
At dinner at the Addis Ababa Hilton,
journalists and relief workers gather to
discuss the madness and heartbreak of
the day. The journalists flex their pro-
fessional muscle and compare battle
scars, mouth off, and reminisce about
the Lebanon, Kampuchea and now,
Ethiopia. There is much of the “Our
Man in Africa” bravado usually from
the types incapacitated by a mosquito
bite.
The media onslaught brought out the
best and the worst of journalism. There
were reports of vile and cruel behaviour
when filming journalists shoving
microphones and cameras into the faces
of the grieving in an effort to capture the
last dying breath.
I heard of one film crew who stopped
their jeep to cook food in front of the
hungry in order to solicit more pathos
on their faces. There were reports of
fights, of misdirecting despatched video
film on planes. One cameraman asked a
mother whose child had just died to lift
up the child for the camera, as if it were
a skinned rabbit. On several of our
journeys into the affected areas, some
journalists complained about the
standard of food and accommodation
which was, in all honesty better than


what you could expect to find in any of
our bush towns. Food and accommoda-
tion for us was hardly a priority. Nor
should it have been.
Then there were a couple of televi-
sion newswomen who looked as if they
were Boston debutantes fronting En-
tertainment Tonight. Complete with
high heels, groaning under gold
jewellery and awash with lip gloss, they
positioned themselves in front of the
starving multitudes and proceeded to
mew on about the nasty drought and
how people were dying even as they
spoke.
Teetering on their stilettos, they
bravely faced the flies and dust, bring-
ing outback Ethiopia into the living
room of Middle America. I don’t know
what Middle America thinks of
Ethiopia but one can only wonder at
what the famine victims thought of the
tribal habits of American television
women on location. It might have been
a laugh on another day.
Where you find the journalists, you
find the relief workers, whose briefing is
essential and their information more
reliable than government sources. They
face enormous structural and political
difficulties, treading a fine line wherever
they go.
They are anguished rather than
angered by reports that food is banking
up in the ports and not getting to the
hungry. The famine, as a news story, has
a limited life span, and everyone is
fearful of any detrimental news that
might deter people from helping. They
fear that the Western world will get
bored with pictures of starving babies,
and that there will be a drought of
compassion. More than 26 organisa-
tions are working together, though from
time to time, one detects territorial
jealousies.
Some of the relief workers help
journalists to get to the feeding stations
and this has been frowned on by the
government; in part because it wants to
get the on-camera credit. Journalists are
not supposed to go anywhere without a
representative from the Ethiopian
government’s Relief and Rehabilitation
Commission.
The famine is not confined solely to
Ethiopia. Africa generally has been
ravaged by drought and crop disease
exacerbating economic and social ills.
Ethiopia is the worst hit so far. Chad
looks like becoming the next crisis
point. Despite all the talk of food being
delivered, the amount pledged still falls
530,000 tonnes short of what is actually
needed to feed the starving. The need
for better transport is crucial. If the
world does get bored with Ethiopia and
fails to continue to provide food and
funds until at least May, then all will be
lost. The dead will simply be replaced
by the dying. □

An idealist sets out
to marry theatre to society
James McCaughey, with a family name woven into the fabric of Melbourne life, is
moving from the halls of academe into direction of the city’s Playbox Theatre with
a mission to cement its relevance to the community. SUSAN MOLLOY reports.
McCAUGHEY is becoming a most
noteworthy surname in Melbourne. The
recent announcement of a new manage-
ment structure at the city’s Playbox
Theatre to replace founding executive
director Carrillo Gantner brought out
yet another McCaughey. This one is
James, an exuberant idealist who is
throwing off the mantle of senior lec-
turer in Drama at Deakin University to
be joint executive director of the
Playbox Theatre Company.
Patrick, a younger brother, is
director of the National Gallery of
Victoria. With his bow ties, sharp suits
and amiable stutter, Patrick Mc-
Caughey is almost a Melbourne institu-
tion. His wife, Winsome, is a city
councillor. Another brother, John, is a
composer and conductor working in
West Germany.
McCaughey senior moved to
Australia in 1953 from Belfast and
London to be professor of New Testa-
ment Studies at Ormond College which
teaches intending ministers of the Pres-
byterian church. He is now deputy
chancellor of the University of
Melbourne where his wife works on
studies on poverty.
And James McCaughey’s wife, Ellen,
has just published her history of the
Victoria Market.
On one bright day recently, James
sweltered at the markets helping her
launch the book and becoming hot and
red as only the Celts can do. Then he
and Gantner (who is off to China next
year as cultural attache to Beijing) went
traipsing round the city looking at
possible sites for a permanent home for
the Playbox.
The company refused to collapse
after its premises were burned down,
probably by arsonists, last February but
it has yet to find another headquarters.
There will be a mere four-play season in
the first half of next year while the new
management (McCaughey and Jill
Smith as exectutive directors and Rex
Cramphorn with McCaughey as artistic
directors) settles in and sets up a new
theatre.
Playbox executives Jill Smith and Rex Cramphorn
“I have always been interested in
directing,” says McCaughey, 43, “but
even five or 10 years ago I did not know
what I wanted to do. Now I do know
what I want to do: to draw the actors
and writers and society into a fruitful
connection. That sounds pretty blah but
I do mean it. Theatre should be very
physical, very funny, but it should relate
very seriously to people’s lives.
“The dream would be a theatre as
exciting as a circus and as grave as life.
“Yes, I am an idealist; yes, I think I
am. If one is not motivated by certain
dreams, you cannot survive in theatre.”
For the past six years, McCaughey
also has been director of the Mill
Theatre in Geelong. It has been a
successful community theatre worked
along co-operative lines. While the
Playbox has been almost synonymous
with Gantner, the Mill was an exercise
in minimal leadership and maximum
collaboration. McCaughey is pleased
that it will carry on without him. “It
makes me cross when people ask me
what is going to happen when I’m not
there, because it is inferring a form of
leadership which we are not into,” he
says. “We are not technically a co-
operative in the way Circus Oz legally
is. With the Playbox, I hope for a
continuing of the co-operative im-
pulse.”
This could be difficult. Playbox is big
business, vying with the 31 -year-old
Melbourne Theatre Company and the
more recent innovations from Anthill


James McCaughey: the Playbox “must become a cradle of invention”
and The Church theatres for a slice of
the arts budget. Shell is the biggest
sponsor but the Playbox relies on 60
percent of its annual $1 million budget
coming from the box office.
James McCaughey was born in
Belfast and spent his early years in
London. He went to Scotch College
when the family emigrated. At
Melbourne University, he studied Latin
and Greek.
Back in Britain, at Cambridge, he
studied theology - “I was just in-
terested in it” and in Dublin later
studied Greek literature. He lived some
years in America, teaching the classics
at Princeton University and then Greek
at exclusive Bryn Mawr college in
Pennsylvania.
Theatre came late to him. He says
that interest arose from so much immer-
sion in the teaching of Greek tragedy.
“When I returned to Australia, in
1969, I found for the first time real
Australian theatre. All Melbourne was
going whoosh, like that. Even in my
second year teaching at Melbourne
University, every single drama group
decided to do an Australian play. So
here was this sense of theatre connect-
ing to society in a way I had not
experienced in Australia and there was
this exuberant new form of acting.”
Deakin University opened seven
years ago and the performing arts were
a major part of the curriculum. He
accepted the position of senior lecturer
in Drama Studies.
He did so, he says, because the
university had leased “this fantastic
space in an old woollen mill, just a
beautiful space. I felt here was a space
where we could set up a professional
theatre company.
“I realised I could go on directing
plays in Carlton forever, aiming at the
converted. In my bleak nights, I could
see myself and the audience and the
audience was everyone I knew.
“I had no interest in being part of a
minority art form. And suddenly here
was Deakin and here was this space in
Geelong.
“It is a complex city. It has a strong
tradition of amateur theatre but it had
never had a professional one till the
Mill Theatre. For the next seven years,
we developed a performing arts pro-
gram which was asking, ‘What are the
uses of theatre in a society like
Geelong?’ ”
He plans to pose a similar question
in Melbourne when he starts working
officially for Playbox next year.
He has some other questions: “How
can an actor play a really central role in
the development of theatre? What is the
relationship between a writer and the
actor when it comes to developing a
script?
“What is the relationship between
theatre and the surrounding society?
How can theatre draw its sap from the
society of which it is a part?” And there
is the question of women in theatre.
“There has developed such solid
work in the last 10 years and only
intermittently have the results been ap-
parent to the public.
“Some of that has come from the best
work of community theatres from the
best work of Circus Oz, in the Playbox’s
best moments.
“Experimental work is banished to
obscurity and one of the reasons is
because our newspapers or our jour-
nals do not review it. Why? One of
the things I would like to do in
Melbourne is be supportive of all
theatre. There is room for mutual
support.
“I actually believe it (the backbiting
within the Melbourne arts world) will
improve.” Now, that A being idealistic.
As McCaughey puts it, the Playbox
Theatre “must become a cradle of in-
vention, for actors to develop new


styles, new ways of performing. And
writers should be drawn into working
with performers so that writing and
acting are not separate activities.
“Playbox plays should relate to the
life of Melbourne. In the age of film and
television, theatre can take special
issues from special localities and draw
the people who come from that locality
or who have that experience. I want to
see the Playbox as the theatrical centre
of Melbourne.” □
ART
The mystery
of Dali’s
millions
By MARTIN BAILEY
SALVADOR DALI and his sister
Anna-Maria had a dramatic meeting at
his hospital bedside recently. Although
they have always lived less than a mile
apart in the fishing port of Cadaques, it
was 35 years since they had last met.
Anna-Maria, aged 77, said that she
made the surprise visit to the Barcelona
hospital in order to reach a reconcilia-
tion before they both died. But when she
entered Salvador’s room, he remained
completely silent. After a moment, Dali,
aged 80 and suffering from severe burns,
made feeble efforts to rise from his bed
to physically eject her.
Dali’s aides said that the painter
assumed that his sister was after only
one thing his wealth. This is probably
an unfair judgment on Anna-Maria, but
the row was symptomatic of the par-
anoia that now surrounds the dying
artist.
Dali’s personal collection of his own
art is worth an estimated $54 million.
His will has not been published, and no
one knows for sure who will inherit this
surrealist treasure trove.
Suspicions have increased during the
past few years because the artist has
been so isolated from his old friends.
Since the death of his wife, Gala, two
years ago, he has gone into total seclu-
sion in his medieval castle in Pubol. It
was here that the severely emaciated
artist was badly injured in a fire that
destroyed his four-poster bed early in
the morning of August 30.
Since Dali’s retreat to Pubol, his life
has been managed and controlled by
three men: Robert Descharnes, a
French art critic; Miguel Domenech, a
Madrid lawyer; and Antonio Pichot, a
Cadaques painter. They have prevented
Salvador Dali’s Persistence of Memory
anyone from reaching him.
Anna-Maria has publicly criticised
the three, asking why her brother was
not rescued more quickly from the fire
by his round-the-clock nursing staff.
And she has asked why he did not reach
hospital until 40 hours after the ac-
cident. Her complaints of negligence
are now being examined by the
authorities.
There are no obvious claimants to
Dali’s heritage. Dali and Gala had no
children, the painter has no brothers
and Anna-Maria is his only sister.
Domenech told me that “all his per-
sonal collection will go to the people of
Spain.”
Originally worth $BO million, his
hoard has been divided into three parts.
Ten years ago Dali gave the first, $6.5
million worth of pictures, prints,
drawings and objects, to the town of
Figueras, his birthplace. A museum was
established in the ruins of the burnt-out
municipal theatre and it has now
become a major tourist attraction on the
Costa Brava.
Earlier this year, when Dali’s health
was deteriorating, he gave the second
part, a further $2O million worth of his
collection, to the newly established
Gala-Salvador Dali Foundation which
he set up to preserve and exhibit his
work.
But this still leaves Dali with the
most valuable part of his collection,
worth more than $5O million. It is
possible that some of these items may be
given to Dali’s close friends before he
dies. Even if the collection remains
intact until his death, it is still
undecided whether the works given to
the Spanish people should be exhibited
in Dali’s native Catalonia or in the
capital, Madrid.
Both of Dali’s homes will probably
be converted into museums. At Port
Lligat, a hamlet on the outskirts of
Cadaques, he and Gala bought a fisher-
man’s hut 50 years ago which they
gradually extended into a house on the
edge of the bay.
The medieval castle of Pubol, 50 km
away, was bought by Dali as a present
for Gala. Very few visitors have entered
the fortress, but it contains a beautiful
ceiling fresco by Dali in the main hall
and several intriguing trompe I’oeil
doors.
The $5O million part of Dali’s per-
sonal collection still in his own hands
contains the most controversial part of
his legacy, his recent paintings. Robert
Descharnes said that the artist produced
no less than 92 pictures between July
1981 and April 1983 an average of
one a week. This compares with an
average of one a month during the
previous 60 years.
This productive output is surprising
in view of Dali’s deteriorating health.
By 1980 he had already fallen into a
depression and the few visitors who
have seen him in recent years have
reported that his hands have been very
shaky.
It is also curious that the few recent
pictures which have been exhibited dis-
play a wide range of styles, some of
them totally unlike the rest of Dali’s
work.
Descharnes admits that Dali was
helped on many of these paintings by
his assistant, Isidoro Bea, a Barcelona
artist. “They are still true works by
Dali,” he says. But other critics believe
that Dali may have done little more
than come up with an idea, apply a few
brush strokes and, finally, add the most
valuable touch his signature.


Art dealers now report a spate of
paintings and prints which have been
nowhere near Dali’s studio. Reynolds
Morse, who set up his own Dali
museum in Florida, claims that his staff
are shown “at least 10 Dali fakes a
week.”
The rise in prices which normally
follows an artist’s death and the diffi-
culties in proving that works are
genuine are likely to create even more
controversy over what happens to Dali’s
estate.
A few weeks ago, Dali’s doctors
pronounced him well enough to leave
hospital. But he is near to death and will
never paint again. □

Finish of the big race in Coolangatta Gold: Rocky with surf, sun and sand
By SANDRA HALL
COINCIDENCE or not, the big
pictures backed by Hoyts and Michael
Edgley since they became partners in
1981 can be seen to constitute a house
style. The Man from Snowy River, Phar
Lap and the latest, The Coolangatta
Gold are all from the Rocky school of
dramatic conflict in which underdogs
battle against extraordinary odds and
show they can win.
They are also celebrations of
traditional Australia the bush, the
racecourse and the beach ... Not the
beach rituals of surfboards, Ajax
blondes and dropping out but the alto-
gether sterner stuff of surf patrols and
iron man races (none of which proved
quite stern enough for the producers of
The Coolangatta Gold who went so far
as to invent their own contest. The film’s
climax is a 43 kilometre swimming,
surfing, paddling marathon which since
has been appropriated by real life and
institutionalised in Queensland as the
Kellogg’s Nutri-Grain Coolangatta
Gold Tri-Aquathon a touch of com-
mercialism utterly in keeping with the
spirit of the film).
The tone is established with the
opening credits, which roll over a series
of intense-looking close-ups of Joss
McWilliam grunting and gasping his
way through a karate lesson while Bill
Conti’s score pounds out an assortment
of macho themes conjuring up visions
of everybody from Rocky to the
Marlboro Man. Then we move to the
beach where a surf race is filmed with
lashings of shimmering spray, copious
amounts of slow motion, more music
and the first appearances of *Nick Tate
who seems to be trying for apoplexy.
As a former surfer who has never
recovered from running second to
Grant Kenny’s dad in the iron man race
of 1960, he is determined that his son
Adam (Colin Friels) is going to take out
the race for him beating Grant,
(playing himself) in the process. This
obsession does not leave him much time
for his other son, Steve (McWilliam),
who is left brooding in the background.
But not for long.
The will to win asserts itself as we
knew it would and Steve decides that
he wants to be an iron man, too, much
to the distress of Robyn Nevin as
mother. Assigned the unrewarding job
of trying to heal the breach between
father and son, she has to utter lines
such as: “Don’t make your father come
second again. He doesn’t deserve that.”
Igor Auzins’ direction duplicates the
rhythms of the score by thumping down
a close-up to establish every sequence.
When they are not on the beach, father
and sons spend a lot of time taking out
their frustrations by hacking into
banana plants with the same viciousness
Sylvester Stallone applied to those meat
carcasses during his training sessions in
Rocky.
I don’t think anything is left out:
There’s some disco, some karate and
even a little ballet (Steve’s girlfriend is a


ballerina) and all is laid out
on the wide screen against
blue skies and Queensland
vistas with a relentless regard
for the power of hard sell that
makes everything else seem
behind the point.
IN TARTING UP Fritz
Lang’s Metropolis with tinted
film and a synthesised rock
sound track, Giorgio Moroder
has created a high camp arte-
fact that should be sealed in a
time capsule as a particularly
revealing example of cultural
hucksterism 1980 s style.
Assorted forms of
cultishness are catered for
here, with intriguingly disson-
ant results. “I think that is
what Lang would have done if
he could have, at the time,”
Moroder has announced of
his work with a brashness
calculated to enrage those
who take their film history
reverently. Yet, perhaps he is
right.
With a highly developed
taste for kitsch, he has gone to
work on a property eminently
suitable for treatment so that
this new motorised Metropolis
belts along on overdrive
occasionally rising to the
heights of hysteria which it
must have possessed origin-
ally.
The music is wildly inapt
but, since it divorces the
melodramatic excesses of the
silent acting from circumst-
ances appropriate for viewing “a
classic,” the performances take on a
ripe comic lustre and the audience is
quite rightly encouraged to laugh when
it feels like doing so.
Made in 1926, Metropolis combines
the decorative and architectural style of
the Bauhaus with a Teutonic high-
mindedness which seems to have in-
corporated a little of every philosophy
around at the time.
Lang’s vision of an industrialised
dictatorship living off the oppression of
its workers, who exist only as servants
of their machines, owes something to
Marxism but a lot more to German
expressionism’s fascination with exalted
allegories about the relationship be-
tween society and the individual. So
Metropolis’ ending has the forces of
capital and labor united by its hero, a
man who can see both sides of the
argument and thus can be thought of as
the heart bringing together the hand
and the mind.
Since this looks as stupid to the
modern eye as it sounds, there is no
need to think about it and Metropolis
Scene from The Woman in Red: mechanical and slightly smug
can be contemplated instead as a glitter-
ing storehouse of artistic effects which
has been plundered remorselessly by
every film-making fantasist in Holly-
wood. Spielberg, Lucas and Ridley
Scott are just three who have “paid
homage” to its design.
THE NEW Gene Wilder comedy, The
Woman in Red, is another nifty piece of
cultural cross-breeding an American
adaptation of a French hit so recent that
fans are still talking affectionately of its
best jokes.
Yves Robert’s Pardon Mon Affaire
was seen in Australia just six years ago
and Wilder has stuck so slavishly to its
most memorable set-pieces that the best
which can be said of his screenplay and
direction is that he deserves an A for
paying attention.
Even so, the story has lost a great
deal in translation and gained a few
features it does not need.
In place of Gallic confusion and a
tone of wry and rueful acceptance of the
consequences, we have American gar-
rulousness, a cloying, sit-com view of
family life and a faintly
moralistic finish. It is still a
well-made farce but no longer
a graceful one.
The story has been
transposed from Paris to San
Francisco where Wilder, an
advertising executive with two
daughters and an ever-smiling
doormat of a wife (Judith
Ivey) with whom he is per-
fectly happy, is suddenly
smitten with a lust for adven-
ture in the shape of a
statuesque model (Kelly Le
Brock).
The ensuing complications
hinge on the theme of sexual
temptation while never per-
mitting anybody to get into
bed long enough for anything
to happen.
Gilda Radner, as one of
Wilder’s co-workers, deluded
into thinking he is making a
pass at her, is used as the butt
of some standard “plain
woman” jokes. As in Pardon
Mon Affaire , sub-plots are
supplied by the hero’s best
friends Joe (Joe Bologna,
unfunny as a womanising
chauvinist); Buddy (Charles
Grodin giving the film’s sub-
tlest and most skilful perform-
ance as an urbane
homosexual); and Michael
(Michael Huddleston), whose
affair with a surgeon’s wife is
conducted during emergency
calls.
The practical jokes these
four perform notably the
“blind man” sequence in which Grodin,
with stick and dark glasses, runs amok
in a restaurant fail to be as funny as
they were with sub-titles and Wilder’s
studied air of incompetence and his
blank, blue-eyed gaze don’t add up to
an inspired comic performance.
There was something random and
anarchic about the original. In this
cross-bred form, it has become
mechanical and slightly smug. □

TELEVISION
Sport - what
the networks
do best
By RON SAW
I WOULD rather sit and watch paint
drying on a tall fence or even a small
fence than follow the average golf
match.
For the wretched, gaping spectators
who shamble in the wake of
their heroes I have not the
slightest ill will rather I
have pity. They would, I feel,
get more of a buzz following
old, tired dogs round the outer
suburbs, stopping to applaud
each time the beasts peed on
trees and lamp-posts.
That had been my attitude
to golf, the slack-jawed follow-
ing rather than playing of golf
until, quite by accident, I
found my TV set switched to
the ABC’s coverage of the
recent Australian Open I
beg your pardon: the
National Panasonic Austra-
lian Open.
Much more of this and the
ABC, to avoid confusion, will
have to change the name of its
new news and feature pro-
gram from The National to
The Sony or even The Subaru.
But I digress.
For the next three or five or
maybe nine hours, I sat
transfixed. How long has this
been going on? Aren’t people
howling asses for not having
forced me to watch TV golf?
The ABC or, more likely, Messrs
National Panasonic must have had a
dozen cameras following; so that, as
usual, I believe, you did not see only the
ups and downs of one particular group
of players. Instead, you switched from
tee to tee, fairway to green, seeing the
lot, learning what few if any of the
players could learn: who was beating
who and who was next, etc.
The tension on the last day, when
Tom Watson scraped home by one
stroke, was almost unbearable. But for
four days the average viewer had been
able to thrash his fancy along: Watson
or Norman, Stanton, Davis, Clayton,
Gale or Baker-Finch ....
And none of it would have been
possible had it not been for the brilliant
commentary of the ABC’s team, par-
ticularly Jack Newton and Peter
Thomson.
They had, mind you, the all-too-rare
attribute of knowing exactly what they
were talking about. Like Ray Warren
(10), Rex Mossop (7) and Lou Richards
(7) at football; Richie Benaud and Tony
Greig (9) at cricket; Johnny Tapp and
Ken Callander (9) at the gallops; Rob
Mundle (10) at yachting, they were able
not only to describe what was going on
but to tell you, usually with complete
accuracy, what was likely to happen.
It was yet another proof that, no
matter what may be the attitude of the
theatrical wankers, political pundits
and hot-shot general reporters, what
Australian TV does best is cover the
activities of, generically speaking, the
Tom Watson with a short iron at Royal Melbourne
PBL MARKETING
flannelled fools and muddied oafs.
Then there is tennis well ... there!
I knew there would be a place on TV for
the incontinent dogs.
THERE WAS a time, children, when
the commercial channels showed com-
mercials and the ABC being national
and paid for by clowns like you and me
showed none.
Then they, the ABC, began to run
promos for Coming Attractions. Then it
became a couple at a time: not a lot but
just enough to irritate the viewer, to
make him think about switching to a
commercial channel where the yap was
balanced by good programming.
Now, between ABC programs, we
get a couple of plugs, usually for shows
of astounding ordinariness that are
coming up a week hence, gasbagging
ads for the ABC shops, for magazines,
for boom-boom-boom the latest
bargains in frightful records.
If this is national TV, the national
televisers should be led out and shot
down like dogs not only because it is
indescribably irritating but also because
it is embarrassing to hear a trained,
plummy ABC voice trying to sound like
something on breakfast radio. And Mr
Myer, the boss, should be reminded that
his family business, flogging bargain
shirts, has nothing to do with selling
entertainment to a nation.
OLD BILL Collins must be worth a
fortune to Rupert Murdoch and the Ten
Network. For much more than a decade
he has been able to make the average
lousy-to-middling old movie
sound like something hot
from Laurence Olivier, Orson
Welles and Bo Derek.
The other night he in-
troduced two white-whiskery
old movies, Sun Valley Ser-
enade (1941, gawd!) and
Orchestra Wives (1942) with
the excuse that now all those
deprived people who did not
know how to buy tapes could
get all their favorite Glenn
Miller music PLUS Sonja
Henie, Lynn Bari, John Payne
and Jackie Gleason aged
about 18.
Better still: the night before
Collins had crashed into
neologism. Butch and Sun-
dance The Early Years, he
said owlishly, was not a sequel
but a PREQUEL.
THE POMS have the idea that
a good comedian is always
funny and the ABC goes
along with it, sycophantically.
It is bad enough that we
have those guffawing oafs in
Are You Being Served? but
now we have Paul Eddington, the cen-
tral figure of Yes, Minister, in Let There
be Love, in which he is supposed to be
an advertising man. It is about as funny
as a broken finger and, if that is not
canned laughter, they must have scour-
ed the British Isles for congenital idiots.
The answer is, of course, that humor
lies not so much in acting as in writing
and direction and the ABC should stop
buying rotten programs simply because
they’re British. Eddington would get
more laughs if he stood on a street
corner pushing beans up his nose. And
there is always a language difficulty.
For instance: a dog was said to have
“gone the best of three falls.” What it
means in Britain I don’t know but here
it is another term for having made the
beast with two backs. □


OPERA
Consensus
proves
magical
The Three Ladies and Tamino: the importance of minor roles was appreciated
By JOHN CARGHER
THE BATTLE of the sexes is a war of
pygmies compared with the battle of the
arts. You may categorise it as “competi-
tion” but the arts wars have given no
quarter, no prisoners were taken and if
the devil did not take the hindmost the
bankruptcy court did. How the Hawke-
style consensus crept into the arts is not
clear but Melbourne last week saw it
work in a way which should make him
green with envy.
The Victoria State Opera presented
Mozart’s The Magic Flute as its last
offering for 1984. It is easy to say that it
was very good, less easy to explain why
it was so. Details were not spelled out in
publicity or the printed program but, on
Mr Costigan’s balance of probabilities,
it probably worked this way:
The new Melbourne State Theatre
and its excellent acoustics were used
with superb effect for an opera which
was first produced in a wooden barn
smaller than the stage area at the VSO’s
disposal. (The myth that The Magic
Flute was first staged at the Theater an
der Wien appeared once more in the
program. That theatre was not built
until 10 years after Mozart’s death. It
was in the temporary Theater auf der
Wieden that one Emanuel Schikaneder
launched his nonsensical and dramatic-
ally inexplicable pantomime with the
superb music.)
Practically all of the Victorian State
Opera budget was used to enhance the
musical aspects of the performance. The
cast, down to the smallest part, was as
good as any seen in Australia. How
good it was can be gauged by the
Tamino, the admirable Robert Gard
in good, if not his best voice being its
weakest member. Perhaps “least strong”
says it better.
The orchestra under Richard Divall
played substantially better than the
Elizabethan Melbourne Orchestra often
does. Michael Geliot’s English transla-
tion was good and understandable and
producer Anthony Besch’s spoken
dialogue clear and concise, though it
avoided the slapstick of the original
however historically correct it may be.
Such overall excellence could not
normally have been achieved without
severe shortcomings on the production
side. Credit is given to “sets kindly
provided by The Australian Opera and
costumes owned and generously
provided by The Australian Opera and
the English National Opera.”
It is possible that some additions
were made by the VSO itself; some of
the drop curtains were new, while the
many animals appearing were not those
of the Australian Opera and appeared
too big to have been imported from
England. They blended with the sets
and the costumes to perfection and were
used intelligently by producer Besch.
What is important is that an in-
tegrated whole was created out of many
ingredients freely offered by many or-
ganisations. It is not essential that every
production must be an original cre-
ation. The designer of the AO Flute,
John Stoddard, was in overall charge
and saw to it that the various in-
gredients blended smoothly. It was a
pity that the tests of fire and water could
not have been replaced but that is of
minor consideration.
What must remain as a monument of
planning and co-ordination by Divall is
superb casting. The singers were so
good that it is difficult to know where to
start the chorus of praise. For the first
time in living memory Australia was
offered a genuine dramatic coloratura
as the Queen of the Night Margaret
Haggart, Melbourne-born and back in
the role which started her career in
England. Marilyn Richardson’s creamy
soprano has been heard in heavier parts
but, in a cast of big voices worthy of
Australia’s biggest theatre, she did not
lose the floating pianissimi which alone
can make Pamina such a touching
character. Gregory Dempsey’s Mono-
statos was as good as or better than any
to be found overseas and the sounds
produced by the Three Ladies
(Christine Ferraro, Suzanne Johnston
and Irene Waugh) were reminders that
these minor but important parts have
been sung overseas by the likes of
Schwarzkopf and Lucia Popp.
John Wood’s Papageno suffered only
in that the producer downgraded the
comedy to a subsidiary function. His
Papageno and Rosemary Boyle’s
Papagena were vocally 100 percent.
Noel Mangin’s huge voice was not
perhaps as smooth as we have heard it
but his Sarastro was overpowering.
Even the smallest parts were cast from
strength: Graeme Wall as a Man in
Armor and lan Cousins as a Priest.
Lest over-enthusiasm give the im-
pression that the Victorian State Opera
is suddenly in the Salzburg class, let it
be said that Besch’s production was
serviceable rather than inspired and
that the modern mania for completeness
and “authenticity” created a few
longueurs not to be found in less well-
researched stagings of an opera which,
let us face it, is no masterpiece regard-
less of the sublime music.
The importance of this production
lies in the example it provides in these
days of tightening subsidies.
Compromises can be made to work
wonders if artists are willing to think
laterally.
A Gesamtkunstwerk is not
necessarily totally original. We treasure
great buildings cobbled together from
parts created centuries apart.
We don’t object to Rubens’ paintings
known to be largely the work of some of
his students.
What is wrong with a successful
blending of disparate components
which make up opera the most
expansive art form of all? □


Now Melbourne has the kind of hotel
youd only expect to find overseas.

Two of Melbourne's most
elegant Victorian buildings have
been stunningly transformed into
the kind of hotel you'd only expect to
find overseas.
Outside, it's classic Victorian.
Inside, it's completely modem.
Every room has all the facilities
you could want.
It is a hotel where every suite
is unique.
But the glass-roofed Portego
is the focal point of the hotel.
Here, amid lush greenery,
you can take a drink at the bar and
imagine yourself in another century
when horses clattered over cobble-
stones delivering their loads.
The Portego is also an ideal
place to meet friends or business
associates.
Although there are many fine
restaurants in Melbourne, you'll still
be surprised at the standard of The
Chandelier Room.
The atmosphere is perfect.
The staff attentive.
The menu exciting and original.
And the chef lives up to his
considerable reputation.
The standard of these facilities
alone is enough to justify Menzies
at Rialto's claim to being Australia's
most exciting new hotel.
But there's more.
It has several bars, a 24-hour
licensed cafe and a magnificent
Banquet Hall.
Menzies at Rialto is a brilliant
concept, brilliantly brought to life.

“The finest reward for our research:
happy, healthy children?
Scientists and advisers at Hoechst.
Today, doctors can defeat
many diseases that only a few
years ago were regarded as
incurable, e.g. tuberculosis,
diphtheria and typhoid fever.
Now we can also protect
our children from polio, small-
pox and tetanus. But while
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetics,
high blood pressure, cancer and
many other devastating diseases
remain unconquered there is
no room for complacency.
The quest for a cure must
not waver.
That is why Hoechst
scientists are dedicated to
eliminating these scourges of
mankind.
The cost of course is
considerable; Hoechst spent in
1982 alone the equivalent of
A 5624 million on research.
Our efforts however are
being rewarded. One significant
example is a new vaccine
against various meningitis
pathogens with which doctors
are saving the lives of many
children.

BOOKS
Life in a
captured
country
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Empire of the Sun, by J. G. Ballard.
Gollancz, $19.95
THIS IS a remarkable book. It is about
what happens to civilians in a war, the
kind of war that Australians have not
experienced, the kind of war in which a
country is taken prisoner. Accepted
principles and certainties are put to the
test when this happens, often with
unexpected and certainly un-
conventional results. Survival is all and
Ballard’s story is of Jim who discovered
this precociously the obvious truth
about the war was that people were only
too able to adapt to it.
As Ballard says in a foreword, the
novel is developed from his ex-
periences. Like Jim, Ballard was 11
years old and living in a superior suburb
of Shanghai when the Japanese bombed
Pearl Harbor and precipitated war with
the United States.
In the confusion following action
between British and Japanese gunboats
in the port of Shanghai, Jim is separated
from his parents. Released from hospi-
tal after treatment for minor injuries, he
returns to the big house. Minus servants,
it has been vandalised, the swimming-
pool emptied; the Packard has disap-
peared along with Yang the Chinese
chauffeur.
Jim subsists for a while on bottled
soda and cocktail biscuits, then retreats
to the docks and the company of an
English ship’s steward named Basie.
The Japanese do not seem to want him
but he is finally placed in the Lunghua
CAC (Civilian Assembly Centre, intern-
ment camp) with 2000 men, women and
children. He is always sure that he will
meet his parents again.
An only child, much given to
fantasy, Jim finds resources within him-
self cunning, obstinacy, a real talent
for survival. He forges strong
relationships, guarded friendships, with
Dr Ransome and Mr Maxted his
parents’ chum, a Shanghai playboy.
Another influence is Basie, the kind of
rat to be found manipulating whatever
market exists.
Jim goes into the camp as a child,
spends his early adolescence behind
barbed wire and armed guards almost
starving most of the time and emerges
as a youth of 15. The processes of
growing up have not been accelerated
by his experiences but, rather, changed.
The camp has been his security and
he admires the Japanese guards and
soldiers and the pilots in the adjacent
airfield for their bravery, their
stoicism and the sadness which he
detects. The guards, toward the end of
the war, have scarcely more food and
their clothes are in tatters.
All this is told with immense skill
and what seems like honesty. The
horrors of starvation and filth are
mentioned not to turn the reader’s
stomach pleasurably but as a necessary
part of the story. The British internees,
except for the missionaries, do not come
out of it too well. Adversity sometimes
accentuates the least attractive national
characteristics. This novel truly is
Bill Reed: an irreverent package
BRIAN FERGUSON
almost impossible to put down once you
have started on it. It was short-listed for
the Booker Prize (which has been in the
news) but astonishingly did not win.
The short-listing brought it immedi-
ate reviews and some discussion has
ensued between people who, having
been interned in China by the Japanese
differ as to how bad it was. However,
Ballard’s credentials are good enough:
He was there.
There may be more than one reason
for the title. The Japanese were indeed
pouring forth from their islands behind
the banner of the rising sun. And the
sun rising over the Woosung river and
the port of Shanghai plays a prominent
part in Jim’s daily life. And right at the
end he sees at night, faintly in the sky,
the outer rays of that other terrible sun
the second atom bomb, dropped on
Nagasaki. □
Watery worst
brings out
best writing
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
The Man Who Stayed Below, by
Alan Gould. Angus & Robertson,
$14.95.
Crooks, by Bill Reed. Hyland
House, $14.95.
Legends of Benson’s Valley, by
Frank Hardy. Penguin, $6.95.
THE MAN Who Stayed Below is the
first novel of Alan Gould who has a
deservedly fine reputation as a poet. It is
a strangely muted book, not because
Gould has indulged in any “poetic”
writing but because of something hid-
den below the action which never quite
emerges. This something is more than
the man of the title, Captain Trygg of
the Emilia Denholm a four-masted
barque sailing from Melbourne to
London in 1913. Trygg mysteriously
shuts himself in his cabin for most of the
voyage; indeed, he is not seen by
anyone except his steward after the
Equator. His vaguely baleful presence
inhibits normal shipboard life as re-
vealed on the voyage; the problem is
whether it also dulls the impact of the
novel. Trygg has to carry a lot pf weight
in more ways than one but Lord Jim, for
instance, did not stay below.
The story is narrated in the 1930
Depression years by Johnny, a man who
had been a 16-year-old apprentice on
his first voyage. Gould gives excellent
descriptions of the terror of Johnny’s
first encounter with the disciplinarian
mate, Hallett, of the worse terror of
going up the shrouds of a clipper for the


first time and of the worst of all terrors
rounding Cape Horn in a storm.
Gould’s interests as a poet have been
much involved with sailing ships and
also with Iceland (he has Icelandic
forebears).
The Man Who Stayed Below is well
worth reading for Gould’s ability to
touch on the mystery of sail, “one of the
very old mysteries, that intelligent in-
volvement with things, that self-
forgetfulness we call work.” The novel
calls for a metaphysical dimension
which it does not quite achieve.
THERE is nothing muted or metaphysi-
cal about Bill Reed’s Crooks. Reed is a
playwright and novelist who has always
had the capacity to experiment with
style and subject-matter. In Crooks he
tackles, four-letter words thrashing like
a loose sail in a storm on the Emilia
Denholm, the wild world of New South
Wales crime and corruption. This has
such an ancient and bizarre history that
it is almost impossible for a novelist to
make fiction stranger than fact.
Reed has almost solved the problem
by a rampageous assault on language
and character, with a humor that ranges
from nailpolish red to revolver black.
The whole is skilfully and irreverently
packaged in the fashionable form of a
novel about a novel. Reed sends up
literature as well as life. The only snag is
that he is so vigorous that the reader
sometimes wilts.
The cast is multi-cultural, held
together by the good old Australian
bond of mutual abuse. These are Jewish
Frank E. R. Stein, “hotshot publishing
financier,” and his Italian “greaseball
adoptee half-brother Costas.” The other
members of The Gang, who set out to
avenge Costas’ death by the criminals
he had been exposing in his book
Australian Crime Bosses, are the
Aboriginal Flash Gurton and the huge
ex-whore (but not done with her trade)
Milly Hunt, which of course rhymes.
(The exuberant Reed might have written
“of coarse.”) And at the summit of the
book, in a wheelchair but still dominat-
ing the action, is Stein Senior, Captain
Harry Stein, VC, AIF, ex-POW of the
Japanese, ex-Police Commissioner of
New South Wales, the ultimate villain.
Such a book needs to be totally
uninhibited, Rabelaisian and inventive,
which it is. But to keep all this material
from falling apart, a strong control is
needed, which slips on occasion, al-
though Reed cleverly uses a structure
that also neatly parodies literary
fashionableness.
IT IS GOOD to see Frank Hardy’s
Legends from Benson’s Valley back in
print again. These are spare, observant,
beautifully-crafted stories that often
open veins of rich comedy. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Sweet Dreams come true
BRITISH-owned Transworth Publish-
ers set up here four years ago, taking
over distribution of Bantam/Corgi
paperbacks from Gordon and Gotch.
Transworth began with nothing, even
had to look up numbers of bookshops
in the phone directory. Bantam, the
biggest paperback house in the United
states, is owned by Bertelsmann,
publishers of Der Stern magazine, who
bought it from Fiat.
Marketing director Judith Curr, fresh
from Christian Dior cosmetics, was so
raw that she rang Macmillan promotion
manager Alan Davidson and asked, be-
fore her first author Joseph Heller
toured, what to do. “When I got the
paper from under my door at the hotel
and saw a front-page story about Heller
being mobbed at a university, I knew
what it was all about,” she said.
Transworth’s success story is in the
spectacular growth in the past two and a
half years of young adult (YA) fiction,
something of a successor in the market
to romance now at saturation point
and perhaps the only true growth area
in publishing at the moment.
Curr says that YA publishing is
different from anything else.
All titles originate in the US.
Roughly: the Sweet Dreams series is for
girls 11 to 14 years; Sweet Valley High is
for girls 12 to 16; and the Seniors,
coming soon, is for when “you’re old
enough to get the full story.” As with
romances, loyalty is to the series. Print
run is 30,000 but all books are kept
Judith Curr: sole growth market?
KEVIN BROWN
in stock because demand continues.
By January, there will have been 72
Sweet Dreams titles. Price is $2.25 and
books reach all outlets.
Choose Your Own Adventure series
is for girls and boys nine and over.
These are claimed to help teach “pro-
blem-solving.” Alternative develop-
ments of plot are offered; the reader
chooses.
New moves will be to younger
children, down to pre-school, and into
fantasy.
Curr accepts that readership will
turn over every couple of years. She
promotes through Dolly magazine and
TV Week.
As “Sally Porter,” she receives 400
letters a month from girls wanting to
know more about the series. If you see
kids this summer with hair ties,
shoelaces or bookmarks with Sweet
Dreams on them, Curr will be smiling.
It is her promotional idea and she has
ordered 135,000 of them as giveaways
with books.
“OH, you mean how to keep yourself
nice,” said the salesman when Maria
Foster of Heinemann tried to explain
one of their lead titles for 1985. This is
Every Occasion in which radio per-
sonality Ita Buttrose will tell us what to
do, what to wear and the general carry-
on for every social event and life’s
milestone from christening to funeral.
Every Occasion will be published
next Easter, at $19.95. Print run is to be
at least 30,000. The only hitch at the
moment is that it is proposed to use a
photograph of the Ita Buttrose rose on
the dustjacket but, because of heavy
Sydney rains, the flower has been
showing an unexpected reluctance to
make an appearance.
IN OUR ceaseless self-examination, it
is perhaps time we took a closer look at
the Eureka Stockade. John Malony, who
wrote I Am Ned Kelly and who is
professor of History at the Australian
National University, has just published
with Viking his Eureka in which he
advances the theory that the “rebellion”
was government-perpetrated.
Early next year, Hale and Iremonger
will publish Desmond O’Grady’s
Rajfaelo . . . Raffaelo!, a biography of
Raffaelo Carboni. O’Grady, who now
lives in Italy, records Carboni’s life
there before coming to Australia and his
involvement in the struggle for Italian
independence. □

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
The case of the sulking cricket pitch
YOU WILL have noticed that cricket
pitches are as deeply mysterious and as
unfathomable as old wines. After the
first test, I don’t think that more than
500,000 words were printed about the
WACA wicket at Perth. Messrs
O’Reilly, Blofeld, Benaud, Nicholson
and innumerable others all had their
say. It was volatile, responsive, fiery,
spirited, unnerving and yet, to some, a
true, honest, rewarding, one almost felt
a Christian pitch.
Then, for the match NSW
versus the West Indies we had
a damp, lively, unfathomable,
spinners’ dream. As I write
this, some deep interpretation
is going on regarding the per-
sonality and human charac-
teristics of the pitch at the
Gabba in Brisbane.
Careers, usually worth
anything up to $lOO,OOO a
year, are being destroyed
because we have little knowl-
edge of what happens with
these strange surfaces.
Obviously it is time for Bob
Hawke to appoint a royal
commission. I would suggest
that he appoint Frank
Costigan, who clearly is not
doing a great deal this minute.
He would need to call as
witnesses grand old cricketers
from the past, leading
groundsmen, experts from the
CSIRO and a number of
psychoanalysts.
Why? Because there is not the
slightest doubt that pitches are human.
Just remember those grand com-
mentators Charles Fortune and Arthur
Gilligan. There would be the inevitable
question: “What do you think, Arthur?”
You could almost see him shaking
his head. We would have an
“unresponsive pitch,” “an unyielding
pitch,” “a dangerous pitch,” “a quixotic
pitch” and even “a meaningful pitch.”
I think I can reveal to you the exact
time it was discovered that pitches were
human. It was the third test at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937.
There was rain on the first day and the
incomparable Neville Cardus wrote:
“The morning dragged on while the
police guarded the pitch as though it
were the crown jewels. There were
repeated visits by the captains to the
wicket and the crowd counted them out
... Apparently the captains could not
agree, for when they left the scene the
umpires had a look and walked around
the pitch, warily, as though half expect-
ing it to get up and shake itself and wet
everybody.
“Profound consultation went for-
ward. It did not require to elaborate the
doctrine of relativity. The problem of
establishing wetness or dryness of a
cricket pitch is as deep and mysterious
as all your metaphysics from Descartes
to Professor Whitehead.”
When play finally began, he wrote:
Former captain Tony Greig confers with the WACA wicket
PBL Marketing
“The wicket was beginning to amuse
itself and the crowd. The first ball to
O’Reilly stood up and stared him in the
face: he patted the wicket manfully and
really it deserved the smacking it got.”
See what I mean? Conclusive proof
that pitches are human. The most deep-
ly disturbed neurotic pitches you will
find at the Gabba. They use a special
black soil that they get from Goodna
and I don’t think it is entirely
coincidental that this is the district
which houses the local mental asylum.
The Sydney Cricket Ground soil
comes from Bulli. It powders, is prone
to ulcers and early old age, and takes
spin. In the old days, you always got
green tops and splendid conditions for
fast bowling but the soil has been more
irritable lately.
Over in Adelaide the soil comes from
somewhere in the Adelaide Hills I
believe. It provides conservative, stable,
ultra-right-wing unyielding pitches.
You would not expect anything
untoward on the Adelaide Oval.
Now, the pitches for the Melbourne
Cricket Ground come from the Merri
Creek and have done so right back to
the pre-Dr W. G. Grace era. The soil is
the blackest of all cricket pitches, the
specific gravity of lead. Fearful con-
troversy has raged over the MCG wicket
since the mid-70s. I don’t think anyone
has been bowled out at the MCG since
1976.
The suspicion arose that
this human wicket had actu-
ally expired, passed away.
Indeed they dug up all the
wickets and replaced them.
Naturally the old cadaver was
sacred. Very sensibly the
Melbourne Cricket Club
bought 2000 chalices or urns.
Beautiful they were, heavy
pewter inlaid with brass and
silver with sculptured
medallions of six cricket im-
mortals Grace, Ponsford,
Bradman, Harvey, Sobers and
Lillee.
Sacred remains were
placed in each urn and the
inscription read: “Original
MCG wicket soil from 1853 to
1983 authenticated by Dr
John Lill, MCG secretary.”
These were sold for $390
each.
We thought things might
be different with a young new
wicket but last November the
WA-Victoria shield match finished in a
draw and Kim Hughes described the
pitch as “laughable ... the worst first
pitch in Australia. Lifeless!”
However, we think the tender young
thing was barely grown up and we are
expecting it to show all sorts of interest-
ing adolescent characteristics this
summer, particularly when it is allowed
to stay up at night.
The Melbourne pitch has displayed a
sense of humor in years gone by. As to
the more recent behaviour, I believe the
pitch is sulking. It does not like the new
commercialism, the horrid outbreak of
pyjama cricket.
Frankly, it is on strike.
The pitch should be put on a psy-
choanalyst’s couch to find out all these
things.
Costigan should conduct a vigorous
inquiry and, for God’s sake, let’s hope
that this time he publishes ALL his
findings. □


Pretty as a Painter and Docker
PHILLIP ADAMS
FOR DECADES, Melbourne has been
insulted by almost everyone, including
myself, for being moribund, anaes-
thetised, catatonic. No more. If Don
Dunstan’s Adelaide was the Athens of
the South, John Cain’s Melbourne is the
Venice of Victoria where big, green,
electric gondolas glide down asphalt
canals. Culture erupts from Melbourne
like pumice from Vesuvius. It’s a
wonder we’re not all buried in it.
At one end of the scale we’ve our
magnificent new theatres and
concert halls, architecture of
such emphasis that it makes
culture feel compulsory. But
at the other we’ve the charm-
ing green and white
numberplates for our auto-
mobiles, elegant enamels pro-
claiming Victoria as the Gar-
den State. Consider the
astonishing fact that these
marvellous pieces of folk art
are lovingly hand-crafted by
Her Majesty’s prisoners at
Coburg. Royal commissioner
Frank Costigan can say what
he likes, but in no other
country are the criminal
classes so dedicated to beauty.
Indeed, we Victorians don’t
think of them as mere
numberplates. Each one of
them is an original painting
by a Painter and Docker.
In New York, the subway trains are
painted by vandals brandishing
aerosols. But in Melbourne, our trams,
our electric gondolas, are painted by
famed artists. They’re vandalised by
professionals. New Orleans may have its
streetcar named Desire, but thanks to
the Met, Melbourne has mobile murals.
Talk about transports of joy, you can
travel along St Kilda Road on an
original Clifton Pugh, go to Malvern on
a Mirka Mora. To fully grasp the
originality of the notion, imagine
waiting at a bus stop in Rome to catch a
ride on the Sistine Ceiling.
There are very few people who are
famous in any branch of the arts,
anywhere in the world, who are not
Victorians or Melburnians. From Dame
Nellie to Dame Edna, from J.C.
Williamson to their talented son David,
Australia’s over-achievers in the arts
have been the sons and daughters of *
Melbourne suburbs. In a desperate at-
tempt to redress the balance, Nifty
keeps luring our luminaries to Balmain,
which is tantamount to stealing the
monkeys from Gibraltar. But in time,
they return from that crass, superficial
city with its shallow, hollow sophistica-
tion, not to mention its high humidity,
and replight their troth to Melbourne,
Metropolis of the Muse.
IF THE foregoing seems somewhat
hyperbolic, there is at least one area in
which Victoria can both claim and
prove its primacy. I refer to the world’s
film industry, the greatest cultural
juggernaut of our time, which all but
turned the planet into a giant Jaffa. It
began in Victoria with an opening salvo
by the Salvos.
Joseph Perry and Herbert Booth
made Soldiers of the Cross in 1900. The
principal location was a tennis court at
the Salvation Army Girls’ Home at
Murrumbeena, although they sub-
sequently filmed the drowning of a
Christian martyr in the River Tiber
across town at the Richmond Baths.
Premiereing at the Melbourne Town
Hall, Soldiers combined 13 film se-
quences with 200 slides and an
elaborate music score using themes
from hymns and the popular classics.
Six years later, the story of the Kelly
Gang premiered at the Athenaeum Hall,
produced by John and Nevin Tait. And
that has a strong claim to being the first
true feature film ever made. And
Australia’s third major film first,
screened at the Athenaeum the follow-
ing year, was Eureka Stockade,
produced in Victoria by George and
Arthur Cornwall.
Just as our industry flickered into life
in Melbourne 80 years ago, it was
reborn here in the 60s. After the Dark
Ages, from the late 30s to the mid-60s,
when Australian films were banished
from our own cinemas, brave, foolish
people such as Georgio Magniamelli,
Tim Burstall, the late Brian Davies,
Nigel Buest, Brian Robinson and yours
truly began making low- or no-budget
features around Eltham and Carlton.
We had no money, no equipment, no
training and no end of en-
thusiasm. But we had the in-
spiration of a number of
Melbourne institutions the
Australian Film Institute,
Erwin Rado’s magnificent
Melbourne Film Festival and,
surprisingly, the largest film
society movement on Earth.
Out of our glorified home
movies, with a little help from
Barry Jones and John Gorton,
came the new Australian film
industry starring such
splendid Melburnians as Fred
Schepisi, Gil Armstrong and
Paul Cox. Augmented by the
genius of David Williamson.
For a time Sydney made a
determined effort to knock off
the film industry but in recent
months we’ve re-established
our place in the arc lights.
And now we have the hope
of a new wave of young film makers
such as Richard Lowenstein, Michael
Pattison and Kathy Mueller, all
graduates from Melbourne’s splendid
Swinburne Film School.
And like Svetlana returning to the
Soviet Union, one by one our expatri-
ates are returning from Balmain.
Neville Wran may have successfully
kidnapped Graham Kennedy, but
Graeme Blundell recently swam to free-
dom across the Murray and negotia-
tions are under way between the
Victorian and New South Wales
governments for the return of David
Williamson.
A SCENE a few days ago in
Melbourne. The state premier is running
late for one of the 150th functions. John
Cain is overdue to lead a cavalcade of
vintage cars. The organisers are getting
desperate.
Then along comes a plaintive sugges-
tion from Don Dunstan, a member of the
Sesqui committee: “Would anyone like a
recycled premier?” □

Self-made
billionaire
Richard De
Voss: a $5-
million
helping hand
Edited by c ßyn Saw
When you’re no more than a common-
or-garden millionaire like Alan Bond
and you need a fast $5 million to run an
America’s Cup challenge, you need
nothing so much as you need a billion-
aire like Richard De Voss. He is the
founder and chairman of the giant
Amway corporation and is described as
“a self-made billionaire with a fleet of
yachts, power boats and seven planes
who started Amway in 1959, selling
vitamin pills door-to-door.” De Voss
coughed up $5 million to help poor old
Bondy. It seems fair enough. After all,
as finance director of the America II
syndicate he’s helping the New York
Yacht Club to raise $l2 million.
A leggy Pirelli
girl: art in a
calendar
You can have warts, pimples, halitosis,
bilharzia, sprue, colitis, piles and/or BO
but you cannot be constipated you
are not to talk about it, anyway. But nor
can the nation’s sales of apples and
pears be allowed to slump. So the
Australian Apple and Pear Corporation
hired nutritionist Rosemary Stanton to
explain that 93 percent of Australian
kids go for junk food, that 225 million
doses of laxatives are sold every year,
that it’s hard to give details of constipa-
tion because nobody wants to talk about
it but that the bindings could be relaxed
if everybody would just eat a pear a day.
The secret: fibre, of course. Next: How
to Calm your Colon with Apples.
For some years now Messrs Pirelli, the
distinguished tyre-fanciers, have been
producing calendars that keep the true
meaning in the maltreated cliche, “cal-
endar art.” This year their public
relations man in Australia, Bill Brown,
although a highland Scot, was delighted
to note that photographer Norman Par-
kinson had used a stirring, 6ft American
girl, posing her “in the magnificent
setting of the Assembly Rooms, Edin-
burgh, Scotland.” And there was more:
“The outstanding feature of the cal-
endar is a unique range of clothing,
featuring the world-famous Pirelli P 6
tyre tread pattern.” What the clothing
has to do with it remains arcane, but few
tyres have been so splendidly-grooved.
Hugh Bingham, the executive director of
Australian Associated Brewers and the
man who leads the charge against the
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal’s pro-
posal to ban booze commercials on TV,
is the kind of man the good chaps need.
Earlier in his career he was news editor
of the Sydney Daily Mirror. There the
Rechabites and other wowsers tried to
break his spirit but Hugh left and went
north to join up with the tosspots: he
became public relations man to Joh
Bjelke-Petersen. From there it was only
a hop to the public affairs of Carlton
and United, then a step and a jump to
his present job. Were he still operating
in a non-Labor state, he would have a
knighthood by now.
Sucks, one might say, to those who
thought that John Newcombe, the
racquet-fancier and TV spruiker (Good
Ole Custom Credit, “they’re good sports
with money”) was really just a
moustache on legs. Peter Ritchie, the
managing director of McDonald’s
Australia, announced that Newk had
been appointed to the board of the
distinguished french-fryers.


John Newcombe: on the board
of the distinguished french-fryers
In Sydney Peter Watts, director of the
NSW Historic Houses Trust, was lying
in his bath when, apropos of nothing at
all, he thought of the title Lights and
Loos. What could the trust do with that?
He passed the question to Shar Jones,
the curator of the magnificently-
restored old Elizabeth Bay House; she
passed it on to ex-deputy premier Jack
Ferguson who is chairman of trustees,
and the result is, at EBH until February
17, an exhibition of antique lights,
drains, baths and loos with, of course,
frequent reference to the thunderpots
and washdown closets supplied with
water from the cisterns of Thomas
Crapper.
British newspaper The Mail on Sunday
has created a form guide explaining the
tortuous web of relationships linking
Robert Sangster’s various wives and
girlfriends, both past and present. For
example, in the middle of the track;
Susan’s ex-husband, Andrew Peacock is
a friend of Shirley MacLaine, who was a
former girlfriend of Pete Hamill, ex-
boyfriend of Jackie Onassis, widow of
Aristotle, whose previous wife, Tina
Livanos, became an English duchess
after divorcing Greek ship-owner
Stravros Niarchos, who has a powerful
racing partnership with none other than
Robert Sangster. Similar convoluted
who’s-who-type affiliations are coursed
for Sangster’s first wife, Christine, ex-
girlfriend Jerry Hall and current
playmate Sue Lilley. It makes Northern
Dancer’s family tree seem quite simple
by comparison.
A whole generation, maybe two genera-
tions, of Australians have never heard
of the Gumnut Babies Snuggiepot and
Cuddlepie, of Bib and Bub, the Wattle
Babies and the hideous, hairy, Big Bad
Banksia Men. These are among the
creations of May Gibbs who is immortal
in that now, nearly a century after she
began gumnutting, they’re giving her
another exhibition, and Messrs Patrick
White, Morris West and Max Harris
might like to think about that. They’re
giving her an exhibition? They are
inspired by Pat Yeomans who has been
in this country long enough to have
Australian-born, married children but
was raised in Canada, probably on
stories of the Beaver Babies and the
dreaded Maple Men. For still better
measure the exhibition Christmas-
gifted, dolled, music-boxed, booked,
glassworn and leather-worked half to
death opens at the end of this month
in Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens,
which are even older than the Gumnut
kids. Yeomans’ co-organiser, the
gardens’ PR, Michelle Frank, a person,
or possibly even a girl of 20, had never
heard of the babies until Yeomans
hunted her along to do research at the
Mitchell Library.
In the late 30s, 40s and 50s Australia’s
mainly Sydney’s and Melbourne’s
favorite villain was an American
wrestler named Ventura Tenario, much
better-known as Big Chief Little Wolf.
The Chief became famous for a bit of
hokum known as the Death Lock 20
years before TV, with performers such
as Gorgeous George, made wrestling
big enough to command good TV time.
He was the complete Ozophile, a tireless
charity worker, until, still in his 50s, he
suffered a stroke in Melbourne. For
nearly 20 years he was a patient in
Melbourne’s Mount Royal Hospital. In
1980 he went back to live out his days in
Sepulveda, California; and last week,
well into his 80s, the Chief died.

Money maketh the eccentric
RON SAW
NO SOONER have I turned
my back than the sociologists
turn up another multi-
millionaire who refuses to
conform. Bob Hope keeps
working. Fang Hancock does
not deny that he enjoys the
company of a beautiful
woman; nor does Adnan
Kashoggi.
Where, you ask, will it all
end? The end may be nigh:
from Albany, New York,
comes the news that Gerald
Billert, the young brewing
multi-millionaire, refuses to
wear socks.
He wears, quite happily,
just about everything else ex-
pected of a well-dressed
young multi-millionaire: his
collars flash with the breast
plumes of the tiniest, best-
bred humming-birds; his belts
are from the hides of inveter-
ate politicians; his shirts are of samite,
mystic, wonderful; but he won’t wear
socks.
And, odd though it may seem, he has
little trouble. There is the occasional
impertinence “Do your ankles get
cold?” “Don’t your feet stink?” but
nothing more.
Few people who are not multi-
millionaires can get away with sockless
feet. I, for one, have often been ejected
from restaurants for wearing no socks.
Once I was thrown out of what used to
be Fe Chardon, in Woollahra, for
wearing no tie at a time when the
place was crammed with multi-
millionaires in states of what I have
called undress. The jockey at the table
next to mine was, in fact, wearing no
socks; a distinguished usurer had a
dinner-jacket and a white tie; Sir
Warwick Fairfax and his Fady featured
matching tank-tops. They were all
allowed to stay, browsing and sluicing
like mad, and they were all recognised
instantly as the bon ton, the absolute
arbiters of fashion; and I was flung out
because I was wearing no tie with my
polo-necked sweater.
There is, then, something about a
multi-millionaire that makes him
fashionable.
There must be many people in Perth
who remember Alfred Murm, who
made about $lOO million in the eastern
goldfields of Western Australia and who
refused to wear trousers, claiming that
his knees needed to breathe.
Nobody ever saw him wear trousers;
not after his first 20 million, anyway.
He’d appear at garden parties and
fashionable race meetings in tailcoat,
weskit, suspenders, socks and shoes but
no trousers though he would, I must
confess, wear short shorts with morning
dress to weddings and the Melbourne
Cup.
He had trouble only once. Shortly
after he got to $75 million he was sitting
in the lounge bar of the old Excelsior
Hotel, drinking Bollinger and letting his
knees breathe, when a waiter told him to
either put on his trousers or go.
Murm left, bought the hotel in an
hour, blew it to bits with two tons of
dynamite, re-built it and staffed it with
waiters wearing only jockstraps below
the waist. It was then that people in the
West realised that trousers were not
only unnecessary but tasteless; and that
bare, breathing knees were chic.
But the most passionate sock-hater I
ever heard of was Jack Dartt-Wrick, the
last in the line of distinguished yachting
Dartt-Wricks.
Nobody I know ever discovered
what Jack had against the wearing of
socks, but it must have been something
profound because he embraced
socklessness despite the awful problems
it caused.
For instance, he knew that nothing
shines with a more ghastly light than the
naked ankle and he made many at-
tempts to soften the glare, some of them
disastrous.
Once, to match a beige suit,
he arranged to have his ankles
painted light brown; and
certainly it worked. But next
day he found it necessary to
wear a blue suit; and how on
earth was he to wear brown
socks?
He was obliged to give an
extraordinary order to the
bootblack at the Sneer Club:
“Shine, please, Giblet. And,
er, just do about eight or nine
inches of the ankles, too.”
There were few multi-
millionaires at the Sneer Club
Jack himself was pigging it,
down somewhere near his last
quarter-million and, in-
evitably, members began
kicking up a fuss. Jack was
called before the committee
and asked to show why he
shouldn’t offer his resignation.
What could he do? He
simply could not resign. His great-great-
great-grand-father, old Ginger Wrick,
the emancipist bootlegger, had founded
the club back in 1824.
At the time of his interrogation, due
to a busy social round, Jack’s ankles
were black and his calves were brown,
and there were flashes of white left from
a picnic croquet match. To frustrate his
accusers, who would be bound to look
under his trousers, he borrowed and
wore a pair of black wrestling tights.
“Black paint!” sneered the secretary
as the committee made its inspection of
Jack’s crossed ankles. “Make him pull
up his trousers.” Jack did so, showing
more black.
“He must have used a spray-gun,”
said the secretary. “Here, wait a bit.” He
went to Jack and dragged the trouser-
legs still higher. Still black.
“God damn it!” he bawled. “I know
it’s only paint. Or maybe boot polish.
Giblet’s always shining his ankles.”
He kept shoving and hauling at
Jack’s trousers until, finally Jack was
sitting before the committee with his
trousers two inches above his knees, his
knees crossed and black stockings all
the way.
“Nothing the matter with that,” said
the Oldest Member. “Me wife wears
those things all the time.” But from that
day on Jack was called “Marlene”
Dartt-Wrick.
It shows just what humiliation can be
heaped upon a poor swine who hasn’t a
multi-million to call his own. □


The Rocks right for great navigator
DAVID McNICOLL
READERS of this page will know that
on several occasions I have pleaded for
some visible recognition for that
remarkable man, Captain William
Bligh.
Bligh was responsible for one of the
most magnificent feats of navigation in
history. As governor of New South
Wales he might have been unpopular
with the officers and the big landowners,
but he was extremely popular with most
of the settlers. His career was remark-
able he sailed with Cook in the first
voyage, was greatly admired by Nelson
and Sir Joseph Banks, distinguished
himself as a naval officer, and finished
up Vice-Admiral of the Blue.
Last week I had a long-overdue look
round Sydney’s Rocks area with Owen
Magee, head of the Sydney Cove
Redevelopment. The progress made has
been staggering, and the planning pro-
mises that the Rocks will become one of
Sydney’s major attractions to visitors.
On the wander round the rocks I saw
a perfect place for a commemorative
plaque (or a sextant) honoring William
Bligh. In the Rocks Square.
AN interesting sidelight on par-
liamentary privilege emerged in the
New South Wales Legislative Assembly
recently.
Roger Wotton, the forceful and out-
spoken member for Castlereagh,
delivered a long speech which included
a free character reading not only for
members of the Wran government, but
also for some members of the Hawke
government.
When Wotton asked the Govern-
ment Printing Office for 100 copies of
his speech, the government printer
demurred, writing: “In our opinion
parts of the speech could possibly be
regarded as defamatory if the speech
were to be published outside the protec-
tion of parliamentary privilege.”
This baffles me. If the daily papers
had printed the speech in full, they
surely could not have been in any
danger from a defamation action. Yet
the government printer said the material
would have to be referred to the Crown
Solicitor (for $7O) to decide if it was
defamatory.
JEAN MARC Heidsieck, head of the
famous house which produces some of
the best imprisoned sunshine in France,
turned on a great dinner party last week
at Richmond Villa, the superbly
restored old house in Sydney’s Kent
Jean Marc Heidsieck with the prime exhibit
Street. A still, warm night, tables set out
under the trees behind the villa, food by
Anders Ousback, bubbly by the host.
The purpose of the dinner was to
present an award to the winner of the
Excellence in Wine Journalism title
this year to a strapping young bibber
named Huon Hooke, of The Australian
Financial Review. Part of the award was
something added by Jean Marc, which
had all the diners drooling $l2OO
worth of vintage champagne.
CULTURE is getting out into the bush
these days. I hear that Musica Viva
recently presented a recital at Mudgee,
and the distinguished Australian
pianist, Roger Woodward, travelled out
to little Gulgong to play to the locals.
Woodward is very keen on the idea
of taking good music to those people
who might not have the opportunity to
visit capital cities and hear it. It’s not a
new idea Melba delighted in visiting
country towns and letting the locals
hear the glory of her voice.
PETER RYAN, boss of Melbourne
University Press, sent me a copy of a
new anthology, about to hit the book-
shops Clubbing of the Gunfire 101
Australian War Poems. The book is
edited by Chris Wallace-Crabbe and
Peter Pierce and covers wars from the
Sudan to Vietnam.
The title Clubbing of the Gunfire
comes from a Kenneth Slessor
poem which includes the line
“Between the sob and the
clubbing of the gunfire ...” I
was very flattered to find that a
poem of mine, published first
in 1942, had been included in
the anthology.
STEVE Cauthen, the Ameri-
can jockey, beat the British
hoops at their own game in the
season just finished.
Steve rode 130 winners. He
was followed by Pat Eddery
107; Lester Piggott 100; W. R.
Swinburne 99; Willie Carson
97; and T. Ives 90.
ONE OF the most interesting,
and frightening articles I’ve
read for a long time was
Margot O’Neill’s report on
Aborigines in Eveleigh Street
Redfern, which appeared in
the Melbourne Age and,
somewhat truncated, in The
Sydney Morning Herald.
The last whites are leaving Eveleigh
Street, and without any doubt it is
racism working in reverse. They are not
wanted by their neighbors, and they are
no doubt in some fear of them. So their
homes are being bought by the
Aboriginal Development Commission
in itself an admission of failure to get
white and black to live amicably
alongside each other.
Redfern seems destined to be an-
other Harlem, and when that happens it
will be a cancer in the body of a
beautiful city. For years it has been
apparent to anyone going through the
area that the little brick shacks of
Soweto are if anything preferable to the
crumbling dirty houses of parts of
Redfern.
Is there any solution to the problem?
It would be tragic if the goodwill in the
hearts of most white Australians is not
matched by the willingness of the
Aborigine to co-operate. In country
towns, houses are being purchased by
the government and handed over to
Aboriginal families. If this is done
slowly and carefully, I think it might
have a fair chance of success. Let’s hope
so.
Aboriginal problems land rights,
sacred sites, paternalism, the threat of
ghetto development are going to
haunt Australian dreams for years to
come. □

New V 8 Holden *
Loses by 0.6 see/
To measure the performance of the
new Holden Commodore SS VB, compare
it with the well bred Porsche 911 Carrera,
Both cars accelerate from rest to
IOOKs in under 7 secs. The Carrera in 6,1
secs, the SS in 6.7 secs.
Over4oo metres, there's nothing in it:
14.3 secs for the Carrera, vs. 14.9 for V 8
Commodore SS.
Not only does the SS go like a
Carrera, it stops brilliantly too, with big
discs all round.
The V 8 Commodore SS handling is
also preferred over many of Europe's
finest. Designed by Peter Brock himself
the V 8 Commodore SS is based on his
experience of seven wins at Bathurst.
Brock has included a limited slip
differential, a blueprinted ignition system,
and HDT high performance cylinder
heads with large inlet and exhaust valves.
He has also added a refined inlet manifold
with improved inlet passages and free flow
extractor exhaust system. Power steering,
HDT gas rear suspension, 15" HDT alloy
wheels and low-profile Uniroyals provide
an outstanding ride with precise handling.
Apart from beating a lot of classy cars at
their own high performance game, the 5.0 litre
V 8 powered Commodore SS can do practical
things such as towing boats, floats and caravans,
and comfortably accommodate 5 people and
their luggage.
Inside, the SS gives you the driving aids you
ss
need full instrumentation, including tacho,
Momo steering wheel, plus a state-of-the-art
electronic tune AM/FM stereo radio cassette
system and sports Scheel seats.
At over $56,000, the Porsche 911 costs about
three times more than the V 8 Commodore SS
a difference of over $38,000,

Your guide to executive gifts, compiled by GLENDA THOMPSON
Excesses of Christmas past are outdated. It is chic to be
thoughtful. Dripping leopardskin coats and private airlines are no
longer the thing. Only King Fahd of Saudi Arabia can afford a
Boeing 747 fuel bill, while furs make hackles rise in some quarters.
Discreet is ritzy. The buzz comes from the skill, tact and wit that has gone
into the selection, rather than unlimited dollars. The ultimate
consumer’s gift would, I suspect, be a gold Amex card with the tab magically
taken care of, but where would be the thrill in that? The tip is to give Christmas
prescience moulded to the personality and suspected fantasies of the receiver.
Packages can be perfect. Recently, a young couple was delighted to receive
tickets to a show, a bow tie and patterned tights in co-ordinated black and white plus
a hand-written voucher from a reputable baby-sitting firm. By all means
buy a Fijian island for a fiance (Raine and Horne) or a miniature Rolls-Royce
Corniche for the kids ($795 for the battery model from Mick Simmons).
But make sure it will delight them ... Be subtle. Be sure. Turn the page.

plated caviar, dish, $ 118, send
some caviar, bread from a
special baker and half a dozen
lemons.
Lots of people like Beluga,
the black sturgeon roe, but
those who really know their
caviar such as Cyril
Vincenc of Cyril’s Delicat-
essen in Sydney’s Haymarket
say the best eating is the
golden Acetra, favored by the
Shah of Iran when he was in
power. Both sorts come from
the Caspian Sea shared by
Russia and Iran but Cyril
believes the Iranian side is less
polluted. The current war ap-
pears not to have limited
supply. Another Australian
buyer was recently offered 20
tonnes, enough for the whole
country for years, so it ap-
pears the caviar is being
stockpiled to keep prices up
artificially as with com-
modities such as diamonds or
oil. The good news is that
Acetra is $650 a l.Bkg can to
Beluga’s $lOOO.

IN THE
PINK WITH
NON-VINTAGE
CHAMPERS
PINK champagne has made a
bit of a splash this year. The
color that once marked a
nouveau drinker now indi-
cates nous. Moet Et-chan-
don’s rose 1978 champagne is
at the Double Bay Liquor
Store in Sydney for $29.95
and Veuve Clicquot 76 rose
champagne $28.50. Dom
Ruinart’s pink 75 vintage
costs $32 but 1975 is
reputed to have been the best
year in a decade or more.
A couple of non-vintage
pinks at Double Bay are quite
affordable: Lanson $17.25
and Nicolas Feuillatte $21.30.
The pretty Perrier Jouet belle
epoch bottle with flowers
costs $41.75. Bondi Junction
Liquor Store has the pink
non-vintage Laurent Perrier
at $17.95.
Those who know their
wines steer clear of big names
and big production runs,
sending their friends boutique
wines offerings with strong
reputations from small
vineyards. For a white, one
cannot go wrong with a 1984
Heemskirk rhine riesling from
south-western Tasmania,
value at $B4 a dozen. At the
same price, a case of
Plantagenet hermitage 82
produced with a lot of care in
a former apple-picking shed
in Mount Barker, Western
Australia will arouse taste
buds. From liquor stores or
through The Australian Wine
Centre, The Rocks, Sydney.
Friends and relatives in
many spots overseas can be
sent Brown Bros wine packs.
The four-bottle case, the dry
white frontignac, spatlese
lexia, Milawa cabernet and
Milawa shiraz, and a suitable
message, can be dispatched to
Aunt Miriam on the Isle of
Wight for $38.50.
At this time of year allow
at least two weeks for
delivery.
And with a bottle or three,
Len Evans’ Complete Book of
Australian Wine (Lansdowne
$39.95) would be a nice bonus
touch.
The tipple to titillate
almost any tongue is a fine
Scotch, particularly a
highland malt such as Glen
Moray Glenlivet distilled near
Elgin in Morayshire ($29.95
for the 750 ml bottle). Or
perhaps a 15-year-old Pul-
teney also from Elgin.
Glenfarelas’ 21-year-old costs
$39.20, reasonable indeed for
this delight produced by the
Grant family at Speyside,
Banffshire, which is also the
home of Glenfiddich ($31.75).
Bruichladdich Islay single
malt from the Isle of Islay
costs $4O and is at least 10
years old. These prices at

A WAY-OUT
CATALOGUE
FOR KITSCH
AND SLEUTHS
PURELY for the nouveau
riche and/or rock music pro-
moters: the ultra-kitsch prize
for the year goes to an item in
the Neiman-Marcus cata-
logue.
The American department
store has strayed into the
realms of Texan fantasy with
a life-sized Red River
longhorn steer macie out of
wood mosaic. This beast, with
real horns spanning more
than a metre, opens out into a
desk. Only $U565,000
delivered in the ’States. Call
214 573 5780.
Americans are becoming
jaded about zany gifts says
New York correspondent
Susan Anthony. “They find
more interest in the practical
possibilities that are
mentioned in the newspapers
and magazines every year,”
she says.
The Neiman-Marcus mosaic steer cum desk, $U565,000
“It’s no wonder really.
After all, as far back as 1960,
Neiman-Marcus offered His
and Hers aeroplanes for
Christmas. His cost $149,000,
while hers mysteriously
was a mere $27,000. Neiman-
Marcus thereby established a
tradition of offering the
zaniest (and often costliest)
gifts around.
“In subsequent years, these
have included the His and
Hers submarine (for large,
Texan swimming pools?) at
$18,700, His and Hers
Mummy Cases at $16,000
(something to die for), the His
and Hers Dinosaur Safari at
$29,995 and, more recently,
the His and Hers Robot, for
$15,000. This year, apparently
outdone by the excesses of the
past, N-M (as the store is
known to aficionados) could
only come up with a weekend
of sleuthing the Mohonk
Mystery Weekend in an old
inn outside New York.
“A full-scale production,
conceived and directed by
crime writer Donald E.
Westlake, the weekend pro-
vides a mystery murder which
guests must unravel. The cost
is $750 a room.”
In London this year there
is plenty of discretion. Sandra
Jobson reports that Aspreys,
the exclusive jewellers of New
Bond Street, are featuring a
special Christmas TV set for
their welbheeled customers.
The 9-carat gold-plated mini-
set costs $3300.
At home, gold false nails
can be obtained through
Diners Club. These 14-carat
nails cost $39.95 each and can
be set with diamonds at $2O a
diamond. From Peninsula
Jewellers, Dee Why, NSW.
Ballooning is an elegant
sport on the rise. The only
fellow making them in
Australia, Phil Kavanagh of
Sydney, will produce a 570
cubic metre envelope which
can carry one person and a
dog in the cane gondola for
around $12,500. But, hang the
expense, go for one of his 10-
person 5700 cubic metre jobs
for $26,000. Kavanagh is
making two of these for an
expedition to overfly the
Himalayas next year.
A Department of Aviation
permit is required to operate a
balloon and that takes 10

FOR THOSE
IN PURSUIT
OF TRIVIAL
NOTORIETY
JUST because something is
almost übiquitous does not
mean that it will not be a
welcome gift to someone who
does not yet own:
a) a Swatch,
b) Trivial Pursuit.
These are the only excep-
tions in all other areas, try
to be a little original.
Swatches are the zappy,
colorful, waterproof time-
pieces which are the Swiss
watchmakers’ principal de-
fence against Japanese digital
domination. About $4O from
jewellers and department
stores everywhere.
And there can be no hermit
left in deepest darkest south-
western Tasmania who has
not been touched by the Tri-
vial Pursuit bug. Perhaps it is
wise to have second and third
sets of the great board game
so that withdrawal symptoms
can be avoided at one’s
weekender or beach house or
on long car trips. I imagine
sensible airlines soon will
supply sets as cheerfully as
they do folders of the latest
Bulletin, Cleo or Australian
Women's Weekly.
Invented by Canadian
former journalists Chris
Haney and Scott Abbott and
marketed a mere two years
ago, Trivial Pursuit is ex-
pected to notch up $7O million
in sales in North America by
Christmas.
Parker Bros’ version
Australianised by Bob
Neilson, a friend of Haney’s
living in this country costs
about $4O. The real kudos
th*ese days will be to become a
Trivial Pursuit question sub-
ject such as Cliff Young and
Men At Work.
Crown and Andrews has
brought out Teacher’s Quiz
($24.95), a sort of junior Tri-
vial Pursuit, and a couple of
Australian-invented games:
Watchamacallit ($22.95), a
word player by former disc
jockey turned Melbourne
television producer John
McPhee who developed
Supertest, and Billionaire.
Geoff Stuart, a packing
designer born in Grafton,
NSW, devised Billionaire a
noisy card game which in-
volves cornering commodities
such as gold and oil on the
stock market.
The book to end all books
for 60s rock fans is a
scrapbook tome by Derek
Taylor who became the
Beatles’ press officer in 1964.
The beautifully bound volume
is a limited edition of 2000 of
which Australia has been al-
located 500. George Harrison
helped edit Fifty Years Adrift
and signed each one. He is to
launch it at Sydney Opera
House on December 30. The
book is available for $375
through Angus and Robertson
in some states, Myer in others
or contact Hedley Australia in
Sydney.
Books in general are
covered in great detail else-
where in this issue and in
other issues.

HOW TO
SLIP IN
A DISC AT
THE WHEEL
PLAYERS use lasers to read
the discs they play longer,
do not scratch and there is no
surface noise to blemish the
music because there is no
contact between player and
disc.
The latest thing in hi-fi is
the compact audio disc. They
have been on the market for a
while and 1000 titles are
reportedly available on the 12
cm discs at record outlets for
about $2O. Manufacturers say
the titles on sale will treble
next year.
Sony says its new disc
player for cars will be avail-
able this month, having
overcome the vibration pro-
blems associated with vehicle
movement. The CD XS model
is designed to be installed in
the dash as an adjunct to
existing systems or as the
main music system. An
AM/FM model will be on the
market next year.
For the busy businessman,
something intriguing a
voice-activated note taker,
also from Sony. Spokesman
Gary Fairweather says this
machine overcomes the pro-
blem with earlier note takers
which tended to lose the first
and last few words of the
message. He says innovative
microchipology manages a
slight recording delay so that
no words are missed.

SEVENTEEN REASONS
WHY STUART CRYSTAL
IS A BIT EXPENSIVE
It takes seventeen people to make one Stuart Crystal glass.
m
'/M
/SA
77/
m
Seventeen pairs of skilled hands to work the formless
glob of glass into an individually crafted piece.
For you to appreciate, for your friends to appreciate.
Obviously when that many people are involved in
the production of a single item, the item is always going to
be a bit expensive.
Its not that were altruistically
providing work for English craftsmen
of a bygone era. Its simply that we
know there is a certain magic in the

n
individuality of handcrafted Stuart Crystal
glass that no glass-making machine can
ever match.
We continue to make it in this way
because we know our craftsmen create each piece as a
labour of love. With pride of workmanship that is so seldom
evident in todays highly mechanised, highly impersonal,
mass production society
At Stuart we have avoided the temptation to succumb
to modernisation. For with it, we know, comes compromise.
We’ve resisted compromise for one hundred and fiftv
years and five generations.
And even though it may take as many as
seventeen skilled craftsmen to make one individual
piece, when you pick up that piece, we know
you’ll appreciate the reasons why.

PERSIAN
APPRECIATION
DUE TO THE
AYATOLLAH
THE HISTORY of a pre-
owned object adds to its
allure. One can only speculate
about the scenes over which a
Russian empire crystal
chandelier has glittered.
Even quite recent history,
such as the overthrow of the
Shah of Iran, can have a
profound effect on supply of
exquisite Persian rugs accord-
ing to dealer Charles
Aronson. He has several rugs
made by Mahommed San-
oyeh, imperial weaver to the
Shah, which are more than 10
years old and not matched by
anything produced in the
country since. Sanoyeh did
not survive the Ayatollah’s
arrival.
Perfume is a wonderful
gift. Yves St Laurent brought
out a great one this year called
Paris. At David Jones, the
most popular size is the 50ml
spray for $25. The crystal-cut
bottle is $lOO for 25m1.

the pits.
And more time on the
move.
Our all-new FV Series of
heavy trucks have been
designed with your livelihood
at heart. We've made
numerous modifications and
innovations to our engines so
that both the 11-litre in-line
6-cylinder 6D22, standard in
the rigid FV4SB and the
16-litre V 8 DC9 fitted in the
FV4IS prime mover are now
easier to maintain —under the
tilt cab, engine components
have been relocated to facilitate
access and lessen service time.
In fact, daily maintenance
checks—oil level, radiator
coolant, brake fluid, battery
and windscreen washer level
can be made without having
to tilt the cab.
Improvements have also
been made in the cylinder
heads, the air intake ports
and the combustion
chambers.
A reduction has been
achieved in dead volume in the
combustion chamber. The fuel
injection angle has been
improved, and a 2-spring
nozzle adopted. Injection
timing has also been changed.
The new "high snorkel" air
intake system is the first of its
kind in a Japanese truck.
We've improved the shape of
the ducts. The result is cleaner,
cooler air and major fuel
savings. The new system also
lengthens the service life of
the air cleaner element and
reduced air intake noise for
a quieter ride.
In all, 26 improvements to
the FV4IS and 28 changes to
the FV4SB engines, have been
made to achieve outstanding
economy, reliability and
serviceability
Combine all this with the
back-up of our Mitsubishi
Australia-wide Dealer Service
Network and is it any wonder
that the all-new FV Series are
unquestioningly the new
direction in truck technology
for Australia.
The FV4IS, a prime
mover or rigid medium haul
with dog-trailer has a GCM
of 43,000 kg.
The FV4SB, a heavy duty
rigid has a GVM of 21,900 kg.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Air Pacific flies out of the
clouds and into a storm
Confusion is at the controls as the squabble between Qantas and Ansett over which
should try to fly Fiji’s Air Pacific out of its economic tailspin takes on new
dimensions. RICHARD NAIDU and JOHN STACKHOUSE report on developments.
CHARTERED JETS flashed across the
ocean last week as Australia’s Ansett
Airlines made a final bid to block the
government-owned Qantas from taking
over control of the strategic but near-
bankrupt Fijian carrier Air Pacific.
The first jets carried Ansett execu-
tives headed by deputy general manager
Graeme McMahon who said they were
responding to an invitation by Fiji’s
Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara
to put their case again, even though the
Air Pacific board had recommended the
Qantas offer.
McMahon said that, because of Air
Pacific’s desperate situation, the Prime
Minister personally had taken charge of
the airline and the negotiations to find
new management. Cabinet had not
ratified the board’s decision in favor of
Qantas.
Ansett would like to control Air
Pacific because of the strategic position
of Fiji. The landing rights the island
nation controls would augment links
with other island airlines and provide a
further stepping stone into the Pacific.
Qantas, which once had a substantial
share in and management control of Air
Pacific, is intent on maintaining its
control of Australian overseas air ser-
vices.
The fracas took on a new bitterness
as relations between Qantas and Ansett
deteriorated for commercial and per-
sonal reasons and senior executives of
both sides laid their reputations on the
line in the contest.
The struggle climaxed a long deter-
ioration in Air Pacific’s affairs.
Union problems and huge financial
losses from a disastrous attempt to
move on to the United States route were
the first problems to come to public and
media attention.
But even the most hardened Air
Pacific cynics were surprised by the
chain of events that unfolded last week.
Fiji’s cabinet, meeting to look over
the fine print of the three-year Qantas
agreement, suddenly handed board
members a re-hashed Ansett proposal
and told them to hold off signing
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara: intervention

anything until they had had a look at it.
Ansett had rushed the document to
cabinet on November 15, three days
after the draft Qantas/Air Pacific agree-
ment had been handed to Ratu Mara.
Next day the board went back to
cabinet and recommended that it stick
with the original Qantas offer. One
board member protested: “It was a
gentleman’s agreement. This is going to
make us look like a banana republic.”
Ansett followed through with a
broadside at Air Pacific. In a press
statement on Tuesday night, McMahon
accused Air Pacific of deliberately mis-
leading his airline over the format and
scope of proposals expected by the
board. McMahon also said that Ansett’s
offer had been deliberately leaked to its
competitors who had benefited from
more background information.
McMahon stated that he could not
just sit back and see his airline
“maligned” by comments in the Fiji
press.
Acting Air Pacific chief executive
Neil Ganley said he was
“flabbergasted” by the accusa-
tions. The Air Pacific board
could not have been more
fair, he said.
The Fiji Times retorted that
Ansett’s complaints would
have contained more cre-
dence had they come earlier.
The Prime Minister, a man
used to getting his own way,
was reported to be strongly in
favor of Ansett.
Qantas’ policy develop-
ment director, Colin Porter,
hit back at Ansett the next
day. He said the Qantas offer
had been the only one sub-
mitted before the Fiji govern-
ment’s first deadline — and
that it stood in its original
form.
Adding confusion to the
affair was an unexpected
statement in parliament by
Suva lawyer Vijay Par-
manandam, an opposition
member now regarded as pro-govern-
ment, that Ansett had retained him as its
legal adviser.
Suva journalists were trying to find
out why Parmanandam had made a
dash to Sydney on a Stillwell Aviation
Learjet from Suva the previous weekend
along with Fiji’s Home Affairs Minister,
Militoni Leweniqila. Leweniqila was
reported to have been asked by the
Prime Minister to make the visit.
Parmanandam confirmed that the
trip was on Ansett business. However,
in Melbourne, McMahon said he knew
nothing about it.
On Friday night, the Prime Minister
left for the United States on a state visit
(which includes a meeting with Pre-
sident Reagan).
Just before Ratu Mara left for the
US, Air Pacific said a decision on its
management future had been put off for
three weeks.
At the weekend, most of Suva was
betting on Qantas. But, after a week of
turmoil, no one was really sure of
anything. □


NEW ZEALAND
Unions aim a
torpedo at
economic plans
By IAN TEMPLETON
THE LANGE government’s economic
strategy appeared to come apart at the
seams when the trade unions walked
away from the wages accord. After
protracted negotiations to set a
guideline for the forthcoming wage
round, the unions refused to accept the
government’s proposal that increases
should be restricted to 4 percent. They
demanded, instead, that the guideline
be set at 11.2 percent. That, according to
Prime Minister David Lange, was un-
acceptable and irresponsible.
The Employers Federation said the
unions’ demand was “fantasy” and
threatened to make the wage round a
“potential shambles.”
The most dismaying factor for the
government is that it went very close to
an agreement with the union leaders at
one point in the negotiations. With
some bitterness, Lange ■ commented
later: “What went wrong is that we do
not have in New Zealand a union
structure which is able to assert an
absolutely definite stance which can be
relied on ...”
He has declared that the guideline
for the wage round should be 4 percent
but its chances of holding down wage
increases to that figure seem remote.
Lange says that the government will
have to consider its options, which
could include a return to centralised
wage-fixing. “If we do not act
responsibly, we lock ourselves into fail-
ure,” he said.
Finance minister Roger Douglas had
been explicit in warning trade unions of
the dangers inherent in “irresponsible”
settlements: “If ever the New Zealand
economy was at a crossroads, it is now.
More than any other factor, what will
determine whether we take the good
road or the bad road is the settlements
that come out of the forthcoming wage
round. If we have high average wage
settlements, we will set ourselves down
for another bout of inflation, we will
lose many of the benefits of devaluation
and we will continue living beyond our
means.”
High wage settlements, he added,
would mean lower employment.
Douglas said: “We are seeking modera-
tion from the trade unions. I am still
confident we will get it.”
The split between the political and
industrial wings of the Labor movement
has been gradually widening, even
though September’s economic summit
managed to paper it over briefly.
Some influental trade unionists have
been critical of the policies followed by
the Lange government since it devalued
by 20 percent in the first week it was in
power. Their suspicion of the direction
in which the Lange-Douglas team has
been taking the country was heightened
by a budget which accentuated a depar-
ture from what many unionists regard
as traditional Labor philosophy.
Lange says that the welfare state was
fresh and new 50 years ago. “Today, it is
in crisis. Today, we must come to terms
with its failings and try to resolve them
... the welfare state has become a
hollow joke to those genuinely in need
of the services it provides. It has been
hijacked. We must have a new social
and economic synthesis.”
The Lange objectives may be admir-
able but that does not remove the
political roadblocks, some erected by
friends and allies.
The fiasco over the wage guideline
follows a storm over the budgetary
measures imposing a surtax on
superannuitants. The farm sector is in
an uproar not only over the removal of
subsidies but also over higher costs
which will erode the competitive edge of
these export industries.
Even Treasury is predicting that
inflation will rise to 12 percent next year
and other forecasts go as high as 16
percent.
Some observers say that the govern-
ment has gone too fast in trying to
adjust the economy to the realities of its
situation.
Yet, the Lange team is confident that
it can win through.
Some government members of par-
liament, particularly from marginal
seats, are unhappy about some of the
budget measures.
The smell of gunpowder has revived
National warhorse Sir Robert
Muldoon. Immediately after the elec-
tion, the deposed prime minister was
saying that he was unlikely to be a
candidate when the Nationals reviewed
leadership but he has announced that he
will be a contender when the Opposi-
tion caucus votes on the matter on
December 21.
Muldoon has been shown in opinion
polls to hold his lowest rating ever in
public esteem. Yet he senses a sudden
change in political opinion since Labor
brought down its first budget.
Should the trade unions torpedo
Lange’s economic policies, the National
Party if not Muldoon could regain
much of the ground it lost in the
election.
To hold steady on the course it has
charted, the government will need some
cool helmsmanship over the next few
weeks. □
NEW CALEDONIA
Dual regimes
drive colony
to the brink
MICHAEL COYNE/THE IMAGE BANK
Lafleur: determined to stay with Paris
By STUART INDER
NEW CALEDONIA has a new, con-
servative government and soon it will
get a new radical provisional one. With
both has come a realisation that New
Caledonian political affairs are
delicately balanced and that the next
few weeks are vital to its welfare.
The conservative government was
guaranteed with the election of 34
members of the Rassemblement pour la
Caledonie dans la Republique (RPCR)
out of a total of 42 members in the
Territorial Assembly. The major pro-
independence politicians under the
banner .of the Front de Liberation
National Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS)
refused to stand and called for a boycott
of voting by the Melanesian population.
The figures reveal the success of the
Kanak election boycott in this French
territory of 145,000 people, 62,000 of
whom are Melanesian and 54,000
European (the remainder being various
minorities).
Of the 79,000 on the rolls, 50.12
percent voted but this figure was made
possible by' the strong turnout in
European-dominated Noumea where


most of New Caledonia’s whites live
and where the RPCR has its support. In
the mainly Melanesian areas elsewhere
the percentage was much lower.
Some booths did not open and in
others ballot papers were burned and
ballot boxes smashed with axes.
Roadblocks were set up by both
forces. There were injuries but no
deaths and police and other enforce-
ment personnel drew praise for their
firm but intelligent handling of an
inflammatory situation.
Voting is not compulsory in New
Caledonia but in the previous terri-
torial elections, in 1979, voter turnout
was more than 74 percent.
The pro-independence forces at that
election, despite their weaker numerical
position, presented a stronger and more
unified front and eventually were able
to gain control of the governing council
of New Caledonia. With Jean-Marie
Tjibaou as leader, they directed it ably
until these new elections.
Tjibaou, one of the architects of the
boycott, has chosen to work outside the
system with FLNKS and the pro-
visional government. The “govern-
ment” will have its own cabinet.
One of the great debates within the
Kanak independence movement has
been whether this move was wise
whether it was not better to operate
from a position of solidarity within the
New Caledonian assembly as before.
Because he did not agree with the
boycott, Liberation Kanak Socialiste
(LKS) leader Nidoishe Naisseline took
his party out of what was then the
Independence Front (now FLNKS) and
fielded candidates. LKS’s six seats in
the assembly will not give it much clout,
although it is fighting for the same
objectives as the FLNKS.
Naisseline, who is no timid figure-
head, believes that the choice is between
a referendum for independence and
guerilla war; that “there is no third
way.” He chooses to work toward the
referendum.
Naisseline says that the conservative
forces, especially the RPCR, know full
well that New Caledonia is headed
toward independence; that it is
unstoppable.
In this view Naisseline is stating a
fact that has come to be recognised by
the Mitterrand government in France
and by Caledonians of every color and
background, if seldom expressed
publicly. The struggle in New Cal-
edonia is about what sort of in-
dependence should come and who
should direct the affairs of an in-
dependent New Caledonia.
Jacques Lafleur’s RPCR has the
support of business, settlers and those
minorities frightened of Kanak domina-
tion. It sees independence as meaning
the end of the ties with the French
republic, of which the territory is an
integral part. Lafleur says the RPCR is
not prepared to compromise on in-
dependence. The conservatives are also
hoping for the defeat of the Paris
socialist government in 1986 and thus,
support from that direction.
There is already talk among the new
assembly majority of outlawing the
FLNKS “guerillas” and jailing some of
the Kanak militants, particularly Eloi
Maehoro who has been very active in
the boycott.
This line could lead to bloodshed.
It is a view not supported by Paris or
the French high commissioner in
Noumea, Jacques Roynette. Since the
elections, both Roynette and the French
Overseas Territories minister Georges
Lemoine have made plain that they feel
a “significant” number of voters clearly
Jean-Marie Tjibaou: working with the provisional government
MICHAEL COYNE/THE IMAGE BANK
Naisseline: it’s referendum or war
stated their objection to the present
autonomy plan.
Although Lemoine said from Paris
that he would make no change to the
plan for a referendum in 1989, it is not
considered that he is determined to hold
to it. He takes the effectiveness of the
boycott seriously and is prepared to
keep the dialogue going in the hope of a
solution.
In Noumea, the FLNKS has said it is
willing to continue dialogue now that it
has made its point but it will be carried
on through the provisional government.
How effective a political ploy the
provisional government is remains to be
seen. Australian Foreign Affairs minis-
ter Bill Hayden was the first foreign
minister to say his country would not
recognise it.
He said recognition would under-
mine Australia’s capacity to make any
productive contribution on the New
Caledonian question.
He also took the opportunity to say
that he would be “gravely disturbed” if
violence became a way of pursuing
political objectives in New Caledonia.
This was apparently aimed at the in-
dependence movement some of
whose leaders, he said, had a tendency
to want to deny that New Caledonia
was a multiracial society.
Hayden added that, should France
withdraw from New Caledonia, the
territory would be in serious economic
difficulties and nobody else in the area
could replace the sort of aid France was
giving. □


BORAL LIMITED
Chairman's Address to Annual General Meeting
by Sir Peter Finley 0.8. E., D.F.C., November 12,1984
The Group’s Annual
Report and financial
statements previously
forwarded to shareholders
disclose that the Company
has again recorded a year of
increased sales and higher
earnings. Sales increased
appreciably and again
exceeded a billion dollars,
while the net profit of $95.1
million before extraordinary
items was substantially
above anything ever
previously earned.
The very good result
reflects the increased
economic activity in areas
where the Company
operates, both nationally and
internationally, and from the
very substantial benefits now
being realised within the
Group from the integration
of BMI Limited, acquired
during the previous financial
year.
The strong rural recovery following the breaking of
the drought, a substantial improvement in the housing
sector where new housing commencements, assisted by
the First Home Owner’s Scheme, rose by thirty per cent
to almost 137,000, and increased Government
expenditure on roads and public works have all been
positive factors in the record profit.
The Construction Materials Group had an excellent
year, particularly Road Surfacing where the additional
funds provided by the Australian Bicentennial Roads
Programme enabled the industry to operate at a
satisfactory level.
It is worth mentioning that the Commonwealth Roads
. Grant Act expires in June, 1985, and if expenditure on
roads is to be maintained at current levels, which in our
view is both desirable and necessary in the national
interest, the amount of money made available will need to
be increased, otherwise
inflation will reduce
expenditure in real terms
between now and 1988.
In the United States of
America, continued strong
growth in the housing
industry saw our sales
exceed Asloo million for the
first time. Profits were also
appreciably higher. The U.K.
operations remain profitable
in spite of a difficult year due
to a reduction in Government
expenditure on public works
and the prolonged coal
miners’ strike, which is
having a most adverse effect
on the United Kingdom
generally.
At last year’s Annual
Meeting, I reported on the
satisfactory progress that
had been made in the
integration and streamlining
of Boral’s and BMl’s
operations. The task was
substantially completed
during the year ended on
June 30 last, and the results
overall have met and in fact
exceed our expectations
when the take-over was
contemplated.
The Company’s ten year
financial history set out on
pages 46 and 47 of the
Annual Report discloses an
unbroken record of progress.
Over the period from 1975 to
1984, sales have increased
eleven fold, profits by almost
the same multiple and
earnings per share, notwith-
standing five bonus issues, have been maintained. We
have managed to fund our growth by the judicious use
of scrip, from retained earnings and the strong cash
flow generated within the Group, without recourse to
shareholders since 1974.
The recent one for five bonus issue will participate in
the final dividend to be paid on November 16, 1984,
effectively increasing this year’s dividend to shareholders
by 10% compared with the preceding year. The dividend
has a two and* a half times cover and has been restored to
a level in keeping with that previously established by the
Company but temporarily diluted as at June, 1983,
following the large number of shares issued in the
acquisition of BMI.
During the year to June, 1984, the Group’s strong
cash flow from trading receipts from the disposal of
surplus land, buildings and investments, and firm control
of working capital, has
produced a marked reduction
in debt. Total debt compared
to shareholders’ funds was
reduced from 70% a year ago
to 46.5%, which is close to
the Company debt to equity
ratio prior to the BMI
acquisition.
While the year to June,
1984, was essentially a year
of consolidation, the
Company has nevertheless
continued to expand its
activities. The principal
acquisition was the 98%
interest in the Oklahoma


Brick Company acquired at a cost of
$lO million. The Company now operates
seven brickworks in the U.S.A. in the
States of Georgia, South Carolina,
Maryland, Oklahoma and Mississippi,
with a total capability to produce in
excess of 600 million bricks per annum,
which is about 400 million by Australian
brickmaking standards. The Fremont
Tile Plant was reopened early in July
last year and a third tile line has been
installed at Rialto, near Los Angeles, to
meet the very strong demand for tiles in
California. In addition, a new Concrete
Tile Plant is being built in Florida, which on present
planning will be completed and in production in the second
quarter of 1985.
The year also saw the completion of the Liquefied
Petroleum Gas Terminal at Port Botany in Sydney at a
cost in excess of $l7 million, which will assist the
continued expansion of LPG sales in New South Wales.
This was the last of the Group’s five LPG Terminals built
along the East Coast from Townsville in Queensland to
Devonport in Tasmania. Further expenditure in the
Energy Division was also incurred when the LPG assets
of CIG in Tasmania were purchased as from July 1 last.
During the year the M.V “Kowulka”, a 23,500 tonne
bulk carrier owned jointly with CSR, was launched in
Korea and is now engaged in transporting gypsum and
sugar on the Australian coast.
In July, 1984, the Company, which already owned 39%
of the Oil Company of Australia N.L. (OCA), made an offer
for the balance of the outstanding shares it did not already
own. The offer of 90 cents per share closed on October 8,
1984, and Boral now owns 83% of the Company for a total
cost of $66 million. OCA is receiving revenue from its oil
interests in the Jackson and associated fields in South
Western Queensland and will also share in what appears
to be a most significant oil discovery at Bodalla South.
OCA also owns close to 40% of the Denison Trough
Gas Fields in Queensland. The development of this area
continues, and it is likely a substantial quantity of gas
from this field will go to Gladstone. OCA has other
interests in the Surat Basin, in Queensland and New
South Wales, and in two areas of Western Australia,
where one has disclosed traces of oil.
In addition, Boral’s interest in the Galilee Basin, which
continues to be evaluated, although drilling has been
temporarily suspended, is now managed by OCA on the
Company’s behalf.
The acquisition of OCA not only strengthens Boral’s
position as a gas supplier complementary to our extensive
gas interests in Queensland, but also provides a
worthwhile diversification from the Company’s building
and construction related
activities, at a relatively
modest cost.
It is pleasing to report a
marked improvement in the
Boral Group’s safety
performance. Over 50% of
the work places had an
unblemished record with no
lost time for injuries during
the year to June, 1984. This
excellent record has also
helped to contain the
disturbing increase in the
cost of Workers’
Compensation Insurance
premiums over the last few
BORAL
years. Contributing to this success was
the commitment to safety by all levels of
management and the effectiveness of
safety committees, comprising
management and employees, working
closely together.
There has been one change in the
Company’s principal Board during the
year. As previously announced, Mr. John
Landels retired as a member of the
Board following the decision of Caltex
(Australia) Limited to sell its
shareholding in this Company. I am
pleased to report that Mr. J. B. Leslie,
A. 0., M.C., accepted the invitation to fill that vacancy. Mr.
Leslie, amongst other things, is the Chairman of Qantas
Airways Limited, Capel Court Corporation Limited, and a
Director of a number of other Companies.
In addition, I mention that Mr. R. E. Camm,
Chairman of the Sugar Board, was appointed to the Board
of our subsidiary company, Gas Corporation of Queensland
Limited. In both cases, the Directors appointed will bring
a breadth of experience and knowledge to the
deliberations of the respective Boards.
At the last Annual Meeting I reported that the Boral
Employee Share Plan had been introduced and can now
report a most pleasing response in that over 2,000
employees took advantage of this initial offer to purchase
shares in the Company. A further offer is currently being
made to employees.
I would now like to bring you up to date on our
progress since the commencement of the new financial
year and prospects for the full year.
It would be unrealistic to expect that the rate of
growth in sales and profits during the past year could be
maintained. Nevertheless, the Company operates in those
sectors of the economy which have been relatively strong
over the past year and there are indications these
conditions will continue, certainly for the time being. We
expect to earn a net profit somewhat in excess of $lOO
million during the current financial year and I am pleased
to report that results for the four months to the end of
October are appreciably ahead of the corresponding period
last year. We are therefore confident that the higher profit
we are budgeting for in the current year will be achieved.
In addition to our very extensive base here in
Australia, the Company is firmly established with sizeable
operations in both the United States and the United
Kingdom, which increases the opportunities enormously
for further growth and expansion which I believe the
Company has the capacity to continue during the
current year.
Finally, on behalf of both shareholders and my Board
colleagues, I would like to express our thanks and
appreciation to the Group’s
Managing Director, Sir Eric
Neal, and to employees at all
levels on the excellent
results achieved during the
past year.
P. H. Finley
Chairman


BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
CSR’s battle to reconcile
the sweet and the sour
The world sugar glut has cost one of Australia's corporate giants, CSR Ltd, dearly
but so have some of its efforts to diversify. DA VID HASELHURST examines
the predicament and weighs up the company’s prospects.
BRYAN KELMAN chief executive
of CSR Ltd must be the least envied
man at the top in Australian business.
When he stepped into the general
manager’s chair in 1983, he inherited,
mounting debts and plunging income
with little room to manoeuvre the
corporate ship from its rocky course.
CSR last week announced another
not-unexpected but still disappointing
result for the half-year to September 30
plus a warning that a poor second
half was in prospect.
The sugar, mining and building
materials conglomerate borrowed heav-
ily over the past five years to move into
coal, oil and gas and it is locked into
this expansion when world sugar and
coal markets are in a state of collapse.
Kelman’s predecessor, Sir Gordon
Jackson, announced his retirement in
July 1982.(Tw0 years earlier, in a speech
to a group of management graduates, he
had said: “Leave before you have been
in the job too long. Better to go when
everyone wants you to stay than to stay
until everyone wants you to go.”)
A year before his retirement an-
nouncement, CSR’s profits had reached
a record $ll2 million for 1980-81.
Despite the massive plunge into energy,
minerals and other activities, 52 percent
of the result came from the then-
booming sugar sector. The following
year, however, the crunch emerged. In
June 1982, profit slipped 26 percent to
$82.4 million as a downturn in the
world sugar market halved earnings
from that sector and the recession bit
into other export commodity prices.
In his 10 years as general manager,
Jackson led the accelerated thrust into
diversification - boosting CSR’s total
assets employed 3.6 times to $2660
million by 1982 (today, $2960 million).
But, in that time, total liabilities rose
almost five times to $1335 million in
1982 (now, $l4Bl million). On top of
that, the company is responsible for
almost $1 billion in debt off the balance
sheet in financing its purchase of Delhi
International Oil Corp and its share of
Chief executive Bryan Kelman: the man in the hot seat
Cooper Basin oilfield development.
When Jackson took over as chief
executive in 1972, CSR netted $20.6
million for the year. One-third came
from sugar, another third from building
materials and a quarter from its earlier
mining investments in iron ore (20.4
percent of the Mount Newman project)
and bauxite-alumina (51 percent of
Gove Alumina).


Sir Gordon Jackson: thrust into diversification
The company was determined to
continue diversifying beyond the cycli-
cal sugar industry and Jackson an-
nounced that CSR was studying
“growth industries” in which it was not
then engaged.
The next year brought three par-
ticularly significant investments:
■ A joint venture company, Cement
Industries Pty Ltd, was formed to ac-
quire Australian and Kandos Cement
Holdings Ltd with Pioneer Concrete
Services Ltd (50 percent) providing $5.5
million of the funds and CSR (50
percent) a generous $43 million.
■ The first venture into coal came
with the $5.2 million purchase of
Buchanan Borehole Collieries Pty Ltd.
■ In July 1973, CSR bought 50
percent of Home Units of Australia Ltd.
Fourteen months later, CSR wrote off
its $6.1 million investment when the
company collapsed with borrowings of
$6O million.
Other acquisitions with sometimes
mixed results proceeded in subsequent
years across a wide range of activities.
But, despite the company’s determina-
tion to diversify beyond sugar, it con-
tinued to invest heavily in that industry.
In 1975, it launched a $llO million
capital works program in its mills plus
the $5O million takeover of Australian
Estates (which added three mills to the
group).
Nevertheless, the thrust into coal
eclipsed all else in the 1970 s when CSR
launched in 1979 the then-biggest
takeover in Australia with its $4BO
million acquisition of Thiess Holdings
Ltd. In total, about $7OO million was
invested into coal by the early 1980 s as
the bottom dropped out of the market.
Then, in 1981, an even greater
plunge was made into oil and gas with
the $530 million takeover of Delhi
International plus development com-
mitments on the Cooper Basin that
lifted the oil play’s eventual cost to
around $1 billion. No really significant
income will accrue from this investment
for another five years, however, until the
funds borrowed to buy Delhi are repaid.
So hard-pressed was the company
for cash by the end of 1982 that it even
sold its headquarters office buildings in
Sydney, for some $6O million, and
leased them back. Several hundred
million dollars have been realised in
other divestments but much of that has
been offset against asset writedowns and
other extraordinary losses.
Since 1981, when staff numbers
peaked at 16,100, the number of
employees has been reduced to 13,500.
The major staff reductions in the past
six months were achieved through the
closure and sale of the loss-making
Gunston copper mine in South
Australia and the sale of Thiess Petrosea
(an equipment-hire firm in Singapore
which employed 700). It was sold to
Clough Engineering (WA) Pty Ltd.
In the year to March 1984, CSR
managed to lift profit 23 percent to
$91.7 million mainly due to cost
savings, a buoyant building industry
and some improvement in sugar,
bauxite and alumina prices,
The profit mix for the last full year to
March 1984, from the five operating
divisions was: Sugar (28 percent; pre-
viously 15.5), building materials (30
percent; previously 17.3), aluminium,
minerals and chemicals (16.7 percent;
previously 23), coal (12.9 percent; pre-
viously 22), oil and gas (12.5 percent;
previously 22).
During that year, the benchmark
sugar price for the spot market (the New
York No 11 price) averaged U 58.05
cents a pound. But it has dropped
sharply and during the six months to
September bottomed at US3.5c/lb.
About 25 percent of Australia’s sugar
production is sold on the domestic
market at government-fixed prices, now
about twice as high as world prices.
Another 30 percent is sold under long-
term contracts which insulate earnings
against the vagaries of the market. But
the balance is at the mercy of a world
market where prices are below cost of
production. The sugar glut is primarily
due to exports of subsidised beet pro-
duction, over-production of beet sugar
in the European Economic Community,
World sugar stocks stand at 37 million
tonnes, compared with a more normal
stock level of 25 million and there is no
sign of the glut being eliminated.
CSR does not break down its profits
sources in its interim report but in the
latest September half-year it claimed an
11 percent increase in net profit to $49.2
million, of which at least one third was
due to the building materials division.


The sugar division probably con-
tributed more than 20 percent, despite
the free market prices averaging
US4.9c/lb 49 percent lower than a
year earlier. The result was distorted,
however, with unusually high revenue
included from sugar sales some $25
million of which normally would have
occurred in the second half.
With the prospect of lower sugar
earnings in the current second half plus
CSR’s prediction that building
materials sales will ease in the new year,
shareholders have been warned that it
will be difficult to match the first-half
result in the remainder of the year.
So complex has CSR become that
analysts’ predictions and assessments
on the company vary widely.
Ahead of last week’s interim, a range
of brokers’ pamphlets had been cir-
culated predicting 1984-85 net profit
within a wide range from
less than $lOO million to
$l2O million.
The probability is that
the net will be little
changed from last year’s
$92 million and the market
has anticipated such a flat
performance by marking
back the shares from a
year’s high of $4.41 to a
recent low of $2.93 before
a modest recovery to a
range of around $3.10.
At prices around $3,
brokers J. B. Were and Son
have been urging clients to buy CSR as
a recovery stock with a forecast of
earnings moving up from last year’s 26c
share to 32c in 1984-85 on the basis that:
■ The shares are cheap on an histori-
cal basis and offer investors a potential
total 20 percent return in dividend and
capital appreciation.
■ Oil, gas and minerals divisions are
performing well following management
restructuring and rationalisation.
■ The world sugar price can only go
up; the coal market has bottomed and
prices will rise next year.
By contrast, resources analyst Dr lan
Storey of Meares and Philips Ltd,
recommends that clients sell the con-
glomerate CSR and re-invest in a range
of individual resource plays for an
improved share price performance.
As an example, he recommends
selling five CSR at $3.10 to realise
$15.50 which would go close to paying
for a share each in Queensland Coal
Trust ($1.15), Santos ($6.30), Bundaberg
Sugar ($2.25), Comalco ($2.50) and a
building materials interest through
Boral or Janies Hardie.
Storey’s forecast for CSR in 1984-85
is a net of $9B million or 28c a share
and there are those analysts, including
this writer, who would see that as
optimistic. □
HOUSING
NSW move
to boost
home finance
By DEBORAH HOPE
HOUSING finance in New South
Wales should receive a considerable
boost next year following State govern-
ment moves to encourage the growth of
a strong secondary mortgage market
here.
The measures, effective from January
1, include the abolition of the 0.6 per-
cent stamp duty on mortgage-backed
securities and 'the establishment of a
mortgage corporation to operate the
Treasurer Ken Booth
market.
The corporation is to be
jointly owned by the NSW
government and the
private sector. State
Treasurer Ken Booth has
already received strong ex-
pressions of interest in the
plan from a number of
corporations, including
some foreign banks. Talks
with these corporations are
expected to begin next
month.
Modelled on the Ameri-
can Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation, the NSW
corporation will issue mortgage-backed
securities, such as housing bonds, to
investors against a pool of real estate
mortgages created by financial institu-
tions such as banks and building
societies, rather than being backed by a
government guarantee.
Moves in this direction began in the
1982-83 NSW budget with the abolition
of the stamp duty on secondary
mortgage transfers. The failure of this
measure alone to stimulate much activ-
ity in this area, convinced the govern-
ment of the need for further reforms.
Similar moves are under way in Victoria
and Queensland.
One of the great attractions of the
secondary market is that it provides a
bridge between the traditional mortgage
market financial institutions and
other investment markets. As well as
offering the means to circulate money
among lending institutions, it attracts
investors from outside this traditional
mortgage market, such as superannua-
tion funds, insurance companies, invest-
ment companies and individuals. This
means new sources of funds for housing
mortgages. This is important at a time
when increasing deregulation of
Australia’s financial system will allow
building societies, a major home lender,
to lend a greater proportion of their
funds for purposes other than housing.
It should also provide building
societies with greater flexibility and
security, since their assets will be more
easily made liquid in times of
emergency. Building societies in NSW
at present hold almost $1 billion worth
of short-term assets and securities to
cover them when they need cash in a
hurry.
The NSW government is hopeful of
echoing the spectacular success of the
secondary mortgage market in America,
where it has grown since 1970 to
become one of its largest financial
markets. By December 1983, more than
20 percent, or $3OO billion worth of all
real estate mortgages in the US, were
“securitised.” Once circulating on the
market, it is estimated these mortgages
could generate funds up to 10 times that
amount.
NSW plans to seek co-operation
with the other states to allow the
corporation to operate nationally
without restrictive prospectus require-
ments.
Although it is aware that remaining
interest rate controls will have a
restraining role in the development of
the market, the NSW government is
hopeful that commonwealth plans to
further deregulate the financial system
in Australia will diminish this as a
problem.
As part of Premier Neville Wran’s
objective to establish Sydney as a major
financial centre, the NSW budget also
included a measure to abolish from
January 1 stamp duty on the transfer of
private interest-bearing securities, such
as debentures. The abolition of the duty
will apply to both fixed and floating rate
securities.
This move is expected to promote in
Sydney the development of a market for
trading debentures and bonds issued by
companies. According to Wran, the
existing 0.6 percent stamp duty on
transfers of these commodities has pre-
vented growth in this area. By contrast,
transfer of government and semi-
government securities carries no stamp
duty or other imposts.
Announcing the initiative, Wran said
he was confident federal and state
government securities would not lose
ground as a result: “Premier state
bonds, like commonwealth bonds and
Australian savings bonds, offer absolute
security, a factor which will maintain
their strong appeal. Nevertheless, the
government’s action will help create a
competitive and innovative private
bond market, which is critical to any
advanced financial system.”
Wran said the costs of funds to the
private sector should be lowered as a
result of this measure, meaning a boost
to investment and so to jobs. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Further into exotica
GREAT EASTERN MINES Ltd was
born in the 1940 s as a brickmaker in
Victoria, switched to tungsten mining in
northern Queensland and then to a
kaolin pit in Western Australia fol-
lowed by an emerald prospect. Now, it
has a spread of gold prospects, some
production and oil and gas interests.
But its latest venture is more exotic than
anything in its past.
Great Eastern is about to win control
of a cartoon animation company in the
United States which produces training
films for the country’s Defence depart-
ment and feature material for Warner
Communications and Marvel Comics.
This has come about because of an
opportunity cleverly recognised by
chairman Wayne Ryder, the Perth
chartered accountant whose group of
companies maintains an office in Col-
orado to supervise its petroleum ex-
ploration investments. He became ac-
quainted with the principals of a new
business set up in Denver 14 months
ago to adapt computergraphics
technology to cartoon animation. The
people involved needed money for ex-
pansion but they also wanted to get
some capital gains out for themselves if
they went to a public listing.
Under US law, “insiders” who
vendor their operations into a public
vehicle cannot sell their shares for a
minimum of two years and may then
“drip-feed” out only a small proportion
for several subsequent years.
Ryder liked the prospects of the
computergraphics business and
suggested a solution to the dilemma of
the founders. Resultant is an agreement
in principle under which Great Eastern
is to buy 51 percent of the animation
company for an issue to the owners of
some 3 million shares (which they may
freely trade) plus about $U5750,000
cash ($850,000). Ryder will retain board
and financial management control and,
immediately following the purchase, an
underwritten issue in the animation
company has been arranged to raise
SUS 3 million. Great Eastern equity then
will reduce to 30 percent of a well-
cashed-up company.
Projected earnings are hundreds of
thousands of dollars in the current year,
rising to SUS 3 million net by the
fourth year.
Great Eastern’s 21.79 million listed
options expired from quotation last
Friday and the company expects about
half to be exercised raising some
$2.75 million at 25c.
Ahead of the options issue, the com-
pany’s 27.7 million shares had what
directors said was a net tangible asset
backing of 28c each based on “hard”
assets such as the costs of acquistion or
development of projects and market
value of investments but no value for
potential in gold or oil projects or the
company’s well-known first right of
refusal over Bill Powell’s Coolgardie
gold mine.
Potential conflict between the two
publicly-listed contenders for Powell’s
Find Great Eastern and Cord Hold-
ings could draw a lot of attention to
these stocks in the new year. At 26c, I
can see upside in this stock par-
ticularly since the company earned 5.4 c
a share in 1983-84 from gold operations
that are likely to be expanded.

WILDCAT
The ‘Bullfighter’ still full of fight
JOHN WOOLCOTT Forbes - one-
time financier and the “Bullfighter” of
the betting ring at Randwick and other
tracks before World War II has com-
mitted his colorful life story to paper.
Martin Dougherty, former editor of
the Sydney Daily Mirror, has completed
a biography, scheduled for publication
next March, which traces the rise, fall
and ultimate survival of the man whose
audacious tycoonery was frequently the
subject of headlines in years gone by.
Woolcott Forbes will be 82 next
March, but is still as active as a man half
his age. He told Wildcat he would be in
Kalgoorlie this week. He wants to take
geologist George Compton and a wire
rope ladder down to inspect the 100-
metre level of an abandoned gold mine.
He’s not quite saying where it is,
however, because he thinks he’s on to
another “good one.”
What a holiday!
IF THE plans of thoroughbred stud
Blandford Ltd eventuate, some US
stallions could find themselves serving
mares during their holidays the
breeding “off-season.”
The reason is the tie-up Blandford,
soon to be listed on local stock ex-
changes, has with the leading Kentucky
stud, Spendthrift Farm Inc. Interests
associated with Spendthrift, including
the stud’s president and chief executive,
Brownell Combs 11, will have nearly 30
percent of Blandford after a share swap
which gives Blandford around 1.25 per-
cent of the US stud.
The Spendthrift connection is ex-
pected to promote a developing
relationship between the Australian and
US studs, where horses breed in differ-
ent seasons.
Terry Mulhall, a director of
Blandford and one of the founders of
the thoroughbred syndication group
Hyperion Thoroughbreds Ltd and prime
mover behind the original Blandford
Trust, says the new company “would be
interested in breeding in August to
December in the US when their stallions
are doing nothing.”
Mulhall says Blandford is looking to
buy interests in well-bred US mares,
mate them to US stallions in their off-
season, then have the mares foal in
Kentucky. The progeny could then be
bought back to Australia when old
enough to travel. The offspring would
be eligible to race within the Australian
racing ages.
The stallions available through
Spendthrift includes Exclusive Native,
a champion sire by the champion sire-
of-sires, Raise a Native, whose dynasty
includes the highly performed horses
Affirmed and Our Native. Spendthrift’s
main drawcard, Seattle Slew, is the US
sire of the moment, syndicated for more
than $lOO million.
Blandford hopes to introduce the US
blood and cross it with the leading
Australian bloodline, that of Star
Kingdom.
Formed from the reconstruction of a
listed company, Clyde-Granville Ltd,
Blandford will have a capital of 11.3
million ordinary 50 cent fully-paid
shares, the same number of options
exercisable at par, and a further four
million shares issued to Guy and other
US interests.
The main assets of the company will
be 2300 ha of lush properties in the
Hunter Valley, bought into the com-
pany at $4.4 million, and nominations
to the stallion Full On Aces and The
Fort, now standing at Blandford, valued
at $700,000.
Floats away
THE spectacular success of the Kidston
Gold Mines Ltd float two months ago
has inevitably encouraged other pro-
moters to draw comparisons.
Two prospectuses now out are being
discussed in such terms:
■ Augold NL, with an offering of 6
million shares at 25c is being
underwritten by Peter Hains and Co.
■ Pan Australian Mining Ltd is
seeking $11.2 million with an issue of 28
million 25c shares at 40c each
underwritten by Ord Minnett Ltd.
The shares, issued at $1.60, gave
stags a 20 percent profit when they listed
on September 6 and have since traded
above $3. The $3O million Kidston float
gave the public an equity of 15 percent
in the company with Elders-IXL (15
percent) and Placer Development (70
percent). In calendar 1985, the Kidston
mine, 300 km west of Townsville, is
projected to become the biggest gold
producer in Australia with an output of
281,0000 z.
The principal project in the Pan
“Ed, next year when I reach retirement - please! No fanfare. No banquet
No speeches. No silver tray. No fishing gear. I just want to slip out quietly
with my old attache case full of big ones!”


Australian portfolio of prospects is Mt
Leyshon, 140 km south-west of
Townsville a 50:50 joint venture with
Noranda.
Reserves are assessed at 2 million
tonnes of 2gm/tonne ore within a larger
probable and possible resource of 16.5
million tonnes of I.sgm/tonne material.
In a study prepared by Ord’s mining
research partner, Norm Miskelly, it is
suggested that PanAust, with a pro-
jected annual production of 58,0000 z
from 1987, is better value than Kidston.
For, on a market capitalisation basis per
ounce of average annual production,
the value for Kidston is $1965/oz, while
PanAust at its issue price has a value of
$B3l/oz on its 50 percent of Mt
Leyshon. That suggests a good crop for
the stags.
Augold NL is a more grass roots
offering, with six low-grade, high-
volume prospects and two high-grade
vein prospects in Queensland and
Victoria.
Half the prospects have been farmed
out to majors, including Seltrust,
Newmont, Amoco and Freeport, to fund
exploration.
But the prospect of most interest,
known as the Rainbow, is yet to be
farmed out, although the promoters
suggest talks have been held with CRA,
Seltrust, Freeport and Placer Develop-
ments.
Brisbane geologist Neil Stuart and
associates got title over the Rainbow
prospect, near Monto in south-east
Queensland, and farmed out 88 percent
of it to Augold. Consultant geologists
Kardon Investments Pty Ltd have identi-
fied anomalous gold throughout the
prospect and suggest it is structurally
similar to both Kidston and Mt
Rawdon. □
THE CHARTIST
Adelaide Steamship full speed ahead
by Russell hander
THE BRIDGE DATA chart shows
Adelaide Steamship on a monthly basis
back to 1975, adjusted for issues. This
illustrates that the stock came out of
nowhere as recently as 1979, weathered
the 1982 recession without too much
damage and is now again on the rise
after pausing for breath mid year.
Other takeover specialists such as
Industrial Equity, FAI, Boral, Bond
Corporation, Koitaki, Keywest and Latec,
to name a few, are also the subject of
sharemarket enthusiasm at present.
The Adelaide Steamship monthly
chart is of particular interest as it
highlights the fact that the uplift be-
tween March 1983 and January 1984
carried approximately the same dist-
ance as the previous upward move in
1980 and 1981. This phenomenon has
long been recognised in charting circles
and is usually referred to as the
“measured move.”
These moves can occur over both
short and long periods. For example,
the idea of flags (small retracements
lasting only a few days) occurring half
way up sheer rises in agitated stocks is
also well documented in charting texts.
The breakout into a new upward trend
channel since July 1984 by Adelaide
Steamship and most of the other stocks
mentioned raises the possibility that
another measured move of similar scale
to the two previous episodes may be
underway. This would translate into a
target price for Adelaide Steamship of
$6.60 or so.
The writer discloses an interest in shares
in both Adelaide Steamship Co. and
Keywest.

to fight its
way through the
wind, you’re the
one who gets tired.
Once most luxury cars reach 70
km/h wind roar begins to intrude into
the cabin.
A whistle from the roof
gutter here, a moan from the
wheel arches there.
You find yourself raising your voice
to converse with your passengers.
Or turning up the radio. And you
finish your journey tired.
In designing the new Audi 100, our
German engineers were determined to
silence these problems for good.
Instead of using human stylists, the
task of shaping the 100 was given over
entirely to our wind tunnel at Ingolstadt.
Over thousands of hours testing, a
softly rounded wedge shape evolved.
With every detail blended in, giving
the wind nothing to which it could cling.
The side windows have their glass
brought out flush with the bodywork.
Even the underside of the car is a
single sheet of steel to smooth the airflow.
Wheels magazine exclaimed,
“... there is no impression of wind noise
at all, whether at 100 km/h or 200 km/h.”
Europe’s motoring writers were
more than a little impressed, too.
They voted the new Audi 100
“World Car of the Year ’83.”
It seems that, after a tiring day,
nobody needs a tiring car.
There are 145 Audi service centres

THE MODEST FARMED
Let’s not think too big
by Bert Kelly
RECENTLY I heard about a small
company located on the coast near
Geelong, which was making wet suits
and other surfing gear to export all
round the world.
I was told that the secret of the
company’s success was that it was
owned in a loose kind of partnership by
its operators who worked like steam
making wet suits when the surf was
down and surfed like steam when the
surf was up.
But when I rang them, I was told
rather sadly that the success of the
company had made its growth inevit-
able, so now it is a factory and is
unionised and its people are not now
able to belt down to the beach if the surf
calls loudly.
The management emphasises that it
is not union control that has brought
this about, it is simply the increased size
of the workforce. When there were only
a few of them, they all knew each other
and a slacker could be detected and
leant on, but when their numbers in-
creased, evidently they started to look at
one another out of the corners of their
eyes lest some were not pulling their
weight.
I was sorry to hear this but the
experience ties in with our experience
on farms.
If farmers had to contend with farm
workers who behaved like workers in
large factories, we would have all been
broke years &go.
If my men thought that things were
being done in the wrong way, they
would tell me so. If they had to go into
the town during a working day, they
went. If I asked them to work longer
hours for some reason, they did it
cheerfully. In short, we worked happily
and effectively together.
But when I told this to a seminar
recently, industrial relations experts
present admitted that this kind of
mutual respect and consideration was
possible and indeed desirable when the
production units were small, but quite
impossible when they are big. They
seemed to feel that awards must be
tailored to suit big business and small
ones do not loom very large in the
industrial relations world.
I wonder if this is really so. Even in
the manufacturing sector, there are
76,000 people employed in the 19,693
factories which employ fewer than 20
people. In the service sector where most
of our people are employed, the small
business proportion would be im-
measurably greater. Indeed, I think, but
do not know for certain, that if all the
sectors of the economy were bulked
together, the number of people
employed in work places with fewer
than 20 people would be greater than in
those with more than 20. Garages,
service stations, panel beaters, imple-
ment repairers, hairdressers, offices,
shops and so on, they are all small
businesses but are largely controlled by
arbitration awards designed more to
suit big businesses. If you doubt this,
ask any small business organisation.
However, it may not be essential that
the benefits of smallness must auto-
matically disappear as work places in-
crease in size.
There have been many US examples
where big factories have broken their
work force into small groups and Volvo
did this with at least some of its car
plants. It did so in the hope of keeping
the advantages of smallness in the form
of friendliness within the group and
friendly rivalry between groups.
I remember when we were carting
hay at the same time as our neighbors,
we would be continually looking across
the fence to see if we were keeping
ahead of them. And after church on
Sunday we soon found out that they had
been measuring their performance
against ours.
I suppose some purists would frown
on friendly rivalry of this kind but I
know from experience that it made a
dull and demanding job into one in
which there was just an element of fun.
It is usually better to be busy than bored
and swinging on the end of a
pitchfork can get awfully boring.
I never found shearing boring
because each sheep presented a different
problem; besides, there was always
another shearer going past me at the
speed of light. But I guess I would have
found the production lines of some of
the big factories I have seen very boring.
I suppose stern critics like Eccles will
frown at me for daring to hope that, in
getting the benefits of cheapness of
production in big factories, it might be
possible to keep some of the benefits of
smallness as well.
I hate to think that the people
making those wet suits must miss out on
the fun in life just because they were
successful.
It is not surprising that dinosaurs
were big animals; that is why they
became extinct. Bruce would work
better if he was smaller. □

PIERPONT
Where did all the goodwill go?
THE SEASON of goodwill is almost
uniquely designed to put Pierpont into a
towering rage.
The thought of the vast amounts of
money Mrs Pierpont is about to spend
on our mendicant grandchildren,
coupled with the sight of snow-covered
reindeer in Myers windows when the
heat is buckling the Bourke Street tram
tracks, routinely reduces your
correspondent to crabbed malevolence
come mid-November.
But this year has been
worse than usual. It may have
been Pierpont’s imagination,
but Christmas seemed to be-
gin earlier than customary
with an invitation to a Santa
Claus Party before even the
Melbourne Cup was run.
Then there has been an
election campaign which has
lasted for longer than Poor
Fellow, My Country. And to
top it all off, the Sydney Stock
Exchange computer has
broken down.
Pierpont is not sure
whether the last event is not
the most trying of the entire
Yuletide season. Your
correspondent was trying to
bale out of some Vapocure
shares the other day and rang
his sydney broker because sydney is
normally the thickest market in the
stock.
Before going further, Pierpont
should perhaps emphasise that he has
by no means turned into a technology
buff in his old age. He had bought
Vapocure as an old-fashioned inside
trader, having heard over the Venison
Esterhazy at the Croesus Club that Vaps
had just signed and sealed the deal with
Dupont. Pierpont promptly or as
promptly as a seven-course lunch
permits bought too many Vapocure at
$9.50.
They raced to $11.50, collapsed to
$7.50 before Pierpont could unload and
have recently been hanging around the
$9 mark. Note that although Pierpont’s
insider information was correct, he still
stands to lose money on the stock. No
wonder the NCSC are trying to outlaw
inside trading.
Anyway, Pierpont rang Sydney just
after the close of trading and the broker
said: “On the screen, Vapocure are
showing $9 buyer, $9.30 seller, no
trades.”
“No trades all day?”
“since the water got into the com-
puter the other day it ain’t been working
too well,” the broker said. “I think that
quote’s wrong anyway because they
split one-for-two today.”
“Ask the floor trader,” Pierpont
suggested.
“Trading’s over so he’s just come
back (pause)... He says they’re $4.95.”
“Sell,” screamed Pierpont, scenting a
profit.
“Just a sec. It might be $4.45.”
Pierpont drew a deep breath. “Does
anybody know what’s going on up
there?” he asked.
“Well, we do during trading, because
you can ask the floor trader to walk over
and look at the board. But when we
have to rely on the screens we’re not so
sure.”
Pierpont hung up, muttering dread-
ful imprecations about the machine age,
and tried to calm his temper by riffling
through a few balance sheets.
It soon occurred to your
correspondent that he is not the only
denizen of this fair land whose stock of
goodwill has been greatly diminished
this season. Half the companies in
Australia have written goodwill com-
pletely out of their accounts.
For the benefit of those readers who
are innocent of the pea-and-thimble
games accountants play, perhaps he
should first explain goodwill.
Let us say G. J. Coles & Co buys a
store that is licensed to sell liquor. The
store and the stock might be worth half
a million dollars net of liabilities, but of
course it is really worth much more than
this because it makes profits. Let us say
Coles, expecting to make high profits
from this business, will pay a premium
and buy it for $BOO,OOO. Coles has thus,
in this hypothetical example, paid
$300,000 more for the business than the
value of the net tangible assets. The
$500,000 is shown on the asset side of
Coles balance sheet as property and
stock. The $300,000 is shown under
intangible assets as goodwill, sometimes
termed “premium on consolidation.”
Analysts for years have been un-
comfortable about large
amounts of goodwill in bal-
ance sheets and have been
muttering that companies
should write it off. The com-
panies say that as long as the
business acquired is earning
good profits its resale value is
as high as ever and there is no
reason to write it down.
From March 1985, the
scorers are changing the rules.
Companies will be given the
option of either (a) writing off
all their goodwill or (b)
writing it off against profit-
and-loss account over a maxi-
mum 20 years from now on.
Quite a few major com-
panies appear to have
anticipated this by wiping out
goodwill in their 1984 balance
sheets. Coles, for example, has written
off $2.5 million goodwill arising from
the purchase of liquor stores. The
retailer now carries, as far as Pierpont
can ascertain, no goodwill in its group
accounts.
Burns, Philp & Co Ltd has done the
same. Note 2 to the accounts shows a
net $9.5 million goodwill has been
written off as capital losses in the latest
year. Confusingly, these figures do not
match any of the goodwill write-off
numbers in note 10, which gives the
movements in reserves.
North Broken Hill took an even
bigger bath, writing off $69 million. This
was part of the difference between the
cost of its investment in EZ Industries
and the value of the assets acquired.
This write-off was the main reason for
North’s shareholders’ funds falling
from $524 million to $487 million in its
1984 equity-consolidated accounts.
John Fairfax Ltd wiped out the whole of
its $13.7 million goodwill. Castlemaine
Tooheys Ltd also cleaned out its books,
writing off $26.5 million against the
general reserve. In brief, some $ll6
million has vanished from the assets of


five companies overnight because the
scorers have changed their minds.
Note that nothing else has happened
to change the underlying values of the
businesses. The ones that were bought at
a premium over net tangible assets and
have earned profits that justify that
premium are still earning profits. The
ones making losses should have been
written back years ago.
There is another way of looking at it.
Let us imagine that Blue Sky Mines No
Liability had bought some dog of a
company years ago which, in hindsight,
turned out to be badly overpriced. Ever
since then Blue Sky has been carrying a
big swag of goodwill in its accounts
while we wondered what we could do
about it. (If we sold the dog for its right
price we would incur a loss, which
would have to be shown as a write-off of
goodwill under abnormal items in the
profit-and-loss account, exposing the
extent of the directors’ misjudgement.)
Now, like manna from heaven,
comes this new, ruling of the scorers. We
have suddenly been given the opportun-
ity of writing off all goodwill on the
ground that we are conforming to a new
accounting standard. Some companies
have taken the opportunity to write
their goodwill off against reserves,
which means the big figures in brackets
do not even show up in the profit-and-
loss account at all. From March it will
have to be charged against the PL.
If you follow Pierpont’s drift, the
companies we should be concerned
about are, therefore, not the ones which
have taken the write-offs. They are the
ones which should have taken write-offs
but have not.
These companies are the ones with
large amounts of goodwill on the books
which will have to be written off at a
minimum of 5 percent a year from now
on.
Or, to put it another way, share-
holders need not extend goodwill to
companies which still have excessive
amounts of it. □
CHESS
The wheel of fortune
by Kerrey Shaw
ONE IS tempted sometimes to think of
strong chess players as well-oiled cal-
culating machines whose moves are
always dictated by objective analysis,
never by flights of fancy. However,
many successful players are gamblers at
heart and always ready to make a
sacrifice despite its result being hard to
assess.
Of past players, the best known for
their daring play were David Janowski
and Frank Marshall. They were inveter-
ate gamblers away from the board as
well. Each had a habit of turning up
regularly for tournaments held in
Monte Carlo and Ostend, the sites of
the most famous casinos in Europe.
Particularly for Janowski, the lure of
the red and black was just as powerful
as that of the black and white. Poor old
Janowsky, pockets bulging with first-
prize cash, would disappear into the
gaming rooms of Monte Carlo only to
emerge days later penniless once more.
When their chess gambles pay off,
such players can produce spectacular
results. The following game, played at
Breslau in 1912, is a case in point. In a
wild position with threats everywhere,
Marshall found himself in the
embarrassing position of having two
pieces attacked at once and appeared
certain to lose. Then, like a magician, he
pulled such a breathtaking move out of
his hat that it has been described ever
since as the most beautiful played on a
chessboard.
The story goes that, when the
significance of the move dawned on the
spectators, they showered the board
with gold coins. History does not record
whether Marshall invested this money
at the roulette table.

South Australia
ft’s no secret that South Australia
has a better industrial relations record
Over the last ten years, South Australia has achieved a consistent record for industrial harmony. During that time, other Australian
States have lost more than twice as many working days (per 1,000 employees) through industrial disputes.
An analysis of the figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the 12-month period to July 1984,
shows this trend is continuing. South Australia recorded a drop of
60%, while the national reduction was only 15%.
Our remarkable record has been attributed to management-
union co-operation. When disputes arise, UTLC policy is to
resolve the situation without resorting to strike action.
This climate of industrial harmony obviously leads to signif-
icantly lower operating costs. So your company should either be
more competitive or profitable in South Australia.
In the past we have kept to ourselves and simply got on
with the job of creating a better place to live and work. But now we’re
making no secret of the fact that we want to improve employment
opportunities by attracting new business to this State.
Better industrial relations are just one reason why you
should consider South Australia. For more information, fill in this

WORLD AFFAIRS
What Can Be Done
About Kaddafi?
Libya’s leader: A modern-day version of a Barbary pirate operating from the shores of Tripoli
A. NOGUES— SYGMA
There are ways to deal with him, but none are easy.
Muammar Kaddafi is the modern ver-
sion of a Barbary pirate, a reckless
rogue who preys on his neighbors and ex-
torts tribute from faraway powers. The
Reagan administration accuses him of prac-
ticing state terrorism on a grand scale, plot-
ting murder and subversion all over the
world. Somehow the Libyan leader gets
away with it; he is treated with gingerly
deference by some of the same statesmen he
is supposedly scheming to kill. The original
Barbary pirates eventually provoked the
infant United States of America to send its
Marines on a punitive expedition to the
shores of Tripoli. The man who rules in
Tripoli today hasn’t yet made such a fatal
misstep. But twice this month Kaddafi has
been caught red-handed, bungling a politi-
cal murder in Egypt and double-crossing
the French in Chad. Those escapades raise
again a question that most Western govern-
ments would prefer to ignore: what, if any-
thing, can be done about Kaddafi?
Washington has been trying to do some-
thing, without much luck so far. The ad-
ministration has boycotted Libyan crude
oil, asked U.S. workers to leave Libya, em-
bargoed the sale of military goods to Tripoli
and has provided a trickle of support for
anti-Kaddafi dissidents. “We’ve pulled
most of the levers,” says one of
Kaddafi’s American adversaries,
“but he’s still sitting there.” Now a
few senior administration officials
argue that the time has come to get
really tough. “If we can afford a
contra program in Nicaragua, we
can afford some similar operation
to dump Kaddafi,” says one.
“Whether we have to use Holly-
wood extras, or Egyptians or Mal-
tese gunrunners doesn’t make any
difference. He’s patently a men-
ace, and he’s got to go.”
But except for the hardest of
hard-liners, no one in Washington
has much enthusiasm for sending
U.S. troops into Libya or even for
sponsoring some sort of covert ac-
tion by American surrogates in the
region. Pentagon officials main-
tain that Kaddafi is a political
problem, not a military threat to
the United States, and should be
handled accordingly. Eventually,
Libya’s chief troublemaker may
do something rash enough to
transform the most dovish of
America’s allies into hawks. At
the moment, however, most of the
options for dealing with Kaddafi
are relatively mild. Among them:
The Silent Treatment: Some an-
alysts, including a few adminis-
tration experts, argue that Wash-
ington’s fulminations against
Kaddafi only feed his ego and his
reputation, both of which are
oversize already. Ignoring Kad-
dafi, this argument goes, might be
the best way to isolate him and cut
him down to size. Many of the
accusations against Kaddafi —
such as the claim that he mined the
Red Sea —have never been proved. Some
Western intelligence officials are skeptical
about recent charges that the Libyan “hit
list” contains the names of people like West
Germany’s Helmut Kohl, Britain’s Marga-
ret Thatcher and France’s Franqois Mitter-
rand. Whatever Kaddafi is really up to, it is
clear that he has become a convenient bete
noire for other nations.
Business as Usual: “Colonel Kaddafi is, I
may say, a fact,” French Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson remarked at a news con-
ference in Washington last week. “He is
there. He is the leader of Libya ... So to
ignore him would be a political mistake. We
want to have normal relations with Libya.”
Many nations in Western Europe and the
Middle East have bent over backward to
avoid tension with Kaddafi. But as France
learned, to its chagrin, Kaddafi cannot al-
ways be counted on to keep his side of the
bargain.
Two weeks ago, Mitterrand met with
Kaddafi on the island of Crete in a concilia-
tory summit arranged by one of the Libyan’s
European friends, Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou. As Kaddafi basked in


the respectability conferred
upon him by the meeting, he
was secretly receiving reports
from his hit squad in Egypt.
And after the summit ended, it
turned out that Kaddafi had
broken an agreement under
which Libya and France prom-
ised to withdraw their troops
from Chad. Last week Paris
warned that it would redeploy
its own forces if Kaddafi didn’t
play fair.
Political Pressure: For what
it’s worth, the Reagan adminis-
tration is considering ways to
isolate Kaddafi politically. One
possibility would be to seek a
vote in the U. N. Security Coun-
cil condemning Libyan subver-
sion around the world; the
United Nations might even be
asked to apply economic sanc-
tions. As a practical matter,
any such action would be pure-
ly symbolic. On a somewhat
more tangible plane, Washing-
ton is pressing Morocco’s King
Hassan II to abrogate the recent “merger”
of his kingdom with Libya. But everyone in
the Arab world expects that marriage of
convenience to fall apart anyway, as have
Libya’s periodic efforts at unification with
eight other Arab nations.
Economic Pressure: “I have always
thought that perhaps the only realistic way
to bring pressure on Kaddafi would be for
the [European Economic Community] to
take concerted action against Libya,” says
Sir Anthony Parsons, a retired British dip-
lomat. “The EEC, acting together, could
say that if he didn’t shape up, then they
would stop building his roads, his power
stations, his water-supply system. I don’t
think he wants to have his whole economy
falling into the hands of the U.S.S.R., and I
think he might respond.” So far, however,
Kaddafi has not caved in to heavy economic
pressure from Washington. By now the
Reagan administration has used up most of

its direct economic leverage on Libya and is
leaning on its allies to cut Kaddafi off. Bel-
gium apparently has been persuaded to back
away from a $1 billion nuclear-power deal
with Libya, and other West European coun-
tries have been pressured not to go after the
business themselves.
But it is unlikely that Libya’s major trad-
ing partners will give up their positions, if
only because Kaddafi’s oil revenues would
then be channeled to competitors in both
East and West. After a London police-
woman was killed by a Libyan gunman last
April, Britain broke off diplomatic rela-
tions. But two-way trade worth $6OO mil-
lion a year went right on, and 8,000 Britons
continued to work at well-paid jobs in Lib-
ya. Even Egypt, one of Kaddafi’s most out-
spoken enemies, might be reluctant to recall
its 200,000 workers from Libya.
Covert Action: Last week a conservative
Washington think tank, the Heritage Foun-
dation, urged the administration to “em-
ploy paramilitary assets” to weaken the
governments of Libya and several other
nations that “threaten United States inter-
ests.” Some of Reagan’s advisers have been
thinking along similar lines. Assassinating
Kaddafi seems to be out of the question; it’s
illegal and could be counterproductive as
well. But it might be possible to stir up anti-
Kaddafi elements among Libyan military
men, students, shopkeepers, Berber tribes-
men and fundamentalist Muslims. What
the United States could do, some hard-
liners argue, is to organize and support a
concerted military elfort by Libyan dissi-
dents and neighbors such as Egypt and Tu-
nisia to oust Kaddafi. One senior official
asks: “Who’s going to bail him out? The
Russians won’t, and the [Organization of
African Unity] won’t support him.”
The bloody but unsuccessful coup at-
tempt in Libya last May demonstrated that
there is significant internal opposition to
Kaddafi, but it also showed that he remains
in a strong position. “What you have to
remember is that he has looked after his own
people pretty well, and they don’t necessar-
ily think these attempts to kill foreign lead-
ers and dissidents are always a bad thing,”
says a senior British official. “It’s an insig-
nificant country, and I suspect that not a
few people are quite happy that the world
thinks Libya is a very dangerous power.”
Military Intervention: Administration
hawks concede that an effort to depose Kad-
dafi isn’t likely to succeed without the direct
use of U.S. military power to eliminate the
Libyan Air Force and knock out other tar-
gets, such as communications facilities. Re-
cently a few administration officials have
informally war-gamed a plan under which
Libyan dissidents would set up a govern-
ment in exile and then request military sup


port from Egypt and other neighboring
states, as well as the Sixth Fleet. “It would be
a relatively safe endeavor,” insists one U.S.
official. “We’d lose a few people, though.”
In the real world, however, a U.S. attack
on Libya doesn’t seem to be in the cards. If
Congress and the public are wary of mili-
tary involvement in nearby Central Amer-
ica, they are unlikely to support high-tech
pirate-bashing in the Middle East. Still,
Washington can see to it that neighboring
countries, especially Egypt and Sudan, have
the economic and military tools they need to
defend themselves against external threats
and internal subversion. “We probably
can’t kill the germ,” says a U.S. official,
“but we can vaccinate the people at risk.”
Some of the other peaceful options for deal-
ing with Kaddafi offer possibilities that
haven’t yet been fully explored.
“We have not exhausted the economic
steps,” says Henry Schuler of Georgetown
University’s Center for Strategic and Inter-
national Studies. The U.S. boycott of Lib-
yan crude has hurt Kaddafi, he says; the
next step could be a refusal to purchase
products from any refinery that processes
any Libyan oil. “It is too early to write off
diplomatic and economic sanctions, be-
cause they’ve never been seriously applied,”
says Paul Wilkinson, professor of interna-
tional relations at Aberdeen University in
Scotland. “And by that I mean collective-
ly.” Collective action is the key to trimming
Kaddafi’s sails. There are many ways to
punish him and to change his behavior. But
nothing will have much effect until the
United States and its allies decide to pull at
the same time and in the same direction.

Egypt Turns the Tables
With television crews on hand to record the scene, a very
unhappy Godfrey Shiner was marched into Cairo’s Credit and
Commerce Bank last week. In his hand was a check for $90,000,
which Egyptian security officials told reporters was his payoff
for aiding the alleged plot to assassinate Libya’s exiled prime
minister, Abdul Hamid Bakkush. Bank clerks paid out the
money—said to have been telexed from Rome via a Maltese
bank and American Express—in piles of cash that Shiner’s
escort promptly confiscated. “You people never keep your
word,” he later shouted at officials as a Newsweek photogra-
pher entered Cairo’s interior ministry. “I was tricked into
coming to this country by Egyptian security.”
Were Shiner and his three alleged cohorts—two Maltese men
and another middle-aged British businessman, Anthony Gill—
really a Libyan hit squad? Or were
they merely dupes, low-level
agents at worst, who were lured
into an elaborate scheme orches-
trated from the start by Egyptian
security officials in order to em-
barrass Libyan leader Col. Muam-
mar Kaddafi? The facts were
murky at best. Last week, Cairo
officials met the press with more
grandiose charges and carefully
staged media events than details of
the evidence against the group,
whose “contacts” in Egypt were
all apparently undercover police
agents. Nonetheless, Egyptian of-
ficials from President Hosni Mu-
barak on down were clearly revel-
ing at having stolen a march on
their vitriolic and violent desert
neighbor—not to mention their
apparent success at manipulating
Kaddafi’s overheated espionage
corps to serve Egypt’s own ends.
Throughout the last decade
Egypt has been a frontline target
for Kaddafi’s anger. The long-
running war of words escalated
earlier this year when Cairo ac-
cused Kaddafi of mining the Red
Sea —and then, despite prodigious
efforts, failed to come up with any
proof. Egypt’s intelligence and in-
ternal security forces have in fact
been better known for sheer size

than for steely efficiency. By some estimates, at least one in every
25 Egyptians works full or part time for the secret police,
including waiters and parking-lot attendants, doormen and
office cleaners. “On every street corner, there’s one and usually
two people watching,” says one Cairo political analyst.
Precisely how that network was first alerted to the foreign
agents in the “assassination plot” has yet to be revealed. Egyptian
officials last week claimed to have agents active both in Libya and
its sometime ally, Malta. But little more than the names of the
two alleged Maltese conspirators— Romeo Nicholas Schembri
and Edgar Bonnici Cachia—has been released. Shiner, too, is
seemingly obscure but may have joined the group through Gill,
who, according to British press reports, faced bankruptcy fol-
lowing the failure of a modest auto-parts store he had owned
outside London. He seems to have had something of a connection
to the Libyans: Egyptian officials say he has confessed to having
helped Kaddafi’s brother-in-law, Muhammad Shibli, to escape
drug charges in Britain last Janu-
ary by putting him in touch with
the owner of a private plane. But in
Gill’s reported 23-page confes-
sion—de-scribedbyEgyptianlnte-
rior Minister Ahmed Rushdie last
week—Gill hardly sounded like a
master assassin. “I was beginning
to feel as if I was James Bond,” he is
quoted as having said, “and that I
could do anything that was asked
of me.” His wife Rosemary, inter-
viewed in Coventry, simply re-
marked: “It is all so bizarre.”
That it was. And yet, an unusu-
ally large number of Western in-
telligence agents were waiting
their turn to talk with their Egyp-
tian counterparts. Cairo officials
say they will hold the four indefi-
nitely and may eventually hold a
trial that would symbolically try
Kaddafi himself in absentia But
that may not be a wise course to
take against the fiercely proud
Libyan leader. Egyptian intelli-
gence has repeatedly said in recent
months that Libya plans to bomb
the vital, and vulnerable, Aswan
High Dam. Given Kaddafi’s re-
cord, that may not be a threat to
take lightly.

CHAD
Famine’s New Victim
The famine in Chad is not as bad as
Ethiopia’s—yet. But drought, civil war and
Libyan intervention have all contributed to a
rapid decline in food supplies, and relief
agencies predict that a major disaster may be
around the corner. Last week Newsweek’s
Nairobi bureau chief Ray Wilkinson trav-
eled to Chad—andfound a nation in misery,
His report:
At a relief station in the southern town
of Doba, a procession of mothers,
their breasts dry and withered, their bodies
caked with trail dust, plead for food and
medicine for the children slung around
their shoulders and backs. But Doba is in
the middle of a war zone, and there are few
supplies; 200 children have died from mal-
nutrition in only two weeks. In the harsh
semidesert wastes of the east, hardy no-
mads are reduced to eating the leaves off
savonnier trees; some die because they can-
not digest the leaves properly. Across the
drought-parched landscape, tens of thou-
sands of refugees pitch straw-and-twig
huts wherever they find water. “At times,”
says Carrel Laurent of CARE, “it seems
as if the entire population of Chad is on
the move.”
Some 4,000 people, mainly women and
children, have died from famine in Chad in
the last few months. As many as 200,000
persons have left their homes to wander the
searing countryside in search of food. The
figure of displaced persons could rise to
600,000 by the end of the year—out of a
population of less than 5 million. Perhaps
another 100,000 people have fled into
neighboring countries to escape both the
famine and the guerrilla war that has
plagued Chad for most of its 24 years of
independence. “These people are used to
getting by on virtually nothing,” says Jamie
Wickens, head of the World Food Program
in Chad. “Now they don’t even have that.
They are abandoning their villages in a last-
ditch effort to survive.”
For tens of thousands, it may already be
a losing cause. Chad’s last food harvest
was a disaster, far worse than during the
last killer drought, in 1972-73. This time,
cereal production has plummeted to
315,000 tons, well short of the 654,000
tons needed for “minimum living needs.”
Relief officials estimate that 25,000 tons of
food is needed within weeks to avert a
disastrous upsurge in starvation deaths,
But the officials expect to be able to import
only 100,000 tons throughout all of Ijext
year, because of what Allan Turnbull of
CARE describes as “nightmarish logistical
problems—even worse than Ethiopia.”
Chad is Africa’s most landlocked nation;
the nearest ports are 1,200 miles away, in
Cameroon and Nigeria. It takes food trains
at least three weeks to travel from the
seacoast to Chad—and then only if neigh-
boring governments cooperate. At the mo-
ment, for example, Nigeria’s northern bor-
ders are officially closed,
Dirt Tracks: By December the Chari Riv-
er separating Chad from Cameroon will be

Unloading relief supplies in Ndjamena: ‘Nightmarish logistical problems ’
UNICEF
Chad’s agony: Famine rules the land
the country, and a guerrilla conflict in the
south has created a huge “no-go-zone” for
relief efforts. A sustained airlift has been
ruled out as too expensive and unworkable.
Chad’s few population centers have been
inundated by refugees. The battered capital
of Ndjamena, still showing the ugly scars of
years of civil war, has absorbed 50,000 peo-
ple. To halt the influx, the government re-
cently established five “feeding centers” in a
rough semicircle around the capital. But the
measure—unhappily code-named “Opera-
tion Wall”—has been only partially suc-
cessful; refugees often ride relief trucks out
of these centers into Ndjamena. Other
towns such as Abeche and Ati have doubled
in size in a matter of months. Conditions
can only get worse. The cold season is ap-
proaching, when nighttime temperatures
plunge to bone-chilling levels and dust
storms whip through the refugees’ flimsy
straw-and-twig huts.
Even in the best of times, Chad is the
poorest and one of the most inhospitable
countries in the world, with a per capita
annual income that hovers around $lOO. It
is also a place where even good news has a
way of turning sour. This year’s cotton har-
vest was the largest in Black Africa. But
much of it was planted at the expense of food
crops. And since no one anticipated the
severity of the drought, little of the profit
was saved for emergency food aid. Now the
cotton money is gone—unavailable for
fighting the killer famine. “One more piece
of bad luck,” says the World Food Pro-
gram’s Wickens, “and we will have another
Ethiopia on our hands. ” But it would be just
Chad’s luck to find the cupboards of world
compassion growing bare.


Mitterrand’s Humiliation
PIERRE LELLOUCHE
Back in the old days, when Franqois
Mitterrand was leader of the socialist
opposition, he denounced Valery Giscard
d’Estaing’s repeated military interventions
in Africa as proof that France had become
“the Cuba of the West.” This was in June of
1978. Three years earlier, the Soviets and
their Cuban proxies had begun a major
drive into the African continent. France
was then the only Western country militari-
ly involved in the area; according to Giscard
and his chief of staff, the French govern-
ment’s goal was to resist “destabilization.”
The United States in those days was not
involved in Africa. Still deeply traumatized
by Vietnam and Watergate, America was in
no mood to deal with military interventions
of any kind.
Today, the situation is dramatically dif-
ferent. On a continent that is politically
fragmented, economically bankrupt and
stricken by famine, geopolitical competi-
tion between the great powers is once again
an issue. Ronald Reagan’s government is
involved again in Africa, providing eco-
nomic and military aid to “friendly” na-
tions. Meanwhile the tables seem to have
turned against the Soviets: Mozambique
has shifted toward the West under the dual
pressure of South African military power
and a near-total economic collapse at home.
In Angola, the Soviets face the prospect of a
Cuban withdrawal negotiated under U.S.
auspices. These events could result in the
eviction of the Soviet presence from south-
ern Africa, leaving Moscow with only two
solid allies on the continent: Marxist Ethio-
pia and Muammar Kaddafi’s Libya.
Horning In: It is precisely Libya that
France has been confronting in Chad. Since
1969, France has been resisting Kaddafi’s
attempts to destabilize Chad. The list of
French and Libyan interventions in that
country is endless and confusing. The
French sold massive amounts of arms to
Libya in the early ’7os, for example, yet the
Libyans burned the French Embassy in
Tripoli in 1980. The latest episode began in
June 1983 when antigovernment troops in
Chad, led by Goukouni Oueddei and sup-
ported by the Libyan Army, began a major
military offensive. A month later, the Lib-
yan Air Force mounted heavy bombing
raids and stopped a counteroffensive by
President Hissene Habre’s troops.
In Paris, Mitterrand was in no hurry to
step into the same quagmire from which
Giscard had narrowly escaped in 1980.
Only a major air attack against airfields
inside Libya could have prevented the fall of
Faya-Largeau. That option, endorsed by
some in Paris, was finally ruled out as too
risky. Politically, Paris needed “demonstra-
ble evidence of Libyan intervention,” which
French officials pretended did not exist,
even though everyone knew that Libya had
been massively involved in Chad following
Giscard’s withdrawal three years earlier.
Later, Mitterrand was forced to move in,
if only to salvage French credibility. Thus
began “Manta,” a costly operation involv-
ing 3,500 French troops equipped with
France and Libya are
again feuding over
Chad, a hopelessly poor
nation but one with
strategic importance.
modern aircraft and helicopters. Mitter-
rand had decided not to fight the Libyans
and not to involve France in the Chadian
civil war per se; and so, he could only hope
to deter further Libyan action directed
against the government forces in the south,
and the capital city of Ndjamena, and to
negotiate an honorable disengagement for-
mula with Kaddafi.
This strategy had one fundamental weak-
ness: in such a war of attrition, time and
geography were on Kaddafi’s side. Sure
enough, as French costs mounted close to
$165 million, Mitterrand’s government
sought a face-saving withdrawal formula. A
deal was signed in Tripoli, which, under-
standably, was greeted in Paris with praise
from the press and politicians alike:
France’s honor had been saved, its prestige
had been enhanced in Black Africa and
Kaddafi had been “forced” to compromise.
Predictably, Kaddafi cheated, just as the
French military expected he would—an ex-
pectation that was soon confirmed by
French reconnaissance sources. The Paris
government, however, chose to overlook
the “discrepancy.” The fact that some Lib-
yan troops remained in Chad, officials in
Paris surmised, would prevent Habre from
restarting the war in the north. Who would
know if the troops were Goukouni’s war-
riors or Libyan soldiers? The Americans
knew, thanks to their satellites —satellites
that French Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson forgot about in his eagerness to
announce that “the Libyan withdrawal had
been completed.” The United States
jumped in at this point and disclosed what
French intelligence sources had kept secret:
Libyan troops were still in Chad. This pre-
cipitated a major political disaster for Mit-
terrand both at home and abroad.
Painful: To my knowledge, this was the
first time in modern history that a major
power publicly contradicted the official
statements of one of its allies and essentially
denounced that ally’s foreign policy. Wash-
ington’s message could only be read one of
two ways: either the French government
was openly lying to its own people and to its
African allies, or it had been “had” by Kad-
dafi. The humiliation in France was all the
more painful since the Mitterrand govern-
ment has been Reagan’s staunchest ally in
recent years in global security issues.
Clearly the Reagan administration was
irked that it had not been consulted or even
notified in advance of the Tripoli withdraw-
al agreement. But the main reason for the
U.S. action was political: Washington ob-
jected to letting Tripoli—and Moscow —
win this one too easily. U.S. officials did not
want the French to go home before “the
job” was finished. Through its disclosures,
Washington now forces the French to move
back into Chad if the Libyans remain
there —a far more comfortable situation for
the United States than having to send its
own troops to replace French legionnaires.
To add to the beauty and the hypocrisy of
this whole affair, Washington also strength-
ened Habre, its ally in Ndjamena, without
disrupting lucrative U.S. contracts in Lib-
ya. All in all, it has been a tough and humili-
ating lesson for Mitterrand, a lesson that
makes his old “Cuba of the West” formula
sound almost like child’s play.

Moscow’s Dirty War
A helicopter gunship scouts the Panjshir Valley, guerrillas take cover in rugged terrain: A fight against superior Soviet resources
PHOTOS BY JOHN GUNSTON —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
The Soviets hold the upper hand in Afghanistan.
It was nearly five years ago that the Soviet
invaders rolled into Afghanistan. Since then,
Afghan rebels, or mujahedin, have staged a
vigorous resistance in a war that has received
relatively little attention in the Western
press. Last week, when Newsweek corre-
spondent Edward Behr visited the Pakistani
town of Peshawar, a center of rebel activity,
hefound that the war was going badly for the
mujahedin—and for all of Afghanistan as
well. His report:
The tragedy in Afghanistan is on a scale
with that in Pol Pot’s Cambodia. Ex-
perts estimate that the nation’s population
has shrunk by a third: at least 4 million have
fled to Iran or Pakistan while up to a million
may have died as a result of the war. The
freedom fighters still enjoy the overwhelm-
ing support of Afghanistan’s remaining
population, but the scorched-earth policy
initiated by the Soviets in 1980 is having a
dramatic effect. Russian carpet bombing is
deliberately designed to scare off the rural
populations and deprive the rebels of a base
for food and support. “[The Russians] are
bombing the hell out of crops just before
harvest time,” says Fazl Akbar, who runs a
Peshawar-based news service closely linked
with the mujahedin. “They are deliberately
f driving the rural population in the vicinity
of Kabul away. The puppet Afghan au-
thorities say this area is becoming a free-fire
zone, and anyone in it will be killed.”
In Peshawar, a Red Cross official reports
an increase in severe burns and other
wounds caused by air raids—and a “much
larger number of civilian casualties, includ-
ing old men, women and children.” “I
passed many villages that were in-
habited two years ago and are now
deserted,” says Steve McCurry, a
free-lance photographer who just
returned from the latest of several
trips to Afghanistan. “A few direct
hits have obviously caused the vil-
lagers to pull up stakes.”
The air war takes several forms.
There is the constant daylight straf-
ing of known crossing points into Afghani-
stan by fast, heavily armored Su-24 and -25
attack aircraft and also higher altitude raids
by squadrons of Tu-16 bombers. In either
case, the Soviet aircraft are able to strike
with relative impunity, severely hampering
rebel supplies. Philippe Gauthier, a French
free-lance journalist who recently returned
from a four-month tour with the rebels, says
that in many places the guerrillas survive on
sweetened green tea and unleavened bread.
“There just isn’t anything else,” he says.
In addition, the Soviets are learning how
to adapt their tactics to Afghanistan’s bru-
tal terrain. “There was a time,” says Fazl
Akbar, “when it was relatively easy to hit
out at the Soviets: they would embark on
carefully staged attacks in long, vulnerable
convoys. We usually had prior warning of
their objective and melted away before they
got there, ambushing them in the bargain.”
But now, he says, the Russians have learned
to use helicopters and paratroopers to stage
lightning raids in tactics similar to those
employed by U.S. forces in Vietnam.
Spies: Even more troubling to the rebel
commanders is the growing effectiveness of
KHAD, a secret-police force that is closely
controlled by the KGB. “There must be a
lot of informers for KHAD in a lot of re-
mote places,” says Gauthier. “In some
northern areas, no sooner had we settled
into a small village for the night than it was
bombed or rocketed. They seemed to know
where we were.” Such was the case 18
months ago when a Russian Army deserter
revealed the itinerary of a Soviet two-star
general who was on a road-inspection tour.
The inspection team was ambushed, the
general taken captive, and mujahedin lead-
er Abdul Haq planned to use him to bargain
for the release of at least 50 guerrillas in

somehow discovered where the general was
being held, and rather than attempt to free
him, the Russians bombed the site into
oblivion, killing the general and 90 of Abdul
Haq’s best troops as well.
But despite the vast resources of the Sovi-
et Army, the rebels have been able to score a
number of psychological victories. Early
this month, guerrillas managed to shoot
down a Russian transport plane at the Ka-
bul airport, killing 240 Soviet troops. In
October, the guerrillas launched rockets
against the Soviet Embassy, breaking up a
diplomatic party. And in July, rebel forces
attacked and rocketed a Soviet Army base
at Tapa Tajbage, a heavily fortified part of
Kabul, interrupting a conference of high-
level Soviet commanders. “We know we
must have inflicted severe casualties,” says
Abdul Haq, “perhaps on senior Soviet offi-
cers who had flown in from the Soviet
Union to attend.”
Those successes were made possible in
part by the growing professionalism that
the mujahedin have developed over five
years of warfare. Until recently, it was the
traditional tribal leader or landlord who
assumed command by virtue of his civilian
position. By now, however, the leadership
has fallen on the more natural, tested guer-
rilla fighters. In addition, there is now great-
er cooperation between the various rebel
groups in the field. At this time last year,
they generally operated with little coordi-
nation, and sometimes they even fought
each other. Now, reports Gauthier, there is
considerable cooperation between the dif-
ferent groups, and insiders say it’s the politi-
cal factions in Peshawar that are the most
reluctant to mount a united rebel effort.
Indoctrination: But the Soviet Army is
clearly determined to stay as long as it takes
to subdue the domestic population. Three
weeks ago the Russians demonstrated how
serious they were when Radio Kabul an-
nounced that hundreds of Afghan children
were being taken from their parents and
shipped to the Soviet Union for years of
political indoctrination. “The enemy
knows he has no hope of turning present
generations of Afghans into communists,”
says Ahmed Shah, an American-trained en-
gineer and a leader of a loose coalition of
resistance groups. “So they are looking
ahead to the future generation.”
For the record, at least, rebel command-
ers claim that morale has never been higher.
The stepped-up Soviet bombing, says Ah-
med Shah, is “a sign of desperation.” Thus
far, however, it has been an effective, if
brutal, strategy. “We know we are in this
war forever,” says Abdul Haq. “The only
really hard thing is this: in the beginning we
felt the whole world was with us; now we
know we are alone.” The rebels’ real strug-
gle is to continue resistance in the face of
civilian suffering and the forgetful indiffer-
ence of the West.
Arafat’s Next-to-Last Stand?
TT* he Israelis forced him out of Beirut.
The Syrians threw him out of northern
Lebanon. His bored and demoralized guer-
rillas are scattered around the Arab world,
But Yasir Arafat will always make do. Last
week the beleaguered chairman of the Pal-
estine Liberation Organization finally got
enough of his scattered irregulars together
to hold a session of the Palestine National
Council, the PLO’s Parliament-in-exile,
“Having this meeting at this difficult time is
a miracle,” he said.

a ship in the Mediterranean. When Jordan’s
King Hussein agreed to act as host at a
session in Amman, Syria ordered Damas-
cus-based PLO factions not to go, and Israel
barred West Bank Palestinians from attend-
ing. With a quorum of 257 of the council’s
379 members present, Arafat opened the
session, angling for a vote of confidence. His
goal was to drown out calls for his ouster
among hard-liners in the PLO’s Syrian-
supported factions. A strong new mandate
could enable him to form an open alliance
with Jordan and Egypt as a counterweight
to Syria and Libya, both of which seek to
dominate the PLO.
With support from Egypt and Jordan,
Arafat may yet be tempted to join Hussein
in a Jordanian-Palestinian response to Ron-
ald Reagan’s 1982 peace initiative. The wily
PLO leader has never been willing to go that
far before, and he may well draw back again.
But in an address to the council’s opening
session, Hussein warned the delegates that
time was running out on the West Bank. He
urged the Palestinians to join him in an
effort to launch peace negotiations with
Israel based on U.N. Security Council Res-
olution 242. The response to the moderate
appeal was mixed. The Parliament did oust
its pro-Syrian speaker, Khaled Fahoum,
replacing him with Sheik Abdul Hamid
Saeh, a supporter of Arafat and Hussein,
But it also reaffirmed its rejection of Reso-
lution 242, which calls for withdrawal
from the occupied territories in ex-
change for security for all nations in
the region.
Tight Security: Given the angry
denunciations from Syria and the
constant risk of terrorist attacks or
assassination attempts, both Arafat
and Hussein faced considerable risks
in calling a PLO council session in
Amman. Security precautions in the
Jordanian capital were heavy. Vehi-
cles filled with earth blocked streets
leading to the King Hussein Sports
Center, where the council sessions
were held, to thwart potential truck
bombers. Jordanian soldiers stood
guard with heavy machine guns, and
a military helicopter circled over-
head. Security guards searched the
shoes of those entering the hall, care-
fully inspected cigarette lighters and
even broke open candy bars. Outside
Amman, the council session caused
violent repercussions. When pro-
Arafat demonstrations by West Bank
Palestinian students led to stone-
throwing, Israeli soldiers opened
fire—killing two students and
wounding several others.
Holding the council session in
Amman represented a striking turn-
about. In 1970 —in what the Palestin-
ians refer to as “Black September”—
Jordanian troops drove PLO guerrilla
forces out of Jordan after days of violent
fighting. It was a major turning point in the
up-and-down fortunes of the PLO. After
leaving Jordan, the guerrillas established a
new state within a state in southern Leba-
non- —until Israeli forces forced them to
leave Beirut, their last foothold, in the sum-
mer of 1982. If Arafat emerges from the
council session with a strong enough vote of
confidence from PLO moderates, and de-
cides to work more closely with Jordan, the
session in Amman will have been a major
turning point. If he backs down, as he has
done so many times before, the PLO will
survive, but as a significantly weakened
player in the Middle East.
ANGUS DEMING with JAMES PRINGLE

THE PHILIPPINES
How Sick Was Marcos?
Marcos and his doctor: A film clip that left open as many questions as it answered
Where was Ferdinand Marcos? U.S.
bankers made panicky phone calls to
Manila, and Philippine opposition leaders
appealed for a bipartisan commission to go
to Malacanang Palace and investigate the
president’s health. Finally last week, aides
released a film clip of Marcos receiving
treatment from a doctor for “a bronchial
infection.” The president was dressed in a
housecoat; he looked tired, but alert. For the
moment, the footage quieted speculation
that he was on his deathbed. But it left open
the question of how sick he really was —and
of who would govern the Philippines if he
suddenly died or became incapacitated.
Concern over Marcos’s health grew
sharper after Francisco Tatad, a former
information minister now in the opposition,
reported that the president had secretly un-
dergone a major operation on Nov. 14. Ta-
tad did not specify the type of surgery, but he
said that Marcos suffered from a heart ail-
ment as well as a kidney disorder. The gov-
ernment denied the report and insisted that
Marcos was well. Other sources close to the
palace said that Marcos did complain of
“chest pains” on Nov. 13, but had only been
confined to bed. According to these sources,
Marcos had trouble breathing, and was re-
ceiving blood transfusions and medication
for rest. A recurring allergy may have also
left him with skin lesions. Palace sources
had said he would agree to be photographed
only after his skin problem eased.
Although brief, Marcos’s disappearance
did focus attention on what would happen if
he was disabled for a longer period. Until
this year, the Philippine Constitution pro-
vided for an executive committee to govern
if Marcos fell ill or died. But Marcos pushed
through an amendment that abolished that
committee and shifted transitional power to
the vice presidency—a post that won’t be
filled until the 1987 elections. Undercurrent
laws, Nicanor Yniguez, the aging speaker of
the National Assembly, would govern for 60
days until elections could be held.
Recently, according to palace insiders,
Marcos has also asked advisers to draft
plans for a “working secretariat” that could
take over if he went to the United States for
medical treatment —possibly for a kidney
operation or heart care. In an effort to please
the Reagan administration, the sources
said, he wanted the secretariat to include
moderates to balance possible threats from
the right. One candidate was Acting Chief of
Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, a West Point
graduate regarded highly in Washington;
others were Yniguez and Defense Minister
Juan Ponce Enrile. But sources said that the
plan was still in “raw” form, and that Mar-
cos was currently too ill to work on it.
Ally: It was also unclear whether Imelda
Marcos would stand for such a commission.
Many Filipinos believe, despite her denials,
that she wants to succeed her husband and
will try to capitalize on knowledge about his
health. “She thinks Jiang Qing didn’t move
fast enough when Mao died,” says a skepti-
cal associate. If Imelda does make a move,
she may find an ally in Gen. Fabian Ver, the
chief of staff who took a leave to clear his
name after he was implicated by an inde-
pendent commission in the murder of oppo-
sition leader Benigno Aquino. According to
a well-placed government official, Ver is still
“very actively advising” the Marcoses and
retains the loyalty of many senior officers.
No one is likely to make a power grab as
long as Marcos is still around. The palace
insisted that he would be well enough this
week to meet with National Assembly offi-
cials and sign a new budget. It was possible
that he would bounce back —probably do-
ing his best to play down his health prob-
lems, the country’s economic crisis and the
continuing storm over the Aquino murder.
Ferdinand Marcos has always shown tre-
mendous tenacity. And in sickness as in
health, he still had the next move.

A High-Noon Shoot-Out at Panmunjom
In Panmunjom, the truce village in the
demilitarized zone dividing North and
South Korea, it was almost high noon. A
group of Soviet visitors followed their
Russian guide last week on a tour of
Pyongyang’s side of the armistice line.
Suddenly a member of the party broke
away and ran across the border. Nearly
30 North Korean troops followed him,
firing their weapons frantically. South
Korean and American soldiers guarding
the southern side of the zone returned the
fire. When the shooting was over, at least
two North Koreans and one South Kore-
an were dead, an American GI was
wounded —and the Russian, unhurt,
was in the custody of United Nations
Command officials. Radio Pyongyang
blamed the incident on the “U.S. side,”
claiming that American guards had
pulled the man over the demarcation
line. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul identi-
fied him as Vasily Yakovlevich Matu-
zok, 22, who expressed a desire to seek
asylum in the United States.
The shoot-out came just as relations
between the two Koreas were showing
signs of improving. Pyongyang sent $l2
million worth of flood aid to the south in
October. The two sides met in Panmun-
jom for trade talks last month. And last
week they agreed to reopen long-stalled
Red Cross negotiations aimed at reunit-
ing families separated by political parti-
tion. The danger was that the border
clash would end the diplomatic thaw.
U.S. officials moved quickly to defuse
the incident. “The matter seems to have
come to a close now,” said national-
security adviser Robert McFarlane. But
the square-off may still worsen tensions.
It clearly did nothing to ease them.

EUROPE
Back to the Table
Reagan and Chernenko agree to arms talks, but the road will be long and tough.
Turkeys were already browning across
the country last week when Washing-
ton and Moscow supplied their own Thanks-
giving Day treat. In simultaneous press
briefings, the superpowers announced that
Secretary of State George Shultz will meet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Gene-
va on Jan. 7 and 8. The surprise was that the
two sides had already agreed to revive nucle-
ar arms talks; they left their emissaries to
dicker over an agenda. John Denver even
showed up at the U.S. ambassador’s home in
Schultz
BRUCE HOERTEL
Moscow to sing “we’re
all in this together”—as
the ambassador, a Soviet
Foreign Ministry official
and other Thanksgiving
guests chirped along in
harmony.
And with that accord,
the Kremlin leadership
blinked: they ended a
year of frosty confronta-
tion, buried their pre-
conditions—and handed
Ronald Reagan his first
postelection diplomatic
coup. Even at best, the
Thanksgiving Day sur-
prise lit only a dim light at
the beginning of the tunnel. In Geneva,
Shultz and Gromyko must somehow script
negotiations on long-range strategic mis-
siles, European-based warheads, space
weapons or some combination of all three
(chart). Gromyko will likely table a familiar
Soviet wish list —including a demand that
the United States stop deploying its new
NATO missiles in Europe. Needless to say,
Washington has a quarrel with every point.
A senior administration official emphasizes
that “these are going to be long, tough nego-
tiations, with no guarantee of success.”
Allies: That renders no less dramatic Rea-
gan’s own late-blooming commitment to
arms control. He spent most of his first term
lambasting the Evil Empire. He launched
his futile first-term talks more to please the
allies than to reach agreement. But by re-
election time he was meeting Gromyko in
person to demonstrate that term two will
belong to arms control. After his victory,
Reagan wrote to assure Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko that he is serious.
Next, in forums large and small, Reagan
persuaded his own administration that he
intends to break the impasse with Moscow.
The message: in term two, the impetus for
arms control will flow from the president
down —complicating matters for the Penta-
gon hard-liners who will oppose the talks.
So far, the results have vindicated Rea-
gan. He resisted election-year pressures to
lure the Soviets back to the bargaining table
with U.S. concessions. Instead, his predic-
tion proved correct: the Soviets came back
anyway. The Thanksgiving Day accord
foresees negotiations on “the whole range”
of nuclear and space weapons. That meshes
with Washington’s preference that offensive
and defensive weapons alike be discussed.
At least for now, it ignores Moscow’s de-
mand that space weapons top the agenda.
The formula even sets aside the most explicit
Soviet precondition: that talks cannot re-
sume until the United States removes its new
NATO missiles from Europe.
If Reagan’s stress on arms control proves
a political winner, it will ease congressional
passage of his hard-line defense budgets and
MX missile program. But it will also shift
stewardship of his foreign policy to moder-
ates like Shultz, national-security adviser
Robert McFarlane—and perhaps a new

high-level “special envoy” such as arms ne-
gotiator Paul Nitze. The moderates already
are pondering ways to keep the Soviets talk-
ing. To that end, the United States might be
willing to compromise on its proposal that
the two sides merely resume the stalled Stra-
tegic Arms Reduction Talks (START) and
the negotiations on Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) in Europe. The administration
would consider merging the START and
INF talks —and even tacking on negotia-
tions on space weapons.
On substance, as well, the moderates are
considering thekinds of gestures that Penta-
gon hard-liners vigorously oppose. In strate-
gic-arms talks, some officials are urging that
the United States bend toward the Soviet
formula for measuring strategic forces —
that is, counting launchers, an easier chore
than counting actual warheads and mega-
tonnage. In the talks on intermediate-range
forces, furthermore, some State Depart-
ment experts advocate a three-year, bilateral
freeze on deployment of new missiles aimed
at targets in Europe pending negotiations;
on the Soviet side, the freeze would cover
triple-warhead SS-20s, the main threat, as
well as shorter-range SS-21s and SS-225.

atorium on testing antisatellite weapons.
With the president and the political winds
favoring the moderates, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, his Assistant Secretary
Richard Perle and other arms-control crit-
ics have kept a low profile. As they see it, the
policy battle will heat up when the adminis-
tration must face tough choices. In the near
term, the hard-liners hope they can derail
any proposal to forgo American antisatellite
tests during negotiations. In the long run
they believe that the trends work in their
favor. For one thing, negotiators will have
trouble keeping up with the rapid expansion
of weapons technology. Even if they ham-
mer out some agreement, the hard-liners
believe its provisions will prove impossible
to verify—and that any arms-control deal
will turn out to be fatally flawed.
Snub: There is another uncertainty: the
Soviets agreed to nothing on Thanksgiving
that they could not undo by Valentine’s Day.
The Kremlin may intend simply to rail at
Reagan from across the table rather than
from afar. But the fact is that Moscow’s snub
treatment utterly failed to prevent the
NATO buildup or Reagan’s re-election.
And it did not address Moscow’s more seri-
ous anxieties —including the U.S. lead in
space weapons, its highly accurate D-5 mis-
siles launched from Trident submarines and
the proliferation of U.S. Pershing II missiles
in Europe. In the circumstances, Moscow
might be genuinely ready to give negotia-
tions another chance. “Of course, Ronald
Reagan will remain Ronald Reagan,” wrote
columnist Fyodor Burlatsky, “but for all
that, one mustn’t exclude the possibility of
certain correctives in the realization of this
line. . . We shall see.”

TERRY RENNA— JAMES LONG ASSOCIATES
JOHN FICARA —NEWSWEEK
With Gromyko in Washington last September: Persuading Moscow that he is ready to talk


as much to internal politics as to strategic
philosophy. The tough talk that pervaded
the spring and summer months came at a
time when Gromyko and Defense Minister
Dmitry Ustinov played particularly promi-
nent roles. But in recent months, the Army’s
aggressive Chief of Staff Nikolai Ogarkov
has been ousted, and Ustinov himself has
taken ill. More important, President Cher-
nenko has asserted himself after a summer of
poor health —and history shows that only a
strong Soviet leader can unite the nation’s
bureaucracy behind an arms-control agree-
ment. In fact, the future of U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions now lies in the hands of elderly presi-
dents in Moscow and Washington alike.
Each has been criticized as “disengaged.”
Neither has ever before shown much interest
or enthusiasm for arms control. Now each
has taken a big first step.
Reagan and Chernenko still have to prove
that they can walk the last mile to arms
control. In exhorting his own team to pur-
sue an agreement, the American president
has acted less the take-charge leader than
the “benevolent, loving, caring father figure
trying to get these very strong personalities
to work together,” as one aide put it. As last
week’s drama "nfolded, Reagan gave most
of his attention to the 800-foot irrigation
system he was digging in the pasture beside
his ranch home. Reagan has always pre-
ferred sketching the big picture to slogging
through details —the fatherly chat to
knocking heads together. Now he has com-
mitted his prestige to the most dangerous,
arcane reaches of the superpower relation-
ship. He still has to prove that his style of
laid-back diplomacy can produce progress.
But knowing Reagan, nobody’s betting
against him.

in Washington and ROBERT B. CULLEN in Moscow
Chances for Progress
By Scott Sullivan
For Washington and Moscow alike, the life-and-death disar-
mament issues are those that are not now being openly negoti-
ated: strategic nuclear missiles, intermediate-range systems
and the so-called “star wars” defense. But when George Shultz
meets with Andrei Gromyko in Geneva in January, they will
be under pressure to prove that they mean business about
disarmament. They will be looking for meaningful signs of
good intentions. The obvious places to
look are the ongoing, if stalled, multi-
lateral disarmament conferences: in
Stockholm on “confidence-building”
measures to enhance European securi-
ty; in Vienna on “mutual and bal-
anced” force reductions and in Gene-
va on chemical weapons.
Any or all these discussions could
yield agreement —if the United States
and the Soviet Union both made it
clear that agreement is what they
want. In Geneva, all 40 participating
governments are on record as favoring
a far-reaching ban on chemical arms.
In Vienna, both NATO and the War-
saw Pact have tabled detailed propos-
als for limited withdrawals of Soviet
and American troops from Central
Europe. In Stockholm, there are signs
of East-West convergence on a pack-
age that would combine a Soviet de-
mand for the renunciation of the
use of force by both sides with West-
ern proposals to exchange informa-
tion on troop strengths and military
movements.
In each case, there are obstacles to a
final accord: primarily the daunting
questions of verification and on-site inspection. But the techni-
cal issues at stake have already been thrashed out and clarified.
And the very fact that the multilateral talks do not touch on the
really cataclysmic nuclear problems makes them all the more
appropriate arenas for compromise. Both Moscow and Wash-
ington can agree to a limited drawdown of their troops in Central
Europe or a ban on chemical weapons without putting essential
security concerns at risk.
The most likely place for real progress next year is the
Stockholm conference. Through most of its year, the tone has
been polite and businesslike. Last May, President Reagan of-
NATO maneuvers in Germany: Negotiable?
WITT—SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
fered the Soviets an important concession when he agreed to
consider their proposed declaration on the “non-use” of force.
James Goodby, the American ambassador to the Stockholm
conference, said last week: “We could be moving into real
negotiations soon. The only thing holding things up is a Soviet
decision to go ahead.”
In the Vienna talks on mutual force reductions (MBFR), an
early, partial agreement remains a possibility. The United States
has offered to remove 13,000 troops from West Germany in
return for a pullout of 30,000 Soviet troops from Eastern Eu-
rope. NATO has agreed to set aside a decade-long effort to reach
agreement with the Warsaw Pact on the total number of troops
that each side maintains in the region.
The East bloc has responded with an
offer to remove 20,000 troops in return
for the American withdrawal and to
make a verifiable commitment to no
further increases. An agreement is
clearly within reach, but the details of
verification could prove to be
insurmountable.
On-site inspection: In Geneva’s dis-
cussions on chemical weapons, the
U.S. has proposed a formula that
would allow on-site inspection of
factories or storage areas within 24
hours of an official complaint. The So-
viets have accepted the principle of on-
site inspection, but no further progress
has been made toward a mutually
agreeable plan. And the overall atmos-
phere of the Geneva talks remains
clouded, especially by frequent U.S.
charges that the Soviets are using
chemical weapons in Afghanistan and
providing them to Vietnamese forces in
Cambodia.
To produce an acceptable agree-
ment, each side will have to give, but in
most cases not very much. In Stock-
holm, for example, the Soviets must
drop their insistence on a declaration renouncing the first use of
nuclear weapons, a point on which the United States refuses to
budge. Washington should be more forthcoming on the East
bloc’s demand for a commitment on the non-use of force.
Such an agreement would inevitably give impetus to the
negotiations on nuclear weapons. Last week, Oleg Grinevsky,
Moscow’s ambassador to the Stockholm conference, put the
issue bluntly: “If our conference adopted either a treaty on the
non-use of force or a statement on non-first-use [of nuclear
weapons],” he told Newsweek, “it would have a revolutionary
impact on the international situation.”


DIPLOMACY
Another Road Not Taken
UPI
Polish refugees receiving food in Hamburg, Genscher: For the time being, Kohl’s hopes for Ostpolitik have been put on hold
Just hours before West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was
scheduled to begin a three-day visit to
Poland last week, the Bonn government
made a startling predawn announcement.
The trip was being canceled, officials said, in
what it called “the interest of understanding
and normalization” of relations between the
two countries. A West German government
spokesman blamed the Polish regime for the
postponement, saying only that “circum-
stances” required it. But he added that Bonn
would continue to try to help foster the
“further positive development” of ties with
Warsaw. No amount of diplomatic sweet
talk could disguise the real message: for the
time being at least, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl’s hopes for a new round of Ostpolitik
had been effectively put on hold.
With the United States and the Soviet
Union at loggerheads over arms control,
Kohl believed that his peacemaking efforts
could play a key role in alleviating East-
West tensions. But then East German Com-
munist Party boss Erich Honecker and Bul-
garian leader Todor Zhivkov abruptly
canceled long-planned visits to Bonn last
September, evidently under heavy pressure
from Moscow. And with last week’s aborted
mission to Warsaw, diplomats in Western
Europe argued that Kohl would now be
forced to toe the Reagan administration’s
tougher line on detente.
Sanctions: Genscher’s cancellation was a
blow to the government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski. The trip would have marked the
first time that a foreign minister from a
NATO country had visited Poland since the
Communist regime outlawed the Solidarity
union and imposed martial law three years
ago. Aside from the public-relations bene-
fits to the Warsaw government, Polish offi-
cials also hoped that the trip would help lead
to the easing of Western economic sanctions
against Poland. The country’s economic
problems were underscored last week when
more than 300 passengers fled two Polish
ships, the ferry Rogalin and the liner Stefan
Batory, during stopovers in West Germany;
many of the refugees later requested politi-
cal asylum, citing a deteriorating political
and economic situation back home as a
prime reason for defecting.
Throughout the negotiations over Gen-
scher’s trip, the Jaruzelski regime had insist-
ed on several conditions that were unaccept-
able to the West Germans. Polish officials
refused to issue a press visa to a reporter
from the conservative daily Die Welt who
had planned to accompany Genscher. The
Warsaw government also said that Gen-
scher would not be allowed to lay a wreath at
the site of the graves of German soldiers
killed in World War 11. But what finally
made Kohl decide to call off the trip was
Polish government spokesman Jerzy Ur-
ban’s suggestion that a Genscher visit to the
grave of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko—the pro-
Solidarity activist priest who was murdered
by Polish security officers last month —
would not be welcome.
The next day Kohl could barely contain
his anger. He denounced the Warsaw re-
gime’s behavior as “incomprehensible” and
“unreasonable.” But he also made it clear
that he wanted to pursue better relations
with Poland. “The road of reconciliation is
the only right one,” he said at a press confer-
ence. “We shall continue on our course.”
Given Kohl’s weakened political position
because of the ongoing Flick scandal, the
chancellor will probably not be able to ig-
nore renewed demands from his conserva-
tive partners that any future visit to Poland
must include a pilgrimage to Popieluszko’s
grave as well as to the shrine for the German
war dead. Realistically, however, there is
little chance that a new date will be set in the
near future. One reason is that the Soviets
seem unwilling to give their clients in War-
saw much diplomatic leeway. The specula-
tion among some diplomats is that the
Kremlin is still trying to punish the Kohl
government for deploying Pershing II mis-
siles last year as part of NATO’s moderniza-

tion drive. Others argue that hard-liners in
the Polish regime have never been comforta-
ble with the idea of having even semicordial
relations with the West in general—and
West Germany in particular.
The mass defections in the ports of Ham-
burg and Travemiinde were the largest of
their kind in recent years. Immigration offi-
cials in West Germany said that the refugees
included an unusually high percentage of
families. In the past, Polish officials have
generally refused to allow more than a few
members of any family to leave the country
at one time in order to discourage defec-
tions. According to one theory, the Warsaw
government has become increasingly wor-
ried about domestic unrest and was trying to
rid the country of potential troublemakers.
If so, the cancellation of Genscher’s pro-
posed trip came at a particularly bad time
for Poland. At the same time that Kohl was
making his overtures, the government in
Warsaw seemed willing to pursue better
relations with Bonn. Among other things,
Jaruzelski’s government had hoped that
closer ties with Bonn would bring a reduc-
tion in the export quotas imposed by West
Germany and a rise in desperately needed
hard currency for Poland’s ailing economy.
The trip, said Ryszard Wojna, chairman of
Poland’s foreign-policy committee, was
“one of the important links in the process of
building our relations with the Western
states.” Given that reality, Poland’s best
hope for an easing of tension with the West
anytime soon may have come and gone.

Thatcher’s Irish Gaffe
With Fitz Gerald: A blunt statement that ruled out power-sharing in Northern Ireland
Even for Margaret Thatcher, the state-
ment was startlingly blunt. After meet-
ing last week with Irish Prime Minister
Garret Fitz Gerald at Chequers, her country
home, Thatcher was asked by reporters
about possible power sharing between Brit-
ain and Ireland in Northern Ireland. “I have
made it clear,” she said briskly, “ . . . that a
unified Ireland was one solution that was
out. A second solution was a confederation
of two states. That is out. A third solution
wasjoint authority. That is out. . .Northern
Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.” In
just under two minutes, Thatcher had deliv-
ered the firmest rejection of Irish unification
ever uttered by a British prime minister.
And in the process, she may have done more
harm to Anglo-Irish relations than any poli-
tician in recent history.
The strategies that Thatcher ruled out
were proposals by the Irish Forum, a mod-
erate Irish Catholic group whose work had
been fully supported by Fitz Gerald. In a
report issued six months ago, the forum
suggested that Britain and Ireland adopt
one of three plans for changing the way the
north is ruled: unification, confederation,
or joint authority over the north between
Dublin and London. Going into the sum-
mit, Fitz Gerald knew that he would not
easily persuade Thatcher to accept any of
the ideas. But there were signs that some
progress had been made: at the close of the
meeting, the two leaders issued a joint com-
munique emphasizing their opposition to
violence in Ulster and calling for continued
cooperation on security. And they agreed to
meet again early next year, speeding up the
timetable for the two countries’ annual
talks. But then, at the press conference,
Thatcher torpedoed Fitz Gerald’s hopes.
Stunned, Fitz Gerald stumbled home to
face an onslaught of angry criticism. “[The]
press conference will go down in history as
One of the black spots in Anglo-Irish rela-
tions,” declared opposition leader and for-
mer Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who
blamed Fitz Gerald for the fiasco. ‘‘You
have led this country into the greatest hu-
miliation in recent history,” Haughey add-
ed, excoriating his longtime adversary for
“incompetence, misjudgement and ineffec-
tiveness.” The prime minister himself
seemed subdued when he appeared before
Parliament to report on the summit, but
behind closed doors he was said to be
furious. At a heated meeting of the par-
liamentary members of his Fine Gael Party,
Fitz Gerald reportedly called Thatcher’s
comments “gratuitously offensive.”
Menace: Given the political realities in
Ireland, Thatcher’s statement seemed at
least ill-advised. Fitz Gerald has not been
unsympathetic to British concerns; for ex-
ample, he considers the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) to be just as much a menace in
Ireland as it is in Ulster and Britain. By late
last week, the IR A was doing all it could to
turn Thatcher’s blunder to its own advan-
tage. “Ordinary people will see what hap-
pened at the summit and they’ll start to
think that maybe [the IRA has] got it
right,” said Danny Morrison, a spokesman
for Sinn Fein, the IRA’s political wing.
Fitz Gerald’s humiliation could hurt his
party’s political prospects in nationwide
municipal elections next year. With that in
mind, the prime minister and his supporters
will probably spend the next few months
trying to restore public confidence in them.
But questions will linger about the long-
term damage that Thatcher may have done
to the cause of a negotiated solution for
Northern Ireland —and to a man who has
staked his political career on a settlement.

Mexico’s Firestorm of Death
The blaze rages out of control in San Juanico: ‘We’ve always been afraid of a tragedy, but we never thought of leaving our home ’
A thunderous explosion in an urban slum takes the capital’s worst toll ever.
Most of San Juanico was still in bed.
Only the early risers felt the first
trembling of the ground. At 5:42 a.m., a
thunderous explosion rocked the impover-
ished working-class neighborhood of Mexi-
co City. Within minutes, a massive fireball
enveloped acres of cinder-block houses in
San Juanico in a holocaust of flames.
Those who were not killed instantly fled
screaming. The flames were everywhere.
Hot, twisted metal rained from the sky.
“There was burned flesh everywhere,” re-
called Sergio Avila Morales, a 23-year-old
survivor. “Naked people were running
through the streets with gaping wounds.”
“I saw a friend who was on fire from head
to toe,” added Juana Ayala, a 39-year-
old housewife. “It looked like her face
was melting.”
Last week’s explosion at the Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) liquid-gas storage and
distribution site in San Juanico was Mexi-
co City’s worst disaster ever. Rescue teams
counted more than 350 corpses; 2,000 peo-
ple were seriously injured and another
1,000 were missing. Hardly a family in the
15-block San Juanico barrio went un-
touched: at least 600 orphans were created
by the massive blast.
In the aftermath of the explosion, report-
ed Newsweek’s Joseph Harmes, “the air
was permeated with the smell of gas, smol-
dering timber and broiled human flesh. It is

an odor you never forget. At one small
house on Avenida Ignacio Zaragoza, rescue
workers called me over to see a victim they
had just discovered. The body had been so
badly burned that it fell through the bed-
springs. What was left of the remains when
they were carried out in a plastic bag would
have fit into a shoe box.”
Residents of the barrio reported that the
smell of gas, which is always present about
the site, had intensified in recent days. Still,
it was uncertain what actually caused the
blast. Pemex officials claimed it was
sparked by a truck at a privately owned
Unigas storage facility 200 yards away. But
none of the 20 Unigas tanks exploded; the
only damage the company sustained was
from falling debris that came from the Pe-
mex site. In the aftermath of the blast, one
industry analyst said, “everyone who
knows what happened is dead.”
In a larger sense, however, the disaster
was almost invited. In the 20 years since the
distribution center was built, San Juanico
had grown from uninhabited turf to a
crowded urban slum. “We’ve always been
afraid of a tragedy,” said Miguel Torres,
whose wife was killed in the explosion, “but
we never thought of leaving our home.”
Last week, when thousands of evacuated
residents returned to San Juanico, the
fumes of another gas leak sent them fleeing
again. But they had nowhere else to go; so
they drifted back a second time —to mourn,
to scour the wreckage for belongings and to
attempt to rebuild their lives.

Bhagwan’s Realm
An Indian guru transplanted to Oregon takes over a
town and causes a mighty culture clash with locals.
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh: Searching for the ‘Buddhafield’ in the Oregon high desert
J. P. LAFFONT— SYGMA
The loyal greet their master: ‘Surrendering to it’
Every day at 2p. m., the loyal of Rajneesh-
puram, Ore., set down their hoes in the bha-
gwan ’.s 1 fields, leave their cash registers in the
bhagwan's shopping mall and emerge from
their day jobs in the bhagwan's nighttime
casino. Dressed in the colors of the sunrise,
they line Nirvana Drive for a peek at the
bearded, doe-eyed master slowly cruising the
boulevard in one of the commune's 68 Rolls-
Royces. Overhead hovers a helicopter; along-
side, a security force armed with semi-
automatic weapons. “ We’re going to sing it
from the rooftops, we're going to shout it from
the mountain, " starts the roadside song of
the committed: “ Bhagwan's our master, we
love life's laughter!"
The Rolls passes, and the devoted return to
their seven-days-a-week jobs in service to
America's most controversial guru. Among
the disciples, called sannyasis, is the daugh-
ter of Leo Ryan, the California congressman
slain six years ago while investigating the
Jonestown cult in Guyana. “Trying to ex-
plain the experience of being here with bha-
gwan, " says Ma Amrita Pritam, nee Shan-
non Jo Ryan, “is like trying to explain what
it's like to be in love. "
For indigenous neighbors in Wasco
County, the experience of being near
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, 52, is not at all
like love. In 1981, the bhagwan’s disciples
bought the old Big Muddy Ranch, a 64,000-
acre spread about 200 miles from Portland
in the north-central Oregon high desert.
Ever since his arrival, relations between
locals and the instant spiritual city have
been antagonistic, at best. Last year Oregon
Attorney General David Frohnmayer filed
suit against Rajneeshpuram, charging the
city with defying First Amendment require-
ments for the separation of church and
state. And during this past election, says
Secretary of State Norma Paulus, local con-
cern over the Rajneeshees “totally eclipsed
presidential politics.”
Bhagwan (literally, Blessed One), eldest
son of a wealthy Indian family, taught phi-
losophy at several Indian universities before
embarking on a career as
a free-lance guru. By the
1970 s he had stirred a
blend of Eastern religion
and pop psychology into
a body of thought that
was irresistible to many
Westerners. In 1974 he
opened an ashram in
Poona, India, and wel-
comed more than 50,000
visitors a year—mostly
well-heeled Americans
and Europeans drawn to
his encounter therapies
and free-love reputation.
“A lot of people came
for sex, a lot came for
drugs,” says one alum-
nus of Poona. “He of-
fered us total freedom.
It was wild.” Within a few years, however,
reports of violence, prostitution and drug
dealing at the bhagwan’s retreat had in-
furiated the ashram’s Hindu neighbors.
Richard Price, a founding therapist at
California’s famed Esalen Institute and a
onetime bhagwan follower, renounced the
movement soon after he saw a sannyasi
break another disciple’s arm in a therapy
session. India revoked the ashram’s tax-
exempt status in 1981 and hit the bha-
gwan with a huge bill for back levies. The
bhagwan abruptly departed for the United
States on a three-month medical visa, leav-

ing many of his disciples to beg in the streets.
Bhagwan arrived in Oregon with 10 dev-
otees, $1.5 million and a reputation as “the
swami of sex.” He began a period of public
silence, entrusting his decrees to Ma Anand
Sheela, his pistol-packing aide. Once en-
sconced on the ranch, however, the Rajnee-
shee brass discovered they were lacking the
essential water, sewer and phone services
needed to run either Utopia or the founda-
tion’s large book-publishing business.
While waiting for their ranch to be rezoned
as a city under Oregon’s strict land-use
laws, they began buying up property in
Antelope, the nearest chartered town. Two
years ago the bhagwan’s disciples took po-
litical control of Antelope. They changed its
name to Rajneesh, turned the general store
into a restaurant called Zorba the Buddha,
and legalized nudity in the public park.
Values: The culture clash was impossible
for most of the townsfolk to bear. At a city-
council meeting two years ago, Sheela
said local students looked “retarded” and
charged that an Antelope woman whose
husband had died in a hunting accident was
responsible for the tragedy. The husband,
said Sheela at the public meeting, “shot
himself because [the wife] was screwing
around with another man.” Soon, most of
Antelope’s old-time residents left town.
“For three years, our values were sneered
at,” says a former townsman. “If bhagwan’s
enlightened, I’m glad I’m not.”
Eventually, the ranch won incorporation.
Then, last June, the Oregon state court of
appeals ruled that Rajneeshpuram’s origi-
nal charter was invalid. In October the
group, whose only hope for a new incorpora-
tion election would have to come from the
anti-Rajneesh Wasco County Court, began
importing busloads of derelicts from around
the country. County officials suspected that
the 4,000 homeless were brought in to sway
November’s county-court elections and
said every new voter would have to be inter-
viewed. The Rajneeshees, who had already
begun dropping off the homeless in the mid-
dle of the night in nearby towns, boycotted
the election. “It was the sleaziest thing I’d
ever seen,” says Michael Stoops, who runs a
Portland shelter for the homeless. “[The
Rajneeshees] picked on the most vulnerable
people in America.” Commune members
insist the homeless were brought in for hu-
manitarian reasons.
Growing Wealth: Meanwhile, the Rajnee-
shees’ city and bankbook have grown ex-
ponentially— to 6,000 people and $lOO
million respectively—and so have local
fears. Some think the group may be intent
on taking over more than just Antelope.
Says sociologist Edward Mann, who has
studied the Rajneeshees for three years,
“He may be heating up to martyrdom so
that he can go down in history as the
spiritual leader of our time.” On the ranch,
meanwhile, rubber gloves are now worn
during sex to ensure that the diseases of the
outside world stay out, and guns are re-
portedly being stockpiled.
It takes about half an hour for visitors to
check into Rajneeshpuram. First, two dogs
usually aid in a mandatory search for drugs
and explosives. Those who pass inspection
are given a hospitallike identification wrist-
band, then escorted to the swanky Hotel
Rajneesh. For $96 a night, visitors get a tarot-
card reading and a room with two round
beds, several pictures of the bhagwan and
a TV that broadcasts discourses from the
master. Visitors sense that they are being
watched. Those who inquire on how to enjoy
Rajneeshpuram are given a hint from san-
nyasis: “Surrender to it. ” According to the
Rajneeshees, if one ’.s energy and attitude are
positive enough, a “ Buddhafield ” can be
created. There, says the bhagwan's philos-
The guru motors down Nirvana Drive: ‘ Bhagwan’s our master, we love life’s laughter!’


ophy, is where consciousness peaks and en-
lightenment are achieved.
Outside the hotel lie 40 other commune
businesses, all staffed by some of the 1,200
sannyasis who “worship” at their jobs in ex-
change for $lO a month spending money,
free clothes, vegetarian board and mattress
space in A-frame houses. Another 2,000 res-
idents pay $250 a month to explore life with
the bhagwan. Some sannyasis work on the
70-acre truck farm, which grows enough
food for the entire community; others find
employment at establishments like the Raj-
neesh deli and pizzeria, the Rajneesh hair
and beauty salon or the
LAURIE GRACE
Rajneesh bookstore,
whose stock consists
entirely of the prolific
bhagwan’s 350 titles.
The jobs are assigned
through what the Raj-
neeshees call a concept
of “horizontal hierar-
chy.” As Ma Prem Ise-
bel explains it, “That
means if you clean, you
clean with the same amount of commitment
as you would if you were a lawyer.” Actual-
ly, Sheela and a core group of leaders make
almost all of the decisions. “They don’t
make any pretense that it’s a democracy,”
says one sannyasi who recently left the
ranch. “One day you can have access to the
A sannyasi in a Rajneeshpuram A-frame: Free room and board, plus $10 a month
goodies, and the next day you might not.
They may think you have to let go of your
trip, so you’ll go back to scrubbing toilets.”
Store patronage comes from mail orders,
residents who have hung on to their own
money and the 15,000 visitors who spend a
minimum of $5OO apiece during Rajneesh-
puram’s annual seven-day summer con-
clave. Business is booming: the Rajneeshees
now also own about 35 Zorba the Buddha
restaurants and discos around the world,
a Portland hotel and land in two Oregon
counties. So far, bhagwan has been able to
plow back $llO million into Rajneesh-
puram. Reads one popular commune bump-
er sticker: “Jesus saves, Moses invests,
Bhagwan buys.”
And of course, receives. Though disciples
don’t have to give their money to the com-
mune, many do. “If it’s a total commitment,
you may as well go for it,” says one ex-
sannyasi who gave $20,000. The average
age of the sannyasis is 35, and 80 percent
came to Oregon from middle- or upper-
Why People Join Cults
What attracts people to offbeat religious groups? According
to most experts, the answer lies in some basic facts of human life.
“A lot of people wake up at 3 a.m. wondering what it’s all about,”
says Jacob Needleman, a philosophy professor at San Francisco
State. “This whole question of searching for meaning in life, for
transcendence, has been completely ignored by psychiatry. But
that’s the context in which to explore this phenomenon. People
are starved for spirituality. It’s a need as basic as anything else.”
By one estimate, there are now 2,400 groups tapping what
Berkeley sociologist Richard Ofshe calls the “enormous market
for psychological perfection.” Anyone, says Ofshe, can start a
“religion”: all it takes is a bit of charisma and a message that
makes a modicum of sense. The groups are widely diverse,
ranging from Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church to the
übiquitous Krishna devotees of city streets. In Malibu, Calif.,
Rama (the former Frederick Lenz) hands out press pictures of
himself taken by a fashion photographer and has advertised his
Lakshmi spiritual group with posters of a woman meditating
atop a Porsche; not surprisingly, California yuppies havejoined a
waiting list to seek his guidance. Los Angeles’s John-Roger and
his MSIA group (pronounced “messiah”) appeal to celebrities
and authors. Trungpa, a Tibetan guru, rumored to have a secret
plan to take over Nova Scotia, is also building a multimillion-
dollar kingdom in Boulder, Colo.
Most of the groups that make up America’s spiritual super-
market —as even the sannyasis call it—appeal to the convert’s
needs for acceptance and meaning. Ofshe points out that even at
Jonestown, where more than 900 people died in a mass suicide
six years ago last week, “the people thought they had discovered
a better way of life.” And almost all the new religions share
common threads. All form around a self-proclaimed prophet.
Most of those leaders try to remake their disciples, giving them
new names, new clothes, new hairstyles, even new birthdays.
Then some erect elaborate psychological barriers between their
chosen few and the “evil” (or at least unenlightened) outside
world; Jim Jones, for example, told his followers that the CIA
was coming to kill them.
“When someone comes along and says, ‘I have the key to the
universe, I know the answer,’ it can be liberating at first,” says
Joshua Baran, a former Zen priest who has counseled dropouts
from such groups. “Suddenly everything seems clear —a lot of
people say they feel like they’ve come home.” It is a spiritual
rush, he adds, “that most people do not feel in ordinary life
except in battle or in the middle of a football field. Like a drug,
you can get hooked on the intensity.”
Disillusionment: In the last five years, Baran’s group, called
“Sorting It Out,” has worked with more than 2,000 “leave-
takers” —including former Rajneeshees. Many had attached
themselves to one cult leader or another out of frustration with
established religions. And for all the talk of cultist “mind-
raping,” brainwashing and “spiritual fascism,” most members
eventually simply drop out of their own free will. In the end, it is
often a matter of disillusionment. Every cult leader claims some
kind of open channel to the cosmos. But in person, says Susan
Rothbaum, director of the Berkeley-based Sorting It Out and a
former cult member herself, “the more closely you look, the
more you begin to see that every teacher has feet of clay. And
every group—or every kingdom of light—has its shadows.” It is
the lesson of all time: perfect masters are hard to come by.

to wear condoms and rubber gloves during
intercourse. Residents who leave the ranch
for more than 24 hours are expected to tell
whether they had sexual contact with out-
siders. If so, they must affix an orange bead
to their necklaces and remain abstinent for
10 days—the time it takes to get a venereal-
disease lab report. Last week, alarmed by
reports that AIDS might be passed through
saliva, the Rajneesh medical group recom-
mended that disciples stop kissing. So far,
sannyasis seem unconcerned by the restric-
tions. “Kisses —I’ve had them all my life,”
says Ma Prem Isebel. “We will just rub our
faces together.”
‘Blood’: Other staples of Rajneeshee life
may soon be changing. This fall Sheela said
she “would paint the bulldozers with my
blood” if the county tried to tear down the
ranch, then announced on national televi-
sion that all of Oregon would someday be
Rajneesh. While Sheela railed, bhagwan re-
mained mute. Years back he said, “It doesn’t
matter if they write negative or positive
things. More people will come to me. And all
they have to do is look in my eyes.” But a few
weeks ago, the bhagwan began talking again,
leading some outsiders to think that he
may be dissatisfied with Sheela’s outspoken
performances.
The bhagwan may also soon need his voice
to defend himself on charges he lied on his
original temporary-visa application: if the
immigration service proves he never intend-
ed to leave, the bhagwan could be deported.
And soon, the Oregon Supreme Court will
rule on Rajneeshpuram’s incorporation. If
it upholds the lower court’s decision, county
officials could begin tearing down the city.
And in the meantime, the hate mail pours in.
That is why, Rajneeshees say, they began
purchasing semiautomatic guns last sum-
mer; today, editor Win McCormack, whose
Oregon Magazine has investigated the com-
mune, estimates they have a stockpile larger
than that of all Oregon’s police departments
combined.
The Rajneeshees are determined to stay
where they are—out of the path, they believe,
of the nuclear holocaust bhagwan has pre-
dicted will occur in the next 10 to 15 years.
“The outside is death and the inside is life, ”
says one former sannyasi. ‘Tf you believed
the whole thing, where would you rather be?”

The cops wanted Sam Serrano for armed
robbery, but that was the least of his
worries. The 18-year-old had plenty of en-
emies on Brooklyn’s mean streets; four of his
brothers had been killed in gang wars. But
Serrano’s curiosity overcame his wariness
when the Brooklyn Bridge Delivery Service
arrived at his mother’s home with a gift that
looked like a radio. As Serrano approached,
“delivery man” Larry Carter announced:
“You’re under arrest.” Serrano was so re-
lieved that he burst out laughing. “Street
guys like that appreciate a good con,” says
Carter, a deputy U.S. marshal.
Serrano was just one of 3,309 fugitives
nabbed in the largest dragnet in U.S. history.
Code-named FIST —for Fugitive Investiga-
FIST members at their New York command post: Stings, shoe leather and paperwork
tive Strike Team—the $2.5 million, eight-
state operation was the seventh in a series of
manhunts that have brought in nearly
11,000 bail jumpers and escaped prisoners
since 1982. At a press conference last week,
Attorney General William French Smith
conceded that FIST should never have been
necessary. But, said Marshals Service chief
Stanley Morris, “the whole back end of the
criminal justice system is broken.” Law-
enforcement officials blame judges for re-
leasing too many hardened offenders on low
bail, and local police don’t have the money
or manpower to track down fugitives.
Targets: The FIST operation teamed U.S.
marshals with local police who were made
deputy marshals, permitting them to cross
jurisdictional lines. The busts themselves
were the product of sting operations, old-
fashioned shoe leather and painstaking pa-
perwork. One top target was bail-jumper
Kathleen Sykes, 26, accused of kidnapping
and stabbing a Philadelphia couple and
throwing their three-year-old child out of a
car. Knocking on doors in her old neighbor-
hood, FIST operatives learned that Sykes
and her boyfriend had moved to California.
There, U.S. marshals found the boyfriend’s
application for a driver’s license and traced
the couple to a house in San Diego.
FIST caught up with Heriberto Gonza-
lez, accused of shooting a New York City
man in 1978, in a New York hospital where
he was undergoing surgery for a gunshot
wound. Detectives found one bail jumper,
accused in a fatal stabbing, working as a
teacher’s assistant in a Providence school.
One convicted murderer, who had escaped
from a Pennsylvania prison, was nabbed in
Florida where he had been arrested and
released repeatedly under an alias without
ever tripping the fugitive-warrant system.
Like Serrano, 42 other New York fugi-
tives fell for FIST’s package-delivery scam.
Detectives used psychological profiles to
select the most alluring “gifts”: a rapist, for
instance, was offered an erotic “adult toy.”
They sent notices to targets’ last known
addresses and collared those who tried to
collect. Others were baited with job offers
from the “Prior Offenders Employment
Opportunity Co-” Nine new-wave fans in
Connecticut were caught when they came to
collect free tickets to a Boy George concert.
For all the glamour of the FIST sweep-up,
Morris estimated that half of those nabbed
were already out on bail last week. The
Justice Department plans to study how the
courts handle the fugitives’ cases. But as
long as court schedules and jails are over-
crowded, even the most successful oper-
ations are fighting a losing battle.

WORLD BUSINESS
Japan’s Samurai Entrepreneurs
New venture capitalists are breaking the rules of the country’s corporate culture.
At an age when most young Japanese
submit themselves to the ethic of cor-
porate obedience, Kazuo Maezawa em-
barked on a daring gamble. At 23, he left his
job at Hitachi, the electronics giant, to
found Japan Digital Laboratories (JDL)
with a handful of friends. Today, the 39-
year-old Maezawa employs 430 people and
boasts a hefty share of a narrow but fast-
growing market for payroll computers
and Japanese-language word processors.
“Things really took off,” says
Nobuo Matsuki, a senior JDL
executive. “Now we are talking
about slowing the company’s
growth, from 40 percent a year
to only 20 percent.”
Maezawa is only one exam-
ple of a brave new breed of ven-
ture capitalists who are break-
ing—and remaking—some of
the rules of Japan’s rigidly hier-
archical corporate culture. As
recently as a decade ago, few
venture-capital firms even ex-
isted. Today, there are more
than 30 companies that rely on
luck, pluck and borrowed cash
to turn high-risk ideas into sol-
id commercial ventures. They
may not seem as daring as some
of their shoot-from-the-hip
American counterparts. But
the samurai entrepreneurs are
mavericks nevertheless. They
produce everything from so-
phisticated computer-aided
design systems to space-age
burglar alarms and sonic va-
cuum cleaners —anything, in
fact, that enables them to carve
out a niche in an economy over-
whelmingly dominated by a
few giant conglomerates.
The scale of the boom is vast
by any measure. Investments
by Japanese venture-capital
companies reached $l6O mil-
lion last year. That may not
measure up to the estimated
$11.5 billion spent in America, but it was
more than double the 1982 level —and there
has been no sign of a slowdown. And while
many of the new entrepreneurs will fail, just
as they do in such established markets as the
United States, so far Japan’s venture capi-
talists seem to be flying high. A recent sur-
vey by Japan’s Nihon Keizai Shimbun
found that the earnings of Japanese middle-
range companies surged an annual 19 per-
cent between 1981 and 1983, against a nega-
tive 0.8 percent for the “blue chip”
companies listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
There are many reasons for the sudden
stardom of venture firms. Japan’s increas-
ingly affluent consumers are demanding a
more varied range of products than is cur-
rently offered by the country’s traditional
giants. “Heavy industry required econo-
mies of scale, but small batches of diverse
products are better handled by smaller
Looking for a bio-breakthrough: A new interest in creative research
firms,” says Masahiro Maeda, director of
the promotion section of Japan’s Small and
Medium Enterprise Agency (SMEA). Per-
haps more important, Japan’s banks and
financial institutions are beginning to look
more favorably on the new venture busi-
nesses. As economic growth slowed from
the heady pace of the 19705, Japan’s large
corporations stopped investing as heavily as
they used to. That has increased savings and
reduced their bank borrowings—and, as a
result, helped open Japan’s once restricted
financial markets to less well-established
companies.
It is tempting to compare Japan’s emerg-
ing growth companies with their American
counterparts, but there are important dif-
ferences. “In America, for example, it’s vir-
tually impossible for a company to start a
new venture after it’s been established for a
decade or two,” says Tadashi Ohmori of the
venture-capital firm of Nippon Investment
& Finance Co. (NIF). “But in
Japan it is quite common for a
company to switch to a new
line of business and still do
quite well.”
The transformation of
Hayashibara Biochemical
Laboratories near Osaka is a
case in point. For almost 100
years, the company based its
earnings on traditionalenzyme
technology. Then after Ken
Hayashibara assumed the
presidency of the company 10
years ago, he took the firm in a
different direction. Hayashi-
bara scientists found that by
injecting thousands of ham-
sters with human cancer cells
to stimulate their immune sys-
tems, they could produce inter-
feron at a fraction of the cost of
conventional methods. That
innovation has placed the com-
pany at the forefront of bio-
technology—and helped beef
up sales.
Obstacles: But if venture
firms have a better chance of
breaking into untried areas in
Japan, they also face obstacles
that their American counter-
parts don’t encounter. One is
the traditional Japanese aver-
sion to risk-taking. Another is
the regulatory impediments to
raising money on the Japanese
stock market. In 1983 only 30
companies were allowed to go
public in Japan, compared with an estimat-
ed 900 in the United States. That has severe-
ly limited the pool of investment capital that
new ventures can draw upon. And recogniz-
ing that their return will come mainly
through appreciating stock values, most po-
tential investors are more concerned with
identifying companies that might be al-
lowed to sell stock than with fostering high
technology.
The play-it-safe approach of Japanese in


vestors has not bothered the country’s new
generation of go-for-broke whiz kids, how-
ever. Scores of new venture capitalists are
transforming Japan’s business landscape.
JDL’s Maezawa is one of them. Takayoshi
Shiina is another. The 41-year-old former
computer salesman quit his job 14 years ago
to found Sord Computer Corp. At first he
was his only employee; today, with 700
employees and 1983 sales of $9O million,
Sord is often called the Apple Computer
Company of Japan. Its personal computers,
equipped with the latest software, are sold
throughout the world, and the company is
gearing up for a concerted assault on the
lucrative U.S. market. “Shiina is as tough
and capable a venture capital player as any-
one you’ll ever meet,” says Sheldon Weinig,
president of Materials Research Corp., a
successful American venture firm.
T>ream Saloon’: Significantly, that kind
of success has not been confined to high-
technology—or to traditional, male manag-
ers. Chiyono Terada founded her own com-
pany, Art Moving Center, in 1976, as a way
of pumping new life into her husband’s
faltering trucking business. The company
earned $42 million last year and has revolu-
tionized Japan’s unimaginative home-mov-
ing industry by emphasizing “personalized
service.” Its latest gambit is the “Dream
Saloon,” a luxurious bus-truck that lets a
family ride in comfort to their new home
together with their household belongings.
Whether these success stories will be du-
plicated in the future is uncertain—and
there are grounds for both pessimism and
optimism. On the negative side, Japan’s
traditional conglomerates are stepping up
their creative research and development
efforts, partly out of fear that their
free-spending U.S. competitors will soon
leave them behind. But the danger for
Japan’s fledgling venture-capital firms is
that they could be squeezed out of some
fields, particularly in such state-of-the-art
enterprises as biotechnology. “In biotech-
nolgy, big companies are investing so heav-
ily that it’s very difficult for small, inde-
pendent companies to succeed,” says
NlF’s Ohmori.
The positive side is the interest that for-
Shiina, Sord technicians at
work: High risk, high return
Terada, Art Moving Center van, ‘Dream Saloon’:
Finding a niche not dominated by conglomerates
eign investors have shown in Japan’s new
venture-capital market —a trend that will
almost certainly give a boost to the next
crop of high-risk entrepreneurs. Pacific
Technology Ventures Cos. of California set
up shop in Tokyo two years ago with $5
million to invest in promising Japanese
start-ups. Last fall Britain’s Baring Bros., a
large investment bank, joined with Japan’s
Orient Leasing Cos. to set up a S2O million
venture fund. And TA Associates, Ameri-
ca’s leading venture-capital firm, has com-
bined with Nissan Motor Cos. and Hitachi to
form Techno Venture Cos., with $27 million
in seed money.
The Japanese government is also getting
into the act. The Ministry of Trade and
Industry has increased its lending to small
and medium-size firms, and the Diet may
soon legislate a tax break for small high-
tech enterprises. “If we support these com-
panies now,” says SMEA’s Maeda, “they
will become the leaders that in the 21st
century can foster the next generation of
start-ups.”
High-Risk Ventures: Only a handful of
these companies have a chance of becoming
the next Sony or Honda Motor Co., them-
selves high-risk ventures begun after World
War II. Indeed, Japanese venture business-
es are forming so quickly that a shakeout
may be inevitable. “A lot of the people
rushing into the market now do not have the
experience that is needed to do a good job,”
says JDL’s Matsuki. “Those are the kind of
people who have gotten into trouble in the
U.S., and the same thing will happen to
them here in the next 12 to 18 months. ” Not
everyone would agree with that gloomy as-
sessment, but most Japanese concede that it
will be many years before Japan can develop
a venture industry on the scale of Califor-
nia’s Silicon Valley, the premier testing
ground for American high-tech entrepre-
neurs. Even so, the the development of any
venture business will hone Japan’s competi-
tive edge—and that has other countries
worried.

An Officer and a Comedian
Murphy takes aim: A street-smart Detroit cop so cool even he can’t quite believe it
To waste as precious (and expensive) a
commodity as Eddie Murphy on some-
thing as flat and unprofitable as “Best De-
fense” is like spreading caviar on stale
bread. Beverly Hills Cop is no master-
piece, but it uses Murphy to maximum ef-
fect. The movie is as brazen, charming and
mercurial as Murphy himself, which is to
say it is unimaginable without him.
Here Murphy plays a new set of vari-
ations on the “48 HRS.” riffs that won him
instant stardom. His Axel Foley is a brash
Detroit cop who, feigning a vacation, trav-
els to lotus land to solve and avenge the
murder of an old crony. Oozing confidence,
Axel bluffs his way out of tight jams by
masterful impersonations. Caught snoop-
ing around a customs shed, he immediately
becomes an officious and demanding U.S.
Customs official. In the call of duty, he is by
turns a fast-talking cigarette smuggler from
the ghetto, a swish named Ramon afflicted
with herpes, and a Rolling Stone reporter in
town to do a Michael Jackson interview.
Braggadocio in comedy is usually funny
in proportion to the fear it masks. The terror
behind the swagger is a fundamental of
Richard Pryor’s appeal. Behind Eddie Mur-
phy’s posture of confidence, however, is
deeper confidence: the joke in “Beverly
Hills Cop” is his utter and instinctive superi-
ority to the “by the book” cops he works
with and outwits out West. He’s so cool even
he can’t quite believe it. He’s condescending
and patronizing to everyone. But instead of
being offended by his swagger one is totally
disarmed. Murphy is the audience’s surro-
gate id, the good bad boy who breaks all the
rules and ends up teacher’s pet anyway. A
loner whom everyone learns to adore, he’s
one black superhero who isn’t defined by
race or class. He can make a point of his
color, but no one else does; he’s equally at
home in a Detroit ghetto or in a suite in a
posh Beverly Hills hotel.
Like “48 HRS.,” “Beverly Hills Cop” is a
thriller/comedy, but here the comic situa-
tions are all anyone really cares about, and
the thriller plot is merely perfunctory.
There’s no suspense about who the bad guy
is, a sinister art dealer/smuggler nicely
played by Steven Berkoff; Daniel Petrie Jr.’s
screenplay relies all too lazily on conven-
ience and coincidence to resolve the action.
You can’t deny the fun this movie provides,
but couldn’t they have worked a little
harder to flesh out the story? There’s no
emotional kick in Murphy’s triumph be-
cause we don’t really believe in the depth of
his friendship with the dead man (James
Russo). And why does the movie make so
little use of Beverly Hills itself as a
satirical subject? A street-wise black De-
troit cop is set loose in the national capi-
tal of conspicuous consumption, and all we
get are jokes about the comic gentility of the
local police force.
Oddball Cameos: On the other hand, di-
rector Martin (“Going in Style”) Brest has a
marvelous way with the supporting charac-
ters, and a great eye for oddball cameos.
Oddest of all is a salesman in the villain’s art
gallery who goes by the name of Serge and is
of god-knows-what nationality; as played
by a singular actor named Bronson Pinchot,
Serge is the most unexpectedly and unusu-
ally hilarious bit role within recent memory.
The unknown Pinchot may be one of the few
people alive who could steal a scene from
Eddie Murphy. Any movie with both these
men is hard to resist.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Combining Computers and Telephones
These days, an executive who dials the telephone may have
no intention of talking to anyone. He or she may want to
use the phone lines to exchange data between two computers.
Until recently this procedure was somewhat complicated; the
computer had to be connected to a standard telephone with a
device called a modem, which converts the telephone signal
into digital pulses that a computer can understand. Now,
however, more than a dozen telecommunications firms are
offering devices that combine the data-handling power of a
personal computer with the capabilities of a telephone.
Manufacturers have adopted a variety of approaches as they
have constructed these “computerphones.” The simplest com-
puterphones are little more than standard telephones with a
few extra features (such as automat-
ic dialing) but limited data-han-
dling capability. These telephones
are designed to appeal to executives
who are wary of computers but
could use something more than a
telephone. Other computerphones
can be linked with computers that
are already on workers’ desks, al-
lowing telephone numbers and oth-
er information to be displayed on
the computer screen. The most so-
phisticated computerphone is a
powerful unit that resembles a per-
sonal computer with a telephone
handset stuck on the keyboard.
A Phone With a Screen
Northern Telecom of Nashville,
Tenn., introduced one of the first
computerphones in 1981. The Dis-
playphone (priced at $1,295) incor-
porates a seven-inch cathode-ray-
tube display, a telephone handset
and a keyboard in one unit. The
device has the features of most high-
tech telephones, including a speaker
for hands-free conversations. Users
can quickly connect to an information service by pressing one
key. Displayphone can also be used to log appointments.
STC Telecommunications Ltd. of London has taken the
capabilities of the Displayphone, added a more sophisticated
computerized appointment book and calendar and wrapped it
all in a sleek package that would look at home on the desk of a
corporate president. On one corner of the Executel ($ 1,565) is a
five-inch screen that can display a personal telephone directory
containing as many as 255 entries, a 20-year electronic ap-
pointment diary or a calculator.
A Computer With a Ring to It
Rolm Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., which is on the verge of
merging with IBM, has come up with two computerphones
that are designed to work with IBM Personal Computers.
The Juniper ($1,360) plugs into an IBM PC. Juniper looks
like an ordinary telephone but provides an appointment
The Cedar: An IBM-compatible ‘computerphone ,
calendar, a customized phone directory and other manage-
ment tools. The unit can also handle transmission of data and
speech at the same time over a single twisted-pair phone line,
allowing a worker to talk about a chart even as he is
transmitting it. For those who do not already own an IBM
PC, Rolm offers the Cedar ($4,245), an IBM-compatible
computer with a built-in telephone. The Cedar works just as
the Juniper-IBM combination does, but the keyboard can be
slid under the unit when not in use.
Davox Corp. of Billerica, Mass., has taken an unusual
approach to combining the computer and the telephone. The
Professional PC Workstation ($2,495) has a telephone and a
full-size keyboard and screen—but no disk drives or other
permanent memory-storage device.
Instead, through an electronic net-
work called DavoxNet, a number of
workstations can share the memory
and processing power of one IBM
PC. One computer can meet the
needs of several workers, say Davox
officials, because most profession-
als need access to a personal com-
puter for less than an hour each day.
Highway Computing
Proponents of computerphones
argue that wherever there is a tele-
phone, there ought to be a comput-
er —even in a car speeding down a
highway. The new cellular tele-
communications technology has
drastically increased the maximum
number and range of automobile
telephones. (A given area, such as a
city, is divided into “cells,” each
with its own transmitter. As a tele-
phone-equipped car travels from
one cell to the next, circuitry in the
phone automatically switches a
call from one transmitter to the
next in microseconds.) But the in-
terruption between cells, while very brief, is enough to break
data transmission when using a computer. Spectrum Cellular
Corp. of Dallas, Texas, has overcome the problem with a
device called The Bridge ($3OO to $l,OOO, depending upon
options).
The Bridge’s two-pound box links a cellular car telephone
with a portable computer. With The Bridge, one can send or
receive data over phone lines even as the car is in motion.
Special programming etched onto a chip inside The Bridge
maintains the phone link during the brief crossover period
from one cell to the next. The firm hopes to offer The Bridge
through U.S. computer stores and telephone companies by
the end of January. The company is also working on produc-
ing a Bridge and cellular telephone mounted in a briefcase —a
portable telecommunications unit that would give one the
power of a computerphone even, for example, in the middle
of a wheat field.

Bazley’s demand
for immunity
rejected
NSW POLICE Minister Petey
Anderson has rejected'-polick
informer Stephen Bazley’s
demand for immunity from
prosecution on matters arising
from his allegations of police
involvement in heroin
trafficking. Bazley, a former
associate of Mr Asia syndicate
chief Terrence Clark, had
sought the immunity as a pre-
condition for his co-operation
with police investigating his
allegations.
In a letter to Bazley’s
Sydney solictor, Peter
Ekstein, last week, Anderson
said NSW Attorney-General
Paul Landa had informed him
that indemnities were granted
after consideration of the in-
formation disclosed and on
advice from crown law
officers that the interests of
justice would be best served
by such a grant.
“In the present case,” he
said, “the Solicitor-General
has advised that it is not
possible to gauge where the
interests of justice lie for there
is simply no information
upon which a decision can be
based.”
Bazley, who is facing drug-
related charges, has refused to
elaborate on the allegations
since they were first aired on
ABC-TV’s Four Corners two
months ago.
Nevertheless, Anderson
says, the Solicitor-General has
advised that there seems to be
no reason why Commissioner
of Police, John Avery should
not indicate to Bazley that any
information about wrong-do-
ing given by him in interviews
with police would not be used
in evidence against him unless
he were first cautioned.
“Should information of this
nature be disclosed by Mr
Bazley,” Anderson wrote,
“consideration would then be
given to recommending the
grant of formal immunity.”
Anderson confirmed that
the police department was
prepared to pay Bazley $lOO
an hour to cover his legal
expenses during interviews.

THE PEOPLE who write the
headings on this page are
called sub-editors, a largely
unsung breed of journalist,
one of whose British ilk
dreamed up what must be the
heading of the year (or, more
probably, the story to go with
the heading of the year).
It concerned a tench-eating
contest in Scotland (where
tench is a popular fish) in
which there were two finalists,
a Mr Hicks from Fife and a
Swede called Sven. During
the contest, Hicks lost a tooth
thus allowing Sven to win
with nine fish consumed.
The headline? One Tooth
Free For Fife’s Hicks, Sven
Ate Nine Tench.
Ivan’s avian disclaimer
NEIL Kinnock, the British
Labor leader, who recently
visited Moscow, has a nice
repertoire of Russian jokes.
For example: A comrade
turns up at KGB headquarters
on a cold, wet Sunday after-
noon and demands to talk to
the head of state security on a
matter of the utmost import-
ance. After some trouble, the
comrade is taken to the great
man’s dacha (weekender),
near Moscow. “Why are you
interrupting my day of rest?”
demands the KGB chief.
The comrade explains that
he has a serious problem He
has lost his parrot.
“Well,” says the KGB
man, “this is Sunday after-
noon in Moscow; it is cold
and are not many parrots are
lying around. Someone is
bound to find it.”
“That is the very point I
want to make, comrade.
When the parrot is found and
brought in, you must
understand that the views of
the parrot are not necessarily
mine.”

An Aborigine sees both sides on land rights
ABORIGINAL Senate can-
didate Burnam Burnam, a
full-blood born on the New
South Wales south coast 48
years ago, last week had some
harsh words to say about
urban Aborigines leading the
fight for land rights.
“They have the albino syn-
drome,” he said “blue and
green eyes and blond hair and
whiter skin than the farmers.
“I feel quite strong about
this point because the reality
is, in government administra-
tion, there are hardly any
black Aborigines in pro-
minent positions. The full
Aborigine will sit down and
get total consensus but
nothing more.
“The full Aborigine is
more gentle, discreet and less
angry.”
Burnam is standing as an
independent in NSW (al-
though he also is supporting
the Nuclear Disarmament
Party). Some might consider
him radical on the nuclear
Burnam Burnam
issue but when it comes to
land rights he is very much a
moderate.
He wants a five-year
moratorium on the introduc-
tion of federal land rights
legislation. The proposed
legislation, he said, had
created division and resent-
ment because white people
were being threatened with
loss of land. “White people
are now going through the
stage that Aborigines went
through being dispos-
sessed,” he said. “I don’t think
two wrongs make a right.” .
Burnam, one of the first
Aborigines to matriculate (he
later studied Law) believes
white people are most de-
prived when it comes to
government hand-outs. His
only election promise is to
introduce a private member’s
bill extending grants for
Aboriginal education to all
low-income families.
He is not at all impressed
with hand-outs to Aborigines.
In his mind, they cause
further resentment and divi-
sion. “The hand-out mentality
has killed our initiative,
motivation and dignity,” he
said.


Bikini blast at state minister
THE girls of Brigidine Col-
lege at Indooroopilly, a
Brisbane suburb, were not
amused last week when a
department of Transport
pamphlet on Moped safety
depicting bikini-clad women
was handed out at the school.
Senior students handed the
tracts back, saying that they
found them “offensive to our
dignity as women,” and
accused Transport minister
Don Lane of sexism.
Prefect Cathy Bell, 16,
said: “The models have
nothing to do with Mopeds
and even less to do with
safety. If the girl on the
Moped fell off, she would
receive severe lacerations.”,
Lane did not think the
pamphlets offensive but
apologised. He said he
presumed the girls were
serious but guessed “they
were having a bit of fun at my
expense.”
It was a suggestion that
further upset the Brigidine
students. “It seems, because
we’re young people, Mr Lane
doesn’t want to take us ser-
iously,” Bell said.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
I ONCE asked a backgammon
player (after watching him lose a
game) why he had hit a particular
blot at a crucial point. “Why not?”
he replied, “It was there and I left
myself in no danger.” Great
mountaineers may climb Everest
“because its there”, but if you're
going to play top backgammon
you’ve got to learn that sometimes
its more beneficial to leave a blot
alone than it is to hit it.
Look at the illustration. White
is well positioned but the game
still has a long way to go. White to
roll throws a 2-4. He can move a
man from 812 to W 7 completing
the six-point prime, and that’s the
only “sane” play. The question is:
does he hit the blot on W 1 along
the way (dotted line play) or move
as per the solid line leaving it
alone?
White’s problem of course is
that he could get hit during the
bearing-olf stage. As it stands if he
gets hit while Black’s home board
is closed, the balance of the game
will change instantly and Black
will become the favorite.
Suppose White does hit, Black
will sit on the bar and it could take
him half a dozen rolls to produce
a 1 for re-entry. In the meantime
his home board remains intact and
threatening to White.
Suppose on the other hand,
White moves the 4 first, leaving
the Black blot alone. Black must
now move and as soon as his blot
reaches home he will be forced
into breaking up his board. By
leaving Black alone, White forces
him to move and this movement
will ultimately end in his (Black’s)
destruction.
By hitting, White allows Black
to maintain his timing and
strength.
BRIDGE
by B.Jay Becker
Partner bids three hearts, neither
side vulnerable, and the next
player passes. What would you
bid now, with each of the follow-
ing five hands?
1. 4 J 963 VAS 0A74 4K982
2.4AQ875 <?72 0 KQ63 4AIO
3.4 842 52J843 0 10 4AQ852
4.4AJ74 <?96 OAKQB2 4A3
5.4 AQ9862 <?7 0 974 4A84
1. Pass. Partner’s three-heart
bid describes a hand with a fairly
strong seven-card suit that does
not make the grade as a one-bid
by ordinary standards. The high-
card content is usually 7 to 10
points. An opening three bid in a
suit is basically a defensive
measure used when the opener
thinks his or her side is probably
outgunned and that the opponents
have a good chance for a game,
perhaps a slam.
Since the opener has less than
an opening bid and his hand also
is less than an opening bid and
it ordinarily takes two opening
bids to make game the best bet
is to pass and hope that partner
will make nine tricks.
2. Four hearts. Here is a rea-
sonable chance for game and to
bid it is best: Your “opening bid
plus,” facing partner’s “opening
bid minus,” will probably produce
10 tricks. There should be no
compunction about raising with
only two trumps because partner
probably has a seven-card suit.
3. Four hearts. This may seem
strange, in view of the previous
comments, but this time the raise
to four is essentially a strategic
manoeuvre. There is virtually no
hope for 10 tricks; the raise is an
effort to deceive the enemy into
thinking you are trying seriously
for game.
The bluff is unlikely to suc-
ceed, since the opponents can
make at least a game, but very
little harm can come from putting
on a bold front. You might even
get lucky and come home not too
badly bruised.
4. Six hearts. No guarantees go
with this bid but slam prospects
are nevertheless excellent. About
all your partner needs for a slam is
seven hearts to the K-Q-J and a
side king. To let the bidding die
under six hearts would be overly
pessimistic.
5. Pass. You can’t fight City
Hall. A game is out of the question
and three spades (forcing) is likely
to make matters worse. Bear in
mind that partner has announced
a poor hand suitable for only
hearts, so why look for trouble?

On November 30,1809, during a private meeting
at the Tuileries Palace, Napoleon announced
to Josephine his intention to divorce her.
As she fainted into the waiting arms of
Bousset, the palace prefect, the lady
whispered, “But I gave him everything”.
Sadly, she had not been able to give him Lindt,
one of the world’s finest chocolates.
Manufactured in Switzerland since 1845, Lindt
chocolates have become synonymous with gift
giving whenever it’s important to make a truly
lasting impression.
Happily the Lindt range of bars, chocolettis and
assortments is now available in Australia from all fine
chocolate shops.
One of the finest chocolates in the world.
