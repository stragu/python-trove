A wilful and independent
Senate will be the main
stumbling block to a Hawke
government fresh from the
December 1 polls with a
huge majority. The
Bulletin's team of political
writers look at the
components of the new and
powerful Senate. Also in
our election coverage this
week, the inimitable Larry
Pickering gives his view of
the issues. Page 27, 70.

Eighteen kilometres from
Ayers Rock, smack bang in the
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, WE’VE BUILT
A VILLAGE CALLED YULARA.
And if you’re going to be
STRANDED IN THE DESERT, THIS IS
JUST THE PLACE TO DO IT.
But before you do, you must
LEARN THE BASICS OF SURVIVAL.
The first lesson is to locate
ALL THE WATER HOLES.
After all, people have been
KNOWN TO WANDER AROUND IN
Yulara for minutes at a time,
TRYING TO FIND ONE OF THE MANY
COCKTAIL BARS OR SWIMMING
POOLS.
The second lesson is even
MORE IMPORTANT.
The desert can often be an
INHOSPITABLE PLACE AT NIGHT, SO
TPIE CHOICE OF SHELTER IS CRITICAL.
WE RECOMMEND FOUR PLACES:
The fully facilitated Yulara
CAMPING SITE.
The Ernest Giles Tavern.
The ioo room Four Seasons
Hotel.
The 230 room Sheraton Hotel
Lastly, you will have to
DECIDE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO
MAKE THE 18 KILOMETRE TREK TO
Ayers Rock.
Will it be by air-conditioned
coach? Or air-conditioned car?
Yulara.
IF YOU’RE EVER GOING TO BE
STRANDED IN
THE DESERT, THIS
IS JUST THE PLACE
TO DO IT.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Let’s hear it for Ron!
More cheers for indestructible Ron
Saw’s rebuff to unspeakable pollution of
the airwaves (B, September 25). We
could do with his support in Noozillan.
God knows where the current crop of
mike maulers was nurtured.
TV has been telling about farmers
who expect to “recuperate” losses, a
storm that “wrecked” havoc, companies
that “distrißUTE” profits, a lawyer who
was the “execUTor” of an estate. We’ve
been assured “Ken Andrews is one of
those people who enjoys what he does,”
and the other day police performed the
recurring miracle of finding two empty
cans of beer. In the lingo of the time,
that would undoubtedly be a “well-
knowen” occurrence. How about
coming over, Ron, to look up your old
mate, Don Grady, and reinforcing the
troops in resisting the common enemy
of sloppy, who-the-hell-cares airborne
speech?

A librarian’s life
Ineffective! Boozing on a Friday night!
Sleeping in on a Sunday morning!
Julia Parry’s image of librarianship
(“A woman’s fight to satisfy her priestly
vocation,” B, October 16) certainly
gives the old ladylike-and-lethargic im-
age a bit of a knock!
And there are even hints that it might
be true. The UK Library Association
put out a T-shirt proclaiming “I’m a
L.A. about,” and we all have a hazy sort
of memory of the advertisement that
said “I was the mainstay of the public
library until I discovered somebody-or-
other’s vodka.” Vodka in the public
library! No wonder librarians keep
saying “Shoosh!” all the time ... the
hangovers must be awful.
But where Julia really doesn’t have
both oars in the water is over her idea
that the road to librarianship is not a
“tortuous path.” After all, just how
many divinity students have had to get
out of bed, like the librarian of the
University of Czernowitz, and fight a
duel with a professor over students’
access to books? And how many divin-
ity students have had to deal with a
professor of economics like Schum-
peter, anyway?
Now that’s tortuous.

been burgled. ”

Like our Northern Territory friends

‘Thumbs-down’ Trinity
These days, when the dignity and pro-
bity of the Bench is under almost daily
discussion, it contrasts strangely with
the 1940 s when the High Court of
“My family’s all grown up now-
except my husband, of course. ”
Criminal Appeal consisted of three
knights Sir Frederick Joran (Chief
Justice), Sir Thomas Bavin and Sir
Percival Halse-Rogers.
Nobody could dispute the dignity of
these three awesome figures who won
fame throughout the legal profession by
rarely, if ever, upholding an appeal.
Apropos of this, I wrote a short verse
which circulated widely among
barristers and solicitors at the time.
In a setting severe, remote and austere,
Sir Percy, Sir Freddy, Sir Tom,
Administer Law (as applied to the poor)
With dignity, grace and aplomb
This Trinity deals with a man who
appeals,
And lest he should do something worse,
he
Is sent back to goal, unrepentant and
pale,
By Sir Freddy, Sir Tom and Sir
Percy.
They never uphold an appeal, so I’m told,
To dismiss one, they’re always quite
ready,
So I’d tremble with fear, if I had to
appear
Before Percy, Sir Tom and Sir Freddy.
Under the lap, the verse went the
rounds of the barristers and solicitors of
that time. It may even have reached one
of the three knights.

ity to build up my business. But not
anymore. I feel like an unpaid tax
collector.
I feel I am swimming in a sea of
stupidity, tied up by bureaucratic red
tape. Morris West put it so eloquently.
Laws are to serve the individual so that
he can live a full productive life. We
now have a situation where our laws
penalise the thrifty, reward the under-
achiever and discriminate against the
wealth producers. Industrial laws have
condemned our youth to unemploy-
ment.
I want to spend my own money;
nobody can do it as well as me. I want
to pay my own doctor. I don’t want to
start a needless traffic jam paying 20
cents to cross the harbor bridge.
I expect the government to deliver
the mail within days, not weeks as it
does now.
I expect to pay a fair price for
electricity and my phone comparable
with charges elsewhere in the world.
Mr Hawke, you’re our leader, how
about doing something about it rather
than copying Malcolm Fraser by drag-
ging us prematurely to the polls to
capitalise on any short-term electoral
advantage?

Hackle raiser
Your Bulletin is a joy to read. I am a fan
of Ron Saw who writes the way Ron
Searle draws - with style and economy
of line.
Please, do not ever drop columnist
David McWhatsisname from your
pages. He writes like a governor-general
does nothing, but beautifully so. But
he is needed to keep the hackles rising.
Too much joy cannot be good for you
so the regular dander raising is
necessary.
Even without his achtzehnhundert-
siebsig ein und siebzig mo he looks
like a clone of the original David Low
Blimp. He stirred the ire again on
October 9 with his “Don’t get sick ...”
The paragraph broke all basic rules of
factual journalism what, when, where,
who and how. It met all Blimp
characteristics.
Kind regards to Dame Edna.

Anglicised Asians
The article “Inside Asian Australia” (B,
October 9) portrays Asian immigrants
in terms of misleading cultural
stereotypes. Ignored are the many
Australians of Asian descent who for
several generations prior to immigra-
tion, have felt a greater affinity for
Anglophone cultures than their own.
They feature prominently at

With the advent of the season’s in-
ternational cricket contests we should,
no doubt, brace ourselves in anticipa-
tion of the flood of childish conjectures
and pseudo authoritative assertions that
will flow from the commentary box on
phases of the matches. I refer in par-
ticular to those mid-wicket conferences
by the batsmen.
Well, I am about to reveal the truth.
My authority? Half a century of umpir-
ing schoolboy matches.
Two conditions:
(a) The unconquered batsman meets
the incoming man and utters three
words: “Don’t get out.”
(b) The faster scorer, having watched
his sluggish partner play a maiden over,
calls him to the half-way point and
utters two words: “Hittem, eh!”

No going back
While I sympathise with L. Alexander
(B, October 23) who is having problems
sponsoring his brother in Scotland for
family reunion migration, I have to
point out that for people like myself,
who wish to join brothers and sisters
settled in the UK, there is NO
sponsorship and NO family reunion
whatsoever permitted by the British
government.
Many Australians are unaware of
that fact.

Auschwitz operations
I take issue with B. Morris (B, Letters,
October 16) stating that no blueprints of
homicide gas chambers have survived.
Anyone caring to examine the first
edition of Purnell’s History Of The
Second World War will find blueprints
of the Auschwitz gas chambers in Vol. 3,
No. 15, page 1313. On page 1315 are
photographs of gas chambers and ovens
for the reduction of bodies. The ovens
were patented in Germany on October
26, 1942, by J. A. Topf and Sons of
Erfurt.
Should doubt persist about the
sinister operations carried out in
Auschwitz, I quote (from Purnell Vol. 8,
No. 7, page 3316) evidence given by
Rudolf Hess at the Nuremberg war
crime trials: “I commanded Auschwitz
until December 1, 1943, and estimate


Swiss Achievement
You may now forget everything
you ever read
about quartz watches
Longines introduce
the Conquest VHP
One quartz watch may cost
100 times as much as another. But
when it comes to performance,
how much difference is there?
Truth about accuracy.
Take it as a fact of life: a quartz
watch will vary by about two
minutes a year, regardless of brand
or price. Main reason for this
variation is the effect of the
changing temperature on the
quartz crystal inside the watch, the
heart of its timekeeping system.
Meaning of VHP.
In the Longines Conquest VHP
(for Very High Precision) a newly
developed movement largely
neutralises that effect, achieving
an accuracy of one minute in five
years. That comes to one second
per month and is, as matters now
stand, the frontier of wrist-watch
precision.
6-vear battery.
A watch battery normally runs
on silver oxide and will last a year
or two. The battery of Conquest
VHP uses lithium and has a life
span of six years.
Silky hardness
Equally innovative is the
Conquest VHP case. It consists of
the extremely hard XL alloy and
has a protective layer of even
harder titanium carbide. The silky
texture of the case is due to
thousands of microscopic craters
obtained by blasting with synthetic
sapphire pellets.
Tradition counts.
The Conquest VHP is a unique
blend of craftsmanship, technology
and inventiveness.
It is probably the most
advanced watch you can own today,
even if it still shares something
with the Longines models of 1832,
namely the Swiss craftsman’s pride
in a job well done.

New V 8 Holden l
Loses by 0.6 see/
To measure the performance of the
new Holden Commodore SS VB, compare
it with the well bred Porsche 911 Carrera*
Both cars accelerate from rest to
IOOKs in under 7 secs* The Carrera in 6*l
secs, the SS in 6*7 secs*
Over4oo metres, there's nothing in it:
14*3 secs for the Carrera, vs* 14*9 for V 8
Commodore SS*
Not only does the SS go like a
Carrera, it stops brilliantly too, with big
discs all round*
The V 8 Commodore SS handling is
also preferred over many of Europe's
finest* Designed by Peter Brock himself
the V 8 Commodore SS is based on his
experience of seven wins at Bathurst*
Brock has included a limited slip
differential, a blueprinted ignition system,
and HDT high performance cylinder
heads with large inlet and exhaust valves*
He has also added a refined inlet manifold
with improved inlet passages and free flow
extractor exhaust system* Power steering,
HDT gas rear suspension, 15" HDT alloy
wheels and low-profile Uniroyals provide
an outstanding ride with precise handling*
Apart from beating a lot of classy cars at
their own high performance game, the 5,0 litre
V 8 powered Commodore SS can do practical
things such as towing boats, floats and caravans,
and comfortably accommodate 5 people and
their luggage.

that at least 2,500,000 victims were
executed and exterminated there by
gassing and burning and at least an-
other half-million succumbed to starva-
tion and disease, making a total dead of
about 3,000,000.”
No facilities for gassing people
existed at Belsen because it was a
concentration camp and not an extermi-
nation camp.
Belsen was a “sick camp” to which
prisoners suffering from various dis-
eases were consigned after selection
from deportation convoys and other
camps. (Purnell Vol. 5, No. 13, page
2150.)
When Belsen was handed over by the
Germans to the British, on April 13,
1945, the British found 40,000 inmates
dying at a rate of 400 to 500 a day and
10,000 unburied bodies. (Vol. 7, No. 15,
page 3081.)
Despite the apologies offered by B.
Morris, the Holocaust did happen and
its horrors are not diminished nor are
they condoned by the existence of
starvation and disease in the world of
today.
H. SULLIVAN
Lenah Valley Tas
The main point
B. Morris suggests that inmates of nazi
concentration camps died of typhus and
starvation, not as the result of gassing.
The cause of death, however, is inciden-
tal to the fact that they died in con-
centration camps.
Any country or government which
sees a need to imprison so many people,
for whatever reason, is not healthy.
They were not holiday camps; they
were death camps and, although I
believe the cause of death was gassing,
the cause is secondary to the fact of
death.
What a sad world it would be if we
all tried to excuse such suffering.

New Zealand allure
Now that the New Zealand government
has decided to make New Zealand the
Switzerland of the South-west Pacific
(but minus the gnomes of Zurich),
would it not be a good idea if some of
our leading citizens who are fearful of
uranium mining and nuclear-powered
ships seek asylum in New Zealand?
I refer to such gentlemen as Senator
Chipp, Mr P. White, Dr J. Camilleri and
others. Although these people and their
followers probably mean well, they are
stirring up doubt and confusion in the
community.
Nuclear power is a reality and will
not go away. Countries like New
Zealand, which want to turn the clock
back, will ultimately become a greater
technological backwater than they are
already.

Benefits under the Act
How can Clyde Holding claim the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Heritage (Interim Protection) Act 1984
is working (B, October 9)?
Without this legislation, none of the
three claims made each one widely
ridiculed could have eventuated.
Taxpayers’ money would not have
been wasted on flying bureaucrats from
Canberra to Western Australia and
Queensland and no platform would
have been built from which the NAC
could launch another fierce attack on
the government for not helping
Aborigines.
“Earthlings are now attacking our landing supports...repeat...Earthlings are now...


Holding claimed, “the Act can be
used only where a significant Aboriginal
area or object is under threat and the
local state or territory law does not
provide effective protection of it.”
It was, they weren’t, they did.
So, who benefited from the Act
“working”?

McNicoll rankles
I was very surprised and rather annoyed
by the flippant remarks made by your
columnist David McNicoll (B, October
9) concerning Northern Territory road
closure by Aboriginals, and sacred sites.
The article was even more startling
in an edition which had as a lead story
“Aussie racism a myth exposed.” Is
prejudice against black Aussies not
racism or is this becoming acceptable in
our society?
Aboriginals were the “park rangers”
of our continent for 40,000 years, before
Europeans came along, and it was
found to be unspoiled. Our national
parks have only been under threat from
commercial development and pollution
(and insensitive park rangers) since
then.
Championing the gripes of any one
individual can be a risky business, as
what usually comes over is rather an
imbalanced picture as the discussed
article is.
The road in question goes the full
length of Arnhem Land, is open com-
pletely for only six months of the year
and then only to four-wheel-drive
vehicles. It only feeds one pre-
dominantly white Australian town
Nhulunbuy which is situated in
Arnhem Land. If open to all, Arnhem
Land will be finished.
Mr McNicoll also seems rather free
with his assumption of “our” support,
with his attitude “in the opinion of
Wood and most Territorians” and
“like other Territorians . . .” Having
lived in the Northern Territory for 12
years, the last six of which were in
Arnhem Land, and considering that
nearly one third of the NT population
are black (and another third of various
ethnic backgrounds), I know that Mr
McNicoll has not the support that he
claims.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
UN role ahead
THE 157-member United
Nations General Assembly
has elected Australia to its Se-
curity Council by 146 votes
for a two-year term. The
council, which has 15 mem-
bers, is the UN’s most import-
ant organ with far-reaching
rights and duties such as
peace-keeping and the impo-
sition of sanctions. Australia,
one of the UN’s founding
members, had served three
times before on the council.
Trimbole found
IRISH police have arrested
alleged Australian crime boss
Robert Trimbole, 53, in Dub-
lin. He has lived in Ireland
under the name of Michael
Hanbury, posing as a retired
gentleman with means. He is
said to be suffering from can-
cer. Australian government
authorities have started pro-
ceedings for his extradition on
various charges including
murder.
Inflation down
STATISTICS released last
week showed that Australia’s
inflation rate in the year to
September was 6.1 percent,
Bill Morrison: retiring from politics
compared with 9.2 percent for
the same period a year ago.
Treasurer Keating predicted
that the figure for the
December quarter “will prob-
ably be lower.”
Cocos decision
BY a six-to-one majority
ruling the High Court restored
the right of John Clunies-Ross
to remain in his home in the
Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Jus-
tice Murphy dissented. In
1978 the Australian Govern-
ment bought most of the
Clunies-Ross holdings on the
islands for $6.25 million and
last year it tried to purchase
the remaining five hectares.
After Clunies-Ross refused to
sell, arguing that his family
had lived on the islands since
1826, the commonwealth
moved to acquire the holding
compulsorily.
Morrison resigns
FEDERAL government
backbencher Bill Morrison, a
former career diplomat then
Labor and Defence minister
in the Whitlam adminis-
tration, resigned from the safe
seat of St George. He is tipped
to become ambassador to
Indonesia.
ALP figure dies
LONDON-born Edward
(Joe) Chamberlain, who be-
came one of Australia’s most
influential Labor leaders, died
in Perth aged 84.
Apology to our subscribers
The Bulletin tenders its deepest apologies to those subscribers,
particularly in Sydney, who received late copies of our last
edition.
It was due to a sequence of compounding delays. First, our
printers were late in delivering the subscription copies to Aus-
tralia Post. The designated post office then could not cope with
the load at that time and transferred it to the Rushcutters Bay
Post Office. That post office on that day had a bomb scare which
delayed all postings there and the situation had still not been
straightened out last weekend.
Such are the perils of publishing.
THE WORLD
Trimbole (left) leaving court
Priest ‘slain’
POLISH Interior minister
General Czeslaw Kiszczak an-
nounced that a police captain
and two lieutenants had ad-
mitted killing one of Poland’s
most outspoken anti-commu-
nist priests, Father Jerzy
Popieluszko, who disap-
peared on October 19. No
body has been found. The
three, said Kiszczak, had been
charged.
Aquino suspects
A FIVE-person Filipino civ-
ilian inquiry board investigat-
ing the murder of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino on
August 21 last year has pre-
sented two reports to Presi-
dent Marcos. Four members
of the board implicated high-
ranking military officers in-
cluding one of the President’s
closest supporters, General
Fabian Ver in the assassina


tion. A separate report by Mrs
Corazon Agrava, who chaired
the inquiry, did not implicate
Ver. Marcos has ordered a
special civilian court to pros-
ecute all suspects mentioned.
Miners’ talks
BRITISH miners’ leader
Arthur Scargill has admitted
that representatives of the Na-
tional Union of Mineworkers
held talks with the Libyan
government on support for
their eight-month-old strike.
According to The Sunday
Times of London, Scargill
and union executive Roger
Windsor flew to Paris to meet
a man who looks after pay-
ments to Libyan-supported
groups. Britain broke diplo-
matic relations with Libya six
months ago, after a police-
woman was killed outside
the Libyan People’s Bureau
(embassy) in London.
Uranium find
THE world’s allegedly richest
uranium reserves have been
found in Saskatchewan prov-
ince,. Canada. The find has an
estimated average uranium
content of more than 10 per-
cent, compared with 3 percent
for existing rich Canadian
mines.
Bomb gaffe
BRITONS were not amused
last week when they learned
that an obviously over-zeal-
ous member of the large de-
tachment of bodyguards
which accompanied French
President Francois Mitter-
rand on his four-day state visit
had planted explosives at the
French ambassador’s London
residence to test the efficiency
of British security. Scotland
Yard detectives discovered
the bombs and an outcry fol-
lowed. Politicians described
the incident as idiotic and in
appalling taste.
Deaths
FRENCH film director
Francois Truffaut, founder of
the “cinema of feelings,” died
of cancer in Paris. He was 52.
Two days after his death,
one of his stars, Vienna-born
Oskar Werner, 62, collapsed
and died of a heart attack in
Bonn (West Germany).
BUSINESS
Issue withdrawn
AFTER more than a month of
negotiations with the Sydney
Stock Exchange, John Fairfax
& Sons Ltd called off its
proposed $96 million pref-
erence share issue and has no
plans for alternative fund-
raising. Fairfax called the ex-
change’s objection to the issue
“remarkable” and withdrew
the proposal “with both regret
and disappointment.”
Bass Strait move
ESSO and BHP announced
they would spend $l.B billion
in the most expensive and
comprehensive development
yet of the Bass Strait oil fields.
The partners’ decision follows
the federal government’s
move to reduce the tax take
from the Bass Strait fields
from 87.5 to 55 percent.
CRA steel plan
CRA Ltd confirmed it was
negotiating to take up a 35
percent interest in a proposed
West German steel conglom-
erate in a move that will lock
European buyers of Hamers-
ley iron ore into long-term
contracts. CRA’s entry is be-
lieved to have cost around
$2lO million.
Timor Sea find
A BHP Petroleum-led consor-
tium recovered oil and gas
from wireline tests of a hydro-
carbon bearing formation at
around 1418 m in the Challis
No 1 well in the Timor Sea.
Planned total depth is 1600 m
and BHP is drilling ahead.

The horror story of
Ferntree Gully High
Ferntree Gully parental pressure group: (from left) Ollvia Ball, Barbara Garrett, Phil Ryan, and Wendy Sandlant
Ferntree Gully High can offer its students - along with a pioneering alternative
curriculum plenty of space. The trouble is, as TIM DUNCAN explains, it is not
supposed to be that way: angry parents have been taking their children from a school
now operating at less than half capacity but still a pet of key educationists.
A VICTORIAN state secondary school
which has pioneered a non-competitive
“alternative” curriculum and been
touted by educationists as the promise
of things to come is in deep trouble.
Ferntree Gully High, at the foot of
the Dandenong Ranges on Melbourne’s
outer east flank, is operating at less than
half capacity. Angry local families
not impressed by what they see as
absence of discipline there, disappear-
ance of traditional academic subjects
and erosion of respect of children for
teachers and parents have accused the
school’s committed teachers of having
wrested it from its community.
Parents in Ferntree Gully are refus-
ing to allow their children to suffer what
they say are the limited life options that
result from non-competitive alternative
education. Consequently, they are
sending their children anywhere but to
Ferntree Gully High. Neighboring
schools have become impossibly
overcrowded because of this.
Worse, parents say, the community
of children around the school has been
dispersed and scores of friendships have
been broken. Hard-pressed parents are
driving kilometres extra each day.
Although unwilling, the state’s Edu-
cation department has become party to
a situation that allows one “alternative”
school which nearby parents do not
want to tie up facilities the area’s
popular traditional schools require
desperately.
The department could refuse the
parents who are unhappy with the
Ferntree Gully “alternative” the option
to transfer children to other schools. But
this inevitably would force a confronta-
tion between the school, backed by the
Victorian Secondary Teachers Associa-
tion and the Victorian Institute of
Secondary Education, and the local
community. The department has backed
off.
The association and the institute
have led the attack on traditional aca-
demic curricula that culminate in the
final-year Higher School Certificate
(HSC), the recognised entrance
qualification for tertiary education and
the qualification for training most-
recognised by white-collar employers.
Ferntree Gully High was one of the
first schools in the state secondary
system to do away with HSC a
decision made on the grounds that it did
not suit students’ needs. The STC course
(Schools Year 12 and Tertiary Educa-
tion Certificate) replaced HSC in 1980.
The STC course will have spread to
about 70 Victorian secondary schools
by the start of the next school year,
although very few follow Ferntree Gully
High and offer STC alone.
According to an official explanatory


document, the STC course is based on
four educational values:
■ Participation. (“The participation
of students in the development of
curriculum is an effective way of
encouraging students to develop skills
in decision-making and self-manage-
ment and to develop a sense of control
over their own lives.”).
■ Adaptation of course content to
student needs.
■ Assessment. (“Accepting that in-
dividuals vary in abilities and aptitudes,
the course developers believe that the
only fair assessment of a student’s past
performance should take the form of
descriptive statements of achievement
made in real terms about real skills and
knowledge. Such assessment is based
upon a clear statement of aims and
objectives in conjunction with that
student.”)
■ Unified nature of the course. (“. . .
individual subjects, general meetings,
work experience and post-secondary
visits should be seen by students and
teachers to operate as a total program
where no aspect is superfluous and
where all aspects work together. The
unified nature of the course is central to
providing students with real experience
of managing their own curricula.”)
Behind the rhetoric of the program is
a notion of industrial democracy in the
schoolplace, the practice of which is
assumed to have inherent virtues that
transcend the mundane task of academ-
ic development favored in traditional
schools.
The STC course was in part
developed by association teachers at
Ferntree Gully and the secondary edu-
cation institute has used the school as a
model in efforts to extend use of the new
course throughout Victoria. The in-
stitute is also aiming to eradicate exam-
inations from the state secondary
system and to break the hold of the
universities over secondary educational
curricula and standards.
But, if Ferntree Gully High is the
promise of things to come, perhaps the
advocates of alternative education
should prepare themselves to take on
the population. The department is
caught between teachers and parents,
unable to satisfy the grievances of the
latter for fear of challenging the power
of the former.
Meanwhile, parents are voting with
their children’s feet.
Ferntree Gully High had a total
enrolment of 824 students in 1972. At
the beginning of this year, 403 students
were there. According to estimates
supplied by the Maroondah regional
office of the department, about 360
children still attend the school. The
region estimates that the school’s
facilities, utilised to an extent compar-
able with what is normal throughout the
PUBLIC OPINION
Peacock, L-NP
start to narrow
the huge gap
Andrew Peacock: a slight improvement
A WEEK OF good performance at the
polls has lifted Andrew Peacock’s ap-
proval rating as Opposition leader to 24
percent in the latest Morgan Gallup
Poll. However, he and the Liberal and
National party coalition are still trailing
the Labor government badly and still
appear certain to lose the December 1
election.
The Labor Party poll of 50 percent is
ample to get it re-elected under the
altered electoral boundaries. The sig-
nificant point is that the Labor Party is
leading the coalition by 9 percent at
this stage of the election. A gap of 6
percent was adequate to give it a big
majority in the last election.

state, could accommodate another 500
pupils.
Six feeder primary schools are zoned
to Ferntree Gully High and 310 children
will leave them this year to begin
secondary education.
On current estimates authoritative,
according to the Maroondah regional
director of education, Dr Robin
Chapman only 26 of the 310 children
will attend their local high school next
year. Another 23 will come ffom outside
the zone, making 49 to start Year 7 at
Ferntree Gully fewer than a third of
the number the school is designed to
take.
Ferntree Gully parents are appealing
to the regional school placements com-
mittee to have their children transferred
to more orthodox schools nearby. One
hundred and six children went else-
where last year as a result of parental
appeals. Many parents this year have
opted directly for technical or private
schools. The appeals are down to 61.
Despite what teachers at Ferntree
Gully High say, the area population of
children of secondary school age is by
no means declining.
Nearby Fairhills High has had to
accommodate its extra quota in 10
portable classrooms.
Laurie Watson, principal of Upwey
High, told The Bulletin that about 100
students there really should be at Fern-
tree Gully. Upwey has about 100 more
students than it should have.
The regional estimate is that about
half the overcrowding of schools in the
area results from the refusal of parents
to accept what Ferntree Gully High
provides. Overcrowding attributable to
the community reaction to the school
has required the installation of about 15
portable classrooms in all. They have
cost the Victorian taxpayer about
$500,000.
By contrast, Ferntree Gully High is
Chris King with daughter Alison: a battle to change schools
sitting on about $5 million in grounds,
buildings and facilities which it has
refused to share with the nearby Fern-
tree Gully Technical School which is
terribly crowded. A regional estimate is
that about 19 classrooms are either
vacant or barely used at Ferntree Gully
High.
A small group of mothers, angered
by their perceived need to find another
school for their children, formed a
pressure group early this year. Headed
by Wendy Sandlant, whose children
easily could walk to Ferntree Gully
High each day, they approached first
Chapman and then local state and
federal members Steve Crabb and Peter
Milton. They presented Victoria’s Edu-
cation minister, Robert Fordham, with
a letter of support representing the
views of 150 local families.
“Our argument is that it’s our zoned
high school but because of what the
teachers there have turned it into, we
can’t use it,” Sandlant told The Bulletin.
“We are also pointing out that all the
other high schools are having problems
because of it.”
The Bulletin contacted the principal
at Ferntree Gully High, Jack Diamond,
who described aspects of the school but
explained that he did not think that it
would profit by airing its problems in
public. A teacher who has led the
defence of the school in the local press
was more forthcoming. On Sandlant’s
group, senior teacher Bob King said:
“They all think that their kids are going
to be brain surgeons at Year 7. It’s an
extremist group. They think we corrupt
the values of the students.
“That’s fair enough; it puts us on a
A tertiary kindergarten, parents claim
ACCORDING to Wendy Sandlant’s
action group, going to school at Fern-
tree Gully High is rather like going to a
play-pen, except that some of the
inmates are aged 18.
There are no uniforms, although
these will be introduced next year in a
symbolic attempt to placate the local
community.
Senior students are allowed to
smoke, and swearing is accepted as
legitimate “self-expression.”
Children address the teachers by
their first names and those who stay
long enough often develop close ties to
their teachers.
Traditional discipline, with its set
rules and standard punishments for
breaking them, has been largely set
aside. Instead, students are expected to
be responsible for their own behaviour.
Quite often, classes become chaotic and
conscientious students complain that
they are unable to concentrate.
There are no individual text books at
junior level. Rather, a class will work
from “community text books.” Because
these often disappear, groups of four or
five children often work from the same
book.
There is a core curriculum of maths
and general humanities, but the
marking of students’ work is far from
rigorous. Spelling mistakes often are
not corrected, in part because the
students are expected, as part of their
self-assessment, to correct their spelling
themselves.
Self-expression is encouraged at
Ferntree Gully High. Sometimes this
leads to extremes of graffiti painting and
property destruction. A recent concert,


Shirley Lovell with daughter Joanne: her mathematics class disintegrated
plane with Socrates and Gandhi.”
He added: “They represent the con-
servative rump in the community, akin
to the League of Rights. I’m not
kidding.”
The gulf between the alternative
educators and the local community is
widening at an alarming rate but the
disenchantment of parents goes well
beyond absence of an HSC course.
Parents contacted by The Bulletin say
that they do not agree with a school
policy which allows smoking and
swearing, where there is no sequential
course structure and where tertiary edu-
cation receives low priority.
Phil Ryan recently pulled his two
daughters out of the school. He says that
it offered the girls no challenges and
that nothing was expected of them.
Another parent, Shirley Lovell, told
The Bulletin that her daughter Joanne
had asked to be taken away from the
school after a mathematices class dis-
integrated and the teacher started cry-
ing: “I felt that Joanne wouldn’t miss
anything over the next eight weeks and
the worst part of it was that one teacher
agreed with me.”
Barbara Garrett said she had taken
her son out of the school in 1980: “It
was the lack of discipline and the lack
of interest by the teachers. My son was
in a place where he could virtually do
what he wanted. It was like I was telling
my children one thing at home and the
teachers weren’t following it up at
school although they expected me to
follow up what they were doing.”
Olivia Ball never became a Ferntree
Gully High School parent, although she
has two children of secondary school
age and lives close by. “All I know is
that, when I went down there with the
kids to have a look, they were offered 11
periods of art and craft each week and
more if they wanted it,” she said.
Chris King was on the school council
for two years as treasurer. He says that
his daughter Alison once missed a
whole term’s work and a teacher told
her that it would not matter. This year,
she transferred to another high school.
Alison says: “The new school rang
Ferntree Gully High to see what I’d
missed when I was sick. But the teacher
had to ask the class what they had done
last year. He had taught us and he didn’t
have a clue!”
Chris King says parents who want to
take their children out of that environ-
ment face a battle before the school will
agree to a release. “I was told I was
walking backward into the future,” he
says, adding that Alison was told that
she would never make it at a traditional
school with exams. “We had to tell him
I was moving house when I wasn’t,”
says Alison.
But the teachers and the bureaucrats
who support them are convinced that
Ferntree Gully High is a success.
“Our critics do not know much about
the way education is heading in
Victoria,” says teacher Bob King.
“Our courses are made to suit the
needs of the kids, rather than imposed
on them from above. It is the course of
the future.”
He refers to what he says is the
school’s remarkable success in retaining
children right up to Year 12 a feature
which both Maroondah regional
teachers association organiser Graeme
Marshall and Dahle Suggett, secondary
education institute consultant to schools
using the alternative STC program,
point out.
One of the goals of the school is to
keep students creatively occupied off
devised over six weeks by a group of
girls, was disrupted by other pupils
throwing stones and bashing the doors.
Teachers supervising at the concert told
the girls that at least they had tried, and
that was what counted.
For the most part, the curricula are
negotiated between students and
teachers. In other schools this method
works to stimulate alienated under-
achievers. At the school projects that are
supposed to touch on spelling, composi-
tion, history, geography and politics
often reduce to politics alone.
One project supposed to touch on
biology, and reproduction, involved the
care, as if it were a baby, of an egg. The
chief worry of the critical parents is that
the negotiated curricula, which could
potentially touch on anything, in fact
touch on very little, and students take
on new projects with no reference to
what they have dealt with before, or
should attempt in the future.
Reading, writing and arithmetic can
be learnt at Ferntree Gully High, but the
curricula guarantee nothing more than
that.
The electives are heavy on dance,
ceramics, weaving and so on, but very
light on science, literature, history and
economics.
There are no examinations, and there
is little pressure to achieve.
The result is that Ferntree Gully
High students are poorly equipped to
learn boring but necessary parts of
tertiary courses, or to digest material
quickly for exams. As the critical
parents see it, school there is like a
tertiary kindergarten.
Tim Duncan


the streets in the face of high youth
unemployment, yet with morale intact,
so it would seem to have achieved some
measure of success. The argument is
only superficially attractive, however. It
ignores the cost of this success as
measured in unused facilities, over-
crowded neighboring schools and the
limited academic options available for
those who move all the way through the
school. And, second, the retention
statistics are not nearly as favorable to
the cause of the school as those who use
them in its defence make out.
Regional statistics from the Educa-
tion department, revised to September
1984, show that the Year 12 enrolment
at Ferntree Gully High compared to its
Year 7 enrolment was higher than for
the average in both the Maroondah
region and across the state. That is,
55.24 percent of those who entered the
school at Year 7 apparently remained
there until the end of Year 12. The
Maroondah average was 48.57 percent
and that of the state 47.26. But it is not
exactly a startling performance, since
seven of the region’s high schools
overwhelmingly traditionally oriented
do better by the same yardsticks.
Ferntree Gully High retains fewer of its
own students during years 10 and 11
than do 14 other of the 26 high schools
in the region. Ferntree Gully High
manages to keep its numbers up to less
than half of its capacity by attracting
students, many of them well and truly
browned off with traditional academic
curricula, from outside its normal zone.
Nevertheless, some parents appear to
Wendy Sandlant: some children can’t move schools
be happy with the alternative program.
They have revived a group, known as
Friends of Gully High, which holds a
seat on the school council and which
sallies forth to defend it in the local
press. The critics do not have such
representation because most have either
pulled their children out or haven’t sent
them there in the first place or because
they are parents of primary school
children and angry that they will have
to bus their children out soon.
Former school councillor Chris King
says that it was extremely difficult to get
parents to join the council and that it
has had four or five parent vacancies for
most of the past two years. “My impres-
sion was that the staff ran the school the
way they saw fit,” King told The
Bulletin.
Suggett says that recent papers,
originating from Fordham’s ministerial
staff, on curricula development are
wholly sympathetic to the school’s ap-
proach. “In the light of the curriculum
paper, Ferntree Gully looks rosy. It
stands as a model in the light of new
educational policy in Victoria,” says
Suggett.
But what of declining enrolment?
“Of course it’s a great worry. But I’d
hang in there. They could modify a few
things but I wouldn’t answer the
requirements of the critics.”
Further away, in Canberra, the en-
thusiasm for the Ferntree Gully style of
alternative education is even more ful-
some.
It was the only Victorian high school
represented at a recent commonwealth
conference on the Participa-
tion and Equity Program,
touted as a major new plank
in the youth policies of the
Hawke government.
The school was paraded as
a case study of the program’s
principles in operation
because it aims to keep people
at school, to instil self-reliance
and to ensure that dis-
advantaged groups girls,
Aborigines, migrants, the
disabled, and so on receive
special treatment.
The non-competitive, non-
alienating, fully negotiated,
caring, autonomous child
STC program is going ahead
in leaps and bounds, despite
its manifest failure at the
Ferntree Gully pilot plant.
“The runs are on the board
as far as STC is concerned,”
Marshall told The Bulletin.
“People are coming into it by
the busload.”
That may well be so but at
Ferntree Gully they also are
heading out of it by the
busload every day. □
THE ISSUES
Unreality pervades
the tax
reform debate
By DON AITKIN
THERE ARE two taxation issues in the
election campaign. One is a threat issue,
the other a benefit issue. For that reason
there is unlikely to be a sensible debate
about either. Indeed, it is arguable that
an election campaign is absolutely the
wrong place to hold a debate about tax-
ation.
The threat issue has been raised by
the opposition: it is that the Hawke gov-
ernment has something very unpleasant
in the wings a tax on wealth, on capi-
tal gains, perhaps even on children’s
piggy banks. If Labor is re-elected, we
will all rue the day.
The benefit issue is also a Liberal cre-
ation. Elect us, they say, and we will
revamp the taxation system so that
people have the tax cuts due to them. In
particular, families will be able to split
the family income between the parents
for taxing purposes.
Labor is avoiding the threat issue,
and pooh-poohing the benefits. In a
marvellous reversal of roles (for anyone
who remembers the Menzies era) Labor
is asking the Liberals, “Where’s the
money coming from?” The Liberal pol-
icy would be financial irresponsibility,
would favor rich people such as cabinet
ministers, would penalise pensioners,
and so on.
To complicate it all, the National
Party has its own suggestion, a revamp-
ing so that people pay a flat percentage
of their income as taxation. It is not a
silly suggestion, since the Australian in-
come taxation system is no longer pro-
gressive to any degree. But the Liberals
don’t like it, while for Labor it is an
abomination.
There is an air of unreality about it
for two reasons. The first is that virtually
no one expects a coalition government,
let alone the Liberals governing in their
own right, after December 1. The sec-
ond is that for the past two years at
least, Australians have begun to realise
that their taxation system is a hopeless
mess, inefficient, most inequitable, and
very expensive to everyone.
It is accepted that there must be re-
form of the taxation system. But how it
is to be done is not accepted, for there
have been no alternatives proposed by
the government, and citizens have not
been told what the constraints are.
Labor has pushed the whole mess off for
attention in its second term, and tried
even to give the impression that it is not


PICKERING’S ELECTION


a matter the government has thought
about at all.
This is a great pity, for unless Austra-
lians are involved in the business of re-
forming their own taxation system they
will resist whatever is proposed. And
that reform process will have to take
place over a number of years so that we
all have time to digest the changes. The
current shadow-boxing is a bad omen.
No one knows what the electorate
thinks about the taxation issue because
public opinion in this area has not been
properly studied. We know that in the
middle 60s Australians were prepared
to accept more taxation in order to have
a higher level of social welfare benefits.
We know, too, that by the late 70s they
were opposed to any increases in social
welfare that had to be funded by in-
creased taxation. We know that they are
opposed to new taxes.
A reform of the taxation system is a
pattern of changes which brings direct
benefits to some, direct costs to others,
and indirect benefits to all through
greater efficiency and greater equity
at least in principle. What Australians
think might be the best system is simply
not known. My guess is that there is a
wide preparedness to accept that a
major change must come, but that few
have much sense of the constraints
which governments operate under.
For example, the present govern-
ment has achieved a very successful bar-
gain with the trade unions over the
question of wage claims, but the cost of
that bargain is that there have to be tax
cuts. If there are to be tax cuts then there
must be increases in revenue elsewhere
or spending cuts somewhere. It is not
possible to reduce the size of the public
service (which has not in fact grown any
faster than population over the past few
years), while transfer payments (pen-
sions, unemployment benefits, and the
like) are going to increase simply be-
cause the population is growing older
and unemployment is not decreasing
appreciably.
Two questions dominate the debate:
The taxpayers preference is for more
indirect taxes? The ACTU is flatly
opposed to them. While indirect taxes
will soak up some of the money not
paid as tax by those who can avoid pay-
ing personal taxation, they also fall on
everyone and hurt most those who have
least income.
Some taxpayers think a capital gains
tax is essential? OK, but think out very
carefully what can be done about that
great Australian game of buying and
selling the houses we live in. A wealth
tax? There will have to be a register,
which people will find intrusive and
what can be done about inflation, and
the domestic dwelling?
To raise these problems is not to in-
dicate that reform is impossible, but to
suggest that an election campaign is a
fatuous area in which to discuss them.
For that reason, the government’s deter-
mination not to be dragged into a tax-
ation reform debate is rational, while
the opposition’s decision to use scare
tactics, while wearisome, is hardly less
rational given the stakes.
On the other hand, the Liberal and
National proposals are not major re-
forms. Both income-splitting and the
flat rate fiddle with income tax, but do
nothing to tax those who are avoiding
income tax. Unless there are some other
new forms of taxation a flat rate might
have to be set unacceptably high for
those on low incomes, while income-
splitting must logically reduce revenue
and implies new taxes elsewhere.
Most election campaigns turn on the
perceived competence of the govern-
ment of the day, rather than on the
measures it proposes to take or those
that the opposition offers in its place.
The election of 1984 is very much of
that kind, at least so far. And the tax-
ation issue will most probably resolve
itself into “Which party can best be
trusted with the problem?” not “Which
party has the best reform proposal?” □

“WORMALD COUNTS ON
PERKIN-ELMER RELIABILITY M
FROM ABU DHABI TO ANTARCTICA?
Denis Redfern, Manager, Wormald Data Systems.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how Wormald Data Systems
and Perkin-Elmer Computers work together.
Firstly, consider the city of Sydney’s
Fire Brigade and a fire control system of over
7,000 fire alarms.
At the heart of this system, developed by
Wormald Data Systems, is a pair of Perkin-Elmer
32-bit computers.
Naturally in such a system, where lives and
property are at risk, the reliability of the hardware
is paramount.
Considertoo Melbourne's Rialto Building
which upon completion will be the tallest
building in the southern hemisphere.
Wormald Data Systems are providing the
Rialto Building's energy management, fire
detection, security and access control systems,
based around a Perkin-Elmer computer.
The fire protection system Wormald has
installed for the huge new Bayswater Power
Station is based around a pair of Perkin-Elmer
32-bit computers.
As are Wormald Data Systems designed
energy management, fire control and building
management systems, in a diverse range of
applications from oil wells off the coast of
Abu Dhabi, to research stations in Antarctica.
Wormald Data Systems have been building
their systems around Perkin-Elmer computers
since 1975.
And naturally, when you are providing a
product which has at its heart a component
manufactured by another company, you insist
that the other company’s component be
the best there is.
Because if that component fails to deliver,
it’s you who are going to be losing orders.
Yet it stands to reason that Wormald
Data Systems chose to work together with
Perkin-Elmer.
For it was Perkin-Elmer who pioneered the
32-bit minicomputer-a breakthrough
that revolutionised the information industry.
Today, Perkin-Elmer is an acknowledged
industry leader with over 14,000 employees
worldwide, an annual turnover in excess of
% 1 billion and a reputation for hardware reliability
which is second to none.
And that's exactly the kind of security
Wormald understands.
To find out how your company and
Perkin-Elmer Computers can work together,
you should call us on Sydney (02) 887 1000,

HISTORY
New light
on Petrov
accusation
IN THE Bulletin of October 2, veteran
political journalist Rupert Lockwood
broke his long silence to write his
recollections and opinions of the Petrov
defection. In one part of the article,
Lockwood quoted then-Opposition leader
Dr Evatt's former secretary Alan Dalziel
as saying that former chief of United
Press International for the South Pacific
Peter Gruening was on the verge of
breaking a big story concerning
a conspiracy over the Petrov
affair when he died suddenly.
Now, George McCadden, an-
other former UPI bureau chief,
tells the story behind Gruen-
ing ’s suicide.
RUPERT LOCKWOOD’S
article about Petrov demands
correction regarding the
tragic suicide of Peter Gruen-
ing who succeeded me as
Sydney bureau chief of
United Press International in
1954.
Lockwood quotes Alan
Dalziel, late secretary to Dr
Evatt, as follows: “Peter
Gruening had told certain
people that he was following
leads that might break wide
open the political conspiracy
of the Petrov affair. As an
American pressman, he had
come upon information that
suggested something ‘sinister’
in events leading up to
Petrov’s defection. He was working on
what he had gathered and hoped to
make it public before he returned home
to the USA . ». He left his office one day
to drive to Mascot aerodrome to meet a
business associate from another state.
Peter Gruening never reached the aero-
drome. He just disappeared.”
Lockwood seems very sure of the
facts as “recorded” by Dalziel, although
Lockwood deplored the disappearance
of many documents in the files of
Dalziel, Evatt and others.
After recounting how Gruening dis-
appeared on October 28, 1955, and was
found on November 6, “in a Ford
sedan, rubber hose attached to exhaust,
in bush at Castle Hill,” Lockwood goes
on to say: “Justice William O. Douglas
of the United States Supreme Court
wrote to Evatt as a friend of the
distressed family, asking Evatt if he
believed there were suspicious circum-
stances. Evatt had only suspicions, no
evidence. Dalziel asked: ‘Why did Peter
Gruening die? He wasn’t the man to
commit suicide. Who stood to gain by
his death?’ ”
I had enough involvement with Peter
and his employers to possess perhaps
more perspective on his tragedy than
anyone. Peter Gruening DID commit
suicide. It is highly unlikely that he was
“about to break wide open the political
conspiracy of the Petrov affair.”
Furthermore, there was considerable
motivation for the suicide. Peter was an
engaging, excessively extroverted jour-
nalist but he had mental as well as
personal and financial problems. Put
another way, he was an unstable young
man as I came to realise.
I had ample opportunity to observe
Alan Dalziel (left), Dr Evatt, outside the Petrov royal commission
him because between July 1954, when I
resigned from United Press, and June
1956 I managed an Australian sub-
sidiary in Sydney for a New York
public relations firm. Thus, I knew in
his final year that United Press in San
Francisco and New York were dis-
turbed about his excessive entertain-
ment expenses.
A vital development in a vortex of
circumstances which drove him to
suicide should now be part of the
record.
Pete never intimated to me in our
reasonably frequent contacts that he
was going to the USA. Obviously, he
would have feared any recall to New
York because of his financial finangling,
as I later realised.
Poor Pete. In addition to money
problems stemming from his flamboy-
ant lifestyle, he had suffered a second
failed marriage this time in Sydney.
(His first disaster was in Honolulu.)
Several of his friends and associates
concurred in my judgment that there
was a final, dramatic trigger to his self-
destruction: Delegates to the Com-
monwealth Press Union, meeting in
Sydney were guests of Frank and Gretel
Packer in a memorable reception at
their Bellevue Hill home. Peter was not
invited. I know he was so upset that he
telephoned Frank to ask, “Why?” The
reply: “Well, I don’t like you.”
The Sydney Daily and Sunday
Telegraph were Gruening’s foremost
clients. Australian Consolidated Press
was a loyal and helpful friend to United
Press, as I had numerous occasions to
remember with warm gratitude in my
career. To have become persona non
grata to Frank Packer was not only a
social calamity in Peter’s dis-
torted perspective; it was also
a professional disaster
sufficient to derail his career
in the UP if and when he
returned to the USA, as
Dalziel was forecasting.
Maybe Pete did claim
“sinister” information about
Petrov’s defection. But I
doubt that. He never tipped
me and he was in the habit of
confiding important office
developments, both news and
business. If he did make any
such claims, it is far more
logical to assume he did so for
momentary bolstering of his
troubled ego. If he left any
hard facts, his office never
heard of them as far as I
know.
Any time a staffer in the
UP is really into a world-
shaker story, he usually con-
sults higher authority in New
York or wherever not only
as an alert but also to get
advice.
It was after his disappearance
became a media event that I began to
learn the depth of his troubles and
how his upbringing had most likely
contributed. I learned from his secretary
(whom I had hired) that Peter had
cooked the company books.
Next came a call from Charles
(Chuck) Henry, then the popular senior
Sydney representative for Pan Ameri-
can Airways. He reported that Hunt
Gruening, Peter’s older brother, an air-
line executive, had arrived in Sydney.
Chuck asked me to talk with the
brother. We repaired to Chuck’s apart-
ment, at mid-morning. Finding Hunt
understandably very distraught, we two
got stuck into the scotch. He poured out
the story of Pete’s misguided youth.
Two salient facts are sufficient for
considerable perspective and insight.
Firstly, Hunt a very likeable bloke
said that Pete’s mother (now deceased)

was incredibly over-pro-
tective. It seems that another
child had died under cir-
cumstances for which Mrs
Gruening assumed an ob-
sessive blame. I forget the
details but I remember Hunt
saying that she was deter-
mined to be sure there could
be no repetition of the
tragedy. Consequently, she
kept Pete out of school for
many years. He was tutored at
home.
Secondly, and further
belated indication of a basic
instability, was Pete’s ex-
perience in World War 11.
Hunt said Pete was
desperately anxious to have
overseas combat experience
in the US Army Air Force. He
became a lieutenant pilot in-
structor in a bomber training
field, as I recall. When he applied for
overseas duty, he flunked various air
force psychological tests. Hunt said that
was a crushing blow.
Thus, at war’s end, still determined
to go overseas (perhaps to prove himself
on his own) he went to work for United
Press. After a stint in Honolulu, he
transferred to Singapore as bureau
chief. It was his first executive
challenge, out on his own.
When I resigned in Sydney, I
suggested that Pete be shifted from
Singapore. Frank H. Bartholomew, San
Francisco vice-president and later big
boss of UP, worked with me for a week
in getting Pete set up in Sydney.
Lockwood’s account of the query to
Evatt was news to me. But not surpris-
ing. Within weeks of the tragedy, the US
consul-general called me in for com-
ment on a State Department cable. He
explained that Peter’s father was the
first US senator when Alaska became
the 50th state. He had been Alaska’s
governor.
The query came from Peter’s mother.
She theorised that Peter might have
been done in by a member of his staff.
The consul-general agreed with me that
such suspicions were nonsense.
Hence it will be seen, I submit, that
my colleague died not in any fancifully
suspected political assassination but by
his own hand.
The exhumation of this suspicion, 30
years later, caused me to reflect on the
needle.ss tragedy of Peter Gruening.
Before his end came, I realised that he
should have always worked under
supervision at staff and not mana-
gerial level. And I found some solace at
the time of his death that I did try to
help, as a confidant, but he rarely
listened to my counsel.
At the end, I found that Hunt was
too unstrung to make any funeral ar-
Rupert Lockwood: his theory questioned
rangements. I did that for Hunt. And
for Pete.
GEORGE E. McCADDEN
Sonoma, Calif
David McNicoll writes: I knew Peter
Gruening well and lunched with him at
least once a week. He was a high-
spirited, interesting man but capable of
moody depression. After the success
George McCadden had made of in-
troducing United Press to
Australia, many people
thought Peter was not up to
the task of being an adequate
successor. This was very ap-
parent to Gruening.
Peter made a disastrous
marriage in Sydney. It did not
last long and the break-up
added to his depressions. I
remember the day he disap-
peared Rupert Murdoch
had come across from
Adelaide and, not being able
to raise Peter at home or
office, rang me to ask if I knew
where he had got to. I had a
feeling that day that Peter
may have done away with
himself.
His car was found in the
bush outside Sydney, hose
pipe from exhaust, a bottle of
champagne alongside Peter’s
body. His parents, who wielded con-
siderable influence in America, refused
to accept the suicide verdict and hinted
at foul play, communist (Chinese) “hit”
men and so on.
There was no doubt in the minds of
anyone who knew Peter that he com-
mitted suicide and little doubt as to the
reasons why. Journalism lost a fine and
talented, if unstable, young man. □

QUEENSLAND
Liberals chance
showdown over
Senate choice
Liberal leader Sir William Knox: prickly rules
Sir James Killen: talks with the Premier
By DENIS REINHARDT
THE QUEENSLAND Liberal Party is
to confront Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-
Petersen with an arch-critic from the
coal industry, Warwick Parer, as its can-
didate for the federal upper house
vacancy caused by nomination of Sena-
tor Kathy Martin for the House of Rep-
resentatives seat of Moncrief in the
December 1 general election. State par-
liament is most likely to convene on
Tuesday November 13 to consider
Parer’s nomination. A rowdy squabble
could critically affect the Liberals’
Queensland campaign.
They had approached former state
leader Sir Llew Edwards to fill the
vacancy. Now chairman of the Queens-
land government’s Expo 88, Edwards
declined.
The federal constitution entrusts
state parliaments with filling casual Sen-
ate vacancies.
The Liberal move hinges on a
gamble that Bjelke-Petersen will not
force a political showdown within the
non-Labor coalition during the last
weeks of the election campaign. “If the
National Party on the eve of the election
tries subversion, it would only adversely
affect them,” state Liberal leader Sir
William Knox told The Bulletin.
Senior Queensland Liberals say that
Bjelke-Petersen has indicated privately
that he does not intend using his num-
bers on the floor of state parliament to
reject their nominee.
However, Bjelke-Petersen’s political
judgment may change. Executives of his
National Party last week still were
making overtures to Liberal Party mem-
bers, including some of the six-member
state parliamentary Liberal Party, in an
attempt to persuade them to accept
nomination against the Liberal Party’s
endorsed Senate candidate not then
decided.
“It’s a nice dubious means of getting
rid of another Liberal,” the Liberal
member for Yeronga, Norm Lee, said.
“They’ve approached everybody
around the sticks.
“It’s no great bloody honor to be ap-
proached. They’ve approached me;
they’ve approached everybody in the
party.”
The candidate most favored by the
Queensland Nationals is former De-
fence minister Sir James Killen who has
been critical of the Liberal Party in the
state since stepping down from federal
parliament last year, privately saying he
had “had enough.”
If Killen were lured into becoming
Bjelke-Petersen’s nominee, the Queens-
land Liberal Party would need steel
nerves to expel him.
Killen this year proposed to senior
Liberals that he head a joint Senate
ticket for this election as a means of
healing the rift between the two con-
servative parties in the state. Killen is
understood to have held private dis-
cussions with the Premier then.
The Queensland government rocked
the boat in 1975 when it appointed
Albert Patrick Field, an “unknown”
member of the ALP, to fill a vacancy
caused by the death of Labor senator
Bert Milliner. Not the endorsed party
nominee (and, indeed, declaring protest
at actions of the Whitlam Labor govern-
ment in Canberra), Field was expelled
from the ALP automatically and his ap-
pointment changed the balance of num-
bers in the Senate. That allowed block-
ing of the budget which led to
Whitlam’s downfall.
As a consequence, a 1977 referen-
dum passed constitutional amendments
requiring that casual vacancies be filled
by candidates who at the time of being
sworn in as senator retain membership
of the same political party as the retiree.
Thus, by expelling any Liberal who ac-
cepted unendorsed nomination from
the Queensland parliament, an appoint-
ment would be declared invalid.
However, the strength of the consti-
tutional amendment remains untested.
National Party strategists have contem-
plated appointing someone who could
argue Liberal membership at swearing-
in but subsequently renounce it.
Bjelke-Petersen’s leeriness at the
constitutional change is shared by the
present Liberal leader who, under the
conventions of the Queensland parlia-
ment, is required to submit three names
for the Senate vacancy. “I think it’s got

prickles in it,” Knox told The Bulletin.
“Frankly, I don’t like those rules.”
That unlikely confluence of views
helps make understandable the edginess
with which other Liberal state parlia-
mentarians are approaching Parer’s
nomination day. His nomination has
yet to be confirmed by the party execu-
tive this week (regarded as a matter of
course). It has until now remained a
secret between Knox, party president
John Moore and one or two others.
Parer, nephew of Australia’s superb
World War II cinematographer Damien
Parer, is a former Utah commercial
manager who resigned to negotiate his
own coal mine consortiums in central
Queensland. As a consequence, he be-
came locked in barely concealed busi-
ness confrontation with the Bjelke-
Petersen government and the Treasury
over rail freights.
The issue still smoulders, with not a
little bitterness on both sides.
The Premier will not welcome Parer
when his candidacy becomes known.
At least two of the six remaining Lib-
erals in the Queensland parliament
want to break the convention of submit-
ting three names for a senate vacancy.
“I don’t really care if he wants three
names, as long as it’s clearly understood
which one we want,” Moore said.
“All the trouble is stemming out of
George Street (parliament).”
“We’ve got nothing to lose in putting
up just one there’s too many hazards
in putting up three,” one of the state
Liberals explained. □
LIFESTYLE
Matchmakers of the airwaves
By GLENDA THOMPSON
BRIAN WILSHIRE has just
had his 63rd marriage. “I
don’t know who she was but
she sounded very happy,” he
says, grinning round his
headphones.
Wilshire is not a home-
grown version of Elizabeth
Taylor. He does not have' a
proposal so quick on the draw
that he does not bother to
swap names first: He is a com-
munity matchmaker.
Wilshire is the daddy of
radio talkback matchmaking
in Australia. His show has run
on Sydney’s 2GB for two and
a half years, attracting 25,000
contacts. The 63 marriages
have resulted from people
who have met via his program
and they are only the ones
he has heard about.
Some people say that it is
deadly boring to listen to. The
callers often are painfully shy or
deadpan. You can hear them screwing
up their courage to say that their best
feature is their smile.
“Kiama,” 51, a 165 cm, 73kg widow,
says that she is told she resembles tennis
star Billie Jean King but thinks it no
compliment. She found porcelain paint-
ing tedious because of the need to paint
a layer, fire it, paint and fire. “Better
layered than never,” cracks Wilshire,
with wit so excruciating that it breaks
the woman up and she unfolds a little.
Her “shopping list” is specific: She
seeks a man 165 to 173 cm tall, without a
beer belly, and his trousers must fit
properly. She does not want dark eyes
because “I can’t see into them.”
Wilshire neglects to ask the next call-
er, “William,” 43, of Newcastle, how his
trousers fit. Otherwise, he might be a
likely match for Kiama after all, they
2GB’s Brian Wiltshire: sixty-three marriages made on air
are both garlic people (the interviewer’s
pet peccadillo).
William a widower says that he
goes to bed at the same time as do his
sons, aged seven and 11, “because we’re
so very close, now there’s only three of
us.” He loves listening to horse racing,
cricket and football and “I’m not look-
ing for Marilyn Monroe or anything.”
He says, “if she’s got a boat, terrific,”
he’s going fishing when he wins Lotto.
Not exactly riveting stuff, yet shows
of this ilk have become big news around
Australia. Electronic media match-
making has blossomed into a phenom-
enon. Wilshire believes that his show’s
success has spurred a proliferation of
dating programs.
Wilshire’s show is 2GB’s top-rater
and where there is joy with a format you
must follow, according to Hobart’s
Graeme Barrie. Program manager of
7HO, Barrie has run a similar
matchmaker show for the past
three months to good re-
sponse. His main opposition,
7HT, has a form of the idea.
Computer Loveline Back With
A Difference is part of Keith
Neil’s Saturday evening rock
program. Tried a year ago as a
competition with a dinner
prize for 20 couples, this gives
four pairs each week dinner
out with Neil and his wife. A
contestant is chosen from girls
who call in the first hour, she
selects herself a date and vice
versa. “We keep it light,” says
Neil.
In Brisbane, Stuart Robert-
son tries to make 4BC’s
Matchmaker entertainment. It
attracts a lot of teenagers,
runs from 10.30 pm to mid-
night, Monday to Thursday,
and receives about 20 letters a
week. It is so popular that it is likely to
be extended.
In Canberra, Peter Henry has
jumped on the bridal train with a
matching program on Wednesdays
from 11pm to midnight. It has been go-
ing for four months but 2CA has it
under review because “we perhaps
haven’t researched it as thoroughly as
we’d have liked.” Such an aid to meet-
ing people is necessary in Canberra,
Henry says, and people call in because
“their need far outweighs the personal
cost of making oneself vulnerable.”
Adelaide is the only state capital
which has not trialled the format. An
announcer at SKA, Scott Mcßain, has
tried it once or twice in a low-key
fashion and says that he is amazed that
no one there has picked it up.
Darwin’s only commercial station,
BDN, does not plan to join the rush.


3KZ Melbourne has
reintroduced its dating show
after a break. Bruce
McCartney anchors it on the
10-to-midnight slot, week-
days. It is doing “quite well.”
In Perth, 6PR dropped its
matchmaker show after two
and a half months because it
was not performing. But pro-
gram director Dick Heming
blamed the hours it ran, from
5.30 to Bpm. “We have an
audience of 40-plus and
they’re doing other things at
that time. We couldn’t put it
on any later without dam-
aging our existing programs
which are rating very well. We
found it quite costly to run.
We had announcer John Price
and a journo, Jane McLatchy, on it for a
while but it didn’t draw a gigantic re-
sponse.”
Melbourne’s Helen Jackson, of
3AW, denies suggestion of any Sydney
inspiration of her introduction show.
“I’d read about it in the ’States and I
thought we should try it here,” says
Jackson, whose Saturday night dating
segment has been running for 12
months and wins its timeslot.
“I used to get people on the talkback
line about 1.30 or 2 in the morning
who’d just been to Madisons or The
3AW’s Helen Jackson: people like the “instant thing”
Underground discos, saying: ‘lt’s such a
meat market where do you meet
people?’ So I put them on and nearly
went out of my brain because I had no
producer and had to do everything here
and answer the phones for hours after
the program ended.”
The format is only part of the 3-hour
Helen Jackson show which runs inter-
views on relationships, news items on
sex and has visiting experts and a sex
therapist on talkback.
Jackson edits Australian Singles
News, a monthly paper with news and
$3 personal ads which recent-
ly went national its circula-
tion jumping to about 35,000.
This follows an American
trend, Jackson says, quoting
the editor of New York’s Vil-
lage Voice in which personal
ads cost $3O and have doubled
in the past two years.
Her show swaps telephone
numbers for people. “They
like the instant thing,” she
says.
Wilshire’s approach is
more structured.
“Women and men use
code names, so as not to iden-
tify themselves, and they
simply say what district of
Sydney they live in for
those worried by geography,”
Wilshire says. “They describe their
likes, dislikes, what they look like, what
they would like to find in a partner, ac-
cording to a set of questions I have writ-
ten down, and anything else that occurs
at the time.
“Anyone who wants to get in touch
with someone they’ve heard on the pro-
gram writes to us.
“All they have to provide is a
stamped envelope.
“In the case of a female, she would
write saying ‘Please, could I have the
names and addresses of Fred, 26, of the
Across a crowded ether
AMONG THE happy couples in-
troduced by 2GB in Sydney are Mr N,
73, a floor sander, and his lady, 70. Each
had been married twice. They would
rather not be named but they are very
happy, thank you.
He went on the program last year
and had 40 replies. He went out with 11
of the women and regularly sees the sec-
ond of them.
“They do a good job,” he says.
“Knowing what I know now, I’d prob-
ably go to euchre drives to meet women
there. Or perhaps, bingo but you
probably get the wrong type there.”
N’s sense of humor obviously was a
big attraction. Brian Wilshire summed
him up on the program as someone who
pulls his own teeth and brews his own
beer.
“I said I was looking for someone
aged between 60 and 70, Australian,
English or even Welsh,” said the North
Lancashire-born N. “I turned up at one
woman’s place and she turned out to be
a Hungarian Jewess aged about 49. I
took her to tea a,t an RSL club and then
she said, Take me where I can see the
lights of the harbor.’ We went to Luna
Park and did some necking.”
N had offers from as far away as
Bendigo, Victoria. That woman offered
Kevin and “Maureen”
to meet him on the border at Albury.
Kevin Clarke and “Maureen,” both
33, were struck by common experiences.
She heard him talk to Helen Jackson
and “it was what he didn’t say, rather
than what he said,” that appealed.
Both had been divorced, each had
two children, each had lost the family
home.
“I was in a better position than
Kevin, in that I had been able to save
and buy another house,” Maureen says.
An almost immediate bond was that
they (and all their children) barrack for
the St Kilda Australian football team.
Another was that the pair had hated the
singles night experience.
Their first telephone call lasted 90
minutes and their first date was a
Devonshire tea. They plan to marry
soon.
What do they think of radio
matches? “I can’t knock it; it’s done
wonders for us,” Clarke says.
“You’ve got to choose carefully. But,
with radio, you can remain anonymous
longer.” □


west, who appeared on such and such a
date, and Alan, 40, of whatever.’ She
provides a stamped, self-addressed en-
velope. Karen, who punches the com-
puter, quickly sorts out which ones the
woman wants. Karen presses a button
and spits out the real names and ad-
dresses of the men, as well as their code
names. They go onto a compliments
card and that goes into the woman’s en-
velope and is posted straight back to
her, so we keep no record of who has
been writing in.
“A man will write a letter of intro-
duction, including his name and resi-
dential address, and adds a covering
note: ‘Please send this to Sonya, 30, of
the west.’ In his case, the computer will
punch out the woman’s name and ad-
dress; that goes into a blank envelope
he has given us, gets posted to the
woman, so initially she knows who
the man is and where he can be
reached.”
The show “caters to a need which
exists now because we have a very mo-
bile society which doesn’t offer people
the chance to meet friends as in the tra-
ditional closely knit village where
everybody’s life was mapped out for
them by other members of that village,”
Wilshire says.
A psychologist at the University of
NSW, Dr Fred Orr, says matchmaker
radio touches listeners with the human
drama of unscripted people, “live.” On
TV, the contestants often are rehearsed
and scripted and lured by the chance of
holidays and gifts. “Unfortunately,
people are often abused for the sake of
entertainment,” he says.
The increasing divorce rate leaves
many people seeking a relationship and,
not wanting to confront an introduction
agency, they have few options outside
serendipity you meet the right person
when you’re not looking for him or her
Orr says. He conducts a shyness clinic
and has referred to him people who are
nervous about dating. One young man
shook so much that he could not hold a
cup on a saucer. It was Orr’s suggestion
that started 2GB off, Wilshire says.
“He said there are a lot of lonely
people why don’t we have a program
to bring them together? I was about to
discuss it further when, one night, we
did some matchmaking. A girl rang up
saying, ‘Where are all the fellas?’ and a
chap rang up saying, ‘I want to meet
that girl.’ The next few nights, we did it
oh a swap-the-telephone-number basis.
During the day the station couldn’t get
any business done with the switchboard
overloaded. So we realised we’d have to
do it by mail. There’s been very little
fine tuning since.
“I’ve just been lucky enough to be in
the right place at the right time when the
format fell into my lap.” □
CRIME
Bazley offers co-
operation on
conditions
By BRUCE STANNARD
SELF-PROCLAIMED Mr Asia drug
syndicate member Stephen Bazley has
said he will co-operate in investigations
into allegations he has made over police
involvement in drug trafficking on four
conditions. Bazley is seeking:
■ Immunity from prosecution before
he gives evidence.
■ A substantial cash
payment for his Sydney
solicitor, Paul Eckstein.
■ All police questions to
be submitted in writing in
advance of any interview.
* Immunity from pros-
ecution on possible
charges of public mischief
which may arise out of his
allegations.
Bazley is also insisting
that any interview with
police must take place in
the office of NSW ombuds-
man George Masterman
and in the presence of
John Hatton, the indepen-
dent MLA for the NSW
South Coast. Police have
no objections to that so
Stephen Bazley
long as their special counsel, NSW
Crown Advocate, Reg Blanch, is also
present.
I understand State Attorney-General
Paul Landa has rejected out of hand any
suggestion that Bazley, described in
police documents as a “cunning and
professional criminal specialising in the
drug traffic scenario,” should be given
immunity before making any disclo-
sures.
Police were prepared to overlook
some of Bazley’s minor drug possession
matters but balked at turning a blind
eye to what might be more serious
charges.
I understand that Landa, acting on
the advice of police, has
agreed to pay the money
sought for Eckstein. Police
are still considering
Bazley’s demand on writ-
ten questions, which would
certainly establish a pre-
cedent in police inquiries
in NSW.
A month after Bazley’s
allegations were first aired
on the ABC television pro-
gram Four Corners, he has
still not offered police any-
thing which might substan-
tiate them. Bazley has had
several meetings with
senior police but has failed
to produce any evidence
which would stand up in
court. □
TAXATION
Anxious eyes
on retreaders’
sales slug fight
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
IN WHAT some experts have dubbed a
test case for a wider taxation of service
industries, authorities are fighting the
tyre retreading industry tooth and nail
in the Federal Court.
Hanging on the case are the proceeds
of a 20 percent sales tax on retreads.
The taxman faces the prospect of
having to refund a host of retreaders the
amount levied since introduction in
March last year. One major national
retreader estimates that amount at well
over $lO million.
In a judgment in the court more than
a month ago, Mr Justice Beaumont
ruled that a retreader and retailer, Jax
Tyres Pty Ltd, was not liable to the 20
percent levy on the wholesale price of
the retreads it processed. The judge
found that retreading is a repair or
refurbishment industry, rather than a
form of manufacturing.
Summarising his reasons for finding
for the retreader in the action against
the Commissioner of Taxation, Judge
Beaumont said: “Since the retreading
process involves no more than the
repair of the product, the original iden-
tity of which is maintained throughout
the process, no manufacture arises.”
Fighting the taxpayer to the wire, the
Taxation office is appealing against the
decision. The appeal is to be heard by
the full bench of the court in Sydney on
November 8.

Introducing a new
concept in leasing and
fleet management
Holden National Leasing Ltd., the first fleet
leasing company in the world to be fully backed by a
Manufacturer.
HNL is owned by General Motors-Holden’s and its
major Dealers around Australia and as such is able to draw
on the substantial resources provided by such an extensive
network.
HNL was formed to provide specialist attention to the
GMH National Heets, and their subsidiary companies
and any other company operating in excess of 100 vehicles
who may, on application to GMH, be eligible.
Because of our direct involvement with GMH we can
offer the most attractive leasing rates in Australia. Since
the company’s inception earlier this year, many major
national companies have already experienced HNLs
competitive rates and professional service.

company our unique structure enables us to offer in a
single package total flexibility and complete cost control.
One appointment can totally
co-ordinate all leasing and fleet
management requirements.
This “One Stop Shop”
arrangement allows the
company’s responsible
executive to direct and
negotiate all fleet vehicle
requirements through
HNL. The effectiveness of
this system has already evoked
welcome comment from our
existing major clients.
HNL is a company committed to
the efficient running of all leasing and
fleet management operations. Our
involvement extends not only to leasing
but also:
li Planning programmes tailored specifically to meet
company’s particular needs.

famous bowler hat. The theme was “Jax
the Rippers.”
The case is seen not only as a test for
retreaders but also for further service
industries. Tax advisers believe that
others including engine recon-
ditioners, shoe repairers, furniture re-
upholsterers and car body repairers and
spray painters could become sales tax
prey if the appeal were upheld.
The original decision to tax the
wholesale price of the retreaders’ tyres
did not result from a change in federal
acts but from a change in interpretation
of the nature or definition of the
retreading process. Processors were told
that the sales tax would be applicable to
the finished retread rather than to any
new materials that went into the tyres.
Before the purge, retreaders were
paying tax of 20 percent on the value of
new materials put into the repaired tyre.
Retreading is a big business exact-
ly how big is difficult to assess because
of the number of smaller operators. But
sales of both passenger and truck
retreads are estimated at around 2/ x
million a year. What the wholesale
value is is anyone’s guess but $5O
million appears to be conservative.
The business is conducted on differ-
ent levels.
Some customers bring their worn
tyres to a dealer who sends them to a
factory to be processed. This is common
practice among truck owners who often
prefer to retread a tyre two or three
times rather than buy a new one which
may be three times more expensive at
around $360.
Most passenger car retreads are
worn tyres that the agent has bought
and processed, sold “off the rack.”
As much as being outraged at having
to pay a sales tax on wholesale price, the
retreaders are concerned about its effect
on their ability to compete on price with
the makers of new tyres.
In a popular sedan retread, new
materials mainly rubber and chemical
solutions cost about $5 before the new
approach. After a 20 percent sales tax,
this cost was $6. Added to this were
labor of around $2, overheads and other
factory costs of $8.50 and a profit of
around $ 1.50 to give a cost of $ 18.
If the customer did not bring in a
worn tyre or casing, the retreader would
also supply that at a cost of, say, $6
taking the wholesale price to around
$24. After dealer mark-up, the normal
customer paid about $32 for the retread.
With the new tax regime, the cost of
retreading comes to $l7 (after the pre-
vious tax of $1 on materials is left out)
plus $6 for the casing and sales tax of
$4.60 on the $23 package, for a
wholesale price of $27.60.
Slapping on the same dealer margin
of $B, the end price to the public is
around $35.60 more than 11 percent
up. The retread’s price is not far short of
the cost of a new tyre, which generally
ranges from $45 to $6O. The retread
could cost the buyer more if he or she
had to buy a tube for about $lO.
The price differentials in truck tyres
are more marked. Prices vary greatly
but a retread often may cost a “truckie”
$l2O compared to a new tyre at $3OO
plus.
Retreaders have paid the extra tax
under protest and many have sent
letters to that effect with their payments.
Under instructions from the
Australian Automobile Chamber of
Commerce and legal advisers, many
also have issued summonses to the
commissioner every six months to claim
refund of the monies paid. Companies
which have not followed such pro-
cedure would seem to have little chance
of recouping their payments in any
event.
Those who did obtain refunds would
have to satisfy certain provisions of the
Sales Tax Act. The Bulletin understands
that wholesalers would be required, in
turn, to refund customers in the main,
dealers and car and truck fleet owners.
Members of the public also might have
to be repaid. □
PUBLISHING
A sick giant
left with
former glories
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
RIGBY Ltd, the 125-year old publisher
which was the largest publisher in
Australia and the largest Australian-
owned five years ago, is a giant no more.
To quote Shakespeare is not in-
appropriate since Rigby was for so long
associated with educational English lit-
erature as well as with general books:
“O! it is excellent /To have a giant’s
strength, but it is tyrannous/ To use it as
a giant” even, one might only just
metrically add, in slaughtering a sick
giant.
The “tyrants” are accountants of
James Hardie Ltd which owns Rigby-
Lansdowne and has just retrenched 23
employees and closed down Brisbane,
Perth and Hobart offices. Frank Thomp-
son, the genial American who estab-
lished University of Queensland Press
as one of the liveliest general publishers
in Australia and who with his wife
Meryl Yule an editor moved little
more than a year ago to Adelaide to run
Rigby publishing, is with it no more.
Most people associated with publish-
ing would expect a new chief to be
allowed from three to five years to prove
policies’ success or failure, but high-
speed machinery soon shreds books.
Bruce Robertson, chief executive at
Rigby-Lansdowne, says that Rigby will
continue to exist at its offices in the
beautiful old stone buildings of
Stoneyfell but that publishing will be
confined to the back list and “an op-
portunity list.”
Rigby was a strong presence in
Writers Week at the Adelaide Festival
for many years, usually holding a fare-
well party in the warehouse on the last
night of the week. Rigby offered prizes
of £lOOO for its centenary literary com-
petition in 1960.
It began as a bookselling and
stationery business in 1859, founded by
William Charles Rigby who must have
been an extremely enterprising fellow as
he sailed his 48-tonne lugger - Gem -
from London to Melbourne in 1853
when he was only 19 years old. The
publishing business which he began in a
small way after a few years became a
limited liability company in 1909.
Rigby was putting out more
Australian books than any other
publisher by 1971. In 1976, the four
largest Australian publishers were

books), Ribgy (148), Horwitz (129) and
A.H. & A.W. Reed (NZ) (87). In 1977-
78, Rigby’s promotional budget was
doubled when the number of new books
was lifted to 300.
In the meantime, all sorts of strange
things had been happening to Rigby.
Paul Hamlyn who had made a
fortune out of cheap non-fiction books,
in his latest incarnation of Octopus
Books, gave Rigby the Octopus agency
in 1973. By mid-1977, Hamlyn owned
10.48 percent of Rigby; he then tried to
take it over. The MacMillan Company
had tried unsuccesfully to do that and,
in November, 1977, the Foreign Invest-
ment Review Board prevented Hamlyn
from achieving a takeover.
Hamlyn terminated the
Octopus/Rigby contract in
1978.
Rigby suffered a
$761,000 loss in 1977/8. A
fire in the Sydney
warehouse on October 27,
1977, had destroyed $2
million in books includ-
ing the spearhead of the
Christmas publishing pro-
gram, Colin Thiele’s Storm
Boy.
However, the main
cause of Rigby’s losses had
been what Ken Wilder of
Collins called “a huge oversupply by
Rigby,” sent out by (in Max Harris’
words) “the costly, dubious, suicidal
horrors of ‘scale-out’ wholesaling of
books.” Hayes admitted in his report:
“This sale or return procedure for
handcover books was not originated by
Rigby but it is probable that your
company played a substantial part in
causing it to escalate through the book-
selling industry.”
Reed Consolidated Industries
assumed control in 1978 and Neil
Bainaves announced in 1980 that
Rigby-Hamlyn, now part of James
Hardie Industries, would be relaunched
as the The Rigby Group. He said: We
had been predicting Rigby’s downfall
and were amazed that they held out for
as long as they did. The Australian
market really has become overheated
with too many titles, too many subjects
being badly promoted and produced.”
Books are “product” to what Mike
Page, publishing manager of Rigby
from January, 1967, to February, 1982,
Neil Balnaves
calls the “non-readers” who run so
much of publishing nowadays. Page, a
quiet, overworked man of great ability
author of several books himself
says of the managing director until
1974, Vern Branson: “Branson was
genuinely interested in books a
shining difference between him and
some recent publishers.”
In Branson and Page’s reign, Rigby
cornered the market in Australiana
from classic such as lan Mudie’s Riv-
erboats to the great blockbuster of
Robert Goodman and George
Johnston’s The Australians, 1966, which
sold 120,000 copies in hardback.
Rigby’s Sketchbook series were very
successful and one ex-
traordinary best-
seller was The First Sunrise,
by anthropologist C. P.
Mountford and artist
Ainslie Roberts, which
sold 300,000 copies. The
most amazing coup was
Alex Comfort’s The Joy of
Sex which might have been
expected to sell 300 to
5000; it sold half-a-million.
Rigby had by 1978 re-
ached the absurd stage,
hounded on by promotion
and product, where sales
were up 25 percent and
profits fell 66 percent.
At the time of the Hardie takeover,
Bainaves said reasonably enough
that investors were entitled to a
dividend. But he went on to say, “if
food, thrillers or sex happen to be the
sellers, then, that’s what we have to be
in.”
However, books are unpredictable
creatures on the market. The public
keeps on confounding market research
mentality. Look at the incredible suc-
cess of that modest man A. B. Facey’s A
Fortunate Life starved of food, devoid
of deliberate thrills and sexless.
All this is not going to help the
giant’s ghost of Rigby. There are many
people who feel that it was not slain in
fair fight but wiped out by computers. □

DEFENCE
Nuclear subs
won’t surface here
for some time
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
NUCLEAR-powered submarines for
the Royal Australian Navy are an im-
possibility in the short term for techni-
cal as well as political reasons. Al-
though National Party leader lan
Sinclair put them on the election agenda
by including the purchase of four as
part of the opposition’s defence
platform, they seem unlikely to become
a real issue in this campaign.
Since the French succeeded in reduc-
ing the size and cost of nuclear power
plants, nuclear-powered submarines
have drawn increasing attention from
the Australian defence community.
When he was Defence minister in the
Fraser government, Sinclair was briefed
on this technology.
Now they have been introduced into
the public debate, they are likely to
remain a long-term option for the
defence force, despite the intensity of
political opposition to the concept at
the moment.
National attitudes and needs can
change over the years and a radical re-
equipment of the navy would take a
decade to organise. So all but the most
dogmatic advocates of nuclear power
do not believe any introduction of these
submarines is conceivable before the
mid-90s, while the boats would be in
service until around the year 2020.
The navy has never expressed an
official attitude towards nuclear-
powered ships. But individual officers
do have considerable nuclear expertise.
Australian liaison teams have been
briefed by the French and the Ameri-
cans and studied intelligence on
Russian developments. And some ex-
change officers have actually worked in
key positions in the British nuclear
submarine program.
At this level, the attitude of in-
fluential officers is:
■ Nuclear-powered submarines are a
political impossibility at the moment, so
better to press ahead with the existing

The car above is the latest
Jaguar.
In our opinion, this Jaguar is
the best Jaguar ever made.
And also represents the best
value ever offered in luxury cars.
With due regard to the
memorable Jaguars of the past,
these are not statements we make
lightly.
Life with a new Jaguar begins
at around $48,450*.
To put this price into
perspective, try to think of any
other automobile which offers
Jaguar’s level of luxury,
refinement and equipment and
doesn’t cost at least ten thousand
dollars more.
You can delete the Mercedes
280 SE which, in our opinion, is
the nearest comparable
Mercedes.
That comes in at around
$61,525**.
You can also disregard the
BMW 735 i at around $59,500**.
-In fact, whatever you look at,
you’ll still find the Jaguar XJ6 is
streets ahead.
The question is, how is it
possible for the best to be made
for less?
Involvement builds better cars,
more efficiently.
Three years ago, when John
Egan took over as Chairman and
Chief Executive of Jaguar cars,
the automobile industry thought
that technology was the sole
solution to all its problems.
John Egan disagreed.
“The best, most sophisticated
machines in the world will not
make memorable cars,” he argued,
“ if the men who operate them do
not have pride in what they do.”
Then, while Jaguar invested
millions in re-tooling, John Egan
began asking the people who
actually build the cars for their
thoughts on ways of making
better Jaguars.
His office was flooded with
ideas and proposals, many of
which were acted upon
immediately.
Ever since then, once a month
the staff meet with management
and continue to find better ways
of doing things.
The result, again, is best
summed up by John Egan himself.
“Productivity has doubled with
no increase - in fact a decrease -
in workforce.”
“Naturally, the
unit cost is less.”
The best Jaguar ever
made gives you the best
of everything.
While the Jaguar
XJ6 embodies
excellence of con-
struction and superb
value, its traditional
virtues should not
be overlooked
It gives you a
unique combination
of looks, perform-
ance, comfort and
peace-of-mind that
is not equalled by
other cars.
It is the only
current model to be included
among the ten most beautiful cars
of all time in a survey conducted
by “Car and Driver” magazine.
It is also considered to have
the best ride in the world.
And, in Mastercare, the best
warranty and maintenance
programme.
The Jaguar XJ6 carries a
warranty valid for two years or
40,000 km, whichever comes first.
Furthermore, Jaguar
undertakes to pay the labour and
genuine Jaguar replacement part
costs of regular maintenance as
set out in the owner’s handbook
for three years or 40,000 km.
whichever comes first.
Whether you buy a Jaguar at
$48,450,* or opt for the more luxu-
rious Jaguar Sovereign.Vanden
Plas, or XJS-HE, the value for
money is no less apparent.
Call your nearest Jaguar
Rover dealer and arrange to test
drive the best Jaguar ever made.
It could be the best decision
you ever made.

program of replacing our
diesel-electric Oberon sub-
marines with the latest “con-
ventional” boats. The pro-
gram is well advanced. An
announcement of two
overseas design teams is ex-
pected in the middle of next
year and a selection, for
building in Australia, will be
made a couple of years later.
■ Australian industry
could not support nuclear-
powered submarines at pre-
sent. The navy doesn’t want to
be the leader in introducing
nuclear technology to
Australia. It sees a possible
future move into nuclear-
powered vessels as likely only
if nuclear industries, such as
fuel processing or nuclear
power generation, are estab-
lished in Australia. None of
these is even on the horizon at
the moment.
■ Cost and numbers:
nuclear-powered submarines
will cost 20-50 percent more
than conventional ones. The
present program calling for building six
Oberon replacements for about $2 bil-
lion would buy (as Sinclair indicated)
only four nuclear boats.
There is no argument with the pro-
position that nuclear-powered sub-
marines are a major strategic advance
on diesel-electrics. They can remain
submerged indefinitely. They are also
much faster when it comes to tracking
fast-moving targets or in moving to and
from station on patrols.
In basic terms, four nuclear subs
equate with the capability of six con-
ventional ones.
When it comes to detection by
hostile forces, the ability to remain
submerged indefinitely is their biggest
advantage. The conventional boats are
vulnerable when they “snort” break
the surface with an air intake so they
can run their diesels and charge their
batteries.
However, even with the latest French
technology, diesel-electric boats are
Four RAN Oberon submarines: nuclear replacements unlikely

much quieter. Even when damped
down, a nuclear plant requires the
circulation of coolants, which can be
heard by sensitive hydrophones. A
diesel-electric boat can be shut down
completely with the members of the
crew forbidden to talk. It is then com-
pletely silent.
Strategists who believe that one day
Australia will have to face up to acquir-
ing nuclear-powered submarines and
perhaps ships say the strong public
opposition to this form of power comes
from confusion with nuclear weaponry.
They argue that Australia will need a
submarine force as a strike weapon and
a deterrent and that nuclear-powered
boats are simply more efficient and
ensure better survivability for crews.
The example they are studying is the
new French Rubis class, the first
operational small nuclear submarines in
Western navies. These are 72 metres
long compared with 73.5 metres for the
existing Australian Oberons. They are
rated at 2385 tonnes against
2169 tonnes for the Oberons.
The French have launched
two of the class and are
working on the third which,
reports say, will be more
powerful than the pre-
decessors, which had a 48mW
power plant, driving electric
generators for propulsion.
They are believed to be
capable of about 25 knots
submerged, carry tube-
launched missiles based on
the Exocet as well as
advanced torpedos. The crew
number is about 66.
Typical of the Oberon
replacement boats which the
RAN is studying is the
Vickers 2400 class, the first of
which has just been ordered
for the Royal Navy as HMS
Upholder. These are in the
same size range but have a
smaller crew in the diesel-
electric version. Britain is
reported to have acquired
French licences to put the
nuclear power plant into fu-
ture Upholder-class boats.
It is this nuclear-powered Upholder
that the Australian naval lobby is ad-
vocating. They would like to see the first
two boats built in Australia as con-
ventional diesel-electric ones and the
remainder modified to take the nuclear
power plant.
Among the problems the navy sees in
nuclear subs is the question of basing
and support.
These can easily be solved, pro-
ponents say. They advocate Cockburn
Sound, WA, which already takes US
nuclear subs for port stays, as the ideal
base. It is on an island and some
distance from Perth’s suburbs and the
port of Fremantle.
Refuelling is seen as the only difficult
part of maintenance and this is required
only every five years or so. This work
could be carried out in Britain.
While most Australians would have
more confidence in British or American
support than French, the dependence
on an overseas base for essential
maintenance would be a step backwards
for the Australian defence force and
local industry. The ADF is progressing,
even if in a stumbling fashion, towards
a higher degree of self-sufficiency.
This dependence factor takes the
argument back to what today’s genera-
tion of navy planners sees as the major
argument against nuclear power. The
country is not yet ready for it, politically
or technologically.
Until there is a complete change in
national attitudes that permit a local
nuclear industry, nuclear power for the
Australian navy remains unlikely. □

A bloody good
punch-up-those
were the days
Britannia in full flight on Sydney Harbor in 1930 with “Wee Georgie” Robinson at the helm
FROM THE BLUE-WATER BUSHMEN, BRUCE STANNARD, ANGUS AND ROBERTSON. $19.95
By DERRIL FARRAR
“ARRH, they’re not like the races they
had in the old days,” said the old-timer,
watching the 18-footers charge around
Sydney Harbor. “Why, in my day,
they’d come alongside and one crew
would board another boat and get stuck
into it.
“They’d cut ropes, bring sails down
and have a bloody good punch-up.
Arrh, those were the days.”
And, with that, he spat laconically
over the side of the ferry following the
race. The lee side, of course. They also
taught them seafaring manners in those
days.
Leading the field that day, at the start
of the 18-footer season was the new
ultra-light boat Prime Computer. With
her crew of two, compared with most of
the other boats’ three, she had scudded
ahead of the field in the light winds.
With most of the race over, it seemed
not so much a matter of whether Prime
would win but by how much. And then,
down the harbor came the squall.
It hit Prime like a blow from a gigan-
tic hand and, suddenly, the seemingly
certain victory was gone. As Julian
Bethwaite and for’ard hand Craig
Ramsden struggled valiantly but vainly
to right their balsa and carbon fibre
craft, Chesty Bond sailed past it and to
victory.
“And that’s another thing you didn’t
see too often in the old days,” added the
aged spectator: “A capsize . . . Mind
you,” he conceded, “we did have up to
“Wee Georgle” Robinson with his trophies
ERNIE McQUILLAN
20 bums on board then to prevent it.”
Two of them are still being used to
fill nothing but landlubbers’ chairs but,
in the “old days,” their youthful owners
were among the best 18-foot skippers
the world has seen.
Bill Miller, present commodore of
the NSW 18-Footers Sailing Club in
Double Bay, had 27 years leaning out
over the gunwale.
He followed his famous
grandfather, George “Cubby”
Holmes, who for 20 years
dominated open-boat sailing
in Sydney until his retirement
in 1919.
Following but certainly
not trailing in his wake, Bill
Miller won a state title and a
host of club races, a record
which also gained him selec-
tion for the world champion-
ships in Auckland in 1962.
Then, in one of five boats
named Donnelly designed
and built by himself and
named after his grandfather’s
boat Miller came a credi-
table second.
“But they were tough days,
those early years,” Miller re-
called this week. “I remember
watching them as a kid.
“I saw them come over the
side of another boat and cut
the jib sheets. The invaders
would get spinnaker poles
and hit the opposing crew in


Fifteen men and a boy keep an over-canvassed eighteen-footer upright in 1920
the legs. They’d up-end them over the
side.
“Still,” he added philosophically, “it
was all good fun.”
In those days, up to seven packed
ferries would follow the races and there
was heavy betting on the outcome.
“Sometimes, it paid more to lose
than to win,” said Miller referring to the
pre-race arrangements that some of the
bookies made with the crews.
“They’d drop their jibs or their kites
in the water, or a bloke with a little
help from his friends would fall over-
board and they’d pick him up on the
way back.
“It was easy,” he added, “to fall
overboard in those days.”
Pity the poor “bucket-boys.” More
often than not, they crouched in the bot-
tom of the boats in heavy blows, bailing
for dear life.
“That was hard work,” Miller re-
called. “Sometimes you’d take in more
than 40 gallons of water in one hit: It
was unreal.”
Balmain was the home of sailing and
many of the crews were footballers in
the winter and sailors during the sum-
mer months. Those were the days when
they were boats, made of cedar, silvei
ash and spotted gum, when it took twc
men to lift the big steel centreboard oul
of the boat and carry it ashore.
Those were the days when you woulc
have as many as 20 men up, many oi
them sitting on one another’s laps, tc
keep the boat upright.
“We had much heavier gear then,’
Miller said, “Heavier hulls, heavier fit
tings, cotton sails. We didn’t
have trapezes then. Lord,
today, out on them, it’s a hol-
iday.
“Once you capsized then,
you were history. It didn’t
matter how many blokes you
had on board then. You
couldn’t get them up again.”
Then, if the boats and
crews did go in, it was a long
and cold wait before a launch
would go out and tow them to
shore.
Then, they would fill them
the crews with rum.
In 1973, at the age of close
to 69, Bill Miller gave it away.
“But I was still the best hard-
weather skipper on the har-
bor,” Miller said and he has
the record for the 73-74 sea-
son to back the claim.
“In that last year, I won
five races most of them in
howling nor’-easters,” he said.
“That was last year of the 27 I
raced in 18-footers.
“You could count on one
hand the number of races I
missed during that time, apart
from the times I was away
representing.
“They were great times
then and they are now. But
they’re different.”
There was one other ques-
tion ... Grandfather, grand-
son ... great sailors what
about the father?
“He didn’t get a crack at
it,” Bill Miller said.
“He went over at Gallipoli.
“Still,” Miller added simply, “his
crew won.”
Bill Miller had spoken of Balmain,
mentioning that it had been the home of
sailing in Sydney in those days and that
many of the top sailors also were top
footballers. “Wee Georgie” Robinson
was one of them. He played first grade
rugby league for Balmain and for 25
years was one of the top skippers in 18-
footers.
On the wall of his home in Balmain,
the suburb in which he has lived his 91
years, is a photograph of an 18-footer
going like the hounds of hell. Beneath it
is a simple inscription that tells it all:
“Perhaps the best-known of all the 18s
was Britannia, built at Balmain by her
owner-skipper ‘Wee Georgie’ Robinson
in 1919. Her crew, mostly Balmain
footballers, were afraid of nothing.
And, it seems, no sail was too big to
set.”
It’s true. Britannia had a 31 ft (10m)
boom, a 23ft gaff and a 21 ft mast, all of
which carried up to 3000 square feet of
sail compared with 1500 square ft car-
ried by today’s boats.

Will the
performance of
your banker be
as impressive
as the view
from his office?
When choosing a bank for their
international business and corporate
finance needs, some Australian
businessmen unfortunately subscribe
to the view “foreign is better”.
Yet overseas, one Australian
bank is acknowledged as a master in
the international money arena.
That bank is the ANZ.
ANZ has long been Australia’s
most active bank internationally, with
an extensive network of offices
covering all the International Financial
Centres throughout the world.
The ANZ is ideally poised to
assist Australian businesses with their
particular domestic and international
finance requirements.
Among the facilities we
can provide are foreign currency loans,
term loans, overdrafts, commercial
bills, leasing plus a full range of foreign
exchange and trade finance services.
Through the Capital Markets
Group we can also arrange specialised
facilities such as access to inter-
national and domestic capital markets,
project finance and big ticket leasing.
Best of all, we have some of the
finest banking brains in the world on
our staff and they’re at your beck and
call. They speak the same language
as you do.
And we believe they understand
Australian international and domestic
business problems and opportunities
far better than any foreign banker.
When choosing a banker for
corporate finance and business
services, look beyond the London, New
York and Paris skylines.
Look for skill, integrity and the
good old Australian know-how.
Look to the ANZ.

Like Bill Miller, “Wee Georgie” had
a family background of sailing.
His father, John “Jackie” Robinson,
was for many years a leading yachtsman
in Sydney and was a foundation mem-
ber of the Sydney Flying Squadron in
1890. Fittingly, he skippered Britannia
in a race with that club in his last time at
the competitive helm in the late 19205.
He finished fifth.
Not bad, considering that he was 86
at the time.
In doing so, “Jackie” Robinson be-
came the oldest skipper in Australian
yachting history, an honor he shares
with West Australian Chris Garland
who also continued racing until he was
86.
Appropriately, his son had relin-
quished the helm that day to his Dad
and “Wee Georgie” sailed in the race as
a for’ard sheet hand.
For the 25 years following the
launching of Britannia in 1919, “Wee
Georgie” and his Balmain footballing
mates sailed her to a string of victories
both club and state. He, too, remem-
bers the tough tactics when crews were
out to win or lose at all costs.
But Georgie was not interested in the
latter. Every time he sailed, it was to
win. And, on many of them, he did.
And never did he do so by protest-
ing.
“Dad always told me, ‘Whatever you
do, never protest’,” the son said. “And I
never did although there were plenty
of times when I had good reason to do
so.”
Whinge and win? Forget it!
As someone once said recently,
Balmain boys don’t cry.
Like father, like son. George Robin-
son’s son Ronnie became a top skipper
and his two sons are carrying on the
family tradition in 16-footers.
When he retired in 1944, George
Robinson put an engine in Britannia,
built her a coach-house and she became
the starting vessel for the 18-footers.
But that was no final fate for a racy
lady who had covered so many sea
miles and ever so quickly under sail.
Today, “Wee Georgie” is completing
perhaps his final task of a lifetime as a
boat-builder: he is restoring Britannia to
her original condition. She will become
part of the maritime museum at Syd-
ney’s Birkenhead Point.
. When she does go on display, young
lads will look at her and marvel at the
boats and the men who sailed them in
those years. Maybe they will even ask:
“Why was he called ‘Wee Georgie’?”
The answer comes today from the
man himself, still with a handshake of
strength that could hold any tiller in any
blow.
“I’m 4ft 117 2 inches and weigh 7
stone 11 pounds,” he laughs.
“Wringing wet.” □

The battle to
break in with
blood substitute
Dr Louis Hissink: went bankrupt in his battle to find a blood substitute
JOHN ELLIOTT
By GLENDA THOMPSON
AUSTRALIAN scientists have devel-
oped a blood substitute which they say
is better for most uses than human
whole blood and plasma.
The substance, called CH, is free of
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syn-
drome) or hepatitis. It is a protein and
can be made from milk or soya beans.
Dr Louis Hissink, a general practi-
tioner, has worked on the substance for
many years. He has been aided by Pro-
fessor Robert Bartholomew, a biochem-
ist, and Friederich Lingens, who is a
doctor in West Germany. They are
negotiating with a pharmaceutical firm,
Boehringer-Ingelheim, to produce the
substance.
Hissink, who was bankrupt for five
years to 1974 while developing and try-
ing to have CH accepted, believes the
climate is right for it to catch on. “At
last, it is becoming clear to people that
blood (from donors) is not such a great
thing after all,” he says.
His files are deep with letters about
CH, which stands for casein hy-
drolysate, to Australian and overseas
doctors, Health ministers and depart-
ments most of them matched by non-
committal replies.
If CH was manufactured outside
Australia it would have to comply with
Commonwealth import conditions
before being approved for use here. If
made here it would have to pass state
health department tests only. These
have not been done for CH.
“We have been browned-off at the
lack of acceptance in Australia,” says
Bartholomew who suggests that the es-
tablished medical fraternity and blood
transfusion services feel threatened by
their claims.
“This is not a replacement for the
blood transfusion service but an adjunct'
to it,” Bartholomew says. “CH is sorely
needed in countries which don’t have a
good transfusion service.”
The doctors say that CH works on
several levels. It is given into the veins,
like plasma or saline, to act as a blood
volume expander. Volume expanders
now in use are either crystalloids (such
as normal saline) which have a short-
term effect or colloids which have a high
molecular weight and stay in the blood
vessels longer before diffusing into the
tissues. Dextran, a synthesised sugar, is
a commonly used colloid. It is believed

that blood volume must be
restored quickly after blood
loss to ensure enough fluid to
maintain supplies to vital or-
gans. As long as volume is
restored, the temporary thin-
ning of red blood cells is
thought to have little effect
at least after small or moder-
ate blood loss. This is why giv-
ing a unit of blood does not
harm healthy people.
Dr Peter Harden, who
heads the Queensland Red
Cross Blood Transfusion Ser-
vice, says that more than half
the people to have intra-
venous therapy in Australia
receive plasma or volume ex-
panders rather than red cells
or whole blood.
Whole blood is given after
massive loss, such as during
open heart surgery, when its
oxygen-carrying effect is
needed. If a person has lost a
lot of blood in a road acci-
dent, for example, volume ex-
panders are given first. After some
hours, when the system is stabilised and
blood has been taken for cross-match-
ing, whole blood can be given for its
oxygen-carrying effect.
Where there is chronic kidney dis-
ease or blood loss over a long period
packed red cells are given. Sufferers
from blood diseases such as haemo-
philia need extracts from blood and CH
is not suggested as a replacement for
these.
The second property of CH involves
the theory that tiny blood vessels and
the lymph vessels have a pumping ac-
tion of their own. Hissink says that CH
speeds up this action and returns to the
blood circulation blood and lymph that
have been trapped or dormant in the ab-
dominal cavity. He explored these ac-
tions in experiments after he migrated
to Australia in 1950. He worked at
Prince Henry Hospital and at the Uni-
versity of NSW, when it was estab-
lished, where he met Bartholomew.
Hissink left after a blow-up with the
head of Pathology. “The professor was
a very precise man and I said, ‘I am a
surgeon; I want to know what happens
with the peripheral system when we op-
erate’. We disagreed and I left. I am a
loner. But I didn’t give up.”
Bartholomew says it was “a person-
ality clash” but that he does not have
trouble working with Hissink even
though he is a volatile, excitable man.
Hissink maintained a small general
practice in Narrabeen, a northern sub-
urb of Sydney, and continued exper-
iments at night. “My wife didn’t like it
much because I set them up in the room
next to the bedroom and it was rather
smelly,” he says. He made a film on rat
Professor Robert Bartholomew: “browned off” at the lack of acceptance in Australia
lymph activity and showed it at a world
blood transfusion congress in Sydney in
1966. He published articles in the ’6os.
Bartholomew who has “improved
CH,” according to Hissink has had
more time to devote to it in the five
years since he retired as head of Pathol-
ogy at the University of NSW. He is a
visiting researcher at Sydney Univer-
sity. He was awarded the Order of Aus-
tralia in 1976 for work in clinical bio-
chemistry.
Bartholomew made the CH that was
sent to Italy and Kenya for trials on
patients years ago. He has bottles of it
that are seven years old, sitting on a
shelf. “It is much better than whole
blood,” Bartholomew says. “Whole
blood cannot be sterilised and is un-
stable. This can be stored at room tern-
perature and it keeps almost indefinite-
ly.
“It should be carried in ambulances,
instead of plasma. It is not only a plas-
ma expander: it has a very desirable
effect on the very small blood vessels
and lymphatics which release blood and
lymph pooled in the vessels during
shock.
“It is entirely metabolisable, unlike
some colloids, so it leaves no residues
that may damage the patient and its
components can be used by the body for
nutrition.”
A protein like CH (Capain) was first
used by Hissink in Holland in 1944. As
a young surgeon, he worked with Pro-
fessor R. Brinkman who was using
Capain for treating babies for malnutri-
tion. Hissink says the blood transfusion
system broke down and there were
many casualties but sometimes no
blood. He tried Capain on his first sub-
ject. “The whole night I looked at the
patient. I would have lost my whole ca-
reer if he had died. We came through it
/ was almost dead.”
Hissink has letters from doctors who
used Capain on patients during the war
and approved it as “most satisfactory.”
Capain was manufactured by the
drug company Organon after the war
and marketed as Amparon. Hissink be-
lieves that short cuts in its preparation
may have given a different product, re-
sulting in Capain appearing not to live
up to its claimed properties. He is con-
cerned that this should not happen
again. However, if agreement with a
manufacturer is reached, Hissink ex-
pects that CH could be widely available
after trials.
He believes that he risks blowing the
negotiations and risks de-registration by
the NSW Medical Board by going pub-
lic in this way to The Bulletin. “I am
speaking out because this is in the pub-
lic’s interest,” he says.
People who have heard of CH re-
cently began seeking news of its avail-
ability from the Health department.
One is a physiotherapist, Barbara
Couston-Cliff. She says: “I feel medi-
cine is taking a wrong turn. Having
worked in hospitals, I know that
patients being given transfusions are
not informed of the risks involved;
there is often not enough time. The
good doctor’s substitute deserves assess-
ment and evaluation.”
Boehringer-Ingelheim heard about
CH from one of its representatives
there, according to Australian market-
ing director Rod Gillespie. He made the
first approach to Hissink.
Ironically Hissink showed people at


the firm his film years ago. He says he
once spent two years approaching all
the major pharmaceutical companies
with it.
Despite Hissink’s efforts, he is not
well known. Dr Gordon Archer, who di-
rects the NSW Blood Transfusion Ser-
vice says: “Hissink? He’s been pushing
that substance since 1966. I don’t know
if there’s been very much advance since
then. There are a lot of other substitutes
around now.”
The Bulletin: “Have you looked in to
CH at all?”
Archer: “No.”
The Bulletin: “Are you interested in
such substances?”
Archer: “We’re interested in any-
thing but we don’t treat patients. We’re
interested in the area. If he were to send
me a bottle of the stuff, you know, I’d be
interested in reading what was in it. But
I wouldn’t have any idea of what it does
on the patient because we don’t treat
’em. I think this is the same material he’s
been pushing since ’66, claiming magi-
cal properties other people didn’t seem
to agree with but I’m not in a position
to say.”
Dr Jack Morris, Melbourne’s blood
bank chief: “I think I did hear about it a
long time ago. I have an open mind but,
if it’s been lying around for that length
of time . ..”
Harden, in Brisbane: “No, I don’t
know of it. I must confess, my initial
reaction to these sorts of things is it’s a
load of garbage but I’m not so dyed-in-
the-wool that I wouldn’t look at it.”
Dr Robert Beal, director of the Adel-
aide blood bank: “No, I haven’t heard
of it but it sounds fascinating.”
Morris says that the AIDS scare is
likely to give some impetus to oxygen-
carrying blood substitutes being devel-
oped overseas.
A fluorocarbon called Flurosol DA,
developed by Green Cross in Japan, has
been used experimentally in several
countries but the United States Food
and Drug administration knocked it
back in October of last year. This means
that it can be used under experimental
conditions only.
The Australian Health department
approved its import on three occasions
recently for use by Jehovah’s Witnesses
but none of the substance arrived, ac-
cording to the Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories.
The other experimental thrust is in
solutions of haemoglobin, the oxygen-
carrying chemical in red cells. Harden
says: “You extract haemoglobin from
the cells and the solution is capable of
carrying oxygen, although you have
some trouble making it give it up again.
I think it’s going to be thing of the fu-
ture. Hissink, not surprisingly, does not
agree with either of these ideas. He be-
lieves that it is dangerous to introduce
blood from another person into a
patient, not only for the chance of
bringing disease but also because of im-
mune reactions set up.
He claims that there are as many
blood types as there are different finger-
prints, only “we haven’t learnt to dis-
tinguish them yet.”
Even the process of taking a person’s
blood to re-infuse it is not the answer,
he says, because blood changes when it
is out of the body.
He points to recent American reports
about a device to do that because of the
fear of AIDS.
“In my experiments, I saw that blood
removed from its original environment
can be damaged which gives rise to anti-
body formation when re-injected. This
can give permanent haemolytic anae-
mia in which antibodies formed con-
tinue to destroy your own red cells.”
A friend of Hissink, engineer Ed
Hundling who helped him make three
films on the discoveries, says: “There is
often professional antagonism and re-
sistance to change, non-acceptance of
lateral thinking by newcomers.
Hundling adds: “A lot of people
thought the Wright brothers were
nuts.” □

CRIME
Women who live in fear of death
By BRUCE STANNARD
DR JOCELYNNE SCUTT
has never been a victim of
domestic violence but she
knows a lot of women who
have been bashed, kicked,
stabbed or shot by their part-
ners.
Scutt’s survey* of the
bruised, battered and some-
times dead victims of dom-
estic violence in Australia has
shed a harsh new light on the
brutality that passes for the
domestic norm in so many
Australian households.
“I suppose,” she said, “I’m
lucky that I’ve never had to
endure anything even remote-
ly like that kind of violence
but I can understand the
reasons women end up killing
men. If you’re living in a
household and your life is
constantly bound up by a man
who comes home and beats
you up night after night, week
after week, month after month
and, yes, even year after year,
your whole life becomes satu-
rated with violence. In the
end, you’re not even aware
there are people out there who
can help. All you know is that the only
way to escape is to do something physi-
cal, like kill him. In the end, many
women find they have no choice but to
end the life of the person who has
locked them into this world of violence
and brutality.”
Women who did leave brutal hus-
bands, Scutt said, often found it was no
solution. The husbands pursued them,
seeking vengeance for the damage to
their pride.
Scutt said that threats of murder and
serious violence were so common that
within the women’s refuge movement
there now was a wartime resistance-
style underground in which scores of
women and children on the run were
often disguised, given new identities,
smuggled interstate and concealed in
houses which it was hoped would re-
main secret.
But, even with such an elaborate net-
work, the women were never entirely
safe. Kathy Braham, the welfare worker
at the women’s refuge at Christie’s
Jocelynne Scutt: violence often leads to killing as a final escape
ANDRE MARTIN
Beach just south of Adelaide, confirmed
that men who pursued women often
went to extraordinary lengths to gain
both access to the shelter and informa-
tion on their runaway spouses.
“Absolutely no information at all is
given out about any women in the shel-
ter,” she said, “so that forces the men to
get up to all sorts of devious tricks. We
have had men ringing up claiming they
were police or social security officers.
Some of them obtain information
through mates in the police force or
through contacts in Telecom. Quite
often it’s a matter of life and death or, at
the very least, severe injury so we’re al-
ways on the look out for con men. We
just can’t afford to take the risk. We tell
them nothing.”
Scutt said police often advised
women on the run that they would be
better off interstate because the men
were “unable to be restrained.” “I know
it’s easy for me to say this from the safe-
ty and comfort of my office,” she said,
“but there is really no point in running.
I have found that, even if the women do
leave, they are likely to be killed any-
way. Certainly the bashing will not stop.
That’s why it’s time for the women to
demand that it is the men who
must leave. I know it’s very
risky and the violence poten-
tial is very high but the point
is, the violence potential is
very high if you go anyway. I
am very strongly of the view
that resources should be made
available to women working
in the refuges to enable them
to move into these homes to
act as guardians. Many of
these bashers are just big bul-
lies who wouldn’t dream of
doing anything in front of
other people.”
Scutt said some women
had great difficulty in believ-
ing their partners were trying
to kill them. “Take, for
example, suffocation in bed,”
she said. “You don’t really
know whether he is trying to
put an end to your life or just
playing some macabre game.
If you’re married to someone,
you don’t want to believe the
worst of them. When the beat-
ings and the bashings and the
attempts at killing start, you
have a schizophrenic reaction.
The women are left wonder-
ing: ‘Well, was it a dream?’ Many of the
women are told constantly that they are
exaggerating. If anything, I’d say the
women in my study downplayed the vi-
olence they suffered.” Scutt examined
the case histories of 312 families, inclu-
ding 127 cases of spouse assault of
which 119 were women victims and
eight were male victims.
In only three cases in her study did a
killing take place. In many other cases,
she said, threats and attempted murder
were daily fare.
Scutt found that one husband threat-
ened to kill both his wife and daughter
“when the least thing upset him.” An-
other man drove “like a maniac” with
his wife in the car, threatening to run off
the road and kill them both. Other times
he held pillows over her head until she
was able to free herself with reserves of
strength she did not know she had.
A girl said: “My mother is continu-
ally bashed in front of my sister. I saw
him pick up and throw a kitchen table at
her. He has knocked her downstairs and
tried to drown her in the bath but she
stays with him and can’t get away.”
One man attacked his wife after re-
turning from her father’s funeral. Scutt
*Even In The Best Of Homes. Violence In The
Family was published recently by Pelican
books ($9.95).


said the man knocked his wife down,
choking her and kicking her in the
stomach, shouting: “When your mother
dies, I’ll kill you too.”
Another man made several attempts
on his wife’s life during their 19-year
marriage. Once, according to Scutt, he
attempted murder by welding the pas-
senger door of their truck and tipping it
into an embankment with her inside. He
also attempted to run her down by car.
Scutt said that women who sought
outsiders’ help on being threatened with
death were immediately at a disadvan-
tage. First, both police and the commu-
nity believed that what happened within
the family circle was a matter for those
within it even where deliberate attempts
on a woman’s life were in question.
Also, women were seen as exaggerating
“She’s imagining it” or “It’s not really
serious.”
Of the three spouse murders Scutt
examined, in only one was the wife the
victim. The dead woman’s sister told the
story: “V— pursued his wife and child
back to Australia from his country
where they had been living for four
years. His wife had left him, intending
to divorce him and then gain custody of
the child and stay in Australia. After ar-
riving back here and advising him she
would not be coming back, he kept
writing ... I have read parts of his let-
ters to her and in them he had told her
he would kill her or both her and their
only child, a boy, and later other mem-
bers of the family if she did not go back.
Finally he came out to Australia where
for several months arguments and
abuse, etc, raged.
“Later arguments centred mainly on
the child. The husband said he would
kill his wife if he could not have the
child. The police were called as the ar-
guments stormed. After a number of
visits they advised they would come
only if severe violence started. When it
did, they were there within 10 minutes.
But it was 10 minutes too late.”
Scutt said this picture of marital
murder was typical of at least 20 percent
of wife killings in Australia today. Hus-
bands, she claimed, were unable to deal
with the affront to their ego implicit in a
wife or de facto wife leaving them or
seeking a divorce.
Scutt is particularly critical of
“muddled thinking” judges who express
sympathy for men who kill their wives.
“It is this sort of muddled thinking,” she
said, “that could encourage men to kill
their wives and locks women into unsat-
isfactory relationships of no benefit to
themselves, to their children or
ultimately to the men murdering them.
Men believe they have a right to retain a
wife’s company and person simply be-
cause, once, she agreed to marry them
and did so and courts support men in
that view. Little wonder women despair
that, once married, there is no way to
leave. If she does leave, a woman lives
in constant fear of her ex-husband forc-
ing his way back into her life to kill her
if he cannot have her, no one else
will.”
Scutt says killings of husbands are
different. She cited a case of a couple
married for 12 years. Once or twice a
week, she said, in a continuing pattern
over those years, the husband slapped
and punched the wife and pulled her
hair. Weekly he threatened her with a
rifle. She suffered very bad bruises last-
ing for weeks. She told no one. She
could not leave because she had six chil-
dren. Finally she retaliated to protect
herself from the beatings.
“I did not threaten murder,” she
wrote to Scutt, “it just happened on the
spur of the moment.” The husband was
shot with the gun he had so often used
to threaten and bully his wife. Scutt said
the woman was “fortunate” in being
convicted only of manslaughter.

began four months before her marriage.
Violence continued for the next 23
years. One son suffered broken ribs and
other severe injuries from the time he
was five months old.
Scutt said the woman finally got a
divorce and remarried. When the sec-
ond husband died, her family and those
she had thought of as friends persuaded
her to take back her first husband. A few
years later, she and her son were con-
victed of murder and spent six years in
prison.
“There is a spectacular difference,”
Scutt said, “between a case where a
woman, constantly beaten and abused,
turns upon the abuser in desperation
and kills him and one in which a man,
never having been bashed by his wife
perhaps having bashed her himself
suddenly, upon learning that she is leav-
ing him, strangles her, stabs her, shoots
her. The ordinary person regarding
these circumstances might think the law
might react less harshly toward the bat-
tered woman, lashing back in desper-
ation, and more harshly toward the man
angrily playing dog-in-the-manger with
the woman he married. Such a person
would be wrong. The law, structured to
deal with a male concept ‘justice’
treats such cases disparately, in the
man’s favor.” □
Murder most common in the home
MURDER, to most people,
probably brings to mind gang
warfare, the silencing of pos-
sible informers by drug-run-
ners or killing during armed
robberies.
The truth, however, lies un-
comfortably closer to home.
According to a survey of
homicide patterns in NSW be-
tween 1933 and 1981, 42.5
percent of all murders occur
within families.
The results of the survey,
by the NSW Bureau of Crime
Statistics and Research, are
not due to be published until
next year.
According to the survey, 54
percent of all family killings
involve spouses. One in four
of all NSW homicides are
spouse killings. The next-
most-common category (27.2
percent) involves offspring,
both children and adults. Parent killings
are next (7.9 percent), followed by sib-
lings (4.2 percent), in-laws (3.8 percent)
and other family members (2.7 percent).
Eighty percent of all domestic kill-
ings occur in the privacy of the home,
with the bedroom the most likely place
27 percent, compared with only 6 per-
cent in the kitchen.
Guns are the most favored weapon.
Thirty-eight percent of all victims were
shot. Twenty-one percent had been
stabbed and 15 percent had been bashed
and kicked to death.
Six percent were strangled and a fur-
ther 6 percent were battered with an in-
strument.
Alison Wallace, the statistics bu-
reau’s project officer who has worked
full-time on the study over the past three
years, said that many people who
bought guns for protection against in-
truders ended up Using them on family
members.
She said 25 percent of family mur-
ders involved suicide or attempted
suicide while the rate for “stranger kill-
ings” was only 1.7 percent.
Sandra Egger and Alison Wallace: studying causes and effects of family killings
People who killed family members
were much less likely than other killers
to have criminal records. Fifty-nine per-
cent had no prior criminal record. That
compared with 40 percent of those who
killed friends and 42 percent of those
who killed strangers.
Sixty-eight percent of family killings
occurred within the city, compared with
30 percent in rural areas.
“A lot of the literature on domestic
violence talks about the role of al-
cohol,” Wallace said, “but we found al-
cohol was a more common factor in
killings involving friends and neighbors
and strangers than it was in killings in-
volving family members. Alcohol was
present in about 36 percent of family
killings whereas it was present in 49 per-
cent of stranger killings and 53 percent
of friend killings.
“A lot of people are tempted to make
very simplistic correlations between al-
cohol and murder.
“The popular assumption is that al-
cohol causes domestic violence; that is
something with which I would strongly
disagree: It may be one precipitating
factor but, nevertheless, there are usual-
ly many other considerations. After all,
in nearly two-thirds of family killings
there was no alcohol present.
“Our study shows that where there
had been a history of domestic violence,
the assaults could occur at any time,
whether alcohol was present or not.”
The younger the relationship, the
more likely it is that a dispute will result
in homicide.
The first few years and, in particu-
lar, the first 12 months of a marriage
are shown to be the most dangerous
times.
The survey shows that, whereas only
3.2 percent of the Australian population
have been married for less than a year,
14 percent of the spouse homicides oc-
cur within one year of the start of the
relationship.
“As a relationship gets longer,” Wal-
lace said, “you find increasingly less
likelihood of it ending in homicide. But
homicide can occur at any point in the
relationship. The shortest duration
involved a couple who had been
together less than a month. The longest


involved a couple who had lived
together for 55 years.”
Dr Sandra Egger, the bureau’s depu-
ty director, said that because evidence
for a history of domestic violence was
based only on information in police
files the results were likely seriously to
underestimate the number of homicides
involving prior domestic violence.
“Nevertheless,” she said, “we find
that, in 48 percent of the spouse killings,
there had been a prior history of viol-
ence almost always by the husband
on the wife. In 40 percent of the cases
where husbands killed their wives there
was a known history of domestic viol-
ence, compared with 70 percent of those
cases where wives killed husbands.
“When we looked for precipitating
factors, we found that the violence by a
husband toward his wife was the single
most important factor leading women
to retaliate and kill their husbands. In
the overwhelming majority of these
cases, self-protection was the context in
which the killings were said to have oc-
curred. It was different in the case of
husband killings: For example, separ-
ation was a very important factor in a
husband taking the life of his wife. Sex-
ual jealousy was another important fac-
tor in husbands killing wives.
“One of the things this study does do
is make a nonsense of the popular press
view that women are most at risk from
strangers in dark streets at night.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
These murders are taking place in bed-
rooms and kitchens and they are being
carried out not by strangers but by fam-
ily members with whom the victims pre-
sumably once shared an intimate, lov-
ing relationship.”
According to Wallace, “alarm sig-
nals” sounded in at least half the cases
where domestic violence led to a spouse
homicide. “There are usually plenty of
indications,” she said, “that things are
seriously wrong. Help is sought from
many different agencies.
“Police are involved; social workers
and hospitals where the victims have
been admitted bashed and injured.
There is a lot of scope for preventive
action when it comes to domestic mur-
ders because they don’t just happen out
of the blue. Invariably, there is a history
not only of conflict but very often of
violence. The occurrence of early cries
for help at least give us some hope. We
can’t just shrug our shoulders and say,
‘Well, domestic murder is always going
to happen.’ It can be prevented.”
Even so, legal action by a few
women covered in the study proved
counter-productive. They ended up be-
ing killed only a few days before their
husbands were to appear in court
charged with assaulting them. Their in-
itiative acted as a catalyst for their
deaths. □

COVER STORY
Hawke’s stumbling block:
a rogue Senate
The emergence of the Nuclear Disarmament Party and the Brian Harradine Group,
together with the Democrats, means that any grand scheme of Prime Minister
Hawke and a huge majority in the House of Representatives after December 1 can be
thwarted by an independent Senate. RICHARD FARMER, DA VID ARMSTRONG,
DEBORAH HOPE and DA VID BARNETT look at the volatile upper house.
LABOR HAS given up hope of control-
ling the Senate after December 1 but the
Senate election is still vital to the way a
second Hawke government would run
the country. The latest Morgan Gallup
poll, published in this issue, merely con-
firms what Labor has believed for
months there is no chance the party
can win four of the seven
vacancies in five states,
which it would need to do
to have 39 of the 76 sena-
tors in the new parliament.
But the figures do keep
alive the prospect that
Labor could do well
enough to break its total
dependence on the Austra-
lian Democrats. And there
is still an outside chance it
could win the seventh seat
in New South Wales, Vic-
toria, South Australia and
Western Australia. Such a
result would split the Sen-
ate 38 Labor and 38 non-
Labor and at least enable
the government to defeat
opposition proposals to es-
tablish embarrassing in-
quiries such as that into
High Court Judge Lionel
Murphy.
The past six months or
so have shown Prime Min-
ister Bob Hawke just what
an irritant it can be not to
have the numbers in the
upper house. The Murphy
inquiry aside, the Liberal
and National parties have
combined with some of the
Democrats and indepen-
dent Senator Brian
Harradine to defeat legis-
lation to collect income tax
retrospectively. All the
signs are that the Liberal-
National coalition will use
its Senate numbers even
more ruthlessly if, as seems likely,
Labor is returned in the House of Rep-
resentatives.
The prospect of an obstructionist
Senate continuing is not a happy one
for Hawke, even though he is likely to
have an increased majority in the lower
house. This is why Hawke, a politician
Prime Minister Hawke on the hustings
ERNIE McQUILLAN
with the capacity to see potential prob-
lems well ahead, has gone out of his way
to have contact with Harradine during
his 19 months in office. The Tasmanian
senator was not in a position to help the
government as he and Labor between
them could muster only 31 of the Sen-
ate’s 64 votes but in the new Senate,
which will have 76 mem-
bers, Harradine and his ex-
pected colleague Mrs Kath
Venn just might be in a
position to make up the 39
votes needed for a ma-
jority.
Hawke, who, as David
Barnett reports on page 79,
opposed Harradine’s ex-
pulsion from the Labor
Party, realises that the po-
tentially key person in the
new Senate has not for-
saken his traditional trade
union background. On
many issues he is a far
more likely supporter of
Hawke’s program than are
the Democrats as led by
Don Chipp. Venn is a for-
mer state secretary of the
Labor Party and it is only
through the extreme stu-
pidity of left-wing control-
lers of the Tasmanian
branch that she is standing
under the Harradine ban-
ner. She, too, could be ex-
pected to support the key
parts of Labor’s legislative
program.
That Venn will win a
seat in Tasmania seems
certain. With seven sena-
tors to be elected in each
state, 12.5 percent of the
votes are needed to gain a
position. The Morgan poll
has consistently shown the
Harradine ticket with close
to or more than enough


PUBLIC OPINION
Ban-the-bombers disturb the Labor vote
THE EMERGENCE of the Nuclear Disarmament Party
seems to be affecting the Labor Party’s prospects for the
Senate. Since the Morgan Gallup Poll included the single
issue party on the ballot paper given to people surveyed,
Labor’s vote has dropped.
In the two weekends of October 6/7 and October
13/14, 50 percent of people surveyed said they would
vote for Labor in the Senate.
On the weekend of October 20/21 when the Nuclear
Disarmament Party (NDP) was listed in its own right, the
coalition partners and the Democrats remained un-
changed but Labor went down 2 percent while the new
party received the first preference of 3 percent.
If the latest voting intention is repeated on December
1, Labor will do better than it did at the double dissol-
ution in 1983 when it polled only 45 percent in the Senate.
Much will depend on how the NDP preferences are dis-
tributed. If they flow to the Democrats, Labor’s increased
primary vote might not translate into winning the extra
seats for which it is hoping in NSW, South Australia,
Western Australia and Victoria.
The last line of the table below shows the prospect for
the Senate as of October 20 obtained from interviewing
an Australia-wide cross-section of 1295 electors.

fMr Harradine’s vote in Tasmania was 9%


support to reach 12.5 percent. Even al-
lowing for the fact that on polling day
some of this vote might drift when
people realise that they would not be
opting for Harradine himself but merely
a supporter running under his name,
such high support at this stage should be
enough to guarantee success.
An element of lottery enters into the
Tasmanian situation because the Demo-
crats and other independents also ap-
pear to be doing well. Together with
Harradine’s group, these minor el-
ements have recorded as much as 22
percent of the voting intention in recent
weeks. This raises the possibility of a
second independent or minor party can-
didate being returned.
Whether that seat would be at the ex-
pense of Labor or the Liberals is diffi-
cult to guess because of the small
Morgan sample in Tasmania. But Labor
is certainly expecting to do substantially
better than the 32.8 percent of the Sen-
ate vote it gained in 1983. Because of the
uncertainty about the position and the
importance of having as many senators
as possible, Hawke might well devote
more time to campaigning in the state
than it would deserve if he simply con-
sidered the potential for winning seats
in the House of Representatives. In the
other five states it is difficult to see the
major parties Labor and the coalition
not winning three seats each. To do so
they need 37.5 percent of the vote each
three times the quota of 12.5 percent.
To get four seats in a State, a party
needs 50 percent of the vote either in its
own right or through the distribution of
the preferences of candidates excluded
as the counting begins. For a minor
party to win the seventh and last pos-
ition, it must get to 12.5 percent before a
major party gets to 50.
The Senate election is really then,
about who wins this last seat in each
state. (In the Australian Capital Terri-
tory and the Northern Territory, it
would take a near miracle for either
Labor or the coalition to gain the 66.7
percent of the vote needed to win both
positions being contested or for a minor
candidate to reach the 33.3 percent
needed to win one of them.)
Before looking at the prospects state
by state, a little bit of arithmetic: On
December 1, 46 senators are to be
elected. A total of 30 retain their pos-
itions and the party break-up of them is
Labor 14, Liberal/National 13, Demo-
crat 2, independent 1.
On the assumption that in each state
there is a three-all split of the first six
vacancies and that in the two territories
the split is one-all, Labor at that stage
would have 34 seats, the coalition 33,
the Democrats two and there would be
one independent.
In Tasmania, as explained, an inde-
pendent seems sure of success in the
seventh vacancy. Labor and the
Harradine independents between them
would count for 36. For Labor to get to
control in its own right with 39 seats
would require victory everywhere else.
To be in the position to block the
combined opposition passing legisla-
tion or motions would take victory in
four of the five remaining vacancies.
For Labor to be able to pass legislation
with the support of Harradine and Venn
would require victory in three of the five
states.
Labor’s best chance of winning a
fourth seat appears to be in Western
Australia where the Morgan polls over
recent months have shown a Senate
voting intention for it between 44 and
54 percent. In 1983, Labor’s Senate vote
in WA was 49.3 percent. Only a minor
improvement on that figure is needed
and Labor has hopes that the simplified
voting system in operation this year for
the first time will help it. A reduction in
informal votes that should follow is ex-
pected to help Labor more than its op-
ponents.
Kath Venn: favored in Tasmania
Where the new voting system is like-
ly to be of most assistance to Labor is in
NSW where ballot papers have con-
tained 60 names or more. In August and
September, the Morgan poll had
Labor’s likely Senate vote around 48
percent.
Until the emergence of the Nuclear
Disarmament Party, Labor was hopeful
of picking up the seventh seat in Vic-
toria. Now they believe that the NDP
will take votes from them and that the
single-issue party’s preferences will be
enough to return a Democrat.
No officials of the main parties be-
lieve that the NDP has any prospect of
winning itself. A vote of 4 or 5 percent
for it is much more likely than the
widely misinterpreted figure of 15 per-
cent taken from a Morgan poll. That
poll asked people surveyed whether
they would support a single-issue, anti-
uranium party which is far different
from asking them for whom they would
vote.
In South Australia, Labor’s Senate
support in the Morgan poll has been as
high as 50 percent in the past two
months. But here, too, the uranium issue
is likely to bleed support. The result is
bound to be close.
In Queensland, the seventh seat
battle is between the Nationals and
Democrats, with odds favoring the
Nationals.
On the basis that Labor wins the sev-
enth seat in Western Australia, NSW
and South Australia, that the Nationals
win it in Queensland, that the Demo-
crats succeed in Victoria and the Harra-
dine candidate gets up in Tasmania, the
new Senate would break up: Labor 37;
Liberal/National 34; Democrats 3; in-
dependents 2. Labor could easily end
up with 36 and the Democrats four.
What is certain is that one seat differ-
ence either way would make a great deal
of difference to a Hawke government’s
ability to run the country. □
Nuclear protest in Melbourne, April 1984


THE DEMOCRATS
Living in the shadow of the Bomb
SENATOR DON Chipp, leader of the
Australian Democrats the party
which holds, and is striving to keep, the
power balance in federal politics is
haunted by one issue: the threat of nu-
clear holocaust.
His apprehension about the future is,
he says, the only reason he remains a
politician. Other MPs, and millions of
voters, might worry about the assets test
or the merits of one type of taxation
over another but to Chipp such matters
are the humdrum of politics. If they
were the only issues to be discussed he
would have quit already.
Chipp’s obsession is explained eas-
ily. Foremost in his thinking is his perky
and pretty daughter, Juliet, and by
extension all children.
The 59-year-old senator
gained a new appreciation
of the delight and fragility
of life when Juliet was
born two years ago. He
worries about the world in
which she will live and
about whether there will be
a world for her.
“The biggest question
of all is whether we’ll be
here the question of nu-
clear holocaust,” he said
the other day. “This is the
issue which consumes me. As I’ve got
older the fundamental truth has grasped
me that we have a massive responsibil-
ity to our children. They did not ask to
be born.”
Chipp’s concern is reflected in the
Democrats’ campaign propaganda. In
pamphlets outlining the election issues,
or listing the party’s achievements, the
nuclear question always is mentioned
first. It is reflected, too, in the campaign
slogan: “You can change the world
vote Democrat.” After seven years as a
national force the Democrats remain
the political romantics.
But they are not entirely so. A person
such as Chipp does not spend almost a
quarter of a century in politics without
remaining a politician. The Democrats’
campaign will be conducted on two
levels. They will pursue an ideological
theme of concern about the future
(which encompasses such issues as nu-
clear war, the environment, high tech-
nology and its threat of widespread un-
employment). They also will push a
more pragmatic, more overtly political
line, which Chipp sums up as “God help
Australia if Labor gets power in both
houses.”
Don Chipp and (inset) his daughter Juliet
The strategy is to capi-
talise on the nervousness
of supporters of private en-
terprise who accept that
Prime Minister Hawke will
be returned but who are
worried about the prospect
of Labor’s winning corn-
plete power. During the campaign
Chipp will be telling these people that
only the Democrats can restrain Labor’s
arrogance.
Democrats also hope that the main
slogan will appeal to frustrated
Laborites who are annoyed at Hawke’s
right-wing position on such issues as the
American military bases, the visits of
nuclear-armed or powered ships, the
mining and export of uranium and rela-
tions with the United States. Chipp said
the possibility of attracting dissatisfied
Labor voters did not enter his mind
when the slogan was being drafted. He
admitted, however, the slogan would
have that practical effect.
The Democrats, he said, did not aim
to be a “centre” party. “One of the
things that hurts is when people call us a
‘centre’ party,” he said. “We are not; we
never have been. We’re a radical party,
a reform party.”
The earnest Democrats want their
fanciful slogan to be taken literally.
When the party’s deputy leader, Senator
Colin Mason, was asked if it was sup-
posed to mean that a vote by one person
for a minority party in a small country
could influence world events, he re-
plied: “That’s true.” Said Chipp: “It is
possible to redirect the course of history
if you get off your arse and do some-
thing. Three years ago there was a time
when every member of the Labor and
Liberal parties had voted for legislation
to dam the Franklin River. Today, the
Franklin runs free.”
Mason argues that the party’s record
justifies the optimism of the slogan. But
have the Democrats been able to change
the world? In the life of the Hawke gov-
ernment the five Democrat senators
have introduced a total of 39 private
members’ bills, on subjects as diverse as
banning tobacco advertising in the Aus-
tralian Capital Territory, banning visits
by nuclear ships and encouraging in-
dustrial democracy. Only one bill (to
stop a form of tax avoidance) has been
passed by both houses.
Five have been taken up by the gov-
ernment and of the five at least one
(providing for a Bill of Rights) was
long-standing Labor policy. Three of
the bills were defeated. When the Senate
rose last week the other 30 had got
nowhere.
A party election pamphlet lists 16
achievements. They include helping
block the Fraser government’s plan to
tax the “necessities of life,” improve-
ments to the Medicare legislation,
strengthening the National Crimes
Authority, forming a Senate committee
on animal welfare and introducing a
bill to save the Franklin River and other
wilderness areas. The rest are proposals.


Chipp said the party’s “runs on the
board” paled into insignificance when
compared with its success in maintain-
ing awareness of the issues of the future.
“We have maintained a consciousness
of these matters,” he said. “That, to me,
is our biggest achievement.”
Chipp was sitting in the garden of his
Canberra home, a garden pre-
dominantly, but not exclusively,
planted with native shrubs and trees.
Chipp and his wife, Idun, have two
homes. The other is built on 1% acres
(the equivalent of five standard Can-
berra housing blocks) of Dandenong
bushland. The site was chosen for its
beauty and its comparative safety. It is
well-removed from the centre of Mel-
bourne and Melbourne, in his mind, is a
nuclear target.
Chipp had just regained his voice,
having had a polyp removed from his
vocal cords eight days previously. The
problem was similar to that which
afflicts New South Wales Premier
Neville Wran but Wran’s doctors did
not remove the growth; they treated it
with Teflon. Already, Chipp’s voice
sounded better than Wran’s.
In Chipp’s mind the issues of nuclear
war and the environment are linked by
the common thread of parental respon-
sibility for their children. At one point,
as we lunched on curried sausages and
salad, he said: “Here we are sitting here
having a nice drink in a nice garden and
tomorrow we could be incinerated.” A
few sentences later the conversation
about disarmament automatically led to
the environment. “The fact that chil-
dren’s mothers and fathers caused them
to be here puts a massive responsibility
on the parents to ensure that the planet
is safe, happy and unpolluted,” he said.
“I owe it to Juliet and the other kids
to preserve the Daintree rainforest, to
keep the Franklin running, to stop the
destruction of the jarrah forests in West-
ern Australia.
Neither Chipp nor the party’s South
Australian senator, Janine Haines, are
standing in this election. They received
high enough votes in last year’s full Sen-
ate election to win six-year terms. But
their three colleagues, senators Mason
(NSW), Jack Evans (Western Australia)
and Michael Macklin (Queensland) are
facing the electorate.
The party aims to win one seat in
each mainland state. Some optimists
hope that they will gain a seat in Tas-
mania but this is unlikely.
Winning a seat requires 12.5 percent
of the vote, so the Democrats will have
to improve strongly on their 1983 results
in all States except Victoria and South
Australia, as the accompanying table
shows.
Party officials say the Democrats’
present low rating in the polls is not of
great concern as their support always

rises before an election particularly
once Chipp starts getting the increased
exposure that comes during a campaign.
Chipp argued, more modestly, that
opinion polls underestimated the
Democrats’ strength as their samples
were not big enough to measure a min-
ority party’s support.
If the Democrats’ hopes are realised
and each mainland state returns one of
their senators, their numbers will rise
from five to seven, ensuring that they
retain their key role of makers, breakers
and amenders of government legisla-
tion.
But the Democrats have their own
problems with the future, flowing from
changes in the numbers of senators to
be elected, now that parliament is being
expanded.
In this election, seven senators are to
The most powerful woman in Canberra
TEN YEARS ago Janine Haines, an
Adelaide high school teacher of math-
ematics and English swotting for a mas-
ter of arts degree, was hurt in a car acci-
dent. Her injuries put a stop to her
studies and she was persuaded to take
an interest in politics. Today, she may
well be the most powerful woman in
Canberra.
Haines, 39, is an increasingly promi-
nent Australian Democrat senator. She
was the Democrats’ first senator and she
may be a future leader.
After the car smash, she said last
week, a neighbor who was active in the
old breakaway Liberal Movement sug-
gested she join to fill up her spare time.
“Spare time” was scarce time for the
mother of two young daughters but she
did go to movement meetings and soon
found herself chairman of a local
branch. In 1975 she was on the move-
ment’s Legislative Council ticket and
then on its Senate ticket. In 1978 the
state government appointed her to the
Senate, following former Senator Steele
Hall’s decision to try to win a House of
Representatives seat. “It was a real in-
stance of being in the right place at the
right time,” she said.
In 1980 she was elected to the Senate
and was re-elected, for a six-year term,
last year. Since then she has taken a
more conspicuous role, leading the
Democrats’ negotiations with the gov-
ernment and the opposition on such
matters as the setting up of the commit-
tee inquiring into Justice Lionel
Murphy, the assets test and Medicare.
In so doing she has won the respect
of her colleagues. “Janine’s got steel in
her guts,” Don Chipp said.
While the Democrats increasingly
have become a “green” party, stressing
such issues as nuclear disarmament and
preservation of the environment,
Haines maintains a deep interest in
more traditional matters, such as social
welfare. “My interests tend to lie in
other areas,” she said. “You’re talking
to the right wing of the Democrats.
“People ought to be looking at the
needs of families with dependent chil-
dren. They are not being attended to.
I’ve been attacking the Labor Party ever
since they decided to spend $1 billion
on across-the-board tax cuts.
“Normally one doesn’t criticise the
government for this. But when it says
this is to assist low income families
when there is patently a better way of
doing it, the government has to be at-
tacked.
“The Liberals dredge up income
splitting every time they’re in opposi-
tion. That assists upper income families


be elected from each State but the last
elected will serve only a three-year term
instead of the normal six year. If all the
Democrats elected on December 1 win
short terms, the party’s whole represen-
tation will face the polls at the next elec-
tion. If the Democrats want to consoli-
date their future and not risk losing
all in 1987 they need to win some six-
year seats.
The party, however, will be helped
by changes in the electoral laws which
should reduce the Democrats’ informal
vote, which Chipp and Mason es-
timated was as high as 22 percent.
In this election voters will be able to
signify support for a party by putting
the number 1 next to its first candidate.
The other change is that the how-to-vote
ticket will be available in the polling
booth, helping to overcome the Demo-
crats’ problem of marshalling enough
supporters to staff all booths. Mason
said these reforms would add 2 percent
to the party’s vote.
The Democrats, however, also face
the immediate problem of competition
on their main issue, in the shape of the
newly formed Nuclear Disarmament
ARE THE Australian Democrats go-
ing into the election with potential
leadership problems?
During an interview with The Bul-
letin last week the party’s deputy
leader, Senator Colin Mason, volun-
teered the suggestion that should the
leader, Don Chipp, retire, he would
be a candidate for the leadership.
“I’d like to see him lead the party
for as long as he feels he wants to,”
Mason said. “But sooner or later he
may feel he wants to retire. If he re-
tires I will be a candidate. I feel I
have the confidence of the mem-
bers.” He said Mason had “every
right to say that.” He added: “I’ve
got no intention of giving it away.”
Party. Jack Evans argued that Nuclear
Disarmament’s presence would empha-
sise the issue but others were not quite
so sanguine.
Haines said the Democrats probably
would steal votes from the government
because of the way it had reneged on
Labor’s uranium policy. But she was
worried that the presence of Nuclear
Disarmament candidates would allow
disaffected Labor voters to make their
protest and then give preferences to the
ALP, “having soothed their con-
sciences.”
Said Chipp: “I don’t know why they
formed. I’m sure the motivation of most
of them is very genuine. I just don’t
know why. They can’t possibly win a
seat. But they could split the anti-nu-
clear vote. That would diminish the pri-
mary votes the Democrats get and the
irony is that that would almost ensure a
Liberal-controlled Senate.”
Chipp took consolation in the
thought that Nuclear Disarmament, by
relying so heavily on rock star Peter
Garrett, might attract younger, more
radical voters, making easier the
Democrats’ job of appealing to older,
more middle class people who are con-
cerned about nuclear issues. “If a bald-
headed rock singer can gather the
young, trendy, angry group, it might
help the Democrats,” he said.
David Armstrong
Senator Janine Haines: steel in her guts
more than lower income families. It
would be far better if the family allow-
ance were increased.”
She is a feminist (who, incidentally,
dresses in frilly, feminine style) but she
finds that even in the male world of fed-
eral parliament she is treated as an
equal. “As far as this place is concerned,
if you do your job well, that’s fine
leaving aside the sexual harassment,
which is a national sport in Australia.
The really important thing in this job is
that you have to take it seriously, but
not yourself.
“It stuffs up your family life. But the
children are teenagers. I’ve been in this
business long enough and they’ve got
used to it. I speak to them three or four
times a day on the telephone, help them
if they’re having trouble with Lord of the
Flies or finding the longitude and lati-
tude of Turkey.
“The weekends are the kids’, and
lan’s. It’s almost an unbreakable rule
that I spend Saturday and Sunday
(apart from during campaigns) in Adel-
aide, with no functions. We do whatever
they want to do - go ten pen bowling
(at which I’m atrocious; my thumb gets
stuck) or go to the beach.”
When she does have some of the
scarce spare time Haines does tapestry
or cryptic crosswords or she reads. □


NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT PARTY
The wild card in the ALP pack
THE NUCLEAR Disarmament Party is
shaping up as a force to be reckoned
with on December 1. That is the con-
clusion to be drawn from the latest
Morgan Gallup Poll.
According to the poll, 3 percent of
Australians intend to vote for the newly
formed party. While this is way below
the quota of votes necessary to win
places for the party’s own candidates,
the exchange of preferences will boost
substantially the 8 percent polled by the
Australian Democrats. The combined
vote should assure the Democrats of a
Senate seat in at least the three states
NSW, Victoria and Western Australia
where the National Disarmament Party
(NDP) is fielding candidates.
Under normal circumstances the sev-
enth Senate seat in most states would be
fought out between the Australian
Labor Party and the Democrats. The
NDP may, however, prove to be the
wild card in the ALP pack.
The October poll gives a somewhat
more realistic assessment of the NDP’s
chances than a separate poll carried out
in September by Morgan and commis-
sioned by the Australian Conservation
Foundation and other anti-nuclear
groups in Victoria. That poll recorded a
9.3 percent first preference vote for an
anti-nuclear party, with 19.3 percent of
those polled saying that they would
definitely or probably vote for an anti-
nuclear party. The October poll, how-
ever, shows that a number of voters plan
to stick by the Democrats who also
have an anti-nuclear platform rather
than support a single issue-party.
The earlier poll was undertaken over
two weekends in September before
the announcement that rock group
Midnight Oil’s lead singer Peter Garrett
and former ALP senator Jean Melzer
would be leading the new party’s Senate
tickets in NSW and Victoria,
respectively.
Since the poll showed that an anti-
nuclear party would be particularly
popular with young people (18 to 25
years) and women, this choice of can-
didates could boost the party’s chances.
The Labor Party and the Democrats
view the poll as over-estimating the
NDP’s chances, with each believing that
the new factor will boost their own vote
the ALP claiming that the NDP will
take votes away from the Democrats
and the Democrats arguing that the
anti-nuclear party will strengthen its
vote following an informal deal be-
tween them on preferences.
Despite the record of failure of single-
issue parties in Australia, Labor is
sufficiently concerned about the NDP to
list it as a proscribed organisation
(alongside the National Civic Council)
and to threaten with expulsion any ALP
members assisting it.
Melzer equated this with using an
axe to kill an ant but no one was
worrying about it, she said.
The ALP has taken no action yet
against one of its members, John
Conway, who is heading the NDP’s
Senate ticket in the Australian Capital
Territory. In the meantime, the new
party is claiming both ALP and
Democrat “defectors” in its rank.
The Democrats have taken another
tack, doubting the benefits of single-
issue members to the federal parlia-
ment. “How would the Nuclear Dis-
armament Party vote on social security
and economic issues?” asked NSW
Democrat senator Colin Mason last
week. Mason says that the Democrats’
role as public watchdog, “keeping the
bastards honest,” is a more important
factor than anti-nuclear policy in
people’s reasons for voting Democrat.
Australian Democrat research had
shown up the nuclear question as an
important issue for this election, Mason
said, but not as important as the
Franklin dam issue had been to the
outcome of the poll in March last year.
The Nuclear Disarmament Party was
formed in Canberra on June 17 in
response to what its members believe is
an alarmingly pro-nuclear stand by
Prime Minister Bob Hawke and much
of his government. “We believed in the
Labor Party and we were betrayed,”
said party founder Dr Michael
Denborough, a medical researcher at
the Australian National University and
a veteran anti-nuclear activist.
The party has attracted thousands
(no one is quite sure how many) of
members and supporters from
throughout Australia, including present
and past luminaries such as authors
Patrick White and Judith Wright, histor-

on the party’s NSW Senate ticket),

Representatives Ted St John, Sydney
City alderman Jack Mundey, former
Whitlam treasurer Jim Cairns and Janet
Holmes a Court.
A lack of funds means that the
party’s campaign is essentially at the
grass roots level. It is printing leaflets
and giving plenty of interviews but is
unlikely to run to television or
newspaper advertising unless it strikes a
major donor.
The NDP’s platform contains three
points: To close all United States
military bases in Australia; to prohibit
the stationing of nuclear weapons in
Australia or their passage through
Australian waters or airspace; and to
terminate immediately all mining and
export of Australian uranium, including
repudiation of all commitments made
by former governments.
Denborough points out that, al-
though the party is single-issue, its
platform has ramifications for many
other areas of government policy
including defence, foreign affairs,
employment and economics.
The party is in the process of
developing associated policies, for in-
stance a demand that schools have
peace studies and another that uranium
miners be compensated. Candidates
have said that they will vote only on
nuclear issues if elected.
Denborough says that the party is
anti-nuclear but not anti-American. He
speaks about the nuclear dilemma with
religious fervor: “We are talking about
the world’s survival. We want to make
this the dominant issue in the parlia-
ment. There will be no point to other
policies, like Medicare, if we don’t solve
this problem. The ballot box is the only
language Mr Hawke understands,”
Denborough told The Bulletin.
He was in the front line of the
campaign in the early 1970 s to end
French atmospheric nuclear weapons
testing in the Pacific.
“When (Opposition leader) Andrew
Peacock says the most important issues
in this election are the assets test, death
duties and superannuation, I think he
must be mad. And, when the coalition
says they want nuclear submarines, I
think they must be completely out of
their minds,” Denborough said.
He is critical of the Democrats’
nuclear policy of retaining the disarma-
ment and arms control functions of the
US military bases here, under
Australian supervision, as “unsatisfac-
tory to many who want a firm commit-
ment. The (Democrats) party is still
perceived as being composed partly of
ex-Liberals who are either opposed or
indifferent to the party’s anti-nuclear
position.”
Melzer is rather more down-to-earth
about the issue: “We don’t see any point
in throwing out the ALP. We want to
administer a reproof to them for
moving away from the principles and
policies on which the government was
elected.”
Rather than staying inside the party
to fight it out, Melzer decided to resign
and join the NDP when the ALP’s
national executive voted to allow re-
affiliation of three right-wing unions in
Victoria. Melzer said this would have
wrought a change in voting at party
conferences to make almost impossible
retaining the state branch’s tough anti-
uranium policy.
Rock music star Garrett (he is also a
lawyer) has hit the trail for a national
concert tour to promote a new album.
Campaigning will be done along the
way. He took time off the tour last week
to attend a national strategy meeting at
Denborough’s Canberra residence.
Lacking resources for a sophisticated
campaign, the NDP is relying on its
natural appeal to women and younger
voters. Its Senate candidate in Western
Australia is Jo Vallentine, a Quaker and
full-time peace activist. The presence of
the North West Cape base in the state
means that voters are well aware of the
issues involved, she says. Other Senate
candidates for the NDP include Dr
Giorgio Venturini, Law lecturer and
author of Partners in Ecocide (Victoria)
and Dr Jan Barret, a Canberra
pathologist (ACT).
The party also is standing candidates
in a few House of Representatives seats.
It has decided so far to stand against
Ros Kelly in the safe Labor seat of
Canberra, against Jim Snow (ALP) in
marginal Eden-Monaro, in the new seat
of Gilmore in NSW and the Victorian
seat of Gippsland against National
Party MP Peter McGauran. Seats have
been chosen according to local
resources and sitting members’ voting
records on the uranium issue.
Other recent research shows that the
NDP has set itself a tough task. A
Morgan Gallup Poll published in The
Bulletin last January found that 66
percent of Australians favored the
mining and export of uranium despite
the concerns of 62 percent of those
polled about the problems of nuclear
waste and/or the potential for
Australian uranium to help make
nuclear weapons.
Separate research by the ALP
recently showed that voters asked to
state the one issue which most affected
them personally put bread and butter
issues such as the cost of living and
taxes well above disarmament.

THE BRIAN HARRADINE GROUP
The growing Moral Minority
TASMANIA’S Senator Brian Harra-
dine is more than federal parliament’s
only independent member and more
than just a well-known father and step-
father: He is one of Australia’s potent
political forces and a voice in Canberra
for the nation’s unfashionable and
neglected Moral Minority.
On their behalf and in the tradition
of conservative trade unionism to which
he adheres, he exercised the balance of
power in the Senate during Malcolm
Fraser’s last term as prime minister.
From time to time, with jolting effect,
Harradine decided the issue during Bob
Hawke’s first term. Now a colleague,
Mrs Kath Venn, has good prospects of
being elected to the Senate as
a member of the “Brian
Harradine group.”
Harradine has turned the
Labor party on its ear more
than once. His feud with Jus-
tice Lionel Murphy is so long-
standing and deep-seated that
Harradine disqualified him-
self from voting on the Senate
motion to set up the Murphy
committee of inquiry.
The passions he arouses in
the Australian Labor Party
are legendary. Gough
Whitlam once resigned as the
parliamentary leader in a ges-
ture of support for Harradine
and only just scraped back
in the subsequent vote.
Harradine is a solitary but
respected figure in the Senate
where his power as a debater
and his incisive mind make
him one of the chamber’s
most capable parliamen-
tarians. He was born into a
Catholic, ALP and trade
union family in South Austra-
lia and went to Tasmania in
1959 to be an official of the
Federated Clerks Union.
He was part of the Catholic
reaction during the years after
the end of World War II to
the power in the trade unions
of the Communist Party and
its influence in the ALP.
He set up the Shop Assist-
ants Union in Tasmania,
fending off a bid by the Mis-
cellaneous Workers Union to
capture its membership.
Murphy, QC, represented the
Miscellaneous Workers
Union at the Arbitration
Commission hearings which Harradine
won. The fight began in earnest when
Harradine became secretary of the Tas-
mania Trades and Labor Council. The
left had three states. With Tasmania it
would have had four and thus control of
the Australian Council of Trade
Unions, to which Harradine was a del-
egate.
The left began a campaign to push
him out of the party. In 1968, he was
elected as Tasmania’s delegate to the
federal executive of the ALP which that
year was to meet in Melbourne. During
the controversy within the party over his
election, he forecast that “friends of the
communists” would try to prevent him
Tipping the balance in the Senate
taking his place. The executive decided
by a majority vote that because of those
remarks he was not a fit and proper per-
son to be on the executive his proph-
ecy thus fulfilling itself.
Murphy was one of those who voted
against accrediting Harradine. Hawke
voted for him. Whitlam felt so strongly
that he resigned as party leader in a ges-
ture of support. He won the subsequent
party room ballot from Jim Cairns by
only 38 votes to 32.
The next year, Harradine was
refused accreditation to the ALP’s bien-
nial conference. He remained secretary
of the Trades and Labor Council until
he was expelled from the ALP in 1975,
when he got himself elected to
the Senate as an independent.
One of his supporters suc-
ceeded him as council secre-
tary and was followed by yet
another supporter, Paul
Lennon. Lennon was expelled
from the Tasmanian state
council of the ALP last week
because he refused formally
to repudiate Harradine whom
he had backed at the 1983 fed-
eral elections.
Venn also was a public
supporter in 1983. She had
been ALP queen of the year in
Tasmania in 1949 when a
typist at state headquarters.
She was party secretary from
1969 to 1976 and a member of
state parliament until 1982.
She was formally repri-
manded by the party, quit and
is standing for the Senate.
Harradine is a great be-
liever in the importance of or-
ganisation but he works on a
set of moral and social values
which guide his actions. His
place in the parliament and
Venn’s bright prospects of
joining him there are testi-
mony to the hardheaded way
in which he operates on those
principles. He has little cam-
paign money. The Australian
Broadcasting Corporation in
Tasmania is giving him only
five minutes of free television
time, against 20 minutes for
the Democrats, although he
outpolls them four to one.
He believes that his organ-
isation is at least as efficient in
Tasmania as that of the ALP
or the Liberals. When Special


Senator Peter Walsh: arch-antagonist gone quiet
Minister of State Mick Young produced
his electoral changes with their pro-
vision for bloc voting in the Senate as
an optional alternative to filling out the
complicated Senate ballot paper,
Harradine immediately saw the danger
to the position of independents. He reg-
istered the Brian Harradine Group as a
party. Venn is the result.
Harradine’s moral values have him
intervening strongly on a range of
issues, some of which are not taken up
by the parties. He makes parliament
confront social questions which it might
otherwise allow to slide past. He
secured from Fraser an increase in fam-
ily allowances and takes pride in having
played the deciding role in the Senate in
blocking the Fraser government legisla-
tion to change the industrial relations
system, which Harradine viewed as dis-
ruptive.
He was wary of the retrospective tax
legislation introduced by both the
Fraser and the Hawke governments. He
helped moderate the Fraser legislation
and played a deciding role in stopping
the Hawke government’s legislation
which would have imposed new taxes
retrospectively.
Speaking a few days ago on youth
unemployment, he saw part of the prob-
lem as being public service recruiting
policy and part in the “hundreds of
thousands of mothers” forced to work
by economic circumstances. Not for
Harradine the John Stone argument
that more work would become available
for young people if junior wages were to
be introduced.
Harradine criticised the appointment
of Wendy McCarthy as deputy chair-
man of the ABC, calling it a victory for
radical feminists, the Women’s Elec-
toral Lobby and the pro-abortion lobby.
He took a role in amending the Hu-
man Rights Commission Act and the
Sex Discrimination Act and a leading
part in setting up the Senate committee
to inquire into the pornographic
videotape industry.
He raised in parliament the decision
of the ABC to treat homosexual part-
ners as spouses for the purposes of
posting and relocation expenses and in-
troduced a private member’s bill to re-
verse a government decision to allow
members of parliament to take unmar-
ried partners with them on taxpayer-
financed overseas travel. Of the decision
to permit this, he said: “It publicly de-
means the institution of marriage,
strikes at legislative recognition and
flies in the face of the responsibility of
parliamentarians to give an example in
matters of principle underpinning the
laws which pass through parliament.”
Nobody else in parliament really talks
like that nowadays, although members
share his views and are pleased that he
is there to put them.
Still, they would not necessarily wel-
come a situation in which Senate num-
bers were so evenly divided that the
Brian Harradine Group could call the
shots.
Harradine was widowed four years
ago. For a few days, during one session
of parliament, he slept in his office so
that his six children could telephone
him easily.
Journalists were fed a story that he
was trying to save himself money and he
received harassing telephone calls, one
of which was traced to the flat in Can-
berra of a staff officer of the West Aus-
tralian ALP Senator Peter Walsh, now
minister for Resources and Energy. A
senate privileges committee was told
there was a lively party going on in the
flat at the time the call was made. Walsh
was the ALP mud-slinger in the Senate,
and Harradine was a frequent target of
his invective. Lately Walsh has gone
quiet, apparently having been reined in
after some muck boomeranged.
Harradine has not been attacked
much since by either side. He has a piv-
otal postition but the respect for him of
his fellow senators goes beyond mere
political discretion. Harradine is ortho-
dox Labor in industrial matters, as a
legacy of his days in the trade union
movement. His philosophical well-
springs are Christian morality and the
institution of the family where he is a
self-evident authority.
He decided to confine the Harradine
Group to Tasmania. He does not see
himself or his supporters as political
successors to the Democratic Labor
Party, the predominantly Catholic
right-wing splinter group which formed
at the split in the ALP in the mid-50s. In
his eyes, the DLP existed to keep the
ALP out of office and that is by no
means Harradine’s position. The Shop
Assistants Union did not affiliate with
the DLP and it gave money to the ALP
for the 1983 elections. His friends, he
notes, are in the ALP. Nevertheless, the
enemies in the ALP of the DLP, of the
industrial groups and of Bob
Santamaria’s National Civic Council
were and are Harradine’s enemies.
Harradine is slightly built and sharp-
featured with fair hair turning grey.
Cartoonists portraying men with large
families often make them look a little
like Harradine. When he remarried, it
was to the widow of a friend with seven
children of her own
It is not hard to detect beneath his
courtesy a sense of moral purpose and
the steely will that have carried him
through 25 years of controversy.
He is familiar with the thesis of
Arnold Toynbee that history can be told
in terms of responses to challenging
events. Harradine does not like being
pushed around, any more than
Toynbee’s survivor nations. The senator
knows what he stands for and he knows
where he is going.

The problem with most desktop computers
is simply that.
They’re desk bound.
And the trouble with most transportable
computers is, apart from being under-powered,
they look more at home in the boot of your car
than on your desk.
Now fortunately, a computer has been
designed to fit neatly between the two.
The Apricot.
In a nutshell, it’s a 16-bit desktop computer
that folds into a briefcase.
So it can take home work when you do.
While at the office, it competes on equal
footing with the desktop heavies.
Unbelievably, it's more powerful than the
equivalent IBM PC.
It also incorporates a few practical advances
in computer technology that no other desktop has
caught up with.
For example, a Microscreen on the keyboard
which operates as a calculator, digital calendar,
time display and as a window on the mam screen.
What’s more, the Apricot comes ready to go.
From $4444 with sales tax and $ 1000 worth of software included in the price. And the software includes Supercalc,


erful desk top computers can do.
v V -A
, * ll l
And one thing they can t
It already has its own business software.
(In fact, over $lOOO worth of it is included
in the purchase price*)
But as well as that, the Apricot is readily
compatible with the computers that boast the
most software in the business, the Sinus and
the IBM PC.
So there you have it.
A computer that does anything any other
desktop computer can do.
And you don't have to hire a removal van
to take it home.

MOTORING
How Karl Benz
overlooked
the image factor
By PETER WHERRETT
ONE HAS to wonder, 100 years on,
exactly what was going on in the mind
of Karl Benz when he spent so much
time perfecting what is generally ac-
cepted as the world’s first automobile. If
he was so determined to replace the
horse, could he have imagined what he
might ultimately have created to take its
place?
One thing seems certain: He wanted
a compact and reliable means of per-
sonal transport and one not subject to
the whims of an animal, nor requiring
daily harnessing and which was com-
paratively pollutant-free. Benz might
have defined his automobile as a per-
sonal people carrier providing total
flexibility as to time of travel and
chosen route also comfortable, reli-
able, economical and safe.
It is sometimes difficult to see where
he achieved all those things.
Today’s automobile is comfortable.
But economical, reliable and durable?
Thousands of people might query that.
And safe? much less so now than in
1886.
Our love affair with the automobile
continues and at such lengths that we
can buy Mr Benz’s progeny for any-
thing from around $7500 to $225,000.
And, yet, are we not still buying just a
means of transport? It seems not; other-
wise, how could there be such a price
tag variation?
Except for size, what is the difference
between the Daihatsu Charade and the
Rolls-Royce Camargue? Each will carry
four adults in reasonable comfort on an
across-town visit to friends or an across-
the-country holiday excursion. The
Daihatsu is much more likely to do the
across-country trip than is the Rolls,
which seems to be restricted to daily
trips to and from the office.
The Daihatsu will do all that the
Rolls will do and much more economi-
cally less fuel used, lower mainten-
ance costs, cheaper parts. Properly
cared for, the Daihatsu will last say 10
years. The Rolls supposedly has an in-
definite life, but to the benefit of whom?
The first owner probably will be on his
second Rolls when the Daihatsu ex-
pires, so he or she is not terribly interest-
ed in what happens to it after that.
At the end of its life, the Daihatsu is
probably worth nothing: $7500 written
off over 10 years. The top-of-the-line
Rolls probably will be worth some-
where between $90,000 and $llO,OOO at
today’s dollar value. That’s $115,000
written off over 10 years. Surely that
money could have been earning more
money if invested in appreciating col-
lectables.
On a lesser scale, one can buy a
Porsche for $70,000 or a Mitsubishi
Turbo Cordia for $14,000. Both are
sports coupes. Both are fast (the Porsche
undeniably faster but who can use 280
km/h, anyway?). Both accelerate brisk-
ly from a standing start; too fast for
most drivers. The Cordia is cheaper to
run and more forgiving to drive, speci-
ally since it will not turn vicious if mis-
handled.
The first car and the new Mercedes-Benz 190
RETO HUGIN/CAMERA PRESS
Looked after properly, the Cordia
probably has a life of about 15 years. By
then, it is likely to be third-hand. The
Porsche probably has a life of 30 years,
given the same care. By then, it might be
fifth-hand. In neither case does the orig-
inal owner usually care two hoots what
happens once the car moves on.
In the family car market, one can
buy a fully-optional Ford Fairlane for
$25,000 or a Mercedes Benz 380 SE for
$70,000. In each case, the owners will
want to change cars at the end of about
three years. In that time, they will have
driven about 40,000 km.
The Ford will have been in for a war-
ranty repair job three times and the
Mercedes once. Both will use some-
where near the same amount of fuel and
a set of tyres which will cost the same
money.
Any parts required for the Benz will
be more expensive than equivalent parts
for the Ford. The Ford will trade in at
about $lO,OOO and the Mercedes at
about $30,000. The Ford will have de-
preciated by $15,000, the Benz by
$40,000.
So, what are people buying when
they spend up big on automobiles?
Much more than any mechanical ad-
vantages or product quality or longevity
of operation or resale value, image is
what people buy when they invest more
than $20,000. And, perhaps, excitement
and pride of ownership.
But it might be even more exciting
and certainly a better investment to own
an original Pro Hart or Dobell. The
reason why the painting often does not
get a look in is that it cannot be seen in
public; it is not a visual manifestation of
success.
Most people who buy such cars will
never admit that they do so
for image: They honestly be-
lieve that they have bought a
better car.
And, although today’s
Rolls is not your average pro-
duction line automobile, it re-
mains cumbersome, inefficient
and an absolute classic con-
sumer of valuable natural re-
sources (its saving grace is
that they sell so few).
It is normal to have aspira-
tions of grandeur ... a bigger
house, a better view, more up-
market furniture. This is why
we work and strive, in most
cases.
Ask the man who drives a
Commodore / Falcon / Sigma
and you can bet that he
aspires to a Mercedes or a
Porsche, maybe even to a
Volvo or a Rover.
But he would not necessar-
ily be getting a better car
just a better image. □

DRIVE A LEGEND.
The legend began in 1885.
With two brothers and a
bicycle.
By |lB9l, the brothers
Peugeot had turned the bicycle
into the first motor car ever sold
A Peugeot won the very
first car race. Paris to Rouen.
And ever since Peugeots
have won a reputation that’s
legend.
At Le Mans and
Indianapolis. And rallies from
Redex to the East African
Safari.
This latest Peugeot is the
STI. And the legend lives.
The STI will do 0-100 in
just 10.5 seconds. (It’s fuel
injected.)
It takes corners as if on
rails. (Its tyres are MichelinTßX
on alloy rims.)
And it looks like it’s flying
even when it's standing still.
(Pininfarina styled it.)
Yet it has all the manners
that make Peugeot drivers take
the long way home.
Power steering. Fully
independent suspension.
And seats rated the most
comfortable in the world.
The air conditioning has
a split cycle to keep your face
cool but your feet warm.
The Pioneer FM/AM
stereo radio/cassette is
standard.
So is the central locking
system. And the hydraulically
adjustable headlights. And the
electrically operated front
windows.
No wonder the STI has
become something of a legend
in just a few months.

KATHARINE WHITEHORN
The vexed question of a lark in the dark
ANYONE who doubts the power of
words ought to consider what the prin-
cipal euphemism for love-making has
done to insomnia. If you don’t sleep in
the same bed as your wife, you’re pre-
sumed not to “sleep with” her any more.
Couples all over the country are groan-
ing, snorting, gazing into the night with
a blank despair and occasionally in-
dulging in a sly vindictive kick.
Do you remember when that man
broke into Buckingham Palace and sat
on the Queen’s bed for 10 minutes be-
fore the security noticed? There was a
ripple of wonder: where, everyone
asked, was Prince Philip? Nobody
seemed to remember that the rich al-
ways had enjoyed separate bedrooms.
While the poor slept in heaps because
they had to.
There was even a murmur when it
came out that Prime Minister Margaret
is apparently able to go to bed after a
late night meeting without necessarily
climbing over Denis.
In Jewel In The Crown, the dreaded
Merrick was shown to have a different
bedroom from Susan though, con-
sidering what he was getting up to in it,
I don’t suppose the revelation did the
cause of separate sleeping much good.
For it is sleep that suffers from this
convention that “separate beds makes
separate rooms makes separate lives.”
When people first marry, there are
usually outside pressures which con-
train them to certain patterns: owl and
lark alike rise to the demands of the
early train, the six o’clock feed, the
school bus. But, the older the lark gets,
the earlier he wakes. And, the less neces-
sary it is to be up by seven, the more the
owl indulges her wish to stay up half the
night talking to her daughters.
People who have trouble sleeping
often come to feel that the only long-
term solution is acceptance: there has to
be an end to the tossing and turning and
worrying about tomorrow and going to
the doctor for more sleeping pills. They
finally realise that, if your body doesn’t
want you to be asleep, you’re far better
off up making a cup of tea, listening
to the radio or stamping around to get
the cramp out of your feet, anything but
just lying there. But you don’t do it, half
the time, for fear of waking your mate.
Of course, there may be no alterna-
tive to the marital four-poster; quite
often, though, there is once the children
have left home.
It can be a spare room, into the cup-
boards and drawers of which the own-
er's clothes gradually seep until the
grown children find half a drawer and
two coat-hangers available for a week’s
stay.
It can be a wonderful mucky work-
shop or a dumping ground for suitcases
and dahlia tubers; it can contain a ten-
ant or a model railway or someone’s
late flowering in the art of watercolor.
But it could become a boudoir or a den.
I once stayed in a house in the
Philippines where each member of a
large and intrusive family stayed sane
by retreating into what was, in effect, an
agreeable sitting-room with a bed in it.
The mistress of the house might well
find this a useful alternative to the mas-
ter bedroom, even if only while some-
one was having a fit of waking at five or
a head cold that seemed to go on all
winter or an especially awful bout of
snoring.
I know couples who have realised
that they’d get along better sleeping sep-
arately (as well as at least two who
haven’t copulated for years yet still dog-
gedly occupy the public-relations
double bed). And I also know several
who would do better if they did, even if
only temporarily. They don’t, though,
for fear that everyone would think that
they were splitting up sexually.
As Hermione Gingold says,
“Nothing propincs like propinquity,”
but I’d have thought that, the more
colorful your sex life, the less it de-
pended on lying between the sheets
when the clock began to chime.
Especially, it seems, their children
think it’s dreadful. And, with all the div-
orce about, these parents can under-
stand their offspring’s disquiet.
We all have a block about the sexual-
ity of our parents: we’d rather stay with
the infantile conviction that they played
Mummies and Daddies just to Make
Babies. We can just about bring the
thought to the bedroom door and leave
it there. But if they inhabit separate
rooms and it’s not the beginning of the
end, why, then, we actually have to en-
visage their seeking each other out
terrible. But not so terrible, perhaps, as
all those Mummies and Daddies staring
bleakly into the darkness to avoid
upsetting their young.
It’s high time someone began to pro-
mote the second bedroom as a status
symbol. Then those who choose the
deep, deep peace of the chaise longue
after the hurly-burly of the double bed
could do so without constraint while
those who continued to sleep together
would have the added enjoyment of
knowing that they were embarrassing
their teenagers. □

On November 30,1809, during a private meeting
at the Tuileries Palace, Napoleon announced
to Josephine his intention to divorce her.
As she fainted into the waiting arms of
Bousset, the palace prefect, the lady
whispered, “But I gave him everything”.
Sadly, she had not been able to give him Lindt,
one of the world’s finest chocolates.
Manufactured in Switzerland since 1845, Lindt
chocolates have become synonymous with gift
giving whenever it’s important to make a truly
lasting impression.
Happily the Lindt range of bars, chocolettis and
assortments is now available in Australia from all fine
chocolate shops.
One of the finest chocolates in the world.

How health foods are changing
the shape of the supermarket
Ray Newell: “People will not sacrifice taste for good health”
JOHN ELLIOTT
Rosemary Stanton: profits can be made out of nutrition
Health foods, which many saw as an aberration, have established new beachheads
in the big stores. MICHAEL MEAGHER reports on the ways in which both
manufacturers and consumers are reacting to a strong, continuing trend.
KRAFT FOODS has done the unthink-
able. In a gradual and subtle manoeuvre
over the past two years, the major food
group has changed the formula of
Vegemite. Slowly, so as not to rock a
boat full of millions of loyal customers,
Kraft has been reducing the salt level in
the perennial spread.
In similar vein, Nabisco is employ-
ing Spike Milligan in commercials on
national television to open his overcoat
in flasher fashion to reveal a variety of
Planters nuts which “have 50 percent
less salt.” Low sodium is voted the nu-
tritional flavor of the month by all food
processors and, by most, as a permanent
fixture on supermarket shelves.
Declining salt levels are being ac-
companied by an increasing number of
labels claiming reductions in fat and
sugar levels. New products are appear-
ing as manufacturers are being made to
re-think their food recipes. Health
guidelines which encourage consump-
tion of starch and dietary fibre
wholegrain cereals, vegetables and fruit
and discourage over-consumption of
alcohol, fat, salt and refined sugar are
the catalysts of a growing consumer nu-
tritional awareness.


Coleman’s Louise Hegarty and Ron Della Vedova: concentrating on products with no preservatives, no coloring or artificial additives
Wholemeal bread 10 years ago was
largely the domain of the small manu-
facturer who baked it for health food
stores patronised by customers whom
the general public thought had hang-
ups about their diet. Now, the large
bread companies are finding wholegrain
breads a money-spinner. Rosemary
Stanton, a consultant nutritionist who
has worked for companies including
Tip Top Bakeries, Weight Watchers
Foods and the Dairy Promotion Coun-
cil of NSW, says that the attitude of the
food industry to nutrition and health
has changed over the past 12 months.
She says: “The food processors were
hoping that the food ‘nuts’ nutrition-
ists like me would go away. They are
now seeing that there may be profits to
be made out of nutrition.” Similar
thoughts are aired by Jo Rogers who
chairs the Australian Nutrition Founda-
tion and has been a constant advocate
of the balanced diet. Rogers believes
that “nutrition really is a marketable
commodity now.”
Australia’s largest food retailers, G.
J. Coles Ltd and Woolworths Ltd,
whose combined sales from supermar-
ket and other activities are more than $7
billion a year more than half of which
is food turnover are setting about giv-
ing the more health-conscious buyers
what they want.
Fresh from a three-month study tour
of United States supermarkets, a
pepped-up deputy general manager,
food marketing, for Woolworths super-
markets, Reg Clairs, says the biggest
trend in American food retailing is the
supply of an increasing array of health-
orientated products. They are being
sold under the banner of a health food
centre within the supermarket.
Woolworths has taken the lead and has
just set up the first of its Natural Food
Centres to be placed, strategically next
to the fruit and vegetable section. “Fruit
’n’ veg” is becoming a big profit centre
for the retail chains.
The health centres which Coles
also is incorporating in some new super-
markets feature rows of clear plastic
hoppers full of nuts, dried fruits, lentils
and other produce. Customers are asked
to serve themselves in a system that
takes food retailing back 20 years or
more to the days of bulk stores.
The first chain to introduce the
health centre idea was the Safeways
group which has even gone as far as
launching SNAP the Safeways Nutri-
tional Awareness Program.
Since buying into the small health
food company Naytura in 1981,
Safeways has installed health food
centres in 60 of its 84 stores nationally.
Woolworths’ Clairs does not expect
the supermarkets to diminish the trade
of Australia’s 1300-odd health food
stores, most of which are independent.
He says: “What we will be doing is ex-
posing many of our customers to health
food-type products for the first time.”
Keith Ready, a consultant to the
health food industry, says the health
food store will become more sophisti-
cated in the lines it sells with products
such as cold-pressed oils, unprocessed
foods, fruit-derived confectionary, nat-
ural beauty care products and vitamins
and supplements. Ready says: “The in-
dustry appears to be heading toward a
mix of natural foods and, when in-

White Wings’ Ken Marshall: wheat is going great guns
adequacies or difficulties in a diet ap-
pear, supplementary vitamins and
minerals and herbal products.”
The processed food manufacturer is
facing new challenges with the dietary
trends. Ray Newell, market researcher
with advertising agency SSC&B Lintas
says: “People will not sacrifice taste for
good health. The spoiled Dr Spock gen-
eration have eaten well for a long time
and are not willing to punish themselves
on food because it is nutritional.” In a
major study on attitudes to food, Lintas
found that the main two attributes con-
sumers want in their food are -conveni-
ence and a desire for health. If a manu-
facturer can satisfy both, says Newell,
he has hit the jackpot. The best example
is yoghurt. Since 1976, it has grown
from a S2O-million to around a $65-mil-
lion market.
Manufacturers are vending foods
that promise to let consumers have their
healthy cake and eat it too. Colmans,
the food arm of diversified consumer
group Reckitt & Colman, two months
ago released anew line of products
under the Elmers Farm brand dubbed
by marketing manager Louise Heggarty
the “indulgent product for the health-
conscious consumer.” Under Elmers are
spreads such as chocolate hazelnut and
apple and lemon butter as well as lemon
and lime juices designed to be used as
alternatives for salt. Colmans has made
the products “natural” by formulas that
it says have no artificial flavorings or
colorings, no added salt and which re-
place sugar as sucrose with glucose.
Like most manufacturers, Colmans is
concerned about supplying products
perceived as being natural.
Colmans’ food technician Ron Della
Vedova says that, over the “past 18
months to two years, there has been a
specific request for products with no
preservatives, no coloring or artificial
additives.” He says the company policy
is to eliminate monosodium glutomate,
a flavor enhancer to which some people
are allergic. MSG is still a common in-
gredient in much processed food inclu-
ding gravy mixes and packet soups.
Colmans says it also has “a long-
term philosophy” to eliminate the yel-
low coloring agent tartrazine from
products. Tartrazine can cause allergic
reactions among asthmatics. Della
Vedova points out that many of the pre-
servatives such as sulphur dioxide, pot-
assium sorbate and benzoate (benzoic
acid) cannot be replaced easily by nat-
ural ingredients and yet maintain shelf
life. He says: “Often, if you take the salt
out of the product, you tend to make it
taste sweeter so you have anew problem
on your hands.”
A company which has anticipated
nutritional trends has been White
Wings, a group known purely as a cake
mix and flour vendor up to five years
ago. The company then made a con-
scious decision to go into what market-
ing manager Ken Marshall describes as
“better-for-you foods” under the Na-
ture Valley brand. Two experimental
cake mixes, sultana buttercake and car-
rot, were launched. The sultana mix is
now the company’s most successful
brand, followed by the traditional choc-
olate and vanilla mixes. Carrot cake
runs a close fourth.
White Wings also is riding the trend
to fibre and grain. In a search for
healthier ranges, the company met up
with two Sydney food scientists,
brothers Dr David and Dr Victor Lewis.
They introduced White Wings to new
technology which allows wheat to be
boiled in a few minutes, rather than
hours. The Lewis’s have patented a pro-
cess whereby grain is carried on a con-
veyor belt band and slightly cracked be-
tween two rollers. The cracks let the
moisture into the grain on cooking.
After a 10-month test market oper-
ation, White Wings Wheat is being mar-
keted nationally as a grain which can be
used as frequently as rice. Says Mar-
shall: “We’re simply flogging wheat and
it’s doing great guns.”
Fibre and bran have moved from the
horse’s feedbag to commercial success.
The health-food-store-inspired muesli
market, which runs to around S2O mil-
lion retail nationally, is one example but
its growth is being outstripped by
wholemeal breads.
Rosemary Stanton has been working
with Tip Top Bakeries in Sydney over
the past two years in a project aimed at


inducing children to eat grain bread.
Stanton explains: “If you take kids who
have always eaten white bread and ask
them to eat a chunky piece of
wholemeal, they will say ‘No’.” So, in a
series of taste stepping-stones, Tip Top
first introduced children to white bread
with soybean husks for dietary fibre
under the brand Hyfibe; the husks then
were substituted with pieces of bran and
a third step saw the introduction of a
bread with rye and kibbled wheat,
called Multi-grain.
But salt reduction is the major trend
in food processing. It has produced low-
sodium varieties of butter, margarine,
cheeses, breads, biscuits and tomato
sauces.
Multinational Unilever Ltd, whose
brands include Streets, John West,
Rosella and Continental, reports that
the salt-reduced Continental packet
soups make up 20 percent of total pack-
et sales in some states.
Colmans recently departed from its
annual practice of “adding a little extra
salt” to its meal base Rice-A-Riso, by
cutting the product’s salt content in half.
Will Wendel, a quality control expert
from Amatil Ltd’s snack foods subsidi-
ary APD, says the company’s research
has shown a “very measurable switch in
the amount of salt people want in their
food.’ He says: “It is starting with baby
foods where most manufacturers
have no-added-salt lines.” APD has
reduced the level of salt in Smith’s pota-
to crisps from 2 to 1.5 percent over the
past year. Salt in the corn chip CCs is at
1.4 percent and Wendel says there is
thought of further reducing the salt in
the snack.
Kraft has reduced the salt content in
Vegemite from 11 to 8 percent and, ac-
cording to the company, that is as far as
it can go without having an effect on
shelf life. Concern about adverse reac-
tion from consumers used to the high
level of salt also could be a factor
against further salt reduction. Kraft is
selling Vegemite with 3 percent salt in
the United States.
Coles is enjoying a steady success
with a range of 10 products under the
Farmland brand which are either “low
in sodium” or have “no added salt.”
They include muesli, peanut butter and
a variety of tomato canned products.
Coles says it will extend the range. Ex-
pansion will not be straightforward for
Coles because of the effect of salt’s
omission on preservation and taste
qualities. Coles tells customers in a
special brochure that no potassium
chloride has been used yet as a salt sub-
stitute but it may be used, in which case
it would be declared as an ingredient.
Salt’s link with high blood pressure
and hypertension has received top
billing from the media and it looks set
to stay in the limelight. Preliminary re-

suits from the Canberra Blood Pressure
Trial being conducted in the suburb of
Woden show that a salt-free diet among
people who suffer from hypertension or
high blood pressure can reduce the need
for medication in some cases.
In the study, sponsored by the com-
monwealth Department of Health and
being watched with interest worldwide,
a team led by Dr Trevor Beard put 870
Canberra volunteers on a six-week salt-
free diet. (Salt could not be added to
food either by the processor or by the
volunteer.) Beard says that, of 176
people analysed so far, 26 of the 59
people who were defined as having a
high blood pressure and on medication
were able to leave off their pills by the
end of the experiment.
Even without the full report, the re-
sults of the trial have urged Beard to
propose a national trial involving 5000
people over five years to see if a salt-free
diet helps prevent hypertension from
developing.
Beard says: “We’ve proven that it’s
feasible to get people to do this on a
large scale.” Apart from volunteer co-
operation, the trial was aided by Coles
and a dozen local bakers who supplied
salt-free bread.
Pharmaceutical companies must be
watching the Woden trial apprehen-
sively. The most common drug used to
combat hypertension, the diuretic, was
the second-most-prescribed drug on the
National Health Scheme list last year. It
had nine million prescriptions. (Anal-
gesics topped the list at 13 million.)
Diuretics and other anti-hyperten-
sive drugs such as beta blockers add up
to a S7O-million market.
Food companies have not taken to
sugar reduction as avidly as to salt re-
duction. Stanton suggests cynically:
“There isn’t a strong pro-salt lobby as
there is in sugar.” Through CSR Ltd, the
sugar cane industry is strongly opposing
any anti-sugar comment or question-
able food labelling.
The sugar lobby is spending more
than $3 million a year nationally in a
sugar education program. The com-
mercials are to become progressively
more aggressive, making attacks on the
claims of artificial sweeteners and chal-
lenging what CSR’s marketing man-
ager, sugar products, Tony Thirlwell
calls “misconceptions” about sugar.
Representing the Queensland Sugar
Board, CSR is taking Ardmona Fruit
Products Co-operative Ltd to court over
claims Ardmona has made about Rippa
a softdrink launched this year.
Ardmona says that Rippa is based on
natural pear juice. CSR says that a “no
added sugar” tag on the drink is “mis-
leading and deceptive advertising.”
Ironically, Ardmona is one of CSR’s
largest sugar customers.
Special dietary lines aside, there has
been little sugar reduction in processed
products. Fruit juices have been one no-
table exception. Awareness of the high
sugar content and calorie intake in soft
drinks is ensuring that the Coca-Cola
Export Corporation’s Diet Coke one
of the most successful product launches
of last year is maintaining a share of
about 10 percent of the soft drink mar-
ket. But major soft drink manufacturers
plan no change in the sugar levels of
their standard products. On whether
Coca-Cola might contemplate a reduc-
tion of the 10.6 percent sugar level in the
standard can of Coke, a spokesman'sug-
gested that “they (consumers) obviously
like it the way it is. Why change it?”
By aligning themselves with the “nat-
ural” appeal of mineral water, con-
sumers have made it a spectacularly
successful market although its growth
has flattened out over the past year.
Mineral waters, consisting mainly of
bottles and cans flavored by fruit juice,
make up some 20 percent of the $1 bil-
lion annual sales of fizzy drinks. Much
of the flavored mineral water has the
same sugar make-up as other soft drinks
but drinkers perceive it as being more
natural.
Executive director of the Australian
Council of Soft Drink Manufacturers,
Tony Gentile, says the council’s mem-
bers do not make health claims on any
of their products. “They don’t market
any of their drinks as being nutrition-
ally better than other products; they just
show people there are a range of drinks
available.”
But some processed food companies
are slowly reducing sugar levels.
Colmans boasts of reducing the
sugar level in its range of Big Sister self-
saucing puddings after feedback from
staff tasters said the brand was too
sweet.
The Seventh Day Adventist church’s
Sanitarium Health Food Company has
quietly changed the sugar content of its
Weet-Bix, the breakfast cereal market
leader estimated at around S2OO million
a year. Sanitarium has not blown its
trumpet about reducing the salt level
from 1 to .75 percent and the level of

Co Design


The orchestration of an efficient office is a matter of finesse and must be in tune
with the Australian business environment. That which performs overseas may
not be popular in Australia, as tastes in colour, materials and inter-personal space
requirements are vastly different.
The result must be harmony, like the sounds of a well-rehearsed symphony
orchestra, rather than the clash of an impromptu steel band.
A polished performance requires the assembly of the most talented performers
in their respective fields.
This is the heritage of CoDesign; a combination of design skills, experience and
aggressive enthusiasm.
The composition of CoDesign is the result of the amalgamation, in 1983, of
Co-Ordinated Design & Supply Pty. Ltd. of Sydney,
a company with diverse products and a proven, long-
established record for design and manufacture of
office chairs, desks, filing systems and specialist
furniture such as the Sydney Opera House seating;
Fricker Furniture of Adelaide, the highly success-
ful newcomer introducing Australian design to
systems furniture; Featherston Interiors of
Melbourne, a recognised name in the industry
for over 25 years; and Robmac, manufacturers of
premier quality reception and conversation
furniture.
The result is music to the business ear.
CoDesign’s repertoire includes:
world famous Wilkhahn chairs; Fulcrum
computer desks, Moduflex filing cabinets,
work stations and library furniture;
Unomanic chairs; reception furniture, lounges,
occasional tables and conversation settings;
System 1 and System 2 work station furniture,
screens and partitions; Rondo chairs and tables;
Maestro and the Series 50 chair ranges; Ambi
and executive desks and boardroom tables.
CoDesign has performed for many of
Australia’s major companies including A.G.C.,
Coles, Commonwealth Bank, C.E. Heath,
1.8. M., 1.C.L., C.R.A., Myer, Phoenix
Insurance, Qantas, Santos, Shell and Volvo
and is a major supplier to Government
Departments.
If you would like to know the full score,
contact CoDesign for a personal performance.


The correct seating is vital for the performance of any
individual. Each chair must suit the performer, their
part and the venue.
In the final analysis it is the quality of these individual
performances which contribute to an organisation’s
overall success.
Logically, the chair should take a supporting role,
m
rather than have valued performers, and their parts, forced into unsuitable,
uncomfortable chairs.
Unomanic chairs are precisely tuned to the needs of the individual. Designed to
perform a wide variety of ergonomic functions, Unomatic chairs offer a string of
features including a single lever which adjusts back rest height, angle and seat
elevation. Back rest and seat cushions are designed for maximum support and
comfort, setting standards in ergonomic design.
Through this simple versatility and ease of movement, Unomanic chairs will gain
unanimous applause.

Fulcrum Desk
A computer is possibly the most expensive
instrument in any office. To make it pay, the
computer must be in constant use by a variety
of people who are collectively even more costly.
Virtuoso performance depends upon the
operator at the keyboard. To produce the best
the individual must be comfortable and
therefore able to provide full concentration.
The Fulcrum desk enables each operator to
set desk and keyboard height at the touch of
a finger and the turn of a dial. In a duet with
a Unomanic chair, a computer terminal
produces the performance of an impresario
rather than becoming an instrument of torture.


The best performances occur in the right venue, those with style and the
flexibility to cope with the entire business repertoire.
CoDesign’s office systems create a perfect environment for polished
performances with the correct working arrangements for every section
of the company.
CoDesign System 1 was Australia’s first complete composition ot
systems furniture incorporating acoustic panels with the warmth ot
natural timber worktops, suspended storage systems and mobile _
credenzas. System 1 is supported by a comprehensive range of chairs,
tables, conference and reception furniture.
System 1 has set the tone for work station furniture throughout
Australia’s major companies.

CoDesign System 2 is in time with the computer
age. Arranged with acoustic panels which
incorporate concealed ducting for electrical and
communication cables, System 2 enables the office
to change as rapidly as the world of computing.
Adjustable work surfaces enable keyboards to be
set to the precise height and angle to suit the
individual. Consisting of suspended
storage cabinets with tambour doors
and task light illumination, mobile
storage units and either Unomanic
or Wilkhahn chairs, System 2
ensures that the office environment
is as up-to-date as the latest
computer technology and able to
keep pace throughout the future.


The symbol of a
company is its boardroom
—the reflection of its image, one that
supports rather than clashes with the
objectives of the organisation. The
furnishings must also be conducive to
productive decision-making from the
company’s key players.
For those in the seat of power,
CoDesign’s boardroom tables and
Wilkhahn chairs set the tone from
board meeting to client’s lunch.
While the use of the symphony orchestra is a light hearted approach to a serious
subject, however it focuses attention on the all important individual whom
furniture is for. It highlights the prime object—human performance.
Thus the symphony orchestra symbolises the requirements of any modem
business: a large number of people with differing skills and abilities working
towards a common goal with results dependent upon collective performance.
In business, poor human performance and team co-ordination may be less
obvious but the result is no less disconcerting than a poorly rehearsed orchestra.

The information contained in this brochure is correct at the time of publication, however details and specifications may change without


added sugar in form of sugar cane or
sucrose, from 2.4 to 1.2 percent. One of
Sanitarium’s food research team, Keith
Lindbeck, says: “Changes have to be
evolutionary, rather than dramatic.
They have to be -below the threshold of
consumer detection.”
Sanitarium recently took competitor
Nabisco to task over advertisements for
Nabisco’s Vita Brits which claimed sub-
stantially lower sugar content than
Weet-Bix. Vita Brits does not add any
cane sugar to its products and advertises
that with a bold yellow flash of “No
added Sugar” across the pack. Sani-
tarium argues that the malt that Vita
Brits adds to its cereal in larger
quantities than that in Weet-Bix is ac-
tually sugar in the form of maltose.
Sanitarium does not argue that overall
the sugar content in Vita Brits, of about
1.4 percent including natural sugars
in starch and other carboyhydrates is
lower than Weet-Bix’s level of around
2.4 percent.
There is much argument about the
definition of sugar. CSR’s education
campaign has taken pains to explain
that sugar comes in many other forms
than sucrose, such as fructose and glu-
cose in honey and glucose in fruit and
vegetables.
Kellogg (Australia) Ltd, which ac-
counts for more than half the breakfast
cereal sales rung up, has made no at-
tempts to lessen sugar levels in its 14
brands but says “the situation is always
under review.” This is a common com-
ment by food processors.
Kellogg’s Coco Pops, the fourth-
most-popular of the company’s cereals
(after Corn Flakes, Rice Bubbles and
Special K), contains no less than three
teaspoons of sugar to every 30 grams
a cupful of cereal. It is no fluke that
Ready Wheats and Puffed Wheat, the
Kellogg lines which have no added salt
or sugar, are the lowest sellers. They are
increasing in popularity, however, the
company says.
Low-fat products also are becoming
more common on supermarket shelves.
New South Wales dairy farmers hold
great hopes for the newly-launched low-
fat milk Shape which has only 0.2 per-
cent fat compared to wholemilk’s 3.8
percent.
Till now, the Dairy Promotion Coun-
cil of New South Wales has marketed a
reduced-fat milk, Hi Lo (2 percent fat),
and a less-than-palatable Skim milk (.14
percent). The council’s group promo-
tion manager, Richard de Voss, ex-
plains: “We saw a gap for a milk which
is low-fat but tastes OK and which
people will want to drink rather than
put in their tea or coffee.” Shape is a
skim milk boosted with concentrated
skim milk and has more protein than
standard milk and nearly 40 percent
more calcium than wholemilk.
Dairy products have suffered at the
hands of consumer fear of high-fat
foods but manufacturers are fighting
back with changes or subtle advertising
strategy. The Dairy Farmers Co-op Ltd
is appealing to people with a cottage
cheese that “only tastes fattening.” The
cheese, with 3 percent fat against nor-
mal cheese fat levels as high as 30 per-
cent, is in a growth market.
Low-fat products now account for
some 25 percent of yoghurt sales. The
attraction is fat levels of only 0.1 per-
cent against normal fruit yoghurt fat of
more than 2 percent. Dairy Farmers has
just launched a product called Ski Plus
which is low-fat yoghurt with honey and
comes with an attached container of
muesli or fruit and nuts. Dairy Farmers,
which has lost its leadership of the $65-
million yoghurt market to the aggressive
Yoplait brand marketed by Plumrose
Australia, says that the new line is “go-
ing like a rocket.”
Anyone doubting that the food pro-
cessors have seen that one way to cus-
tomers’ wallets is through promoting
nutritional or health aspects in some
way has only to look at one of Uncle
Ben’s of Australia’s more recent releases
polyunsaturated Pal dogfood. □

OTHER LUXURY CARS ARE UP TO 300 KILOS OVERWEIGHT.
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THEIR FIGURES.
Too much weight on a car is as
unhealthy as too much weight on a
person.
But whilst today's executive is
becoming fitter and trimmer, the
overlong, overlarge luxury car is still very
much in evidence.
It seems as if built-in obesity is the
mark of the breed.
But not for BMW though.
The BMW 735 i is as in tune with the
times as the modern executive.
It is designed to be lithe and
sporting in nature.
The computer-controlled engine
management system actually re-tunes
the engine at every revolution. It
monitors temperature, humidity, and
engine speed and adjusts the tuel/air
mixture and ignition timing for optimum
performance and efficiency, to levels of
accuracy simply unavailable in less
refined systems.
And just as a fitness expert
constantly monitors you, so a computer
monitors the way the car is driven. It
then tells you the precise moment a
service or oil change is necessary.
As a further measure to increase
efficiency, the BMW 735 i is equipped

I!
with a four-speed overdrive
transmission. At certain speeds it
actually bypasses the torque-converter,
saving energy. This results in the first
automatic to give you the performance
and economy of a 5-speed manual
gearbox.
Despite this leanness, the BMW 735 i
still gives you safety, space and features
like the computer-controlled anti-lock
braking system - known as ABS.
It is said that the fit and active get
more out of life. So the BMW driver gets
more satisfaction out of driving. The car,
like its driver, is supple, dynamic and
progressive.

Ormolu-Sue hands out another lesson
RON SAW
IT WAS nearly 10 years since I had seen
Ormolu-Sue van Gripper but the wait
had been worthwhile. She was still a
sight to summon up the blood: a sort of
golden-white version of Raquel Welch
with a tennis racquet in one hand, a golf
club in the other, skis on her feet and
Old Glory between her teeth; a girl from
so deep in North Carolina that she
regarded people from Texas and
Lousiana as Yankees.
She must have been about 25 when I
first met her, in Saigon. Her husband,
Rip van Gripper, was somebody
machiavellian in the Central In-
telligence Agency. Ormolu-Sue had
flown to join him and, able to spend
only about eight hours a day at sport
she was teaching South Vietnamese
soldiers to swim in the Saigon River and
hookers from the Melody Bar to play
basketball she took a job with United
Press International.
For a while, she just buzzed around
the office brushing up the reporters’
shorthand but her main job later was to
translate into more or less intelligible
English the utterances of a Texan
reporter named Nat Gibson.
For example, Gibson was fond of a
pet owl he had bought (God knows
where). Assigned to a hot spot just out
of Da Nang, he asked: “Hey, y’all
lookafftamal?”
The entire staff Americans,
Australian and Vietnamese looked at
him blankly.
A deskman, from only as far south as
Atlanta, Georgia, said: “Nat, what in
Goad’s name yo’ talkin’ about?” And
Nat repeated it just as Ormolu-Sue
came bounding in from the showers or
somewhere and she was able to tell us
that he had asked: “Will you guys look
after my owl?”
Just about every reporter anywhere
in Vietnam (but in this case up near the
demilitarized zone) was having a bad
time with the telephones. So Ormolu-
Sue flew north to show the Viets how to
work them.
“What’s the point,” she asked, “in ol
.yo guys trahn to cole yo’ stories in when
ol the lahns is fouled up with VC people
who doan know how to use ’em?” So
she showed the Viet Cong, too, and
inside two months a local call could be
made in no more than 20 minutes. A
longish-distance call say, from Da
Nang to Saigon took longer, maybe
40 minutes, but was still a 100 percent
improvement.
I next saw Ormolu-Sue in Cyprus.
Rip was conspiring with, I think, the
Turks against the Greeks. Or possibly it
was the Russians or even the Israelis.
She was showing the few Americans
present how to evacuate the island. Not
many Australians were there, either, so
she also showed us. She would have
shown the Brits and the British
Cypriots, too, but they said it would be
better if they did things their way.
The result was that we strolled on to
the choppers with no great fuss in this
emergency, my wife actually took two
fur coats and a small crate of Italian
shoes with her offering the pilots
chewing-gum, O. Henry bars and
courses in colloquial Turkish; and the
Brits, marking time and carrying
nothing heavier than postcards, landed
on our aircraft-carrier two hours later as
Ormolu-Sue was showing the mystified
Royal Navy crew how to mix bloody
marys.
The Poms had been marvellous: a
cheery rating greeting every tired, bewil-
dered and often badly-shocked evacuee
with a nice cuppa tea. But it was
somehow more exciting to get a roaring
slug of vodka with tomato juice, black
sauce and tabasco.
And Ormolu-Sue was showing them
how to mix it.
When we caught an aeroplane for the
United Kingdom, we found ourselves
sitting next to a wonderfully-bibulous
British businessman with a bottle of
vodka and two obliging sons.
That was a good start but it was
Ormolu-Sue who made it perfect: the
boys needed to find not only tomato
juice, black sauce and tabasco but also
ice from the galley of a British
aeroplane and she showed them how
to find it.
That was the last I saw of her for a
while but I got a letter from Rip, about
the time of Watergate, telling me that
she had gone into TV.
“She seems to think,” he wrote, “that
Richard Nixon may have to make some
kind of a statement on the box. He’s not
good at it, she says, so although we’re
both registered Democrats she’s going
to show him how to do it.”
Not long after that came the fall of
Saigon and those desperate scenes as
half the people in South Vietnam tried
to get the hell away from the place. I
remember seeing in a newsreel a tall,
chesty, pony-tailed blonde giving in-
structions somewhere between the gates
of the United States embassy and the
evacuation helicopter pad; the same
figure later stood on the deck of a
destroyer, pointing and shouting as
sailors threw choppers into the sea. I’m
pretty sure that Ormolu-Sue was
showing how to throw ’em.
So nine years went by and last week I
received, from a UPI man in Dallas,
Texas, a video of Martina Navratilova
at practice.
“She’s coming your way,” said an
accompanying note. “Thought you
might be interested in this footage I shot
of her the other day on her private
court.”
It was a sound film.
There on a sunny court stood
Navratilova, tall and tough and hatchet-
faced, and suddenly she was joined by a
familiar figure: tall, golden-white and
tanned and active, her legs long and
beautiful, her every move-
ment showing that despite her
40-odd years she still had
what are known in her neck of
the woods as “rahsin beaut-
ies.”
“Honeh,” she was saying,
“Ah’m not real wahld about
yo’ backhand. Ah’d be a
whole lot happier ef yo’d be-
gin yo’ shot mo’ definitely,
mo’ horizawntally . . .
Thisaways ...”
Ormolu-Sue van Gripper
was showing the world
champion how to do it. □

AT 99, crusty journalist R. W. (for
Robert William) Robson reckoned his
100th birthday would be a good story.
So he dictated a report on himself to his
long-time colleague and companion,
Judy Tudor. In well-turned sentences he
told how he had been born on a remote
bush farm in Southland, New Zealand,
had learned reading and writing from
his mother and shorthand from a Pres-
byterian missionary, then went on to a
number of top newspaper jobs in New
Zealand, Australia and London. But the
event that left the deepest impression on
Robson was in 1916 when he ac-
companied the New Zealand governor-
general on a tour of the Pacific Islands.
In 1930, Robson capitalised on the
experience to launch the Pacific Islands
Monthly, which he ran until his retire-
ment in 1974. Robby’s journalistic in-
stincts were spot on but the deadline
crept up on him. He died at the age of i
99 years and one month. The last story
he filed became his obituary. i

Stan
Oldfield, left,
and Arch
Colbron:
getting back
to square
one
In Brisbane, Russ Hinze, the Queens-
land Minister for Local Government,
Main Roads and Fine Cotton, launched
a book of Sean Leahy’s cartoons, posed
beside a polystyrene banana shaped like
Joh Bjelke-Petersen a further indica-
tion that somewhere in the mass there is
a soul. Further indication? Indeed.
Consider parts of the introduction he
wrote to Leahy’s book: “(Leahy’s) harsh
caricatures of me have completely
missed the essential Hinze the warm
wonderful human being so loved by
those near and dear to me. In missing
the essential Hinze, Leahy has ensured
that I would never be mistaken for
Grant Kenny or ever thought of as an
occupational therapist. That he asked
me to introduce this sad little book is
remarkable. More than that, it’s bloody
cheek. But, on reflection I really
couldn’t afford to turn him down. After
all, a politician can cope with anything
except being ignored or, even worse,
overlooked.”
There was a time when a businessman
in need of a fashionable pastime turned
to horses, yachts or women, not
necessarily in that order. Then Len
Evans went on the air and life became
still more sybaritic. So it was little more
than a society note when Andrew Simon,
the boss of Camperdown Cellars, joined
with the big-deal bankers Nick Whitlam
(managing-director of the State Bank of
NSW) and David Clarke (chairman of
Hill-Samuel) to produce Simon-
Whitlam chardonnays and semilions.
Needless to say the wines are nectareous
(“ ... outstanding fruit flavor ... clean
finish ... fresh, fruity bouquet” accord-
ing to Johnnie Walker). As money men,
the partners are strictly non-
superstitious. They’d need to be: their
grapes grow at Broke, NSW.
In 1937 Stan Oldfield’s father bought
the Astra Hotel, Bondi, from Sir
Joynton Smith; and in 1946 Stan himself
took over as licensee. It was some pub.
It became the set for Summer of the
Seventeenth Doll and, to get experience
for her role, Anne Baxter worked behind
the bar for six months. To get the place
in shape a builder’s foreman named
Arch Colbron sawed and hammered;
and he and Oldfield met there again last
week. But it was a pub no more: the
Astra had gone downhill, had become a
bloodhouse, had been sold and now re-
opened as a swish retirement village
61 apartments, for pity’s sake. So Stan
could decently pour some of the
Bollinger for Arch: the Astra was get-
ting back to square one.


Jack Hylton was the giant impresario of
London’s West End between the 1940 s
and 60s. He died in 1965 shortly after
introducing the hit musical Camelot to
England, ending a career in which he
staged more than 100 famous musicals
and plays. But the family tradition lives
on in the bush in Western Australia.
His son, Jack Hylton Jnr, recently
wound up a tour through 42 outback
towns in the West with the comedy
Footrot Flats based on the syndicated
comic strip created by New Zealand
cartoonist Murray Ball. And 37-year-
old Hylton’s relaxation was examining
menus in country cafes. For instance a
Chinese cafe in Dumbleyung offered:
“Braised crap in black-bean sauce.” A
menu board in Mt Barker promised:
“Today’s special shitzel and fresh
veg.”
Britain’s premier duke and earl, the
Duke of Norfolk, also bears the title of
Chief Butler of England. Alas, the
Duke’s butling skills are, according to
his Duchess, minimal. She recently told
a New York audience: “Norfolk’s only
just learnt to stack the dishwasher!”
Bernard Malipaard, the 41-year-old
chief of police in Zwijndrecht, Holland,
has been convicted and sentenced to
five months’ jail (suspended) for his
technique of interviewing female
recruits. This consisted, in part, of
having them bare their breasts to him.
Accused of abusing his authority.
Bernard explained: “It was a test. The
idea was that they should say ‘No’.”
And, ladeez an’ gennelum, next in line
of the anti-vitamin doctors the latest
of those who might say that Professor
Linus Pauling got his two Nobel Prizes
for so much hogwash is Dr Victor
Herbert: not the distinguished Ameri-
can musician but the distinguished Am-
erican nutritionist. To be fair, Herbert
says that vitamins are used in common
quackery by the people (among them
14,000 Americans) who set themselves
up as “nutrition consultants,” apparent-
ly qualified by a small cheque and
return mail. Herbert is professor of
medicine at Hahnemann University,
Philadelphia, and currently is lecturing
at universities in Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane. To illustrate the ease with
which quacks can obtain impressive
credentials, Herbert paid for and got
professional membership of the Ameri-
can Association of Nutrition and
Dietary Consultants for Charlie and
Sassafras Herbert respectively his cat
and dog.

Possibly the next big number on the
record charts: an album called 2:ooam,
Paradise Cafe, featuring vocalists such
as Sarah Vaughan and Mel Torme and
the man who put it all together: Barry
Manilow. Barry who? Not the man who
attracted such praise as “Las Vegas
schlock,” “marshmallow,” “syrupy,”
“ugly,” “talentless,” “fag” and “wimp.”
None other. Manilow, the nice Jewish
boy from Brooklyn who once enthused
about “schlepping up the ladder of
success,” is schlepping again, but
differently. All those names, he says,
“hurt so badly because I call myself
those things before they do.” So he set
about getting not just richer than super-
rich but better, and Paradise Cafe is the
result. Early criticisms says that it is full
of the “wistful sounds of another era,”
but if the bottom line is a bagging, as is
the case with almost everything else he
has written, Manilow will smile gently.
“If I’m still annoying them,” he says, “it
means there’s still a lot of life left.”

PHILLIP ADAMS
Subtle, understated and forever popular
THE New Yorker magazine is now 59
and three quarter years old. It was
launched by the legendary Harold Ross
in February 1925 with a statement of
editorial intent that was (a) unusually
civilised and (b) unfailingly fulfilled.
“ The New Yorker starts with a
declaration of serious purpose but with
a concomitant declaration that it will
not be too serious in executing it. It
hopes to reflect metropolitan life, keep
up with events and affairs of the day, to
be gay, humorous, satirical, but to be
more than a jester. It is announced that
it is not edited for the old lady in
Dubuque.”
Those words, more or less, could
have served as the manifesto for The
Bulletin and, I hope, for my column.
I have long believed that any fool can
be serious and that self-importance
destroys communication as surely as
cutting the telephone wires.
Like most columnists I’m frequently
asked whether I write for readers or for
myself. Roger Angell, another New
Yorker editor, provides an excellent and
accurate answer. “We don’t run some-
thing to please as many reasons as
possible. It’s just to please ourselves:
our ideal readers are ourselves. I always
think that there’s somebody out there
who shares exactly my tastes and pre-
judices and limitations, and that’s the
person I’m editing or reading for.”
A few months ago this column paid
tribute to The New Yorker’s cartoonists,
from Thurber and Steinberg to the
present crop, hailing them as the mag-
azine’s greatest attraction. They’re jokes
for grown-ups, one-framers that say as
much about contemporary and urban
anxieties as a good short story or a
feature film. How I envy the cartoonist
who gets his weekly wage in return for a
few squiggles and five or six words.
Whereas we columnists have to hack
out thousands.
Come to think of it, it was in New
Yorker that I first discovered the genius
of Australia’s Bruce Petty, shortly be-
fore he returned to Australia to become,
in both style and stance, Australia’s
most radical political cartoonist. It was
night in Petty’s drawing, and a little
man was knocking at a lonely eottage
door. A very long way in the distance
you could dimly see the lights of an
enormous city. “May I use your
phone?” he was asking. And behind
him, on the road, was a giant ferris
wheel full of people. It had come adrift
and rolled for hours.
Given The New Yorker’s literary
reputation, it’s remarkable that Harold
Ross was so ill-educated. It’s said that
he never read more than one book all
the way through. And New Yorker
staffers recall the time he said, with
regard to Moby Dick, “Is that the man or
the whale?” For all that, he must have
had the most remarkable judgment.
And courage. In a world where the
attention span of readers was held to be
ever diminishing, Ross would publish
very long essays indeed. Just one might
fill two or three issues of his magazine.
For example, John Hershey’s account of
Hiroshima and Rachel Carson’s enor-
mously influenial Silent Spring, con-
cerning the environmental impact of
pesticides.
In more recent times, the tradition
has been maintained with Truman
Capote’s In Cold Blood and, more
recently, Jonathan Schell’s harrowing
speculations on nuclear war, The Fate of
the Earth.
As for fiction, few journals in the
world could claim to be as influenial. It
was The New Yorker that introduced
Nabakov, Dorothy Parker, J. D.
Salinger, E. B. White, Robert Benchley,
Woody Allen and John Updike.
Where the rest of the publishing
world is forever up-dating its typo-
The New Yorker editor Harold Ross
graphy and design, today’s New Yorker
is almost identical to 19255. Approach
any news-stand and you’re assaulted by
blaring, strident covers. And then
there’s New Yorker, subtle and
understated. And the extraordinary
thing is that, next to the National
Geographical, it has the highest sub-
scription renewal rate of any American
magazine.
ANOTHER pleasurable subscription
... my Sotheby’s catalogues. They ar-
rive every week, principally from Lon-
don and New York, covering antiq-
uities, old master paintings,
ethnographic material, historical docu-
ments and what they call “important
printed books.” This week one of the
most impressive book catalogues turned
up, a marvellous tome in its own right,
crowded with full color illustrations of
everything from illuminated man-
uscripts to 19th century etchings.
Hundreds of pages detailing books
of exquisite artistry and extraordinary
rarity. For example, an early edition of
Cervantes’ Don Quixote for $22,000. A
second edition of Goya’s Los Proverbios
(“some foxing, otherwise in good condi-
tion”) for $14,000. Books on hunting,
horsemanship, hawking, fowling,
fishing, agriculture, medicine, theology
and cartography, each more exotic and
valuable than the other.
But for me, the most interesting of
all, out of the whole 989 lots, was lot
147. My attention was caught by a full
page reproduction of one of the plates,
showing a Mexican antiquity, one of the
categories I collect. Beside it I read ...
“Kingsborough, Viscount Edward.
Antiquities of Mexico, nine volumes. 743
lithographs plates, some folding, some
discoloration and foxing (mainly affect-
ing plates). 19th century half Morocco,
spines faded, somewhat rubbed, 1830-
1848.”
Then followed the sad entry:
“Kingsborough, born 1795, determined,
on seeing a Mexican manuscript in the
Bodelian library, to devote his life to the
study of Mexican antiquities, which in-
deed he did. His book cost him over
£32,000. He was arrested for debt and
died in prison of typhus fever in 1837.”
Imagine a book that, in the early 19th
century, could cost £32,000. How many
millions would that be today? And the
sad thing is that Kingsborough’s
publishing venture has depreciated in
value. You can now snap it up for a
mere 7000 inflated quids. □

DAVID McNICOLL
Life far from taxing in Vanuatu
PEOPLE HAVE different aspirations
when they set off to swan round the
South Sea islands for a few days mine
was to meet Chief Jack, of Tanna
Island, Vanuatu, the famous chief who
venerates the Duke of Edinburgh and
believes the Duke will bring prosperity
to him and his people.
But I was told I couldn’t meet Chief
Jack. Why? Well, he was in some dis-
grace and recently had been put in the
calaboose for a couple of days. His
offence? Well, Chief Jack has a novel
method of tax minimisation don’t pay
taxes at all. The head tax is only about
$lO a year but, when you realise Jack
has about 2000 tribesmen, the shortfall
must come to the attention of Vanuatu’s
Prime Minister Walter Lini. Apparently
it had.
Despite the Chiefs isolation, I
managed to get to his mountain fast-
ness, a glorious, green, tree-matted area.
Chief Jack was waiting to meet me
naked, as the Americans say, as a
jaybird, except for a slightly inadequate
penis sheath. We shook hands, he yelled
and from one of the long houses 200
warriors (similarly all but starkers)
emerged dancing and chanting.
Dancing over, I was able, with an
interpreter and my own rough pidgin, to
hear the complaints of Jack, his witch
doctor and spiritual adviser. We then
adjourned to his “study” where I was
shown the precious signed photographs
of Prince Philip plus the letters written
to the Chief by the Duke.
Did I happen to know the Duke?
asked Jack. Yes, I said, I had met him
on several occasions and had appeared
The visiting columnist with (I to r) the witch doctor, Chief Jack and the spiritual adviser
on television with him. Looking very
seriously at Jack, I said: “I know Prince
Philip will want you to pay your taxes.
Everyone has to pay taxes. If you pay
your taxes, visitors will be allowed to
come to your village again and you will
be prosperous.”
With much nodding, and patting, we
made our farewells.
Next day, back at Vila, I had urgent
messages from Tanna. Chief Jack had
been to the local authorities, told them
he’d been visited by someone who knew
Prince Philip, and that Prince Philip
didn’t want him to pay his taxes.
Something obviously went wrong
with the pidgin. Over to you, Prince
Philip.
VANUATU has a touch of magic about
it. It is not merely the peace, the happy
people, the absence of tipping or bar-
gaining. It is, praise be, one of the un-
spoiled little paradises left. Jacques
Saint, the indefatigable boss of Leisure
Pacific, had laid out my program and it
could not have been better.
A comfortable, fast flight to Noumea
by UTA; then into Le Surf hotel, the
newest jewel in Noumea’s tourist
crown. A wonderful position, pleasant
service. The service extends to the ca-
sino now attached to Le Surf if you
don’t happen to be correctly dressed for
losing money at the tables, there’s an
attendant who will provide not only a
tie but a jacket!
Vanuatu Finance minister Kalpokar Kalsavau
Tourism director Warwick Purser points out Vanuatu’s beauties


The remote and peaceful Tanna beach resort
ON TO Port Vila by Air Cal-
edonie, in a Boeing 737
owned by Air Nauru and run
on charter. Hardly off the
plane when greeted by the de-
licious representative of Tour
Vanuatu with the news that
we were expected to dinner at
the home of Warwick Purser,
director of tourism. Our fel-
low guests Bob Ansett, wife
Josie, plus Vanuatu’s minister
for Finance, Tourism and In-
dustry, Kalpokar Kalsavau
(who will eventually run
Vanuatu), and his wife Maria.
Kalsavau is one of the most
clued-up politicians I have
met which I attribute to his
having been sent to school at
Scotch College, Melbourne.
LE LAGON must be one of
the most picturesque hotels in
the world. Strung out along
the side of the Erakor Lagoon
it can offer you everything from peace,
perfect peace, to highjinks in the piano
bar. The hotel is in process of being
completely overhauled (as are most ho-
tels in Sydney). Ten bungalows at a time
are being closed, fitted with new bath-
rooms, Jacuzzis, improved air-condi-
tioning. The enthusiasm of the manager,
Masa Nakauchi, and his side-kick Jean-
Luc Randin is quite infectious. They are
not worried that six new resort com-
plexes have been approved for Vanuatu
Le Lagon’s position gives it a walk-up
.start.
808 ANSETT’S Budget boss in Vila,
John Duncan and wife Sue, turned on a
day of snorkelling and exploring. We
boarded the Pacific Dream up in
Havannah Harbor (a Taiwan-built
cruiser, skippered by Gordon Neale,
formerly of Newcastle, who gave away
trucking coal for a less gritty life), sailed
to the island of Lelapa to see the caves,
Food served on the Pacific Dream
feasted on the most mouth-watering
spread of coconut crabs, lobsters,
prawns and oysters, all local, all fresh.
Ansett a fitness nut spent most of
the day hundreds of metres from the
boat, head occasionally surfacing as he
inspected the coral and the underwater
detritus left by the Americans when they
abandoned their wartime base in
Havannah Harbor.
TANNA was the highlight of my trip to
Vanuatu. There are only seven Euro-
peans on the island, no town, just a snug
little Tanna Beach Resort which can ac-
commodate about 16 people in huts.
The place is run by a most impressive
young man named Ray Saunders and
wife Janina. Not only does he run the
place as a qualified builder and engin-
eer he can do everything but he also
has installed two huge old Listers for
lighting, has taught the local natives
how to make bricks and has thrown
himself into the community life of
Tanna in a remarkably effective way.
Ray and his wife had, a week or so
before, looked after the visiting Sir
Ninian Stephen and his wife. The
Governor-General’s visit was popular,
one reason being that all the roads had
the grader put over them. One touch of
solicitude towards the vice-regal visitors
which appealed to me just under the
rim of the active volcano Yasur (a
“must” sight for all visitors), the locals
had erected a portable 100. As
far as I know, it was not used.
The experience of proximity
to the rumbling, shaking and
burping volcano would have
been, let us say, unsettling.
HAVING said so many nice
things about Vanuatu, let me
offer some criticism. I wanted
to hear a session of parlia-
ment which was debating the
Airport Tax (Vila, like Syd-
ney, has a departure tax).
Warwick Purser applied for a
pass to take me in to the pub-
lic gallery. At the entrance, I
was stopped. “You are a jour-
nalist,” said an official, look-
ing at my pass. “Journalists
are not admitted.” Prime Min-
ister Lini, 1 cannot follow
your reasoning in banning
journalists they are there to
observe and record, not neces-
sarily to be critical.
FOOD in Vila: Some of the restaurants
are remarkably good.
The cooking at Pisces and Rendez-
vous was as good as in any top Sydney
or Melbourne restaurant (and the prices
about the same).
But the restaurants seem strangely
reluctant to serve the wonderful native
vegetables.
Only in Tanna did I get yam, taro,
and native beans.
Delicious.
IN 10 YEARS Vanuatu will be the No 1
overseas resort sought by Australians.
It’s so easy to get to there is a direct
air service which takes a bit over three
hours or the comfort of going first to
New Caledonia in a UTA jumbo to
Noumea, then in an Air Caledonie
plane to Vila. The inter-island fights
in Vanuatu are by Air Melanesiae and
are in those safe-feeling planes Twin

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Melbourne agonises over its super Moomba
VICTORIA’S 150th birthday celebra-
tions get under way on November 17. I
think it will be a stunning, exciting year
but by heavens it has not been easy. For
a start there was the feeling, could it
ever be quite as good as it was for the
centenary?
Back in 1934 we had MacPherson
Robertson, the astonishing confectioner
king, maker of Freddo Frogs and 2000
other lines. Mac Robertson, later Sir
MacPherson, gave as a straight gift to
the State £lOO,OOO. Now at a time of
depression this was an unbelievable
sum of money, worth heaven knows
how many millions today.
Noting the gift, the federal govern-
ment taxed it £40,000. Mac Robertson
was enraged. He thought it so unfair. In
the end he turned round and paid the
£40,000 himself to make a total gift of
£140,000. What Victoria did with that
money is almost beyond belief. It paid
for a bridge across the Yarra, the
MacPherson Robertson bridge at
Grange Road. It paid for an entire
school, the Macßobertson Girls High
School. It paid for a herbarium in the
Botanic Gardens, a fountain in the
Domain and most spectacular of all, an
air race to Australia, won in three days
by Scott and Black flying the marvellous
De Havilland Comet with its ply skin
construction. The Comet was said to be
the forerunner of the wartime De
Havilland Mosquito.
Ah yes, we all remember the thrilling
arrival of the Comet at Laverton and we
remember that at preparatory school we
all received a centenary medal.
Preparations for the 150th started
early with the distinguished engineer,
Sir John Holland, as director. There was
a change of government from Liberal to
Labor in midstream. There was a period
of terrible torpor in between when no
funds seemed to be forthcoming, Hol-
land resigned, there was a spill of
almost the entire board, plus secretary.
Ranald Macdonald, then managing
director of The Age, took over, the
federal government gave $5 million for
specific commonwealth projects, The
Cain government gave $lO million and
there was almost another $2 million for
various administrative costs. John Cain
did not want the 150th to be a frivolous
piece of razzle-dazzle, he wanted
Macdonald and his board to create
projects of lasting benefit to Victoria, all
Victoria.
Every city,, town, shire, parish in the
state put in applications to improve
MacPherson Robertson welcomes aviators Scott and Black to Melbourne in 1934
their local gardens, pond, monument,
bandstand and for a time it looked as if
funds would be spread as thin as
lunchbox margarine. There were 2000
projects which were being funded or
partly funded by the 150th. Ranald
shuddered at the name “Sesqui Centen-
ary” and it was known always as the
150th. Dr Michael Searby, former man-
aging director of H. C. Sleigh, former
chairman of SPC Ltd, became executive
director.
Early on there were many grand
ideas. The mighty Westgate Bridge was
built over the most hideous wasteland.
It was decided to spend $3 million of
the commonwealth money in turning
this into a dazzling Tivoli Gardens
exactly like those in Copenhagen with
lakes, flowers, carousels, fun machines,
restaurants.
That proved to be over ambitious,
but now we will have the 150th
Westgate Park, 26ha of it and there will
be a general landscaping of the lower
reaches of the Yarra at a cost of $2.25
million.
Another million was allocated to
build a Gallery of Sport at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground not just a
monument to cricket and VFL footy,
but a super museum for all sports. In a
place where sport was God, this was to
be perhaps the finest sporting museum
on Earth.
I think it still will be, but the agonies
of birth have been awful. The cost now,
including a contribution from the
Melbourne Cricket Club, is more likely
to be $3 million. The National Trust was
not keen on proposed changes at the
MCG and Norm Gallagher with his
Builders’ Laborers’ Federation had a
black ban on all building operations.
The Gallery of Sport will be a 150th
triumph but it may not be complete
before the end of the 150th year.
A million dollars was to go to a
women’s centre, a place where women
could get advice, help, rest. First it was
to be in the Flinders railways station
building, then it was to take over a hotel
in Spencer St, but agreement has yet to
come on where and how it will work.
A big dream was to bring out the old
Comet, fly it to Laverton just as it was
flown in 1934. Indeed the Comet was
restored to flying order, new engines,
complete modern instrumentation. But
in the end its owners shuddered at the
thought of it flying over the Pacific, so it
is coming in a box and we will see it at
various displays, like Open Day at
Tullamarine.
So what’s happening that will be
terrific? Portland has the honor of being
the actual birthday town. So there will
be a great party there on November 17
with an opening by the Premier. This
will continue on to Melbourne. There
will be two floating stages on the Yarra
and two more in the gardens on which
all sorts of rock, folk and jazz groups
will perform. There will be an opening


show at the State Theatre on which the
Seven Network is spending $300,000.
There will be fireworks on the Yarra
and an event called a Firescape, offici-
ally described as “a floating pyrotechnic
theatrical production, a unique pre-
sentation of fire, live music, theatre,
fireworks and a water paradise.”
There will be an orgy of athletic and
muscular events. On December 1
through to December 8 there is the
Great Victorian Bike Ride from
Wodonga to Melbourne. Originally it
was expected that 2000 bicyclists might
take part, but there could be many more
and now we are expecting it will be the
biggest mass migration since the Gold
Rush.
But then there’s the Australia Games
between January 26 and February 3, our
answer to the LA Olympics; there’s the
world championship cricket at the
MCG starting February 17 under lights.
That’s the event which attracted such
enthusiastic interest from the BLF.
There’s world orienteering, the
Oceania amateur boxing champion-
ships, the Women’s world bowls, the
world modern pentathlon champion-
ships, international women’s cricket
and an international skating competi-
tion.
You must appreciate Melbourne al-
ways has had a sense of guilt about
being insufficiently cultured.
The Moomba festival has been
criticised for being too much fun
without providing any fodder for our
intelligence, whereas Adelaide has
secured all the refinement. That is being
exorcised once and for all.
The Spoleto Melbourne Festival will
take place during September and
October 1985. You appreciate that
Spoleto is the small town in central Italy
that for 27 years has been a world centre
for dance, theatre and opera. Its
director is the composer Gian Carlo
Menotti.
Now the festival is to move between
Spoleto, Charleston in South Carolina
and Melbourne. The hope is to make
Spoleto, Melbourne, the biggest and
grandest of all.
I haven’t even told you of countless
other 150th activities, the Chinese
Museum which is going into a four-
storey building in Cohen Place, just off
Little Bourke Street, at a cost of $1.6
million.
• I haven’t told you of the sheep
drive through the city, of the million-
dollar musical dramatisation of Man-
ning Clark’s History of Australia, or of
the Westpac flagpole, the tallest
freestanding flagpole in the world that is
going up at the Haymarket. Westpac
offered the flagpole but Melbourne
couldn’t agree on a place to put it. Then
Westpac suggested Adelaide might be
grateful for it. The decision on the
Haymarket was made as fast as you bat
your eyelid.
I haven’t told you about the Living
Museum of the West, the active live
museum being created for the long
neglected western suburbs of Mel-
bourne. Nor have I enlarged on the
project at Lake Condah. Naturally there
has been a certain sensitivity that the
Aborigines could easily celebrate the
20,000 th birthday rather than the 150th.
So the board has contributed $750,000
to purchase and restore the old mission
area at Lake Condah, between Portland
and Hamilton.
There will be displays of craft and
artefacts, the old fish traps and stone
houses are being restored.
Oh I tell you, there’s a lot more. We
are getting a gigantic lamington party, a
Freddo Frog party. The Victorian State
Opera is giving us Fergus Hume’s Mys-
tery of a Hansom Cab with libretto by
Jack Hibberd.
You’re going to hear a lot about
Victoria before the end of 1985. □

THE ARTS
Redgum: blending
protest and pop music
They stand apart from the less idealistic elements of the music industry. Yet, in its
“eccentric” way, Redgum has achieved audience rapport as its hits, albums and recent
national tour testify - and, GLENDA THOMPSON reports, is putting its ideas across.
REDGUM IS not a just another rock
band. Nor is it another folk group.
Musically, its roots are diverse and its
members difficult to categorise. To
them, the message is more important
than the medium music serves as just
a way of getting their ideas across.
The band has shunned the usual
route to popularity, epitomised by its
refusal to appear on ABC-TV’s
Countdown which for years has been the
youth music “bible.” Redgum is known
through its pub and club appearances
and five albums. Its song about the
Vietnam war, I Was Only 19 struck a
tingly chord in the Australian con-
sciousness. It came off the sharp pen of
John Schumann, 31, the driving lead
singer and focal point of the band. He
also wrote the satirical hit I’ve Been To
Bali Too.
In the world of popular music,
characterised by commercialism and a
general lack of idealism, Redgum
stands apart. “We’re not accepted by
the music industry because we’re
regarded as eccentric,” says Michael
Atkinson, 32, the bass player.
“We didn’t set out to be a radical
band. The thing that motivates us
passionately is a sense of being
Australian in resisting the in-
ternational culture we’re bombarded
with. We’re saying we can share a
considerable pride in being Australian
and that goes beyond jumping up and
down and having a few beers and a few
of our millionaires winning a yacht race
over a few American millionaires and
all that petty chauvinism. There is
something a lot deeper, in us coming to
terms with what’s happening in this
country, that we do have a sense of our
own history and what is our own art.”
The core of political consciousness
(as Schumann puts it) was and still is
Atkinson, Verity Truman, 30, and
Schumman himself. They met at uni-
versity in Adelaide about 10 years ago.
“I wasn’t aware of their existence
until they put up their hands in the
politics-arts class and said they wanted
to work on a music project,” Schumann
says. The band they formed was called
“Red...” after the shade of their politics
and “... gum” as ultra-Australian.
Schumann was playing drums in a
rock and roll band but the other two
had no musical experience.
Truman says: “I came from a
western suburbs-type area of Adelaide
where musical instruments just weren’t
part of a house and I went to an average
high school with no music department.
It wasn’t till university that I decided to
learn an instrument.” She took up the
flute and now also handles saxophone
and tin whistle with aplomb.
Atkinson’s family was not musical
but he banged around on a guitar at
university and is doing his Bachelor of
Music degree. His interest has pushed
into classical music. He is composing a
string quartet.
Redgum’s John Schumann on stage
ROBERT MORT
Schumann found that he could not
write songs on drums and, lacking a car,
he had difficulty moving around the
drum kit. So he taught himself the
guitar.
The line-up has changed quite a lot.
Hugh McDonald, 30, replaced
original fiddle player Chris Timms in
1982; drummer Brian Czempinski, 43,
has been a member since March 83 and
keyboardist Michael Spicer, 24, first
played on the current album, Frontline.
Stephen Cooney guitar, mandolin
and didgeridoo player left recently
for Ireland.
Redgum has been professional since
1981.
Truman was “going round the twist”
in the public service and welcomed the
decision. Atkinson was a teacher for a
short time, then cut film for the South
Australian Film Corporation.
Schumann threw in a $25,000-
a-year job teaching English,
drama and outdoor education
at Marion High School in
Adelaide and in his first year
as a pro earned $9OOO.
So he is not in it for the
money. “We’ve now got back
to probably an average of
$25,000 a year and there are
occasional perks I wouldn’t
have as a teacher,” Schumann
says. “But I work something
like twice the hours a week
and music is a very draining
thing.
“There is a distinct lack of
security and the expenses go
on and on.”
What, then, made this
archetypal Angry Young Man
tick? Is he still angry?
Schumann says: “There is a
Catholicism in there some-
where which developed an
innate sense of justice and fair
play. I did Philosophy at uni
and it took about three years
before a Marxist analysis of
society and class contradic-
tions made sense. Then I


Redgum members (from left): John Schumann, Michael Atkinson, Hugh McDonald, Brian Czempinski
could see it operating. It was almost like
a vision there it is, the world is now
clear.
“Obviously, after nine years, that
sort of intensity fades a bit. But I am not
yet able to answer to myself sat-
isfactorily as to why one kid down in
the western suburbs and one kid over on
the north can be born at exactly the
same time and have utterly different
expectations, different horizons.
“That fundamental inequality of op-
portunity, of access to resources such
abysmal lack of fair play frustrates
me.”
Schumann has a speech impediment
which draws out some of his vowels. It
happens occasionally when he is talking
on stage but never when he sings. “I
developed it at school in grade 5 it
was nerves or paranoia or insecurity.”
He is religious. He was educated by
Dominicans. “I’m not a tub-thumping,
double-born, twice-dipped Luxembourg
Redemptionist but I have leanings,” he
says.
Truman says that each person in the
band has particular concerns. “I feel
very strongly about the environment.
The rainforest debate is quite a small
part; it’s the whole thing of Australia’s
resources, how we exploit them for our
own uses. We’re talking about preserv-
ing Australia’s rural industry the
massive erosion problems.
“People say, if you stop the
woodchip industry, you’re destroying
jobs. If, in 10 years’ time, you’ve got no
trees you’ve got no industry at all. We
don’t mind people cutting down trees as
long as there’s some long-term plan-
ning. Australia could have a terrific
industry and still preserve trees.”
For her song Still Life, Truman
researched the environmental subject
thoroughly and condensed it to 12
foolscap pages. She looked at them in
dismay and threw them out, doing the
song on her feelings. Here are some
lines:
“The earth is shred and skun,
fortune seekers hit and run. ”
“We've change to make,
while there’s still life. ’’
“Will we see the light through the trees
as the last axe falls. ’’
Atkinson is possibly the most ob-
sessive. He says he gets a gut reaction
when he even sees an American. It is
rage. “It’s almost to the degree where
people call me a racist.
“I must say, a lot of Americans I do
meet in Australia tend to be particularly
awful but it’s quite unreasonable
because a lot of American people are
obviously beaut but I can’t help it;
everything American makes me furious
at a gut level, it’s because of every-
thing I feel is happening and at an
intellectual level because of everything I
know is happening.”
He says the band has been railing for
years against foreign ownership of
Australian resources but its first protests
were about “a lot of things that made
people our age angry” and localised
topics such as the problems of the motor
vehicle industry in Australia.
“We’ve written songs about working
on the production line, people we’ve
met, the way the workers were treated; a
big follow-up to the sackings at General
Motors-Holden which virtually gutted
Adelaide, leaving it with no economic
base. We could see it happening years
ago,” Atkinson says.
He consulted Victorian civil rights
member of parliament Joan Coxsedge
on the Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation, which he attacks in the
latest album;
“Darwin rendezvous, a B-52,
a trenchcoat slightly creased
from a coup in Asia, a US Air Force
major,
buying dirty laundry, swearing it’s for
peace.
Infiltration, we’ll never know.
Just like Chile but the bruises don’t
show. ’’
And “Your life’s in a databank at
AS 10. ”
Atkinson believes that ASIO “should
not exist. There’s no justification for
maintaining files on people with left-
wing views in Australia as if they’re
some sort of security risk. ASIO uses
right-wing extremists such as Ustasha (a
Croatian organisation) to harass left-
wing groups.”
On stage, though, it is not pure
rhetoric. Irish reels and jigs go down as
well as the hit songs and the group


probably would be more effective if it
played a few more.
Apart from Schumann’s individual
vocal style, the lead electric guitar
breaks of McDonald take the limelight.
“Hughie” or “Bullet” says he would
rather be performing than anything else.
He even likes the pub circuit.
He started out as a teenager singing
James Taylor songs in Melbourne
restaurants for $lO a night. Soon he was
writing “basic songs” and his The Spirit
Of The Land has a ballad feel. After the
just-ended 43-concert national tour, he
was headed back to his wife and family
in Melbourne.
Czempinski, married to singer Di
Faulkner, is also from Melbourne. He
first learned the trumpet but has been a
session drummer for years.
“I get the feeling of doing something
worthwhile for a change that’s what
I’m doing in Redgum,” he says.
Spicer has an honors degree in Music
from Latrobe. He started learning the
piano at eight and has played flute and
recorder.
Now, he plays with computers.
“When I was at uni, I did a lot of work
with electronic equipment syn-
thesisers and stuff. They originally had
big modular systems, looking like
telephone exchanges all this com-
plicated control voltage and the
logical extension of that was to use a
computer to generate all the control
voltages which is what they call hybrid
synthesis. I’m actually doing a master’s
project on it at the moment.”
He was spotted by Redgum producer
Trevor Lucas when playing with the
band XS. Spicer says that his main fault
(he does not smoke or drink and his
nagging has probably made the rest of
the band stop smoking) is his “terrible
habit of buying synthesisers I’ve got
nine.”
The live band attracts an audience of
committed fans, idealistic-looking types
in jeans, rather than The Beautiful
People. A large slice of the fare is
message music even when light-hearted
as in It Doesn’t Matter To Me.
“We employ humor a hell of a lot,”
Atkinson says. “People join in and end
up laughing at themselves. We put up It
Doesn’t Matter To Me as the new
national anthem. It goes through
sexism, racism, drugs, the whole gamut
of pursuits, and every verse ends ‘lt
doesn’t matter to me, I’ll sit home and
watch it on my color TV.’ They love it
because every Australian identifies with
that extraordinary complacency.
“The cudgel doesn’t work. We’ve
done that and we still do when we’re
impassioned enough and there is no
other way. We just say forcefully,
‘Please listen to this; it is about some-
thing important that perhaps you don’t
know about.’ ” □
SHOWBIZ
The shrewd
Carr behind
all that hype
Showbusinessman Allan Carr: reason to smile broadly
ROBERT DORAN
By SHELLEY NELLER
ACUTELY aware of the need to hype
showbusiness productions, the cel-
ebrated Hollywood producer/party-
thrower Allan Carr arrived in Australia
last week loaded with one-liners,
anecdotes and name-dropping.
The purpose of his latest visit is to
promote the first non-American produc-
tion of his Broadway stage hit La Cage
Aux Folles.
The $1.4 million Australian version
of La Cage which won a row of Tony
awards and is still playing to packed
houses in New York’s Palace theatre
is to open at Her Majesty’s in Sydney
next March 2.
Carr, who has not financially needed
to work since 1978 (he produced the
movie Grease which has taken more
than $350 million), then will have pro-
ductions running simultaneously in
New York, Los Angeles, Detroit,
Cleveland and Sydney. An all-Japanese
version is scheduled for Tokyo from
April.
Keith Michell and Jon Ewing are to
play the dual leads two middle-aged
homosexuals, the former the owner of a
St Tropez drag club called La Cage aux
Folles and the latter its star transvestite
performer.
Carr’s weight, dieting tips, hair color,
clothing, jewellery and recent social
encounters are so assiduously chron-
icled by the tabloid press here that it is
easy to overlook the shrewd and astute
side to this (show)businessman.
What many people miss about Carr
is that he is ever a fan. He once was
Broadway’s youngest investor. As a raw
Chicago kid of 14, he put $1250 into The
Happiest Millionaire and he still bases
investments on the same gut-reacting
premise.
“While my shows are in production,
I sometimes go in and have a look,” he
says. “I don’t interfere too much. I
pretend I’m the audience, reacting to
the show on an emotional level. If I see
glaring gaps or errors in the emotional
balance, I make sure it’s fixed.”
A college Journalism major, Carr
delivers mountains of “good copy” at
the speed of machinegun fire.
For his verbal excess, plus that he has
an Egyptian disco in the basement of his
Benedict Canyon home, plus his ex-
travagant and innovative party-throw-
ing, Hollywood considers him to be
flamboyant.
But the other side of him which he
attributes to his Gemini sun sign is the
one invited to lecture at Harvard and
Radcliffe on how it it possible to work
in movies and theatre simultaneously in
the United States. It is the one whom
opera’s Placido Domingo asks to pro-
duce a Broadway show for him.
Carr to Domingo: “Can’t we do
South Pacific ?”
No wonder he is caricatured in print
as a corpulent, irrepressible joker. The
serious Carr says that finding all-
Australian investors for La Cage was a
breeze. “They’d read the New York
reviews and heard about the box office.
We had to club them off.” The investors,


for their efforts, will see the most ex-
pensive and spectacular musical yet
mounted here. Each costume costs some
$40,000 to begin with.
“With La Cage," he explains, “you
have to give the audience their money’s
worth and then some. You can hype a
show to the sky but, ultimately, it’s the
word of mouth that counts.
“La Cage gives them every sequin
but underneath there is an emotional
level which will appeal not just to
regular theatregoers but to mums and
dads who would not normally go to the
theatre.”
Carr’s attention to detail on pro-
ductions can drive staff to distraction.
On an opening night, he will check and
double check everything from the music
to the number and neatness of the
waiters who are to serve the champagne
afterward.
“There’s a lot of work and aggrava-
tion in theatre. But a hit in the theatre is
more exciting than in the movies
because it is a living thing,” Carr says.
“The New York cast of La Cage is
like a family. It’s a tremendously
exhausting musical with jazz, ballet
and acrobatics. But everyone signed to
do a second season.”
The Australian cast is the youngest in
the world, with members culled from all
over the country. Carr himself refrained
from casting the Australian talent.
“I have lots of actor friends I’ve met
here on my previous visits like
Gordon Chater, Reg Livermore and
Garry McDonald; I didn’t want my
personal opinions to interfere,” he says.
Because Her Majesty’s is similar in
structure to the Palace, the look and
feeling of La Cage in Sydney will be
almost identical to its Broadway
counterpart.
That most Australians are unaware
of Carr’s impressive credentials in
theatrical production does not bother
the man. “I come here as a visitor with a
certain amount of glamor and Holly-
wood and that’s fine. I go on The Mike
Walsh Show and goof around with
Danny La Rue. I don’t think people
want to see me do or say serious things.”
In traditional Los Angeles style, he
wears tennis shoes without socks. Ment-
ally, I note that he has streaked his hair
blond: An unnecessary observation. In
his relentless self-accounting, he tells
me so anyway.
The endless anecdotes weave Audrey
Hepburn, Burt Reynolds, Robert
Redford, Farah Fawcett and Joan
Collins into his private and professional
life. In the telling, most of it seems to
have happened last week.
Just before the interview concludes,
the phone rings. It is international. It is
Carr’s Los Angeles houseguard inform-
ing him of the latest grosses there for La
Cage. Carr is smiling broadly. □

Our wartime
history leaps
back to life
By ALAN REID
WINSTON CHURCHILL was the
villain of World War II as far as
Australia was concerned, viewing the
country as relatively unimportant in the
overall global picture. He was prepared
to see Australia taken by the Japanese,
confident that it would be re-taken
when the allies achieved final victory.
That is how writers David William-
son and Denis Whitburn have por-
trayed Churchill in The Last Bastion,
the multi-million dollar effort to depict
on film the perilous 1941-43 days.
Australia faced the threat of Japanese
invasion and John Curtin sought as
ALP Prime Minister to mobilise the
resources which would enable the
nation to survive.
Commissioned by Network Ten
Williamson and Whitburn have written
a six-hour mini-series crowded with
personalities who loomed large in those
days. Just a few:
■ Robert Menzies, prime minister
from 1939 to 1941;
■ Arthur Fadden, who took the helm
for 40 days, when Menzies fell;
■ Curtin whom the playwrights have
turned into a meekly ox-like, patient
figure but who nevertheless was a
stubbornly effective antagonist for
Churchill;
■ H.V. “Doc” Evatt, an enigma if
ever there were one, the High Court
judge who stepped down from the
bench to turn ambitious politician;
■ Ben Chifley, the pipe-smoking
former engine-driver-cum philosopher
Curtin’s closest and earthiest adviser;
■ Eddie Ward, the firebrand from
East Sydney irrepressible, class-con-
scious, holding inflexibly to the policy
“When in doubt, veer left”; and
■ United States’ General Douglas
MacArthur, allied commander-in-chief
in the area, backed by Curtin.
The Last Bastion identifies Churchill
with disasters and misjudgments. He
sends allied forces, including Aus-
tralians, to Greece without adequate air
cover and they suffer heavy loss when
the Germans drive them out. Singapore
will hold against Japanese attack, he
trumpets. When the island fortress is in
its military death throes he castigates
advisers for not telling him what they
had apparently told him repeatedly
that Singapore was equipped only to
resist a naval assault.
Churchill is depicted and you can
justify this by examining the cables of
the time between him and Curtin of
giving Curtin misleading information
and of being devious and deceitful.
Churchill is shown as wholly intent on
the policy of “Beat Hitler First” and,
impatiently unresponsive to Australian
fears of Japanese invasion of the
mainland.
In the mini-series, Churchill’s exas-
peration takes on a distinctly anti-
Australian tone. He accuses Australia of
cowardice when it insists upon troops
being relieved in the siege of Tobruk.
But what can you expect? the screen
Churchill wonders. Australia has poor
stock. Blood will out. These are de-
scendants of convicts and the Irish.
The series deals dramatically with
Churchill’s attempt to hang on to the
7th Division for service in the Middle
East and his last-ditch bid to have them
diverted to the defence of Burma. But
Curtin proves unmovably stubborn. The
7th Division returns to Australia, the
Japanese are halted on the Kokoda
Trail in New Guinea, the Japanese
menace starts to recede.
Michael Blakemore plays Curtin as a
long-suffering, patient worrier, a man
who felt deeply his responsibility for the
decisions he hated but which were
forced upon him by exigencies of war.
Curtin was not always patient and
long-suffering. I saw him turn on dis-
plays of temperament which would
shame a film star. He could be cutting
and very authoritative, necessary quali-
ties to survive and be successful as he
had been in the tough environment of
the ALP machine. He was no shrinking
violet. But he was a worrier, a highly
sensitive man who brooded over his
decisions and accepted responsibility
for them in a personal sense.
I was travelling with Curtin to
Brisbane by train once while the 7th
Division was at sea on its way back to
Australia. It was night. I had dozed off
but awoke and went into the carriage
corridor. At the end of it, staring into
the night, was Curtin. Beads of sweat
were on his forehead and trickling
down his face. I thought he was ill.
I said: “Are you all right, Prime
Minister?” He said that he was but he
had had a terrible nightmare. Enemy
submarines had got into a convoy of
Australian ships. Ships were blazing.
Men were jumping into a burning sea.
The men were dying. “And I’m respons-
ible,” said Curtin. “It’s my decision that
sends them to their death.”
I woke Don Rodgers who officially
was Curtin’s press secretary but who
filled the larger role of Man Friday.
Rodgers, one of the girls from Curtin’s
staff, myself and Curtin played bridge
for the rest of the night in an attempt to
get the Prime Minister’s mind off his
worries for a while. But he clearly was
not interested in the cards; his thoughts
were elsewhere.
The series might not be a completely
precise history but it is compelling
entertainment and a riveting attempt by
the writers to bring to life their in-
terpretation of history. □

FILMS
Robespierre
misses out on
a head start
By SANDRA HALL
THE FRENCH LEFT, which does not
like foreigners mucking about with its
revolution (even 190 years after the
event), gave Andrzej Wajda’s film
Danton a rough reception when it
opened in Paris last year.
Wajda, after all, had per-
suaded the French govern-
ment to invest both money
and goodwill in a film which
appropriates a significant slice
of French history and uses it
as a convenient backdrop
against which to construct
what is in essence an allegory
about contemporary Poland’s
relationship with the Soviet
Union. The result, says the
left, is a melodrama which
gives scant consideration to
the true concerns of French
revolutionary history while
perpetrating the doctrinal
crime of confusing Robe-
spierre’s politics with those of
Stalin.
The French people do not
come out of it too well, either,
rhubarbing away ineffectually in the
background while Robespierre and
Danton quarrel over the question of
who loves them best. And then there are
the meetings of the Convention which
have a hint of the schoolyard about
them, as if Wajda might have taken in-
spiration from Ronald Searle.
So Danton is best viewed lightly as a
rousing moral tale about two bullyboys
one a swot, the other a noisy show-off
who eats too many lollies and the way
they come to grief while competing to
become leader of the gang.
Robespierre already is ahead on
points when the film opens, with
Danton apprehensively eyeing the guil-
lotines as he rattles by on his coach after
a late night. The bread queues are long,
the weather is awful (Wajda relies a
great deal on rain as a mood-modifier)
and Danton’s most fervent supporter,
Camille Desmoulins (Patrice Chereau),
has just had his printing press raided
and his latest pamphlet protesting the
excesses of the Public Safety Committee
confiscated by Robespierre’s chief flun-
key.
But Danton still has one enormous
advantage, in being played by Gerard
Depardieu who hams so energetically
and inventively that you really need two
viewings in order to take everything in.
He mews, he coos, he cajoles, he slurps,
he shouts, he claps on his wig at one
moment and snatches it off at the next
all in all, an action-packed and intermit-
tently hilarious performance. Although
Wojciech Pszoniak, the Polish actor
who plays Robespierre, does his best
sweating profusely, recoiling dramati-
cally from human contact and (with the
help of some particularly sickly color
tones) taking the epithet “sea green in-
corruptible” as literally as possible he
does not have a chance. It is Danton’s
film.
Hence the disgust of the left.
Wojciech Pszoniak, as Robespierre, in Danton
“Have you ever seen Dallas ?” Mar-
cel Ophuls asked Wajda in an interview
which reads more like a scolding ad-
ministered for lacking correct socialist
attitudes (in almost every case, the ques-
tions are longer than the answers): “...
in the west, all the publicity and all the
market research pushes us in the direc-
tion of Dantonesque vulgarity, of pleb-
eian voracity. It’s an existential greed
that is quite the opposite of a real love
of life.”
Yet to believe, as Ophuls does, that
Wajda has set out to make a hero of
Danton is to be excessively literal about
both the script’s line on the character
and Depardieu’s performance. Danton
may be a scene-stealer but he is an inor-
dinately stupid one misinterpreting
the state of play at every turn, consist-
ently under-estimating his enemies and
over-estimating both his talents as an
orator and his popularity among the
people.
Even at the end, ego triumphs. In the
film, as in history, Danton tells his ex-
ecutioners to hold up his head and show
it to the people. “It is worth it.”
Wajda may not have taken the
French as seriously as they might have
wished but the tricky realities of Polish
communism seem to have made him
sufficiently knowledgeable about the
effects of power not to need a lecture on
the subject.
Danton may not be “correct” but it is
enormously stimulating and, in its high-
ly-colored and slightly ramshackle way,
rousingly iconoclastic.
ICEMAN, which seems to have con-
firmed Australian film-maker Fred
Schepisi’s reputation in America as a
thoughtful and inventive director with a
flair for visual grandeur, begins wonder-
fully, ends with the same sense of excite-
ment and suffers in the middle from
having stereotypes instead of charac-
ters. Schepisi is in trouble
when he leaves his glacial
landscapes behind and moves
inside.
He has a great idea and a
beautifully conceived central
performance by John Lone, as
a prehistoric man cryogenic-
ally frozen and brought back
to life after 40,000 years, but
neither quite makes up for the
cliches which surround them.
Schepisi and scriptwriter
John Drimmer are offering up
a fairly glib argument between
science and culture.
Lindsay Crouse, as the
primly dedicated Dr Brady,
wants the iceman for
whatever clues he can impart
to medical science about the
secrets of cryogenic preserva-
tion.
The equally idealistic Dr Shephard,
an anthropologist played by the in-
sufferably wide-eyed and artfully
dishevelled Timothy Hutton, would
much rather sit around and get to know
him. “Maybe his spirit can teach us
more than his flesh,” Shephard says pi-
ously. And, if Dr Brady is arguing,
Schepisi is not.
The script introduces a linguist who
investigates the iceman’s speech pat-
terns with the aid of a computer and
Shephard embarks on an anthropologi-
cal detective game which would be in-
triguing but for Hutton’s hyped-up reac-
tion to every discovery.
The answer, when it emerges, is high-
ly intriguing and touchingly plausible
and allows Schepisi to escape once
more to the outdoors to mount his daz-
zling finish. By then, however, it is al-
most too late.
Danton: in Sydney at the Academy, Pad-
dington. Soon for other states.
Iceman: in Sydney at the Pitt Centre; in
Melbourne at the Russell; in Brisbane at
the Albert. Soon for other states.

Cutting the
anaesthesia
out of opera
The Maestro's Company: making opera more intelligible, entertainingly
By RON SAW
I WOULD just as happily spend a day
with my dentist, having my teeth drilled
to the very jawbones, as sit through an
hour of grand opera.
Joan Sutherland, Renata Tebaldi, etc
may be splendid sopranos but I just
don’t know what the hell they are
shrieking about and when people have
tried to explain various operatic plots I
have felt my jaw thud on my breastbone
from dazed disbelief.
Life is too short to be wasted strug-
gling with such soggy soap.
I could, I suppose, change my mind
when, for instance, The Bulletin is
printed or Dynasty is played in Italian
or French or (rather more likely) early
in January when Channel 0/28 begins
running The Maestro’s Company.
Made at the old Bijou Theatre in
Sydney’s Balmain, by Independent Pro-
ductions, the 13-part series is the prod-
uct of an idea by the brilliant Marcia
Hatfield who became famous by anima-
ting (of all things) toothbrushes.
The singing in this case is by Suther-
land, Tebaldi, Resnik, Mario Del Mon-
aco, et al and the acting praise be is
from puppets who explain what is going
on, cutting out the more anaesthetic
passages so that a complete opera takes
25 minutes, and two real live children
as the alter egos of clods such as you
and me.
The sound is from original Decca re-
cordings, photography simply brilliant.
But how, you nag, do they get away
with it? How? Think of The Muppets
and you are three parts of the way there.
Puccini, Rossini, Verdi and the rest
of the boys from the fruit shop may be
spinning in their graves but the bottom
line is that TV has made opera not only
intelligible but also wonderfully enter-
taining.
TELEVISION continues to reflect the
national ethos whether we like it or not.
Most channels last week ran heart-
rending news film of wretched, fly-
blown Ethiopians dying of starvation
with the additional information that the
pyres probably would devour six mil-
lion corpses.
What bad luck it was that on that
night we switched, once more, to NSW
doctors whining about how badly their
lilies were painted (ABC).
Then it was whaddya know real,
black people in good old Oz: half-a-
dozen Pintubi, one named Thomas,
wander in from somewhere and the na-
tion is agog. And they weren’t even
starving.
THE Ten Network’s coverage of the
Chicago marathon proved just how wit-
less sports commentary can become.
For instance, two men whose future
lies in some good non-speaking field of
sport were discussing Steve Jones the
young Welshman who won and who
had been described on-screen as “Steve
Jones (Wales)” about every five minutes
for the past two hours. One of them still
managed to call him Smith.
Never mind, said the other, “they’re
all Smiths and Joneses, these
Englishmen.”
THERE IS a fact with which we, the
public in general, and the Ten Network
in particular, will just have to come to
grips ...
Soon now well, comparatively
soon: in the next four or five years.
Haste tends to bring on a crise de foie
M*A*S*H will have to be brought to a

Pause. Sharp intake of breath. Incred-
ulity. Who in hell is this clown? Which of
the eccentric, irresponsible trails of
journalism is he exploring? Ah, the hell
with him. Turn the page to . . .
No! Stop! Don’t turn the page at all.
This is serious!
The network began showing MASH
(if you will forgive the deletion of those
damned asterisks) in February 1973. No
fewer than 246 episodes were made in
the following 10 years and every one of
them has been used at least once.
Once! How mad. I’m prepared to bet
that you that strange, bug-eyed, hy-
dra-headed, ill-tempered, pedantic pest,
The Average Viewer cannot think of
one you have not seen at least four
times.
I, for one, like Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Blake (played by Maclean
Stevenson) more than I do subsequent
commanding officer Colonel Sherman
Potter (Harry Morgan). It is mad slap-
stick compared with occasionally weepy
homespinning. But both are great.
ARE both great? Certainly. It must
be, in the United States, five years since
Stevenson appeared in MASH but here
he keeps turning up like the flowers that
bloom in the spring, tra-la, and there are
no plans to stop him doing so.
So one keeps on trying to be an
aficionado. Why did they stop calling
Margaret Houlihan “Hotlips”? Frank
Burns, too, was (is) mad but Charles
Winchester gives the cast better balance
... I prefer Trapper to BJ ... Hawkeye
is not always funny but MASH would
be mush without him . . . Chacun a son
gout.
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with repeating a good show. I do not say
that MASH should be tossed in the gar-
bage can and burned. But I don’t think
even the most passionate MASH-fan-
cier would object if it were to be given a
rest, brought back maybe about five
years from now.
It has been one of the greatest com-
edy series in the history of TV.
But enough is enough. □


THEATRE
Even the
shock value
has gone
By GLENDA THOMPSON
DOROTHY HEWETT was one of the
few Australian women dramatists of the
19705, according to Leslie Rees, the
author of A History of Australian
Drama. Rees says this was a watershed
era because in previous decades “both
sexes regarded the world as their
oyster.”
He suggests a reason for the direc-
tion plays took in the 70s. He says:
“Most effective writing for this medium
has adopted, in respect of sexual and
marital topics, a stance and an idiom
too free and outspoken to be attractive
to women with their heritage of modesty
and traditional fear of being thought
loose-tongued or ‘cheap’.”
Without arguing with Rees on that
point, we can agree with him that
Hewett does not feel these constraints.
She has always cocked her snoot at
convention.
Her life flouted the norm: she
became a communist in the 1940 s and
had children out of wedlock. Her work
is not exactly conformist, either. Who
can tell whether Hewett rebelled against
established formulas or whether she
lived and wrote in a manner she could
not restrain? Perhaps it was simply self-
indulgence.
Her life is her own business, yet it
apparently comes out vividly in her
work
Her mother’s death in Western
Australia sparked her 1976 one-act play
The Golden Oldies which is getting a
Nimrod revival at Sydney’s Seymour
Centre, directed by Peter Kingston.
It looks at family. It features the
deaths of the grandmother and her
daughter, both senile at the end, and
involves two grand-daughters one of
whom, Becca, is never seen but by the
end has committed suicide. Two ac-
tresses play four parts and the rest,
including the men, are represented by
dummies.
This play might have had a little
shock value seven years ago when it was
first produced in Melbourne. But we are
all a bit more blase these days so that
the scant second-night audience felt
more effect from the explicit giving of
an enema than from some of the
dialogue.
Carole Skinner, known to the wider
populace as a Prisoner on TV, carried
off the bouncy roles of nurse-to-
grandma and housekeeper-to-mum with
more than a slice of the ham.
The more demanding mother-daugh-
ter tasks fell to Helen McDonald who
has had a brush with Hewett in the past
she played the lead, Sally Banner, in
the original production of The Chapel
Perilous, Hewett’s best-known work.
McDonald did quite well here, apart
from being strident rather than strained
in the first scene where she is oppressed
with looking after the inert Nana at
home: “She spoke once last autumn.
She said one word, ‘Bum!’ ”
What falls flat here is not the manner
in which the work is handled but the
play itself. After a start which succeeds
in getting some humor out of awful
situations, the impetus runs down in a
series of haphazard spots, the action
dissipated in vague directions.
The characters are pretty doleful.
The women are plagued with romantic
dreams in the midst of their unsavory
reality, probably echoing the author’s
disillusionment.
The mother never had an orgasm
and developed the “I’ve got a head-
If you want a really mild cigarette...

ache” syndrome to avoid sex. The
visible daughter is stitched up and, in
her own eyes, lacks backbone.
Only the image of the absent Becca
has any joyousness, characterising a
kind of wild freedom which the mother
and other daughter envy deep down.
Becca has long golden hair, Hewett’s
trademark and the telltale sign that this
represents her gilded youth.
The author has made gestures in
common with more formal feminists,
such as Germaine Greer and Erica
Jong. But Greer and Jong have virtually
recanted many of their early assertions
as Marcel Proust said: A powerful
idea communicates some of its strength
to him who challenges it.
Hewett gives one the impression that
she is (or was at the time of writing The
Golden Oldies) a desperately bitter
person trying to come to grips with a
burden of disappointment. Let us hope
that she has exorcised some of that by
now and can get on and produce more
telling work. But does her therapy have
to be inflicted on the theatregoer?
Even Shakespeare is a bit racy but he
endures for values other than that. In a
phrase that all too soon has lost its
shock value and become commonly
accepted as useful perhaps proving
the value of explicitness it is all a bit
of a wank. □

BOOKS
Blinkered
insights into
Europe
By EDMUND CAMPION
The great Museum: the Re-
presentation of History, by Donald
Horne. Pluto Press, $12.95.
DONALD HORNE takes office as
chairman of the Australia Council in a
few weeks. Much of its work in further-
ing cultural pursuits is done by its
boards and their project officers. Quite
correctly, the chairman does not involve
himself in their activities; his function is
wider and more communal it is to
speak up in public for culture, to get
Australians thinking about what they
want from life.
Because he is a respected even
admired Australian intellectual,
Horne can do what no mere politician
could attempt to do: He can become a
sort of secular archbishop, challenging
and stirring a community-wide response
to the big questions in our national
culture. This is an historic opportunity
that comes to few people.
What will he say? One can only
guess. Some clues appear, however, in
his latest book which is the most
philosophical he has written since But
What If there Are no Pelicans?
The Great Museum con-
tains Horne’s reflections on
his experience of Europe.
In pursuit of what Europe
was all about, Horne visited
almost every capital east
and west and much else
besides. Admirers of his prose
will find here the familiar
attention to illuminating de-
tail, the quickening irony and
the love of a good argument. I
think that I have read all his
books but I noticed for the
first time in The Great
Museum his powers as a
descriptive writer. When he
writes about a painting, you
see the very thing.
What really interests
Horne in Europe is the way in
which monuments and art
museums celebrated the
political life of their societies.
Sub-titled The Re-Presenta-
tion of History, he says that the
book is about power and
imagination or public culture. Monu-
ments put up to celebrate an idea in one
century can celebrate something else in
the next. Typical of Horne’s acumen is
that he notices the absence of some
monuments there are none, for in-
stance, to Stalin’s camps.
The novelty of the book is the
attention he pays to eastern Europe.
Much of what he writes about the
socialist countries will be unknown to
readers here.
The book carries no pictures so you
just have to take his word for it when,
for example, he says that 13th century
paintings in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria
start the renaissance long before the
west got wind of it. True or false, it
certainly is challenging.
Some challenges are overblown. It is
not true that Goya’s Disasters Of War is
the first famous celebration of a modern
atrocity Jacques Callot had done
that two centuries earlier. Is Avignon
nostalgic? To me, it is no more nostalgic
than a jail. Nor, in my experience, are
pictures in art galleries “remote in their
frames.” Rather, they seem to me to be
remarkably accessible.
More seriously damaging to the
book is Horne’s constant misuse of
words such as “sacred” and “holy” to
mean “special.” For a cultural historian,
these are sharp-edged tools; if you
mishandle them, even ironically, they
will cut you. Thus, when he says of a
factory siren that signalled a strike in
1933: “It is one of the holy relics of
Romania,” questions crowd one’s mind.
Do they carry it in procession? Use it to
cure illnesses? To ward off plague or
pestilence? To get in touch with the
numinous? What can he mean?
Donald Horne: more to Europe than politics
Such devaluation of language points
to the most serious flaw in the book: It is
about only part of the European ex-
perience.
Horne is generous and understand-
ing when he writes about religion but he
is not really interested in it. Typically,
when he looks at a monument it is a
monument about dying for a cause
not about death. In his eyes, the
cathedrals put ordinary people in their
social place, rather than lift them and
allow them to transcend their day-by-
day existence.
Fair enough Europe is in the eye of
the beholder. Horne’s Europe is in-
tensely political and, after all, politics is
and has been a very large part of the
European experience. But not the whole
of it. There continues to be more to
Europe than politics.
It gives me no joy to say this but the
author of The great Museum seems like
a man in a rose garden who hast lost his
sense of smell. □
Surprises in
Brookner’s
winning novel
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Hotel du Lac, by Anita Brookner.
Jonathan Cape, $21.95.
The only Problem, by Muriel
Spark. The Bodley Head, $16.95.
HOTEL du LAC is a very clever novel
witty, urbane, with a plot that never
gives itself away. It is set in a hotel on
the shores of Lake Geneva as the tourist
season ends and the shutters are about
to be put up.
The “long cardigan” worn by
principal character Miss Edith Hope
does not sound much like the present
but another of the characters uses the
colloquialism “Do me a favor,” so
perhaps the time is now.
This novel has just won the Booker
Prize, presented annually in Britain
from a fund whose source is income
from sugar, the Booker family having
grown cane in the Caribbean when both
sugar and labor were cheap. The award
has, by astute publicity, assumed great
prestige over the past few years. Novels
in its heavily publicised short list are
guaranteed reviews in serious news-
papers, if not sales in bookshops. The
kind of book that rates the award
depends, as in all such contests, on who
is on the judging panel.
Well, Edith Hope in her long car-
digan is at the Hotel du Lac because of a
fiasco in her private life. A writer of not-
quite-best-selling romantic novels, she

is taking a breather from home to the
relief of her friends.
It is a well-worn trick to use a
collection of people shut up somewhere
as the basis for events and very often
it is a trick that works, if the writer is
good enough. Brookner is quite good
enough.
The Hotel du Lac harbors an ageing
deaf French countess relegated by her
bored children, an aristocratic Eng-
lishwoman with a small but bad-
tempered dog, a rich consumer named
Mrs Pusey and her daughter Jennifer.
The guests go for walks and shop-
ping, take coffee in the local cafe and
discover that nobody is quite what they
seem.
The lapse from good behaviour that
brought Edith to the hotel emerges in
intriguing little flashbacks as she
reviews her life, at the same time trying
to finish a novel. The last paragraph in
the book contains the clue to Edith’s
future.
English women novelists such as
Brookner and Muriel Spark whose
reputation is such that her name ap-
pears on the dustjacket above the title
and in much bigger type are the true
defenders of the language which they
use both imaginatively and precisely.
Spark’s book is wonderfully free of cant
and of the windy and the woolly.
The problem of the title is: Why did
God give the biblical Job such a bad
time when all Job wanted was to be
good?
Worrying at this like a dog with a
difficult bone is a rich Canadian named
Harvey who takes himself to a cottage
near Epinal in France to work it out.
(Of course, it is a problem which has
worried a few people before Harvey.)
Harvey has a beautiful young
English wife named Effie, from whom
he is separated and she has a sister
named Ruth who is married to a young
clergyman who becomes a successful
actor. These four bounce off each other,
in love and aggression. The cool ones
are Harvey and his creator, the author.
Harvey sits in his cottage under the
Vosges mountains, working on his
monograph about Job, while his “com-
forters” like Job’s come and go.
The actor, a lawyer, his Aunt Pet, police
(including a policewoman posing as a
maid) bring news of Effie who is
thought to have become a pistol-packin’
terrorist connected with the Quebec
freedom fighters though why she
would be fighting in France instead of
in Canada is not clear.
The police think that her gang of
raiders is simply collecting money via
guns. Harvey disbelieves these stories
and the police disbelieve him.
The reader is free to disbelieve
everything and to conclude that Spark is
simply playing games. □
BOOK BULLETIN
The sweep of the censor
by Patricia Rolfe
THEY SHOOT Writers, don’t they? has
chapters by many of the world’s leading
writers; Australia does not get a men-
tion anywhere. We may praise Heaven
for this slight because it is a collection
of pieces from the international maga-
zine Index on Censorship. Australia has
at times been an enthusiastic censor and
one never knows when there may be an-
other outbreak but it almost always has
been puritanical protection and not pol-
itical suppression.
The collection, edited by George
Theiner, will be published by Faber next
month at $9.95. Contributors include
Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie,
Milan Kundera, Andre Brink, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and Mario Vargas Llosa.
Some of the other names may be unfam-
iliar here; Index casts a wide net.
Nineteen countries are represented,
with Czechoslovakia (six entries) and
South Africa (four) having the dubious
honor of greatest frequency.
The book does not ignore the sort of
censorship with which we have been
plagued here. Kurt Vonnegut has written
a chapter on his Slaughterhouse Five be-
ing ceremonially burned by order of a
school board in North Dakota in 1973,
an oddity at the time but more common
in these Reagan years.

1980 and carries 127 color plates and

McCulloch began work on the ency-

fairly stormy period as art critic of the
Melbourne Argus, but it really took
shape after he joined the Herald. The
1968 edition was reprinted the follow-

NEIGHBORHOOD
Foreign policy problems
coming close to home
For years, even decades, Australia has been closing its eyes to foreign problems. Now, says
STUARTINDER, there are two matters close to home demanding immediate attention and
Australia has no firm policy on dealing with them.
ONE OF THE prob-
lems with foreign poli-
cies is that they can be
overtaken by events.
Australia’s foreign pol-
icy makers are facing
that problem with New
Caledonia and they
may be closer than they
think to the same prob-
lem with Papua New
Guinea.
In New Caledonia,
November 18 is the date
which may record the
end of Australia’s New
Caledonia policy and as
yet there is nothing to replace it. In
Papua New Guinea, the signing this
week of a new PNG-Irian Jaya border
agreement between PNG and Indonesia
merely underscores a problem that
won’t go away merely because more
words have been put on paper. And,
should it blow up, Australia has no
specific policy.
What New Caledonia and the PNG
border problems have in common is
that both have been building for years
but the crunch could come swiftly.
New Caledonia goes to the polls on
November 18 to elect a new 42-member
territorial assembly which will be given
a greater degree of autonomy, leading
to a referendum in 1989. One of the op-
tions at the referendum is to be indepen-
dence.
But the four main pro-independence
parties, under the banner of the Front
de Liberation Nationale Kanak et
Socialiste, will boycott the election and
set up their own provisional govern-
ment on December 1 and rename New
Caledonia Kanaky. After that, they say,
communication with Paris will be
through the provisional government.
They say they cannot work within
the system because the system is not
working for them.
As the front is believed to represent a
majority of the Kanak population of
New Caledonia, the split is serious.
The problem facing Australia and its
PNG Foreign Minister Rabbie
Namaliu: not satisfied
ANZUS partners is
whether a provisional
government can be
recognised. But there
can be no answer to that
yet. The matters that
will first have to resolve
themselves in the next
few weeks are:
■ How effective will
the boycott be? Will it
badly disrupt the elec-
tion?
■ In the circum-
stances of the boycott,
how much electoral
support can the front be
judged to have?
■ Who will make up the provisional
government and what support will it
have?
■ What will be the attitude of the
French government in December?
By December 1, one way or another,
Australia’s policy on New Caledonia
will have been over-
taken by events.
That policy, shared
by New Zealand, is the
one confirmed at the
latest South Pacific For-
um, held in Tuvalu in
late August: It is that
the referendum should
be brought forward and
meanwhile additional
administrative and pol-
itical powers should be
transferred to the terri-
tory.
But the bottom line
of the policy is the sig-
nificant one and that is:
“Australia urges all the involved parties
to continue to work toward the peaceful
political evolution of New Caledonia.”
In other words, Australia hopes that
the New Caledonia crisis can work itself
out without Australia having to pick
sides between a French socialist govern-
ment and what might well be an
unstoppable nationalist movement in
New Caledonia.
It is a dilemma no government wants
to face, given the scrambling of the
demographic eggs in New Caledonia
where Europeans and other island
minorities have lived for years.
If the provisional government turns
out to be popularly supported, Australia
will have image problems if it is unsym-
pathetic. But Australia must have sym-
pathy in any case for those trying to
work within the system including
Nidoish Naisseline’s pro-independence
Kanak party which believes that victory
for the Kanaks can best be achieved
from the inside. He is not boycotting the
elections.
The next few weeks will sort out
some crucial facts, although they may
not resolve Australia’s policy dilemma.
Stripped of pretence, Australia’s pol-
icy on the Papua New Guinea border
with Irian Jaya is the same as its policy
on New Caledonia. That is, let’s pray
hard that it continues to work itself out
so that we don’t have to make an un-
Nidoish Naisseline: pro-inde-
pendence but from inside
comfortable choice.
“Dialogue” is what
Australia advocates as
the solution to the bor-
der problems dia-
logue between PNG
and Indonesia.
Australia’s view is
that the border is a mat-
ter between PNG and
Indonesia. Australia is
prepared to act as “hon-
est broker” if either side
asks.
What would Austra-
lia do if Indonesian
forces deliberately
crossed the border?
Nobody can say because there is no
specific policy on it. Australia does not
have a defence treaty with PNG. The
nature of the defence relationship is
spelled out in the joint communique of
1977, reaffirmed by the Hawke govern-
ment last year, and what it says is that
both governments may “consult” at
the request of either about security
matters.


Border-hopping refugees in PNG: a problem but not the main one
GARTH NETTHE IM/RAPPORT
Papua New Guinea’s border rela-
tions with Indonesia are better than
they were but not good.
The matter of the 10,000 Irianese
border crossers is not a serious obstacle
to good relations.
Where relations have become
strained is over whether Indonesian jets
have crossed into PNG airspace, which
the Indonesians deny; over whether In-
donesian troops have destroyed PNG
gardens and a garden village they pre-
sumably suspected was being used by
rebels which Indonesia again denies.
It is because of what it sees as con-
tinued Indonesian humbug that PNG
deliberately raised the border question
in the United Nations General As-
sembly three weeks ago. Foreign Minis-
ter Rabbie Namaliu said PNG was not
satisfied with most of the replies it got.
Indonesia was stung by this public
exposure of the border problem and
Foreign Minister Mochtar retorted that
PNG was making too many complaints
and some constituted “interference in
Indonesia’s domestic affairs.”
This significant remark will now
make it harder for frank exchanges on
border problems. PNG officials, for in-
stance, have become convinced that the
main reason for the recent rush of Irian
Jaya villagers across the border is that
independent rebel bands are consolida-
ting into fewer but stronger and larger
groups and putting pressure on village
people to choose sides the govern-
ment or the rebels.
The time may come when Australia’s
policy of not taking sides in Papua New
Guinea will also be overtaken by the
march of events. □
THE PACIFIC
New twist in
New Zealand’s
ANZUS problems
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE TOP United States military com-
mander in the Pacific region, Admiral
William J. Crowe, last week signalled
a cooling-off period between the US and
New Zealand to reconcile conflicting
attitudes toward the ANZUS treaty
which also involves Australia.
Crowe, speaking from Honolulu in a
television press conference with Pacific
Basin journalists, said that it was hard
to see “how the US can support a
security alliance whole-
heartedly when its ab-
ility to interact with the
forces of the other
members of that alli-
ance is constrained.”
But it was “still a little
bit premature” to talk
about a new bilateral
treaty between Aus-
tralia and the US.
“Both the US and
New Zealand under-
stand the seriousness of
the dialogue now going
on,” Crowe said.
“We’re working hard to
sort it out.”
Crowe was taking a
softer line than have
US Admiral William J. Crowe:
conciliatory attitude
recent Washington administration fig-
ures who have served a virtual
ultimatum on New Zealand to permit
visits by nuclear-powered ships or leave
the ANZUS alliance.
Asked whether he favoured a bilat-
eral treaty between Australia and the
US to replace ANZUS, Crowe said:
“We’re working hard to sort the situa-
tion out.
“It’s just too early to talk about
alternatives.”
He described the alliance as “an
important pillar of the entire free world
network of alliances that contributes to
deterrence and stability.”
ANZUS, he said, was important not
only to the participating countries of
Australia, New Zealand and the US but
also to the island nations of the South-
west Pacific.
“They feel the entire region comes
under ANZUS and the entire region
benefits from the shield,” Crowe said.
“It is important to explore with the
government of New Zealand our
military to military relationships how
much we depend on and rely on exer-
cises and joint operations. We then have
to look for ways we can continue to
maintain our effectiveness and co-
operation.”
Crowe also said he did not believe
the deteriorating political situation in
the Philippines would make it any more
urgent to forge a new link with
Australia alone. US defence planners in
the past have suggested Western
Australia as a “fall-back” if the US is
denied access to its pivotal Subic Bay
naval and Clark air bases in the Manila
area.
“I do not believe that we will lose our
access, no matter how the present pro-
blems in the Philippines sort themselves
out,” Crowe said. “And I’m confident
they will. The issue has not been
politicised. We will retain that security
relationship and will still be able to
support and manage a very effective
forward defence in that part of the
world.”
Another conciliatory
signal to New Zealand
and Pacific nations with
nuclear worries came
when the American
forces chief defined US
attitudes toward the
South Pacific nuclear-
free zone proposal
which Australia has
tabled at the South
Pacific Forum.
The basic American
concern, Crowe said,
was to ensure that in-
ternational laws
“high sea rights and
transit rights” were
respected. □


NEW ZEALAND
Move to sack
Muldoon
gathers force
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALAND’S National Party,
which has ruled the country for all but
six of the last 35 years, is fighting for
political survival in the wake of its
crushing defeat in the snap election last
July. As the popularity of Prime
Minister David Lange has soared he
won an approval rating of 75 percent in
the most recent opinion poll so have
the stocks of former Prime
Minister Sir Robert Muldoon
fallen. The politician hailed as
an economic miracle worker
not long after his landslide
victory in 1975 is now
regarded by party officials as a
political disaster area. Im-
mediately after his defeat
Muldoon reached an agree-
ment with his parliamentary
caucus that the leadership
should be reviewed next
February. In that review, he
said, it would be “unlikely”
that he would be a candidate.
Now the pressure is mounting
within the party to depose
Muldoon earlier than that.
Former Transport minister
George Gair leads a caucus
faction which wants the issue
decided before Christmas.
Activist Ruth Richardson, MP for
Selwin, is urging that a new leader
should be selected immediately after the
government presents its first budget, on
November 8. She says: “It is generally
recognised that the budget is a turning
point in the life of this government and
it should be a turning point in the life of
the National Party, too.”
Already candidates for the National
Party leadership are declaring them-
selves. First in the field is former Labor
minister Jim Bolger, a farmer from the
rugged King country in the central
North Island. Next to declare himself
has been Gair, perhaps the most ex-
perienced administrator, after Mul-
doon, in the opposition.
Yet to declare himself a candidate
but certain to be one is the 39-year-
old deputy leader of the party, Jim
McLay, who, like Gair, represents an
electorate on Auckland’s north shore.
McLay became deputy earlier this year
on the first ballot of a three-way contest.
Since then the composition of the cau-
cus has changed significantly, and his
opponents are not slow to draw a paral-
lei with the melancholy example of the
youthful Andrew Peacock taking over
the leadership of the Liberal Party in
Australia after Malcolm Fraser's depar-
ture. It was that example which per-
suaded some party strategists to argue
that Muldoon should be left in office
long enough to absorb all the obloquy
heaped on the previous government by
the rampant new administration.
The problem for the National Party
is that Muldoon has been such a domin-
ant figure that his would-be successors
have stood too long in his shadow.
Gair says the public clearly saw the
former government as a one-man band.
That perception had been reinforced by
Muldoon’s “his lot or my lot” glove-on-
the-mat challenge at the outset of the
election campaign. Further reinforce-
Muldoon: the one-man-band likely soon to be silenced
JOHN SELKIRK
ment of the one-man-band image had
come when Muldoon said before the
election that there were no successors to
himself suitable or available.
Says Gair: “When a party is in office
with a majority of one, who among the
others who might be suitable would be
so crass as to bring the government
down just to rebut the putdown? But we
are no longer in government by a
majority of one. We are in opposition
by a wide and daunting margin, and the
self-imposed muzzle of silence can be
put aside.”
While Muldoon has been blamed for
both the election defeat and the condi-
tion of the National Party, it has taken a
party mandarin, Sir George Chapman,
to argue forcefully that the party
troubles would not end with the over-
throw of Muldoon.
One of the major difficulties for the
Nationals is that the government has
moved into the centre of the political
spectrum, and the Nationals are com-
peting with two other parties on the
right. Where once it could claim to be a
broad spectrum party, it now resembles
a rural rump, with diminishing support
in the big urban regions. There is much
talk that the party must re-discover its
principles, which critics say it had
ceased to identify with in the last years
of the Muldoon regime. Yet the
National has always been a party of
pragmatists who, if they believed in the
capitalist system, did not hesitate to
extend the welfare state if it drew votes.
Even now, some of the pragmatists
believe they have only to wait for Labor
to make the kind of mistakes it did
between 1957 and 1960 and between
1972 and 1975 for the Nationals to
sweep back into office at the next
election. They are looking for a new
leader who can put the party together
again as a tidy political machine and as
an effective opposition in parliament.
But this time the party may
need more than cosmetic
changes. Over the years of the
Muldoon administration it
progressively alienated first
the young voters and then the
women’s vote. Where once it
could claim to be a pro-
gressive political party it has
become increasingly re-
actionary. Chapman says that
a “crunch” organisational
issue confronting the party is
the need for more women
MPs to give the parliamentary
team a more balanced
representation. He believes
changes to the party’s selec-
tion system are needed to
achieve this.
An equally important step,
according to Chapman, is to
say what the Nationals stand
for in terms every voter understands.
That may be the hard part for
politicians who are closely identified
with the Muldoon era.
The politician who might have been
able to revive the Nationals quickly,
quit parliament at the last election.
Derek Quigley had been a minister in
the Muldoon government but was
demoted after disagreeing with
Muldoon. Justifiably or not, he had
become the symbolic defender of the
National Party’s private enterprise
faith. Curiously, some saw in him the
qualities of a Muldoon in his early years
in politics. Quigley had not just the
philosophic qualifications but the
capacity to be the kind of lateral politi-
cal thinker who could have established
original positions in the now crowded
right-of-centre segment of the political
spectrum.
What the Nationals are missing are
the innovators and thinkers, the young
energetic activists, who can re-create the
party as a broad spectrum party.
Muldoonism has left many wounds
which could take a long time to heal. □


est Marketing
made simple for
speed and profit.
Test marketing is normally used
to minimise risks in new product
launches, but there are also frequent
opportunities to improve sales
performance or profitability of
existing brands by focusing them
more accurately against consumer
wants. In a controlled Adelaide test
market you can measure the effect on
sales volume and consumer and trade
attitudes of many variables in the
marketing mix. Things like product
variations, packaging changes,
alternative pricing, shelf merchandising variations, promotional
activity, alternative advertising creative approaches and different
advertising media weights. Sometimes a manufacturer will go
national with a new product but use a test area to gather detailed
information about the product’s performance so that any
necessary adjustments can be made in due course.
Generally, Australian test markets last for around six
y •
Y<
months. For most products this
allows time for the consumer
repurchasing pattern to be established
without unduly delaying the national
launch or allowing competitive pre-
emption. Of course the longer the
test can be allowed to run, the better
the data base obtained. An A. C.
Nielsen study of 141 test markets in
the U.S.A. and U.K. found that the
odds for correctly forecasting final
national sales results increased with
time. For instance, a two month test
has a I in 9 chance. Eight months improved the odds to 2 in
3 and ten months to 5 in 6. If you’d like to know more, arrange

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Customers still winning
the big car-rental war
Showdown (left to right): Thrifty’s Peter Burmeister, Avis’ Gordon Howlett, Budget’s John Stevens and Allen Dewhirst of Hertz
PETER BARR
The bitter battle between Australia’s big four motor vehicle rental firms continues to
rage despite some rationalisation in new airport contracts. As JOHN
STACKHOUSE explains, corporate clients are not among the casualties.
STATISTICALLY, the Australian rent-
a-car market is becoming more honest.
The joke in the travel industry a few
months ago was that, if you added up
everyone’s market share claims, you got
145 percent. Now they total to about
130 percent.
When executives of the top four
companies Budget, Avis, Hertz and
Thrifty gathered in the one room at
the Surfers Paradise Fishermen’s Wharf
convention centre recently, spectators
flocked to what promised to be the best
free-for-all since Nero thumbed-down
Roman gladiators.
They were not entirely disappointed.
No blood was spilled in the war of
words between Gordon Howiett, mana-
ging director of Avis Australia; John
Stevens, Queensland manager for
Budget (out of the Bob Ansett mould);
Allen Dewhirst, managing director of
Hertz; and Peter Burmeister who is the
new managing director of Thrifty.
That the organisers of the Ansett
Travel Writers’ seminar could get the
TWO VIEWS OF CAR
RENTAL MARKET SHARES

Others 7 14.2
... AND THE INDUSTRY
Value in dollars 140 million 120 million
four rivals into the same room at the
one time probably shows that a little of
the heat has vanished from what must
be one of Australia’s most competitive
industries and, thanks to Bob Ansett,
one of those most dominated by person-
ality.
One reason is the new airports con-
tracts, starting on July 1, which allow
access for the big four in exchange for
an 8.5 percent cut off the top of revenue
for the Department of Aviation. Austra-
lian Financial Review columnist Chanti-
cleer heralded the move this year in
terms of “Airports see the last of the car
rental cowboys” because, he reasoned,
equal access removes a historic cause of
friction between the operators. But
Chanticleer was being wildly optimistic.
All four still come out shooting from the
hip.
The new move is unlikely to deflate
those market share claims to anything
like a conventional 100 percent. For one
thing, airport rental revenues amount to
only about 50 to 60 percent of the Aus-
tralian car rental market (which Avis es-
timates at.sl2o million and Budget at
$l4O million), so lots of room is left for
rubbery figures.
Next, the official market-share fig-
ures (which were due around the end of
October) will not dissect airport busi-
ness by numbers of individual rentals;
they will instead give total revenues for
the first quarter, operator by operator.
The department’s interest obviously
is only in money. The industry would
like to know how the money is spent


how much comes from the business
traveller, how much from the tourist
and how much from other sources (such
as corporate fleets or a family renting a
car while the household “bomb” is be-
ing resuscitated at a service station), the
numbers in operators’ fleets and* the
number of individual rentals.
Probably the most interesting revel-
ation in the great Surfers confrontation
was the coy relationship between
Ansett’s Budget and Thrifty. Many
heard an echo of how young Bob
started in the cut-throat business.
When Ansett returned to Australia
(he had been a paratrooper in Japan,
with the United States army,
and had worked in selling
jobs in the US), he was given a
job by Australian rental car
pioneer the late Eric Mcllree
who thoughtfully had regis-
tered the names Avis, Budget,
Hertz and National in all
states.
Mcllree made Avis his
flagship and eventually al-
lowed Hertz of the US to win
back its name in this, country.
But he had a special role for
Budget. It was to be the el
cheapo competition for Avis,
operating out of city centres
and not airports and with a
small fleet. Mcllree fingered
Bob Ansett to launch this
Budget concept.
How Ansett moved it from
that lowly position, through
associations with Australian
Guarantee Corp Ltd and weil-
publicised rows with his
father the late Sir Reginald
Ansett, to the top of the heap
is one of the nation’s corpor-
ate legends. Bob Ansett is
Budget’s up-front man in all
its advertising and publicity,
as well as today’s virtual own-
er. Unfortunately, he was not
able to speak at Surfers (he
had just returned from an overseas trip)
but Ansett is one of Australia’s most
sought-after motivational speakers.
Now, the wheel has turned and
Ansett is a major shareholder in the
consortium which bought Thrifty from
founder Bernard Bruning (at a reported
$3 million or so). Others are Burmeister
and Stan Hamley, of Hamley Manage-
ment Services Pty Ltd which long has
held a big interest in Budget as well.
As Burmeister, a former Budget
executive, told the seminar: “We are the
smallest of the four major operators and
also offer the lowest cost. We don’t aim
to be the biggest but the best alternative
to the majors.”
The acquisition of Thrifty has al-
lowed Budget to become a pacesetter in
car hire rates in the normal market.
Hertz and Budget traditionally‘have
level-pegged and Avis, once the highest
of the three, now matches them. But
Ansett is protecting his rear with
Thrifty, just as his mentor Mcllree
sought to do in the 50s and 60s.
Avis, too, has had a chequered his-
tory in recent years. Sir Reginald Ansett
bought the company from Mcllree’s
heirs and it operated as part of Ansett
Transport Industries (ATI) Ltd through
the News Ltd and TNT Ltd takeover.
Eventually, it was sold off but maintains
marketing links with Ansett Airlines.
ATl’s Avis experience was disas-
trous. In the last round of bids when
Bob Ansett, of Budget: front man and virtual owner
the rental car company presence was
limited to two at each airport and oper-
ators tendered for representation, Avis
lost out to Hertz which over-bid at $8
million and Budget which succeeded at
about $3 million. Avis reportediy be-
cause of an internal foul-up at ATI
bid around $1 million and lost out on
major locations. ATI then sold out.
The new owners are Burns Philp Ltd
and the US Avis organisation.
Avis had about 50 percent of the
market before the 1979 airports disaster.
Now it claims 30 percent (see tables),
although the Budget camp gives it about
19 percent.
Howlett, working hard to give Avis a
new and competitive image, admits that
the industry as a whole has been a loss-
maker for years. “We can thank Hertz
for that,” he says.
Previous managements positioned
Avis at the top of the market in costs.
Howlett has brought it into line and
aims to compete on service and, as
others of the big three are doing, on top-
of-the-range cars. To drive the point
home, Howlett has a Mercedes 280 SE
available which rents at $l4O a day.
“Avis now intends to dominate once
more,” Howlett says.
He sees one of the strengths of Avis
as fast counter service and international
associations. As a result, he is moving
the company into inbound tourism, in
association with the airlines’ promotion
of fly-drive package tours.
The new Avis brochures, for
visitors to Australia and for
Australians going abroad,
promise stable rates in Austra-
lian dollars for the next 12
months which implies a risk
with the see-saw of currencies
in the region.
But Howlett warns that
costs are competitive and re-
turns low. He said he feared
service soon may be a casualty
in the Australian business.
If Avis was a disaster for
Ansett after 1979, Hertz was
(for TAA) the nearest thing to
a black hole in Australian
business as perceived by its
then joint owners, Mayne
Nickless and TAA. Allen
Dewhirst announced a change
in attitude with the phrase
“The blinkers are off.”
Hertz paid its $8 million-
plus in 1979 to win it repre-
sentation at all major airports.
While the Number One car
rental company worldwide
floundered in the aftermath of
the Australian economic
downturn, it lost big money.
Budget’s Ansett was quick
to claim that the loss would
total $l4 million by mid-1983,
a figure which Hertz-TAA-Mayne
Nickless did not deny. However, at the
end of 1983, the partnership did post a
loss of $l2 million at the end of four
years’ trading.
Ansett’s campaign was particularly
sharp-edged because he attributed $7
million of TAA’s $7.5 million losses in
1983 to the rental car enterprise. By the
end of the year, Ansett was saying that
“we estimate” the losses to be $l5 mil-
lion. The result was that Mayne
Nickless a year ago turned round and
put $2l million in capital into the Hertz
operation in cumulative redeemable
preference shares, reflecting current in-
terest rates through their life. In effect,
TAA was out and Mayne Nickless was
the proprietor.
However, TAA strongly promotes


Hertz in in-flight and tour marketing
and maintains a close link.
The money re-financed the Hertz
fleet - a move that mystified the rental
car industry. Rent-a-car companies nor-
mally do not do anything as crass as buy
their equipment; it is usually leased, as
are premises and office equipment and
- come at that - people. Accordingly,
if Hertz is now highly capitalised, it
must be a stand-out in this hallmark ser-
vice type enterprise.
Dewhirst was brought in to reflect
the changes. He told the Surfers audi-
ence: “The home truths are no longer
true. There have been drastic changes.”
The managing director admitted (for
the first time by a Hertz executive in
public) that the losses had amounted to
$l4 million and that market share had
fallen to 10 percent in 1983.
As for his role, Dewhirst put it:
“Mayne Nickless asked me to return
Hertz to profitability and a reasonable
market share.
“We came up with a three-year plan
and now we are half-way through it.
“The first taks was to change the
image,
“Next, we needed to motivate the
staff. Everybody needed what I call a
‘will to do’ to believe in themselves.
CAR RENTAL RATES COMPARED
(unlimited kilometres)
Rates quoted are for Sydney. Insurance, not included, typically $8 a day for small and
medium cars and $lO a day for big or executive cars. In most instances, the cheapest
cars are subject to availability and cannot be reserved. Also, some cars of the same
type costing more may be upgraded with extras such as air-conditioning.
‘With car phone, $lO3.
“I gave them the motto, ‘lf it is to be,
it’s up to me.’ ”
Spiritual motivation, however im-
portant, is not all. Hertz led the way into
the top end of the market with high-
class European cars such as BMWs,
ranging up to the $68,000 735i5.
During the spiral, Hertz had
economised by sacking sales staff and
cutting advertising. Dewhirst said that
he had reversed those philosophies,
doubling sales staff and stepping up ad-
vertising.
Some major accounts have moved
his way from Budget lately. Some have
been in travel rentals, others in fleet
management.
All the major renters would like to
move into the company fleet-manage-
ment field. Two or three-year contracts
must be bliss to an industry subject to
the vagaries of seasonal shifts and econ-
omic winds.
Dewhirst says that market shares
have increased from 10 percent to 22
percent in 1984 alone.
Pinning his hat on the motivation
peg, Dewhirst summed up his approach
to reviving the business with the philos-
ophy: “The truth is not what it really is;
it’s what we perceive it to be.”
As can be seen, perceptions shift
throughout the industry.
Imperfect as they might be, the offi-
cial figures might be the first accurate
statistics ever seen in the rental car busi-
ness in Australia. They will be up-dated
early next year to reflect the December
31 figures and then at six-monthly
intervals.
With all the razzamatazz, the color
and the hype of this ultimate service in-
dustry, it would be a pity if the depart-
ment wet blanket quietened the person-
ality conflicts in car rental.
A better indicator for the averag’e
user always will be which of the big four
is offering the discounts, how deep do
they run and where are they available.
The brochure rate (known in the in-
dustry as “rack rate”) is just a starting
point in the rental car bazaar. Most
credit cards will entitle you to 10 per-
cent off. The flat rate for company ac-
counts is 15 percent. Ansett says that
Budget will honor Avis and other credit
cards.
Discounts of 20 to 30 percent are
common, as are trades for services for
instance, between rental car companies
and airlines.
The lesson for corporate users is to
get out there and bargain.
Until the industry settles down and
yield becomes as important as are
hyped-up market share statistics, it is an
almost-anything-goes business. In such
an environment, a big corporate ac-
count can be and should be pure
gold and worth buying for Australia’s
warring rental car companies. □


THE STOCK MARKET
Second board
venture all set
to go national
By DAVID HASELHURST
ALL AUSTRALIAN stock exchanges
will open their doors to small business
within six months - giving thousands of
little-known companies the opportunity
to tap the public purse for new risk
capital. This exciting development fol-
lows the success of the Perth Stock
Exchange’s pioneering efforts to list
fledgling companies to the public.
Since Western Australian Premier
Brian Burke officially opened Perth’s
Second Board market on July 1, six
small companies with a combined
market capitalisation of almost $l4
million have been listed. Another four
have been approved and as many as a
further 10 could join the board before
the end of the year.
The other capital city exchanges,
which held aloof from Perth’s early
efforts to bolster the small business
sector, are scrambling to offer a similar
service. Melbourne and Brisbane hope
to open second boards before
Christmas, Adelaide by Lebruary and
Sydney by Easter.
The market value of small company
listings previously denied access to the
exchanges could well exceed $lOO
million before the middle of next year.
New vistas will open for thousands of
small-time entrepreneurs who have
depended for funds on the whims of
banks and finance companies in the
absence of any certain source of equity
risk capital.
But potential investors will need to
exercise more than usual caution, for
the risk of loss certainly will be greater
among junior companies. Indeed, under
Perth’s Second Board rules, companies
may be admitted in some circumstances
with no track record of trading
provided they are sponsored by a
member of the Perth exchange. On the
other hand, investors in on the ground
floor in a new company may expect
greater than average growth if all goes
well.
Perth’s Second Board basically offers
a public listing to industrial companies
with paid capital of as little as $lOO,OOO,
a minimum 50 shareholders and a
spread of at least 70,000 shares or 25
percent of the issued capital (whichever
is the greater) in public hands. This
compares with main board listing
requirements of the Australian As-
sociated Stock Exchanges of a
minimum paid capital of $300,000, with
Noni Hazlehurst, star of Fran: movie market listing believed to be world first
at least 300 shareholders holding
marketable parcels totalling a minimum
25 percent of capital.
Perth’s Second Board listing require-
ments are also less onerous than for
companies on the main board and the
minimum initial listing fee for an elig-
ible smaller company is $BOO (compared
with $2025 on the main board) and an
annual fee of $5OO ($1600).
These provisions will be adopted
broadly by other exchanges, including
radical provisions to permit different
classes of fully-paid shares to carry
varying voting rights thus enabling
vendor entrepreneurs and families to
keep control of their companies. This
provision is in distinct contrast to the
main boards where the exchanges in the
past decade have moved to bar variable
voting rights on fully-paid securities.
The Perth Second Board’s voting
concessions are even more generous
than those expected on the other ex-
changes. The Perth rules allow
variations so that any number of “man-
agement” shares may carry 60 percent
of the voting rights. As an example, one
company on the Second Board Com-
puter Venture Capital Ltd has 4.07
million shares on issue, including 300
management shares which entitle the
holders to appoint 60 percent of the
board and the sole right to appoint or
dismiss the managing director. That
concession is retained until a company
has an issued capital of $lO million at
which time (in common with all other
Second Board listings) it must transfer
to the main board.
Draft rules likely to be approved for
the other states provide for non-listed
A-class shares to carry three votes for
every listed B share, so that a vendor
holding A shares may have as little as 25
percent of issued capital yet retain
voting control.
The Perth Stock Exchange was first
into pushing for a new “junior” stock
market because members recognised
two facts:
■ A potential market existed to
promote smaller companies and, more
urgently.


■ A long-held paranoia of Perth
loomed large once again that the
eastern states might swamp its
traditional broking business with the
coming of de-regulation this year.
Against that background, the ex-
change also took a hard look at the
diminishing numbers of listed com-
panies on the main boards a trend
which has been almost irreversible over
the past 15 years.
The following table shows the in-
sistent decline for all but one of those
years in the numbers of listed entities on
the exchanges. Of the total number of
companies to disappear from the public
boards, nearly 65 percent fell to
takeover bids.

The control provisions embodied in
the Perth Second Board listing require-
ments and envisaged for others are
designed to encourage private en-
trepreneurs into the public fund-raising
arena while sheltering them initially
from corporate predators.
The exchanges will not list mining
companies and property trusts on their
second boards at this stage but deter-
mined promoters doubtless will find
new opportunities to make hay within
this virginal field.
The stocks on Perth’s Second Board
so far are:
■ Hugall and Hoile Ltd which grew
out of reticulating water through home
gardens in Perth, into commercial ir-
rigation projects and the merchandising
of pumps and other equipment. The
company listed on the opening day of
the second market, with 303,178 fully-
paid 50c shares. It promptly re-
constructed to 20c shares, followed with
a one-for-one bonus and has 1.515
million shares issued and listed. The
shares were quoted at $5.50 before the
split and bonus. With one old share
equivalent to five new shares at a
current $1.50 each, the original holders
are showing a capital gain of $2 on each
of the old shares. Net asset backing is
about one-third the quoted price and
the company has just reported a $3OOO
net profit for the year to June 30,
compared with a $52,000 loss pre-
viously.
The premium on the share price
demonstrates a certain enthusiasm for
the new board.
■ Century Holdings Ltd also joined
the board on the first day, under the
chairmanship of former Bell Group
executive and solicitor Roger Hussey.
The company’s aim is to invest in other
companies either to re-organise them or
groom them for listing. It has 19.9
percent of the listed engineering group
Bowra Holdings, interests in a computer
software group and in Toni’s Tyres with
its 22 retail outlets. Having listed with
835,500 25c shares, Century promptly
made a one-for-four issue at $1 a share
within two weeks.
■ Keith Russell Simplicity Funerals
Ltd was the next cab off the rank and
he came out of his Adelaide head-
quarters to list nationally-operating,
budget-priced undertaking business in
Perth. His 50c par shares are trading at
60c, with the expectation of a maiden
dividend of 5c in 1984-85.
■ Computer Venture Capital Ltd is a
high-tech development company with
interests in software programming pro-
jects and a device to bar unauthorised
telephonic trunk calls.
■ Sonartec Ltd formed to develop
and sell a remote-control sonar device
to raise fishing nets and craypots from
the ocean floor, eliminating the need for
ropes and floats. It also would eliminate
craypot thieves.
■ Autoarc International listed two
weeks ago with an initial 1.02 million
50c shares quoted and the remaining 2.7
million of issued capital held in escrow
as promoters’ stock. Perth brokers Eyres
Reed placed 170,000 new shares at 50c
on the opening and they closed at 65c.
Last week, Sydney brokers Brown
Lancaster placed a further 250,000 at $l.
The excitement is all about a new
portable electricity generator with the
potential to increase its sales 10 times
from last year’s level of $600,000.
Coming up in the next few weeks
(see table) are a glass-recycling com-
pany, a lucerne farm and two movies.
Producer Paul Barron, instead of
seeking to list his production company
Barron Films Ltd, has won approval to
list individual films. They will be listed
as unit trusts when prospectuses are
filled and investors are advised to hold,
until after a film both has been com-
pleted and has earned “acceptable”
revenue, to protect tax deductions.
The first movie up Fran, starring
Noni Hazlehurst is shooting in Perth.
Investors in the 780,000 $1 units will
own 70 percent of the copyright and the
producer the remainder.
The same deal applies to I Own a
Racecourse, to be financed with an issue
of 699,000 $1 units.
Barron believes it will be the first
time in the world that investors could
buy and sell in a movie listed on a stock
exchange. “Instead of people seeing
movies as a tax deal,” he said, “we hope,
with a listing, more people will see it as
a risk investment where the listing gives
them negotiable assets.”
He also raised the prospect of a
major American production house
raiding his movies on the exchange if
they prove successful a prospect
budding business impresarios will be
able to share in other fields when the
second board concept is national next
year. □

THE MODEST FARMER
Mavis to the rescue
by Bert Kelly
LAST WEEK I said that our centralised
wage system, with its fundamental
plank of comparative wage justice, was
making it impossible for our
unprotected industries, who live in the
Rough Cruel World (RCW), to prosper.
Eccles says that you can always tell a
man who is dining out on an expense
account by the enthusiasm with which
he summons the waiter. The protected
industries, particularly the metal manu-
facturers, are usually the first to give in
to extravagant wage demands because
they know the export industries will
have to pick up the tab. Most thinking
people agree with us, but the question
this week is: How do we get this fact
through to the ordinary citizens of the
Living in the Past (LIP) city? They have
been reared under the present wage
system, they have been told for years
that it was one of the laws handed down
cut in stone tablets to Moses. How are
we going to make the LIP people even
start questioning our present system?
Eccles said that he was willing to
give them a series of lectures entitled,
“The Sombre Facts of Life in the RCW”
but we quickly ruled this out. There is
little prospect of anyone being awake at
the end of one of Eccles’ lectures, let
alone after a series. Fred volunteered to
climb in over the LIP tariff wall and give
anyone who disagreed with him a thick
ear. We ruled this out because we
thought it would take too long. Then
they all looked expectantly at me. John
Stone said, “You tell us what to do,
Bert. You should know how the
common people think, being one of
them yourself.” I didn’t quite know how
to take that. However, I said I would
give the matter my deep consideration,
which is what politicians say.
The next day I left the RCW wilder-
ness headquarters and went home for
the weekend. I told the others that I was
going so that Mavis could wash my
clothes but my real reason was to
consult her about how to get through to
the ordinary people living in LIP. I
know that some people think that Mavis
is a bit simple just because she starts
ironing my striped trousers whenever
she gets emotional, but all the same she
has a lot of shrewd political sense, far
more than has Eccles. The other day I
was at a meeting when someone
suggested that we ought to have another
economist join our group. “Where
would Bert be without Eccles?” he
asked. A bloke at the back said, “In
parliament!”
When I spelt out our problem to
Mavis she thought for a while and then
said, “It is no good giving them lectures,
dear, no good at all. You must tell the
leaders of the various groups in the LIP
that, unless the country can cook a big
economic cake, then there will not be
big slices to hand around when the cake
is cut up.” She meant that I must tell the
LIP people that, unless we can get our
economy functioning well, we cannot
afford to do all the good things that
good people want done. She says that I
will have to tell the welfare state advo-
cates, the CSIRO scientists, the school
teachers, the university chancellors,
even the greenies, that they cannot
expect to get a bigger slice of the
country’s wealth unless we create more
wealth, and the same message must be
preached to all the people who are
always clamoring for more money to be
lavished on their pet projects. But we
cannot do this while we are dragging
our economic chain as we are doing.
I am certain Mavis is right. When
people demand more money be spent
on their particular causes and I express
doubt whether we can afford it, I often
hear them say, “Of course we can afford
it. We are a wealthy country, we have
immense natural resources. If other
countries can afford it, so can we.” It is
true that we do have great resources but
we are not using them so we are not a
wealthy country. And one of the reasons
why our economic performance is so
lamentable, why the other countries in
our region who do not have anything
near our resources, bound past us up the
economic stairs while we stand placidly
on the economic escalator, is that our
wage fixing system is too inflexible for
today’s world.
Mavis says that it is no good talking
to ordinary people about the economy,
they just switch off as soon as it is
mentioned. “Tell them that they cannot
get a bigger slice of cake unless we can
cook a bigger cake. They can under-
stand that kind of talk.”
So I must go back to the RCW
wilderness headquarters and give this
simple message to the good and great
assembled there. I feel a bit nervous
about doing this. I am not frightened of
the others but I have to admit that I am
rather frightened of John Stone. I
understand that he does not suffer fools
gladly. I wonder how he and Mavis
would get on. □

outperforms others that take up half the office
and cost thousands more.
Incorporating the latest technology in their on-
board computers, these new Ricoh models
satisfy every corporate or individual fax
requirement superbly, giving you fax features
and quality that are quite simply the 'state of the
art' in facsimile operation.
Read on.

receiving side con be activated to accept
documents at any time, enabling the receipt of
important documents after hours.
Transmitter Terminal Identification (TTI)
The name, transmission time and date can be
automatically printed on the received copy,
enabling instant identification of the sender.
Half Tone Mode
This permits accurate reproduction of photo-
graphs and illustrations, in addition to enhancing
the reproduction of graphics and line work.

i will automatically'poll'the receiving
location to 'pick up its moil' on the same
coll, further reducing telephone charges.
Confidentiality through RTI
Confidential documents cannot be transmit-
ted to an incorrectly dialled number due to
Ricoh's built-in Remote Terminal Identification
function (RTI).

Documentation which contains small
characters, fine lines or graphics are 'read' by
the MTF, and effective transmission assured.
Full reporting facilities
You'd expect fax machines with a 'state of the
art' brain to not only know what they're doing,
but to tell you about it, too. So Ricohfax gives you
a complete list of operating reports like the
Transmit Confirmation Report (TCR), which
confirms which document went where and the
length of individual transmission times so that
faxing can be correctly charged out.
Charge code facility
The ability automatically to identify every
transmission by department or client, for
charging-on purposes.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A hell hole’s new grab at glory
ONE OF the hell holes of the old Aus-
tralian gold diggings was the mosquito-
infested Palmer River in northern
Queensland. Across the mountains be-
hind Cooktown, a prospector named
James Venture Mulligan was among the
first to pan rich alluvials from the river
and is credited with instigating one of
the state’s biggest gold rushes in 1873.
Twenty thousand Chinese diggers were
on the field within a year, far out-num-
bering Europeans. But the field waned
within a few years.
There have been intermittent revivals
the most recent involving a new float
out of Adelaide, Chase Minerals NL.
Chase was floated and listed on
August 30 to acquire a private company
Mirrajong Pty Ltd which over some
years had consolidated a collection of
leases, claims and prospecting author-
ities along the Palmer. Four of the prin-
cipals of Mirrajong are directors of
Chase. They are Adelaide solicitor
Michael Fuller (chairman), Adelaide
pharmacist Slobodan Djurasevich and
the principals of the Sydney mining
consultancy Marden and Associates
(Trevor Marden and Jay Bracher).
A coup for the company was negoti-
ation of a joint venture deal over its
areas with the leading civil engineering
firm Leighton Holdings Ltd. Chase re-
tains a 49 percent equity and Leighton
51 percent over alluvial ground on
which the prospectus revealed:
■ Initial reserves of 1.5 million cubic
metres of o.7gm/cub metre on the
Palmer River and
■ Reserves of 280,000 cub metres of
0.47gm/cub metre plus tin values at
nearby Fiery Creek.
More recently, the Chase/Leighton
joint venture has farmed into a 66.6 per-
cent interest by spending $280,000 on
areas held by the White Industries sub-
sidiary Mareeba Mining.
All up, Chase and Leighton have in-
terests in some 70 km along the Palmer.
The whisper in the market is that a
report should be released in the next
week or two which more clearly defines
reserves and, better, lifts the head grade
in the original Palmer River block to
around lgm/cub metre.
The report to come should confirm
also that a plant will be commissioned
by next April to treat 500,000 cub
metres a year, with the probability of an
identical second plant being commis-
sioned a year later.
Norths’ analysts have projected that,
on the basis of one plant operating a full
year on the Chase/Leighton areas,
Chase will produce earnings of 16c a
share or 8c a share if all options are
exercised. That is on the basis of gold at
SA4OO/oz and after deducting from
gross proceeds sl/cub metre for capital
costs, $5.35/cub metre for operating
costs and 44c/cub metre in state
royalties. Break-even is below
SA2OO/oz leaving a wide margin for a
gold price fall.
With two plants operating and a rise
in the gold price to SASOO/oz next year,
the broker estimated earnings/share
would rise to 43.5 c or 21.8 c after exer-
cise of options. The company has about
$200,000 remaining in cash with an-
other $BOO,OOO to come from the certain
exercise of options if the Leighton plant
works as expected.
At a price of 35c, the company is
capitalised at $3.85 million presuming
all options are exercised.
With earnings projections of nearly
22c a share two years down the track,
the expectation that reserves will be
greatly extended and the partnership
with a company of the stature of
Leighton, the company looks a safe play
particularly since there is such a wide
margin below the current gold price be-
fore the company falls to break-even.

WILDCAT
The good old days return to Leonora
THE ABORIGINES in the remote
West Australian settlement of Leonora
might not quite be on clover but they
are certainly sharing in the good times
that have returned to this once near-
abandoned outpost.
A month or so ago, the 100-odd
Aborigines of the area had settled upon
them an up-front $300,000 cash
payment, plus the promise of perhaps
another $500,000 to come with the
opening of a new gold mine.
It will be the fourth public-company
gold mine to open in an area where two
years ago none operated.
At this time of the year, this desert-
fringe town, 240 km north of Kalgoorlie,
is usually baking beneath an unrelent-
ing sun. But this year, with unusually
heavy rains, the salt bush plains look
more like the Riverina in a good spring.
All those vast “lakes” we see on the
maps, which in most years are nothing
more than dry salt pans, are now filled
with water.
Not only has the season been bouti-
ful to Leonora but, as local mining
identity Vern Taylor says: “The popula-
tion has doubled to nearly 1000 people
in the past two years.
“We’ve even got 10 darts teams,” he
adds, highlighting the social activity
that dominates the evenings at the two
remaining pubs the White Hart and
the Central.
It’s still small beer compared with
the old days, but better than it has been
for decades. At the turn of the century,
Leonora boasted seven hotels and a
brewery after mining engineer Herbert
Hoover put the Sons of Gwalia gold
mine into production in 1898. For the
next 65 years, before the mine closed in
1963, it was the richest single mine
outside Kalgoorlie’s Golden Mile. Pro-
duction totalled 2.7 million ounces.
In 1971, when the gold price was still
SUS3S/oz, the abandoned mine and
plant went under the auctioneer’s ham-
mer. It was knocked down for a mere
$l6OO to be stripped for what it was
worth.
A decade later, with the rise in the
gold price, a new company, Sons of
Gwalia NL, was floated to acquire con-
trol of the mine. It is now producing
1250 z a day.
In early 1984, a second mine was re-
opened The CRA-operated Tower
Hill, just north of Leonora. It had its
first gold pour in June.
Then in October, Kulim Ltd had its
first gold pour and became the third
“More staff! Damn it, boy, you haven’t learned to fire
the ones you’re got!’’
publicly-listed gold miner to begin pro-
duction in Leonora within the past 18
months. The first pour produced 2200 z.
Kulim is extracting ore from two mine
faces north of the large Sons of Gwalia
mine ahead of plans to develop its own
open cut operation immediately north
of the Gwalia mine.
A little further to the north of
Leonora, a fourth mine will go into
production by next August the
planned 500,000 tonnes-a-year Harbour
Lights gold mine, where production
from presently-known open-pit reserves
is expected to be 624,000 oz over an 11-
year mine life. From drilling results
announced last week, indications are
that further underground reserves will
extend the planned mine’s life to at least
20 years.
This property is operated by a joint
venture comprising Esso (55 percent),
Carr Boyd Minerals (40 percent) and
Aztec Exploration (5 percent).
The bonanza for the local Aborigines
emerged when drilling showed the
Harbour Lights orebody extended into
a camp site set aside for them by the
Leonora Shire Council in the 19505.
The council had chosen an area that
was well-treed half-a-kilometre north of
the town and erected a power line with
overhead lights, an ablutions block and
some iron-clad shelters.
Locals say that over the years the
trees were cut down, the iron stripped
off the buildings and those for whom the
amenity was provided camped in other
spots around the settlement.
Nevertheless, with the discovery that
the orebody extended into the Bha camp
site, Esso and partners were prepared to
pay $300,000 as compensation for the
use of the Aboriginal land, plus $25,000
a year, indexed, for the life of the mine.
Back in action
REG HARE, the man who put Metals
Exploration Ltd on the mining path in
the nickel boom, has obviously had
enough of retirement.
For the past 12 months he has been
working on one of his favorite hunting
grounds the Day Dawn gold mining
centre near Cue in Western Australia’s
Murchison goldfield.
He negotiated for a private com-
pany, Western Deeps Pty Ltd, to earn
a 49 percent interest in the deeps of the
famous old Great Fingall mine leases
held by Australian Consolidated
Minerals Ltd.
Western Deeps is raising $BOO,OOO
privately to finance early exploration
and a float called Great Fingall Mining
Company NL is blueprinted to take over
the role and to raise about $2 million
from the public also.
The Great Fingall leases have been


among the least-explored areas by
ACM Ltd in recent years as the com-
pany has concentrated on the Big Bell,
where a Mount Charlotte-style orebody
has been delineated, and on the Golden
Crown near the Great Fingall.
Hare, like ACM’s founding chair-
man Richard Burt, has a lot of faith in
Great Fingall. At the turn of the century
it was producing 1.9 million tonnes of
ore for a recovered grade of 20
grams/tonne of gold.
Before leaving Metals Ex, Hare had
that company into the Day Dawn area
and the attraction then, as now, was the
tantalising results from a West Austra-
lian government drilling program with
Day Dawn Gold NL between 1955 and
1959.
Four deep holes were drilled. Two
went into the Great Fingall reef but had
mediocre results but two following
holes were wayward and penetrated a
zone beyond a hanging wall and sur-
prisingly came up with two true-width
intersections of 5m that graded 17
grams/tonne and 6 grams/tonne.
It was construed at the time that the
results showed potential for a reef ex-
tension but a subsequent hole in 1980
involving Metals Ex, at greater depth
was disappointing.
This convinced Hare of potential for
a new reef system on the same elevation
as the well-mined Great Fingall reef.
Hare’s forte in geology is in the structur-
al field.
The first hole, to about 950 m to test
this theory, is expected in early 1985 on
a zone on the Great Fingall leases
north-west of ACM’s Golden Crown
shaft development.
THE CHARTIST
$A looking healthier
by Russell Lander
ONE OF the most enduring bull
markets in recent times has been in the
US dollar. The greenback has probably
ruined more speculators over these past
five years than any other single invest-
ment medium. This is brought home by
the accompanying chart on five
currencies. This graph simply shows
month-end, mid-rate values against the
SUS for SA, sterling, the yen, the mark
and the Swiss franc since January 1980.
Rising lines denote SUS strength.
Clearly the wooden spoon goes to
the pound sterling which is now fast
approaching parity with the SUS and
has halved its value over the past six
years. Next weakest has been SA, then
the mark followed by the Swiss franc.
The yen is virtually unchanged on its
level against the SUS six years ago but
has weakened steadily over the past
eight months.
A closer inspection of this chart
shows that the $A gets the prize as the
strongest of the five currencies over the
past two months which may come as
something of a surprise to readers
because Australia’s effective inflation
rate is still higher than in the other four
countries under scrutiny.
The second graph gives a finer focus
on the SUS/$A relationship over the
past year but note here that declining
trends denote $A weakness and vice
versa. This chart which shows the daily
range of the $A indicates that the
downtrend evident since March 1984 is
at an end and that a useful consolida-
tion pattern with rising lows is now in
place. This suggests that the next in-
termediate move should be up. If a
traditional chart measurement is made
one could say that, given a break above
US 0.86, a move to SUS 0.90 would be a
distinct possibility.
If you’re thinking of an overseas trip,
leave your currency purchases until the
last moment. □


PIERPONT
Punting on the good oil
FIRST, Pierpont must record his
heartfelt thanks to Sir Tristan Antico.
On the morn of Caulfield Cup day,
your correspondent was breakfasting in
Melbourne’s Regent Hotel with a gaggle
of publicans who had come down from
Sydney the night before on a private
train hired by Carlton & United
Breweries to mark their first sponsorship
of the Fosters Caulfield Cup.
To Pierpont’s practised eye, some of
the lads appeared to have had little
sleep the night before. Indeed, he hears
that the 100 chaps on the train arrived
with only three dozen stubbies left out
of a Starting quota of 60 dozen which
just shows how quickly Fosters evapor-
ates on board railway carriages.
Anyway, the lads were now on the
35th floor of the Regent admiring views
of beautiful Melbourne and having a
beer-and-croissants breakfast a sight
to make the bravest shudder.
Pierpont was there, picking up gossip
about track gallops and Castlemaine-
Tooheys, when he sighted Sir Tristan
who coincidentally happened to be
staying in the Regent.
Aftef a brief chat in which your
correspondent congratulated Sir Tri-
stan on his appearance (he is looking
fairly trim and fit these days and does
not appear to have aged a day in 10
years), the Pioneer Concrete chief said
his Alibhai was a good chance in the
Cup. As an afterthought, he mentioned
that another of his Hermod was
worth an each-way flutter in Sydney.
Pierpont agreed with Sir Tristan
about Alibhai, although already com-
mitted (over-committed, as it turned
out) to Colonial Flag. But your
correspondent must confess that, on
studying the form, he was no more
attracted to Hermod than he would
have been to shares in MIM Holdings.
At its latest three starts it had finished
last, last and ninth, respectively.
Having always thought highly of our
concrete knight’s judgment, however,
Pierpont boxed Alibhai in a trifecta
with Affinity, A 1 Dwain and Colonial
Flag. Unfortunately, the TAB took a
narrow view and refused to pay on first,
third, fourth and sixth.
Worse, with the Cup over, Pierpont
had yet to collect on a wager all day
having by then lost a couple of cattle
stations. Steeling his nerve, Pierpont
plunged each-way on Hermod and was
greatly relieved when it battled in for
third place. That retrieved at any rate a
few kilometres of fencing for your
correspondent and gave him his only
collect for the meeting.
In gratitude, Pierpont has nominated
Sir Tristan for membership of the
Croesus Club (although whether that is
a reward or a punishment your
correspondent is by no means sure).
Sir Tristan did not have the only
good oil floating about last week. Your
correspondent discovered that you can
even get good oil through the mailbox.
A few weeks back, Pierpont received
in the mail an exciting pamphlet headed
“Let Our Success Be Your Success.” For
as little as $5OOO invested, Pierpont was
offered the opportunity to participate in
an oil and gas drilling program in
Colorado which had a 96 percent suc-
cess rate.
For further information, all your
correspondent had to do was clip a card
out of the pamphlet and post it to
“American Oil Investment,” Box 76,
North Quay, Queensland.
For an avaricious soul such as
Pierpont, this sounded too good to miss
so he posted off the card. In due course,
an envelope arrived containing a bunch
of documents and a letter from some-
thing called Macquarrie Financial
Planning. Pierpont’s first reaction was to
fail it on both spelling and history for
getting the surname of our most famous
governor wrong. But its financial heart
is in the right place.
Macquarrie, licensed as an invest-
ment adviser in Queensland, said that
investors who had followed its tips on
oil investment last year so far had
received a 25 percent return on their
investment and the drilling program
had a 96 percent success rate.
“Based on the discoveries, it is es-
timated that investors will receive
income equalling at least 100 percent of
their investment back within the first
two years,” the letter said. “After that,
they will earn at least 25 percent p.a.,
without having any money invested.
“This estimate is supported by the
Wall Street merchant banker Solomon
Brothers 1983 annual survey, which
showed that over the last 15 years
investment in oil drilling has been the
top investment, showing an annual
compounded return of 25.4 percent.”
Solomon Brothers? Surely they
meant Jim Wolfensohn’s old stamping
ground, Salomon Brothers? Tsk,
thought Pierpont. And tut as well.
But these are quibbles. The big news
is that Macquarrie has discovered how
to strike oil or gas in 96 percent of wells
drilled. Reading the document further,
Pierpont discovered, however, that
these are not wildcat exploration wells
but development wells drilled as exten-
sions of known oil and gas fields.
Investors are invited to join a limited
liability partnership of 19 ordinary part-
ners and a general partner named
Coilarado Oil Investments Pty Ltd.
These partnerships then invest in 19
wells in the Wattenberg field of the big
Denver-Julesburg basin in the Rockies.
Macquarrie claims that a success rate
of 50 percent is sufficient to ensure
investors’ money back whereas the
current success rate, it repeats, is 96
percent.
Another letter, from Rex Davis, a
director of American Oil Investments,
told Pierpont that investors were
assured of their investment back within
12 months of the hooking up and
completion of the wells and then
assured of going on to receive each year
“cash income of approximately 25 per-
cent of your initial investment, for a
minimum of five years.”
He added: “There is no safer invest-
ment showing such substantial returns.”
Well, it sounds like the ultimate
investment but Pierpont sour old
grump that he is has found that the
number of sure things in this world is
very small either in finance or in racing.
American Oil Investments cannot
guarantee, for example, that the 96
percent success rate will continue
although, with development wells, the
success rate should be high. If this sort
of success rate is not sustained, the
return presumably would be lower.
Since discovery in 1970, 914 wells


have been drilled in the Wattenberg
field and 907 are producing. From this
field (which must look like a Swiss
cheese), 1.7 million barrels of oil and
156,657,000 million cubic feet (mfc) of
gas have been produced. This averages
out at 1865 barrels and 172,000 mcf a
well, which is tiny production.
If these wells also average a return of
SUS2S a barrel and SUSS per mcf, they
would yield average total revenue of a
little over SUS9OO,OOO.
Depth appears to be around 7700 ft
and the best estimate Pierpont can get is
that such an onshore well in Australia
would cost around half-a-million dol-
lars. Drilling cost may well be lower
in the United States but these wells
have to be completed in fairly exacting
fashion.
Most oil wells produce their best
flows and, hence, their best financial
returns in their first year or two of life.
Further, a geologist’s report with the
offer notes the presence of an extremely
tight formation which requires artificial
stimulation to establish production.
This indicates the possibility of costs
rising and production falling. Indeed,
without modern fracturing technology
which breaks up formations and allows
oil and gas to flow, the geologist
doubted whether the Wattenberg field
would have been developed.
This also would account for the very
large numbers of infield wells being
drilled.
FOR THE time being, Pierpont will stick
to the horses.
For his Melbourne Cup tip this year,
Pierpont is prepared to ignore trans-
Tasman mutterings about sore tendons
and tip Kiwi to win again.
If he should be scratched, however,
your correspondent will stick to Sir
Tristan and tip Alibhai.
CHESS
A case of royal composure
by Terrey Sbaw
THE PROBLEM positions I use in this
column are usually from flesh-and-
blood games. I use them because they
help to improve one’s play.
Another type of problem which is
published frequently is the composed
problem. These represent a completely
different branch of the game, in which
the pieces are deliberately and artifici-
ally arranged into positions which con-
tain amazing and often beautiful
finesses.
Problem composers have developed
a terminology of their own to describe
the fascinating themes which recur in
their creations. Being used to the safe,
predictable world of the fork and the
pin, for me these terms are a trifle
unsettling. But if you find that you
aren’t nonplussed by a Nowotny,
baffled by a Brunner-Grimshaw, or ab-
solutely ’orrified by an obscure or-
thogonal Wurzburg-Plachutta, then the
composed problem world is for you.
Probably the most famous chess
composer of all time was the great
American, Sam Loyd. Problem 21 is by
Loyd, and represents a compromise
between real life and composed pro-
blems. It is titled “Charles XII in
Benderack,” and the story Loyd
composed to accompany it is as
fascinating as the problem itself.
The story goes that the position
occurred in a game played in Fort
Benderack by King Charles XII of
Sweden, in 1713, while he was beseiged
during the Swedo-Turkish war. Playing
White, he had just announced to his
hapless opponent that he was about to
mate him in three moves, when two
Turkish bullets crashed through the
window, shattering, in turn, Charles’
Knight, then his Rook’s pawn.
Undeterred, Charles calmly brushed
the broken glass from his arm as he
surveyed the remnants of his position,
and announced that he could still mate
in four moves without his Knight, and
even with his Rook’s pawn smashed off
as well, it was mate in five.
White to play and mate in three
moves (masochistic readers may also
like to find Charles’ mates in four and
five, so all three solutions will be
published). Send entries to Bulletin
Chess Problem No 21, GPO Box 5252,

As the hero in Problem 21 is a
Swedish king, it seems appropriate to
show an unusual game by the current
chess king of Sweden, Ulf Andersson.

TOM HALEY—SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
The Aquino murder stains Ferdinand Marcos’s top aide.
Corazon Agrava’s face was ashen and
her hands trembled as she presented
her findings on the murder of Benigno
Aquino last week. Ferdinand Marcos
signed a receipt for three copies of the 121-
page document, which charged a Philippine
general and six soldiers with plotting to
murder the president’s chief political rival.
Then he told reporters gathered in the Ma-
lacanang Palace that “with the submission
of the final report by the chairman,” the
work of Agrava’s fact-finding
board was finished.
It was a wily gambit—
but Marcos’s troubles weren’t
over. The next day, four other
members of the Agrava Com-
mission issued their own far
more devastating report. A
bulky 457 pages, it found 25
military personnel and one ci-
vilian indictable for premedi-
tated murder. At the top of the
list of alleged conspirators was
Armed Forces Chief of Staff
Gen. Fabian Ver —Marcos’s
intelligence chief and one of his
closest aides. Later the same day, Ver hand-
ed Marcos a written request for a leave of
absence to prove his innocence. The presi-
dent granted it with “sadness.”
With Ver’s leave—and with a special civ-
il-court inquiry into the charges in the two
reports —Marcos clearly hoped to contain
the damage of the board’s findings. Wheth-
er he would succeed remained to be seen.
When Agrava announced the submission of
her report in the board’s hearing room, she
Ramos (left) and Ver: Keeping
military loyalists in their place?
was booed, hissed and brought
close to tears by scores of pro-
testers. She was also jeered the
next day when she closed the
board’s proceedings. But her
colleagues were cheered wild-
ly. In the following days, thou-
sands of demonstrators took to
Manila’s streets to demand
Marcos’s resignation. And op-
position leaders raised the
question troubling many Fili-
pinos: could Ver have been in-
volved in the plot without
the knowledge—or consent —
of Marcos or his wife, Imelda?
“Are we now to believe,” asked
Aquino’s widow, Corazon,
“that the assassination was
planned and executed without
Mr. Marcos’s approval?”
Around the answer to that
question turned a matter of
crucial importance to the Unit-
ed States. Clark Field and Su-
bic Bay, the American bases in
the Philippines, remained stra-
tegically vital to U.S. interests
in Asia. Reagan administra-
tion officials were determined
to work with Marcos —for fear,
as the president put it in his
debate with Walter Mondale,
that “the alternative” would be
a communist takeover of the
Philippines. But they also
made it plain they wanted Ver
and others named in the major-
ity report not only removed,
but prosecuted. In one of
Washington’s toughest public
signals to Marcos since Aquino’s assassina-
tion, State Department spokesman John
Hughes called for “swift action” on both
commission reports —and said that all those
implicated should be tried “no matter who
they may be.”
Findings: As early as late summer, re-
ports began leaking out that the Agrava
board was reviewing evidence of a military
conspiracy to kill Aquino (Newsweek,
Sept. 3). Since then, it has been expected
that the board would reject the
military’s account of the assas-
sination—that Rolando Gal-
man, a lone gunman in the pay
of communists, committed the
murder —and conclude that
Aquino was shot by a military
escort as he stepped off a plane
at Manila International Air-
port. But the majority finding
was even tougher than many
expected. Among the alleged
conspirators named in the
report:
General Ver: The majority of
the commissioners concluded
unequivocally that Ver tried to
cover up the military’s role in
Aquino’s murder. Without


saying so directly, it also sug-
gested he knew about the plot in
advance. In sworn testimony
before the board, Ver insisted
that he did not even know when
Aquino would arrive in Ma-
nila. But the report cited 37
circumstances, including air-
traffic communications, indi-
cating that the military knew
Aquino was aboard China Air-
lines flight 811 from Taipei.
The board members also cast
doubt on Ver’s assertion that he
made no attempt to track
Aquino’s movements as he re-
turned from the United States
through Asia. They pointed out
that as head of Philippine intel-
ligence, Ver had previously kept files on
everything Aquino did, down to his “dental
activities” when he was a political prisoner
in Manila.
The accusations against Ver were cir-
cumspect, however. It was largely over
Ver’s role that the panel divided; in her
report, Agrava devoted more than four
pages to arguing that Ver could not have
been involved in the conspiracy. Mean-
while, the other members of the
panel discussed whether to im-
plicate Ver on the basis of negli-
gence, involvement in the cov-
er-up or participation in the
plot. In the end, they decid-
ed simply to declare Ver in-
dictable for the conspiracy to
murder Aquino and Galman.
When asked whether the ma-
jority intended to accuse Ver of
taking part in the assassination
plot, one panel member, union
leader Ernest Herrera, smiled
and replied enigmatically:
“Read the report.”
Gen. Luther Custodio: Agra-
va and her four colleagues
agreed on one point: that Cus-
todio, head of the elite Avi-
ation Security Command (Av-
secom), was a key player in the
plot. The majority report says
that Custodio conspired “to
disguise the real plan” by or-
dering Avsecom troops to meet
every plane that arrived on
Aug. 21, secure the tarmac
around Aquino’s plane and
search the interior before he
got off. “Custodio presided
ovfer the whole clockwork-like
proceeding,” the report con-
cludes. Custodio, who Was re-
lieved of his command shortly
after the killing, has insisted
that Galman killed Aquino.
“God knows, my men and I
were without guilt in this
crime,” he said last week.
Gen. Prospero Olivas: As
head of the Metropolitan Com-
Anti-Marcos protesters after the release of the findings: Survival may take all of the president's wiles
mand, Olivas was initially named to investi-
gate the Aquino murder, and his reports
became the basis for “the Galman theory.”
But the four panel members concluded that
Olivas “sought to mislead us” by trying to
prove that the murder weapon was a .357
magnum, when chemical tests show that
Aquino was shot with a .38- or .45-caliber
pistol. Olivas has stuck by his account —and
proclaimed his innocence.
The Escort Team: Both Agrava board
reports assert that Aquino was shot by one
of the soldiers who accompanied him down
a staircase to the tarmac. Of the five sus-
pects named by the majority report, the two
who had the “best opportunity” were Roge-
lio Moreno of the Philippine Constabulary
and Sgt. Filomeno Miranda, an Avsecom
intelligence agent. Both testified that they
did not see the actual shooting of Aquino.
Others: In all, the majority
report named 18 other con-
spirators. Col. Arturo Custo-
dio and businessman Hermilio
Gosuico were accused of pick-
ing up Galman, the “decoy kill-
er,” at his farmhouse four days
before the murder. Col. Vi-
cente Tigas, an officer in the
Presidential Security Com-
mand (PSC), was accused of
ordering journalists into posi-
tions from which they could
not witness or photograph the
killing. Ten other soldiers were
implicated as possible assassins
of Galman or as participants in
an alleged cover-up that in-
cluded pumping bullets into
Galman’s body 17 seconds
after he was killed. Five other
soldiers situated around the
plane were said to have “en-
couraged and abetted the mur-
der,” and later to have lied to
the board. So far, all the ac-
cused have stubbornly backed
the military account that Gal-
man killed Aquino.
The Agrava Commission’s
findings raised unsettling ques-
tions about the military’s hand
in Philippine politics. Last
week a high-ranking govern-
ment official said that many of
the 25 accused military men
appeared to be members of a
“loyalty group” with roots in
the elite Presidential Security
Command, a 1,200-man unit
that provides security for the
first family and performs some


'Justice Can New Proceed'
Philippine Defense Minister Juan
Ponce Enrile has often been mentioned as
a potential successor to President Ferdi-
nand Marcos. His duties as defense min-
ister are largely administrative and he is
not part of the military chain of com-
mand. Enrile met with Newsweek’s
Melinda Liu and Richard Vokey in Ma-
nila last week to discuss the findings of
the Agrava Commission and the likely
impact on the troubled nation. Excerpts:
NEWSWEEK: What will be the coun-
try’s response to the inquiry findings?
ENRILE: A sigh of relief. The cat
is out of the bag and now it can
crawl. The tension, the passions,
the rumors will now subside and
the machinery of justice can now
proceed.
Q. Are you confident of that?
A. I am not the minister of justice.
But I believe in the system.
Q. How high up do you believe
the alleged conspiracy might have
reached?
A. I can only base my thinking on
the report, which said it went up to
the chief of staff.
Q. Do you give the majority report
more weight than the separate report
issued by commission chairman Co-
razon Agrava?
A. Based on what I’ve heard, I
would say that the analysis of the
material presented by the board is
much more telling than the analysis
made by Mrs. Agrava. This is a very
interesting case, either way. I wish I
were not in the government because I
would be happy to take on this case.
Q. Which side?
A. Either.
Q. There’s no specific motive men-
tioned in the commission findings. Isn’t
it difficult to prosecute a case like this
without one?
A. I won’t presume to play the role of
the prosecutor, but I’m sure a skillful
prosecutor will bring out the motive.
Q. What was President Marcos’s reac-
tion to the reports?
A. He was quite sad. You have to
understand that some of the people in-
volved were men who worked with him
for a long time and for him to take the
action he did was something that bore on
him deeply as a human being. But none-
theless he had to do it.
Q. Do you think the president acted
strongly enough in granting requests for
leave by Generals Ver and Olivas?
A. The president must be very careful
not to violate the presumption of in-
nocence of these people under the
Constitution.
Q .ln his letter to General Ver, the presi-
dent made it very clear that he felt the
charges were not very credible.
A. That’s his assessment. I cannot pass
judgment on whether his assessment is
correct or not.
Enrile:‘The tension and rumors will subside’
TUCCI—GAMMA-LIAISON
Q .Don ’tyou think his formal statement
might influence or prejudice subsequent
thinking on the case?
A. Not necessarily. We do not have a
jury system in the Philippines and judges
are presumed to be independent-minded.
No matter what their biases may be, they
assess the evidence on record. Otherwise,
they will not only have to answer to their
consciences, they will have to answer to
the people.
Q. Some Filipinos suspect that the
courts that will try the 25 military men
will be tough on low-ranking soldiers
and rather lenient on the more powerful
officers.
A. It remains to be seen how they’ll
perform in this particular case. I think
the searchlight of public opinion will be
on them.
Q. Isn’t there a potential escape hatch
for the men on trial, since all the Agrava
Commission witnesses will now have to
reaffirm their testimony to the court —
and some may recant?
A. Even in the American or British
systems, witnesses have to present the
evidence anew. This cuts both ways.
Witnesses must sit on the stand to be
questioned by the prosecutor and be sub-
jected to rigorous cross-examination.
This is a system of ferreting out the
truth, and anybody who lies will be easi-
ly exposed.
Q. What effect have the findings had on
the military?
A. Mrs. Agrava’s report and the
majority report have relieved the
rank and file of anxiety because their
entire organization has been under a
cloud. I think that many military peo-
ple have felt a certain degree of disap-
pointment and embarrassment. Now
the board has identified those in-
volved and it is a small group that is
under suspicion. The president’s ac-
tion relieving the ranking officers is a
reassurance to the organization that
no one is immune.
Q. How would you assess the popu-
larity ofLt. Gen. Fidel Ramos within
the armed forces?
A. The fact that General Ramos
was placed, even temporarily, as chief
of staff will stabilize the entire organi-
zation immeasurably. Ramos is a re-
spected military officer.
Q. Is the military divided by
factions?
A. There may be some people who,
for one reason or another, would like
to be close to certain people who can
give them better opportunities and
improve their positions. But that is
not the general run of things in the mili-
tary. Many believe that they are profes-
sionals and the system of reward and
punishment must be applied to them ac-
cording to the rules. One hundred percent
believe in God, more than 90 percent
believe in country, people and the Consti-
tution, and no one else.
Q. Won’t General Ver’s followers be an-
gered by these events?
A. Anger is one thing; the ability to do
something about it is another. And that’s
assuming [that General Ver’s followers]
are angry. In fairness to General Ver, I
don’t think they are. All this talk about
coup, coup, coup d’etat. Who is the lead-
er who will attempt to undermine the
institution of the presidency in this re-
public? Don’t worry, when the tanks
start rolling, I’ll tell you.


VAL RODRIQUEZ— AP
Corazon Aquino holding a press conference in Manila, Ver meeting with Marcos: The general takes an ‘indefinite leave’
intelligence functions. Generals Ver and
Custodio had both been members of the
unit; according to Air Force sources, when
Custodio took the Avsecom post in late
1982, he brought a number of PSC person-
nel with him. Miranda is a former PSC
member. Miranda’s friend and neighbor,
Sgt. Clemente Casta, is a current member of
the PSC who appeared in television footage
taken at the airport. It is not clear how many
former, current or covert PSC personnel
might have been in the vicinity of the
Aquino slaying. But even the stolen identity
tag that Olivas said he found on Galman’s
corpse belonged to a PSC soldier, Sgt. Do-
minador Aguyao.
Marcos was clearly prepared for the two
Aquino reports. He quickly referred both
documents to the ombudsman of the Sandi-
ganbayan, a special court that hears cases
against government officials charged with
wrongdoing in the course of their duties. He
also announced that the seven men impli-
cated in Agrava’s report would be confined
to barracks. At 9:30 on the morning the
majority report was released, Ver was
standing by at Malacanang Palace with his
request for a leave. Ver appeared sheepish as
he delivered the note, which proclaimed his
innocence “to the world.” Marcos re-
mained stony faced and seemed to avoid
looking Ver in the eye.
Loyalists: For the moment, the military
appeared satisfied with the president’s
moves. A brief flurry of coup rumors had
swept through Manila’s bars and coffee
shops. But they quickly subsided—and
some soldiers actually expressed relief that
only a limited number of men were impli-
cated. To replace Ver during his leave, Mar-
cos made the shrewd choice of deputy chief
of staff Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos. Ramos, 56,
graduated from West Point and has a repu-
tation as someone who might help clean up
the armed forces —points that endeared
him to Washington. But he also has strong
support within the 210,000-man Philippine
military. Even so, Ver and Marcos loyalists
may remain in place. Introducing Ramos at
Malacanang Palace, Ver said the acting
chief of staff would carry on “with the same
personnel whom I have used.”
Many Reagan administration officials
were glad to see Ver go. They point to
plummeting morale, indiscipline and cro-
nyism within the military—three reasons,
they believe, that communist insurgents of
the New People’s Army have been gaining
ground in the Philippines. Recently, De-
fense Department officials have been par-
ticularly alarmed about the crisis in the
Philippines and have feuded with State De-
partment hands who took a less pessimistic

U.s. air and naval units at Clark Field and Subic Bay: In a tough public signal, Washington called for Ver and others to be prosecuted


view. But Ver’s departure and Hughes’s
tough statement appeared to appease the
Pentagon. Ver had been seen as a serious
obstacle to reform, and administration offi-
cials now seemed to share a similar reading
of Marcos’s predicament. Marcos was on
the defensive, but not on the way out, bar-
ring a collapse of his uncertain health.
Therefore, trying to replace him was not an
option, according to officials in Washington
who felt they had to continue to push for
democratic reform —and for a fair trial on
the Aquino findings—through Marcos.
Clearly feeling the American pressure, at
the weekend the president lashed out, say-
ing his country was grateful to have “such a
strong and very generous partner” as the
United States, “but we certainly don’t want
to appear... as if we were the pet dog of any
Western ally.” The commission findings
provided plenty of new grist for the opposi-
tion, which renewed its calls for the presi-
dent to resign and make way for clean and
fair elections. One group also pressed for a
new move to impeach Marcos for “culpable
violations” of the Constitution.
Skeptics: The opposition’s next moves—
and those of the military and Washington—
will probably hinge on what happens in the
Sandiganbayan court. By the weekend, it
had begun a preliminary investigation—
listed as Case No. 84-02110, People of the
Philippines v. Gen. Ver et al. But many
Filipinos were skeptical that the judges—
three of whom were named by Marcos last
week—would ever rule against the top men
in uniform. Some believed that a campaign
to discredit the Agrava findings was already
under way. Two weeks ago, Celso Loter-
inia, an airline mechanic who told the panel
he saw a military escort shoot Aquino, re-
canted his testimony. Then last week, Gen-
eral Custodio charged that one of the
board’s lawyers had offered one of his men
passage to the United States if he testified
against the military. Other key witnesses
are out of the country or have disappeared.
Still, Marcos will need at least a reason-
ably fair and thorough court hearing to
salvage his credibility. Even before last
week, the Aquino murder had shaken his
government badly. It had driven away for-
eign investors and brought on an economic
crisis, revived the opposition and strained
relations with Washington. Now the two
Aquino reports have accused government
officials of lying, charged high-ranking offi-
cers with conspiracy to murder —and raised
the specter of a new backlash in the streets if
the civil-court trial is seen as a whitewash.
Marcos has always been a canny political
survivor, as his swift reaction to the board’s
findings showed. But he will need all his
wiles to ride out the disaster of Benigno
Aquino’s murder. And this time, he can’t be
certain that he will succeed.

RICHARD VOKEY in Manila and
JANE WHITMORE in Washington
A Changing of the Old Guard
Lee Kuan Yew has governed his tiny
island nation with an unswerving hand
for 25 years. But time is creeping up on
Singapore’s ruler—and his helpmates. Lee,
the country’s first and only prime minister,
is now 61 years old, and when the question
of another term in 1988 comes up, Lee has
said, in essence, maybe I will, maybe I
won’t. Goh Keng Swee, the architect of the
robust economy, is 66 and in poor health.
Second Deputy Prime Minister S. Rajarat-
nam, 69, has announced that he will retire
in two years. Before they loosen their grip
on power, however, Singapore’s top politi-
cians are trying to groom their successors.
As Lau Teik Soon, a member of Parlia-
ment, says: “The old guard wants to ensure
that what has been built up does not dete-
riorate because of poor leadership.”
Lee (right), his son: The general’s entry into politics has led to talk of a ‘Lee dynasty’
Every move in the transition will un-
doubtedly be written and choreographed
by Lee himself. The next “performance”
will come in December, the date of Singa-
pore’s general elections. All but inevitably,
Lee’s People’s Action Party (PAP), which
has controlled Singapore since its inde-
pendence from Britain in 1959, will sweep
to victory. (Only one opposition MP
has ever been elected to Singapore’s
Parliament.)
Lee’s determination to mold Singapore’s
future governments became even more ap-
parent last month when his eldest son,
Brig. Gen. Lee Hsien Loong, resigned his
military commission and said he would
run for Parliament. The announcement by
the 32-year-old graduate of Cambridge
and Harvard immediately prompted talk
about a “Lee dynasty.” There was reason
for that talk. Lee is said to admire the way
in which Chiang Kai-shek passed control
of Taiwan to his son, Chiang Ching-kuo.
Young Lee’s entry into the political arena
will upset the jockeying already going on
among a troika of top second-generation
candidates. Defense Minister Goh Chok
Tong, 43, Finance and Industry and Trade
Minister Tony Tan, 44, and Minister
Without Portfolio Ong Teng Cheong, 48,
will now have to face yet another
contender.
Prosperous: The opposition conceeds that
its basic objections are to PAP’s arro-
gance—not its aims or the end results of its
policies. Were Lee’s opponents to come to
power, things in Singapore would probably
not be that much different. “We don’t
want drastic change, but we do need re-
form,” says Chiam See Tong, leader of the
Singapore Democratic Party. Whatever
their problems with PAP, few residents of
Singapore complain about the prosperous
society it has given them. Never much
taken with politics, most of them, says a
veteran PAP politician, “are more interest-
ed in their bread and butter.” That may be
the biggest factor in Lee’s favor. “There is
a fear,” says one opposition politician,
“that without PAP and Lee the country
will go down the tubes.”
Those who agree with that view may not
have to worry. In August Lee introduced a
constitutional amendment investing the
largely ceremonial office of president with
veto power over government spending. In
theory, that is only a protection for the
country’s $9 billion in reserves against fu-
ture spendthrift governments. But the
move could also be a prelude to Lee’s own
run for a revamped presidency, which he
has hinted he might seek after his term as
prime minister ends. If he does decide to
make a run for that office, Singapore may
have Lee around as a guide for some time.

The ‘Spend Money 5 Campaign
Chinese consumers: A government-approved shopping spree to stimulate the economy
CHINA
FRANCOLON—GAMMA-LIAISON
For the average Chinese, the message is
nothing short of revolutionary: spend
money for the good of the country. Articles
and editorials in the official press exhort the
people to buy washing machines, color-tele-
vision sets,and fashionable clothes. China’s
leading newspapers are urging the Chinese
masses to “liberate themselves from the
obsolete notion that self-indulgence is ta-
boo.” Chinese leaders are hoping that the
new spending campaign will stimulate the
national economy by unleashing the pur-
chasing power of the country’s 1.1 billion
people. In a way, official sanction of West-
ern-style consumerism could lead to a new
kind of cultural revolution.
The government’s call for a shopping
spree follows a sweeping package of reforms
designed to move China away from
centralized planning and toward
a supply-and-demand-style system.
“Many of our comrades understand
that without production there can be
no consumption,” said a front-page
editorial in Peking’s Guangming
Daily. “But many of our comrades do
not understand that without con-
sumption there can be no produc-
tion.” Under the new economic pro-
gram, which was announced in a
Communist Party plenum report this
month, prices that had been kept low
through state subsidies will be al-
lowed to float. Factory managers will
be given greater autonomy in running
their companies, and businesses will
be encouraged to compete in a surviv-
al-of-the-fittest marketplace. Ac-
cording to the 39-page document
drafted by the plenum, “only the best
[will] survive”; and the consumers
will be the arbiters of quality. The
new system is said to be an attempt to
reward hard work and punish sloth by link-
ing workers’ salaries to productivity.
To give emphasis to the reforms, the na-
tion’s major newspapers have been trumpet-
ing a new age of spending. China Youth
News recently praised a Sichuan Province
peasant for razing his thatched cottage and,
in its place, erecting a Western-style villa
complete with balcony, bathroom and tele-
vision. In contrast, the People’s Daily chas-
tised one man in Hebei Province for saving
all the money he earned. “He got rich, but
did not dare tell anybody,” the paper said,
“He was afraid to spend the money and
continued to live in a mud hovel, sleeping on
a dirt floor with a rotten old mat.” To ensure
that similar attitudes do not prevail, officials
in Hebei Province have already established a
Today’s look: A different kind of cultural revolution?
FRANCOLON—GAMMA-LIAISON
Consumer Guidance Association. The asso-
ciation gives advice on personal money
management to young people; the organiza-
tion’s “line” is that buying is not bourgeois.
As part of the campaign, the country’s
leading cadres are being called upon to set
a new tone for the nation. “Chinese leaders
should dress more fashionably to help cre-
ate a revolutionary change in people’s atti-
tude to clothes,” the Guangming Daily
wrote. No longer is the Chinese adage
“Three years new, three years old and
three years patched up” the fashion tip
that every well-dressed comrade is expect-
ed to follow. That attitude has now been
denounced as “miserly” and ultimately
harmful to the economic well-being of the
country. “How are we going to develop
our textile industry if everyone keeps wear-!
ing the same garment for nine years?” asks
Deputy Prime Minister Tian Jiyun.
The spending revolution will undoubt-
edly increase the demand for Western-
style goods. One of the hottest items in
Peking’s municipal department store is the
Western-style business suit (worn, most
prominently, by Chinese Prime Minister
Zhao Ziyang). Each day the store sells 200
conservative gray suits. One salesclerk
who was wearing a tailor-made Western
suit provided by the store said: “Every-
body’s buying them because this is the
right thing to do.” And the new celebra-
tion of the individual through clothing and
appearance has sparked an interest in cos-
metics. Recently, more than 100 people
waited in lines that wound around the first
floor of the department store to buy ajar of
Treasure for Darkening Hair, a new lotion
that promises to “turn the white to auburn
and the auburn to black” in “a matter of
days.”
Long Lines: Whether the enthusiasm
about the buying binge will last is an open
question. For all the promises of riches for
the diligent, Chinese leader Deng Xiao
ping’s proposals are certain to upset
the country’s urban workers who
have seen their wages guaranteed and
their rents and medical care subsi-
dized for more than 30 years. Fearing
imminent price increases, some Chi-
nese waited in long lines recently to
purchase produce and other necessi-
ties. Communist Party leader Hu
Yaobang, trying to quell those fears,
promised that any price increases
would be carefully staggered and that
wages would be increased according-
ly to prevent a drop in the standard of
living. “Making the nation and the
people rich quickly is the party’s key
problem,” he said. To that, China’s
official news agency added: “The ulti-
mate aim... is to make all the people
rich.” Free-market societies have yet
to find any system that makes all the
people rich; it seems unlikely that
China will fare any better.

EUROPE
The Spreading Stain of Flick
Barzel testifying last week before the special investigating committee: ‘ Infamous ’ charges
WEST GERMANY
J. H. DARCHINGER
Like a toxic spill, the Flick Corp. scandal
has been oozing across West Ger-
many’s political landscape for two years—
and the politicians have been trying to wish
it away. By last week, however, it clearly
had become the most damaging ethics crisis
in Germany’s postwar history. The scandal
claimed its highest-ranking victim yet, Bun-
destag speaker Rainer Barzel. For the first
time, the name of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
was linked to improper Flick payments.
And at the weekend, former chancellor Wil-
ly Brandt stood before a parliamentary
investigating committee, also denying
charges that he had taken money from the
Dusseldorf-based holding company.
Barzel is accused of taking $565,000 in
Flick funds in return for stepping aside as
leader of the Christian Democratic Union to
make way for Kohl. The money, according
to the weekly Der Spiegel, was funneled
through a Frankfurt law firm that had re-
tained him as a consultant. Barzel initially
denounced the charges as “infamous.” Last
week, after meditating briefly at the grave of
his first wife, he announced that the “politi-
cal and psychological pressure on me has
become unbearable,” and resigned as Bun-
destag speaker.
List: Spiegel and other publications have
obtained documents that appear to show
secret Flick cash payments made in the
names of Kohl and other prominent CDU
politicians, allegedly in return for $265 mil-
lion in tax waivers during the 19705. The
chancellor’s name appears repeatedly on a
list—kept by Flick’s former chief account-
ant, Rudolf Diehl —of “unofficial pay-
ments” to the CDU. According to the ledg-
er, a total of $221,000 was handed out
“wegen Kohl.” Other sums were listed “on
account of” top members of the governing
coalition, including President Richard von
Weizsacker, Christian Social Union leader
Franz Josef Strauss, and Foreign Minister
Flans-Dietrich Genscher, a Free Democrat.
(All have informally denied any wrongdo-
ing.) The payments were supposedly ordi-
nary political contributions, to be passed on
to the recipients’ respective parties. But it is
far from certain that they were.
Kohl, who is scheduled to appear before
the Flick special committee next week, dis-
missed as “nonsense” the charge that Flick
had bought politicians. “It is the goal of the
[opposition] to defame the coalition and the
chancellor,” he said in a television inter-
view. Brandt, now chairman of the Social
Democrats, denied having received any
Flick money and told the investigating com-
mittee it was “barking up the wrong tree.”
Despite his resignation, Barzel may still
face charges of tax evasion. Like the FDP’s
Otto Lambsdorff —Kohl’s former economy
minister and the first prominent politician
forced to resign as a result of the Flick
investigation —he could also face indict-
ment on bribery charges. And with the alle-
gations spinning closer and closer to Kohl,
his beleaguered government may be in for
even rougher times ahead.

Happy Birthday, Asterix
© DARGAUD
Hundreds of children crowded into the kiddies’ section of the Bois de
Boulogne in Paris last week, hoping for a glimpse of their favorite hero. And
lo and behold, there he was, sporting his famous winged helmet and blond
mustache. It was Asterix, the pun-slinging Gaul from 100 B.C. whose
exploits in comic books have sold 160 million copies around the world.
Asterix and his sidekick, Obelix, are usually busy defending their village
against the stupid but persistent Romans. But they took a breather to
celebrate the 25th birthday of their comic strip. Asterix and Obelix (imper-
sonated by actors) attended the opening of a reconstruction of a typical
Gaulish village at the park’s Musee en Herbe. Also on hand was Vitalstatis-
tix, the chief of Asterix’s village; sadly, Getafix, the Druid who concocts the
potion that gives Asterix his superhuman strength, could not make it.
Why is the diminutive warrior more popular in France than Tintin or
Mickey Mouse? “Asking for the reasons for Asterix’s success,” says Albert
Uderzo, who along with the late Rene Goscinny created the character, “is
like asking for the recipe of the magic potion. I can’t tell you.” Whatever the
reason, Asterix will undoubtedly continue to keep millions of his fans in
hysterix.

The Pope Plot: A Second Gun
The shooting in St. Peter’s Square: From behind the crowds, Agca (top left) takes aim and fires at the pontiff
Indictments suggest the Bulgarians—and perhaps the KGB —tried to kill John Paul 11.
For three years, Judge Ilario Martella
doggedly investigated the attempt on
the life of Pope John Paul 11. A Turkish
gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca, had been con-
victed of the crime, and as a result, Mar-
tella labored at first in near-obscurity. But
in November 1982, the arrest of a Bulgar-
ian airline official, Sergei Ivanov Antonov,
changed everything. If the “Bulgarian con-
nection” could be proved, then it would
not be hard to believe that the Soviet KGB
was the ultimate mastermind of a bizarre
conspiracy. Last week, at a courthouse in
Rome, Martella filed a 1,243-page final
report on the case, formally indicting
three Bulgarians, including Antonov, and
five Turks, including Agca, for complicity
in the plot to kill the pope. “My job
is complete,” said the 50-year-old
magistrate. “We must now wait for the
final phase.”
Martella’s report is supposed to remain
secret until the trial begins, probably some-
time next year, but 13 pages were made
public last week, listing the names of those
indicted and the main charges against
them. There was one major new revelation:
Martella claimed that a second gunman, a
Turk named Oral Celik, also had taken a
shot at John Paul in St. Peter’s Square on
May 13, 1981. Celik, 25, is thought to be
the man who was photographed running
away from the scene, and he is still at
large today. Martella said at a news
conference that Agca
fired the first two shots
at the pope, after which
Celik, who was standing
next to him, fired the
third bullet, hitting
John Paul’s finger and
grazing his arm. Neither
the pistol nor the bul-
let has ever been found.
But Martella insisted
that a ballistics report
and statements from
eyewitnesses all pointed
to Celik.
Martella was careful
to stress that guilt had
not yet been established.
But he concluded: “It
must be held certain
that a plot to kill the
pope existed.” Asked
whether the Soviet Union was involved, he
replied: “I have not addressed that issue. It
was not part of my job.” His list of indict-
ments, however, left no doubt that the
investigation had made the magistrate a
firm believer in the Bulgarian connection.
Christmas 1983: The victim forgives his jailed assailant


UPI;AP;ANSA;AP;CECISCIPIONI;UPI;AP
The suspects in what may be a bizarre international conspiracy: Aivazov, Celenk, Vassilev, Celik, Celebi, Antonov and Bagci
Antonov, who is under house arrest in
Rome, was accused of waiting with a car
outside St. Peter’s Square to help Agca and
Celik escape after the shooting. The Bul-
garians allegedly planned to smuggle the
two gunmen out of Italy in a truck protect-
ed from any search by a diplomatic seal; in
a separate report earlier this year, prosecu-
tor Antonio Albano speculated that Celik
actually may have escaped in that fashion.
The portion of the indictment made public
last week said that another Bulgarian, em-
bassy cashier Todor Aivazov, was min-
gling with the crowd at St. Peter’s, al-
though there was no indication of what he
is supposed to have done. Aivazov and the
third Bulgarian accused of complicity,
Maj. Zhelyu Vassilev, an aide to the mili-
tary attache, left Italy in 1982. So far,
Martella has not asked the Bulgarians to
extradite Aivazov and Vassilev.
The indictment also charges that a
Turkish businessman named Bekir Celenk
offered $1.2 million to Agca, Celik and
another defendant, Musar Cedar Celebi, to
kill the pope. It accuses a Turk named
Omer Bagci of smuggling into Italy the
Browning automatic pistol that Agca used
to shoot the pontiff; Agca himself is indict-
ed for his role in the smuggling operation.
The report charges that Agca, Celik and
the three Bulgarians scouted St. Peter’s
Square, “together establishing the spot
where the assassination was to have taken
place.” Agca and Celik allegedly brought
two “panic bombs” with them to cover
their escape; for some reason, the bombs
were never used. Currently, Bagci and Ce-
lebi are in Italian jails, Celik has dropped
out of sight, and Celenk, the purported
paymaster, is in Bulgaria, safely tucked
away under the government’s wing. Mar-
tella’s report also claims that “not less than
five” other “unidentified people” took part
in the plot.
“This trial will be very complex, very
difficult,” Martella said last week. The
case seems to hinge on testimony from
Agca, who has repeatedly changed his sto-
ry and been caught in lies during the past
three years. Antonov’s lawyer, Giuseppe
Consolo, said the case against his client
was based “only on Agca’s declaration,
and 70 percent of [that] has been denied by
Agca himself.” Consolo charged that Ital-
ian magistrates had “created this case, and
they are not courageous enough to dismiss
it.” While admitting that Agca is “an in-
credible person,” Martella insisted that
“not much” of his case was based on the
gunman’s unsupported testimony. He said
that strong circumstantial evidence cor-
roborated key parts of Agca’s evidence and
that the Turk had provided highly detailed
and accurate descriptions of the Bulgar-
ians, whom he knew only by aliases:
“Bayramic” for Antonov, “Sotir Kolev”
for Aivazov and “Sotir Petrov” for
Vassilev.
In his own, earlier report, prosecutor
Albano said that Agca’s testimony proved
to be reliable on the important aspects of
the case. Agca frequently lied about the

peripheral details, in an effort “to negoti-
ate his own possible liberty.” Agca haggled
“like the Levantine he is,” Albano wrote,
“presenting his wares, with variations in
the price, the color, the weight.” When his
Turkish and Bulgarian friends failed to
spring him from jail, Agca “entrusted him-
self to the clemency of our judicial order,”
Albano wrote.
Antonov claimed to be suffering from a
variety of ailments as he waited for the trial
to begin. Consolo said his client was under
severe “physical and psychological” strain,
but that he still insisted on his innocence,
The Bulgarian government maintained
that the case was nothing more than “a
political conspiracy against Bulgaria and
socialism.” Western diplomats in Rome
suggested that the Bulgarians may have
been particularly annoyed because Mar-
tella ignored their recent release of two
Italian tourists who had been sentenced on
espionage charges after Antonov’s arrest,
The Bulgarians may have hoped that Mar-
tella would reciprocate by dropping the
charges against Aivazov and Vassilev, who
are beyond his reach anyway. But Martella
does not make deals.
The Bulgarians appeared to have won
one small victory last week, however. Part-
ly for lack of evidence, and partly because
Agca recanted on his testimony, Martella
announced that he was dropping his inves-
tigation into Agca’s earlier allegations that
the same Bulgarians involved in the at-
tempted assassination of the pope were
also plotting to kill Lech Walesa, the
founder of Poland’s Solidarity movement.
The evidence gathered in that investigation
will not be used in Antonov’s trial. In any
event, relations between Italy and Bulgaria
have reached a new low. Late last week, a
member of the Italian Parliament report-
edly called for an end to diplomatic rela-
tions with Sofia.
That climate could turn even chillier in
the months, and perhaps years, ahead. Un-
der Italian law, the authorities now have
eighteen months in which to begin a trial,
and no one expects that the drama will
begin soon. Martella himself will not take
part. Now that his investigation is over, a
new prosecutor will be appointed for the
trial. Martella has taken the case much
further than most observers expected three
years ago, when Agca was widely written
off as a mad gunman who had acted alone.
But the prosecution is still a long way from
proving its charges before a jury. When the
case finally goes to court, Martella’s thick
dossier may provide Western Europe with
its trial of the century.
ANDREW NAGORSKI in Rome
The Low-Profile Judge
Judge Ilario Martella had been so successful in avoiding the
press during the course of his three-year investigation into the
plot to kill Pope John Paul II that journalists were startled
when he appeared at his own news conference last week.
Speaking sotto voce, he outlined the case in terse, dry terms,
emphasizing its complexity while keeping his disclosures well
within the limits of Italian secrecy laws. This was vintage
Martella: reserved, diligent, politically neutral and “totally
incorruptible,” as one high-ranking Communist Party member
once described him.
These are unusual qualities in a man who has
found himself in the center of an explosive crimi-
nal investigation. The 50-year-old Tuscan, credit-
ed with turning the “Bulgarian connection” from
journalistic jingo into a viable criminal charge,
first won public notice in 1975 as a magistrate in
the Rome attorney general’s office. There he
launched the successful prosecution of former De-
fense Minister Mario Tanassi, who was convicted
of accepting bribes from Lockheed Corp. In 1981,
when Martella was tapped to head the investiga-
tion of the papal plot, his appointment drew little
notice —not because of the low profile he had
cultivated over the years, but because of the per-
ceived impossibility of uncovering a conspiracy.
Martella: Scrupulous
ANSA
After his appointment Martella immediately—and quiet-
ly—traveled to Turkey, West Germany, Austria, Switzerland
and the United States, following leads. Under Italian criminal
procedure, a magistrate like Martella performs the functions of
a grand jury in the United States: weighing the testimony of
suspects and witnesses and determining whether there is suffi-
cient evidence to charge and try a case. With all the political
controversy surrounding this case, it is a tribute to Martella
that almost no one, including the Bulgarian government, has
attacked his personal integrity. While calling the case an “anti-
Socialist” plot, Sofia has avoided direct criticism of Martella.
Martella has been scrupulous in his dealings with Bulgarian
magistrates who claimed to be conducting their
own investigation. He has declared that “there is a
common interest in ascertaining the truth” about
who was responsible for the attack on the pope.
During the course of the investigation, he re-
mained respectful of the Bulgarians’ right to inter-
rogate the suspects. But he was firm about his own
aggressive use of Italian law, which permitted him
to detain Sergei Antonov for nearly two years
before formally charging him. Martella says he is
“content” that his work is finally over; the charges
will now be turned over to a prosecutor for trial.
But there is little doubt that Martella will be
closely observing from the sidelines the case he
worked so painstakingly to build.

DIPLOMACY
An ‘Explosive ' Test Backfires
At dinner with the queen: Overzealous security efforts spoiled the party
PHOTOS BY AP
At the Buckingham Palace banquet for
French President Franqois Mitterrand
in Britain last week, Queen Elizabeth had
“bombe glacee” served for dessert. It turned
out to be an unwittingly prophetic choice.
Mitterrand’s state visit, designed to cele-
brate 80 years of entente cordiale between
the two nations, nearly bombed itself.
The literal explosives were planted by one
of Mitterrand’s bodyguards to test British
security. But the ensuing political fireworks
highlighted old Anglo-French hostilities,
dominated the headlines, outraged Parlia-
ment and overshadowed Mitterrand’s dip-
lomatic achievements. “It sounds to
me,” said Tory M.P. Eldon Griffiths, “as if
the French brought Inspector Clouseau of
‘the Pink Panther’ to Britain.”
Plastic Explosives: The strange train of
events began shortly before Mitterrand was
to arrive for an opening-day reception at the
French ambassador’s residence in London.
According to Scotland Yard, a bomb
disposal expert attached to the president’s
party placed two four-ounce packets of
military-type plastic explosive on the em-
bassy grounds. British police were then
asked to make a security check. The idea, a
police spokesman said, was “to put our
ability [to protect Mitterrand] to the test.”
The concern about a possible security
lapse was understandable, especially in the
wake of the IRA bombing of the Brighton
hotel where British Prime Minister Marga-
ret Thatcher was staying. This time, howev-
er, two sniffer dogs—“ Lucy” and “Oli-
ver” —took only 10 minutes to find the
plastique. The packets were unarmed and-
harmless —but when Scotland Yard made
the “test” public a day later, the uproar
resounded across the nation. MP. ’s de-
nounced the “sick joke,” demanded an in-
vestigation and urged the recall of French
Ambassador Emmanuel Jacquin de Mar-
gerie. It was, as the conservative Daily Mail
wrote, “an enormous success for the Yard
and a diplomatic disaster for France.”
For their part, French officials scrambled
to achieve some damage control. “A minor
Mitterrand: Political fireworks
incident,” said Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson. At Mitterrand’s press confer-
ence later in the week the French president
said: “We must keep a sense of perspective.
That is, after all, a British quality.” Private-
ly, French diplomats tried to convince their
British counterparts that Mitterrand and
other senior officials had not known of the
“test.” The Foreign Office, apparently as-
suaged, labeled the incident “a case of ex-
cessive zeal by a very junior official.”
‘Sensational Declarations’: But French of-
ficials blamed the whole mess on the British.
The French Interior Ministry dismissed
Scotland Yard’s version as “sensational
declarations without any truth.” Police offi-
cials said the British had been informed in
advance of the test —a contention hotly de-
nied by the Yard. The French also said that
the still-unnamed bomb-disposal expert
brought the explosives to London on an
ordinary commercial flight, “in the normal
course of his duties,” for use in triggering
suspected bombs that might endanger the
president.
Margaret Thatcher would have none of
that. “The French authorities,” she told the
House of Commons, “are aware of our
views that it was wholly wrong for the indi-
vidual to have acted as he did. It is a matter
of most serious concern. Urgent discussions
have begun and will continue with the
French government about this incident.”
She did add one conciliatory note, saying
that the blowup “should not be allowed to
mar the success of the French visit.”
By that time, of course, the trip had al-
ready been marred. For one thing, Mitter-
rand had come to London to make a major
speech to the British Parliament on what he
sees as the urgent need for the superpowers
to resume direct arms-control talks as soon
as possible after the U.S. presidential elec-
tion. Rather than resuming separate negoti-
ations at Geneva and elsewhere, Mitterrand
suggested a new comprehensive approach
“in all the arms fields —be it a question of
strategic weapons or medium-range weap-
ons or possible new weapons that might be
used in space and chemical weapons.” But
all that was lost amid screaming headlines
over the bomb incident.
Perhaps that was to be expected. The
love-hate relationship between Britain and
France goes back hundreds of years, years of
alternating enmity and alliance. Through-
out Mitterrand’s visit there were constant
reminders of the suspicions each country
has of the other, even as they are trying to
forge “European” cooperation.. Mitterrand
spoke to a joint parliamentary session
Wednesday with full honors —a trumpet
fanfare and the yeomen of the guard (the
beefeaters) in their colorful medieval garb.
There was, however, one unintended gaffe.
On the walls in the Royal Gallery where he
spoke were frescoes 45 feet long—one on the
Battle of Waterloo, the other on the Battle of
Trafalgar, two of Britain’s most famous
victories over the French.

Britain: Facing Up to Violence
Trying to restrain an unruly crowd of mine workers in front of the House of Commons: An atmosphere of ‘sheer hatred’
A catalog of horrors plagues a country that was once renowned for its civility.
A huge bomb devastates a hotel in an
attempt to murder the leading mem-
bers of the government. A 14-year-old
Asian boy is beaten unconscious by a white
gang; then his back is slashed to ribbons
with a carpenter’s knife. A court hears that
a mother held her three-year-old daughter’s
head while her lover ripped the child’s teeth
out with a pair of pliers. A striker is
callously crushed to death on a picket
line. It is a catalog of horrors that
could have been culled from the po-
lice blotters of many troubled coun-
tries. But these incidents —and many
more like them —happened this year
in a land that once seemed the very
embodiment of civility and respect
for the law: Britain.
To be sure, Britain is still a relative-
ly tranquil land in an increasingly
brutalized world. Its violence does
not begin to approach that of Leba-
non; its murder rate is still far below
that of the United States. Even so,
terror and crime in Britain are rising
rapidly. Every day newspapers and
television tell of racist assaults, brutal
muggings and what has become a
running war between police and the
striking coal miners. Statistics show
that violent crime of all kinds in Brit-
ain has doubled in the past decade.
Though the number of murders has
remained steady, serious injuries
Police tactics: Paramilitary force?
from assaults have almost doubled and vio-
lent robberies have tripled.
The IRA bombing in Brighton two
weeks ago that killed four people and just
missed murdering Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was only one brutal episode in the
ongoing sectarian strife over Northern Ire-
land. In the past week, two more people were
JOHN HARRIS— IFL
killed in Ulster, bringing the total dead to 51
this year—and 2,396 since the British Army
entered the province in an attempt to keep
the peace in 1969. Almost 1,700 of those
killed have been civilians. IRA gunmen
have not been the only murderers. Time and
again, ordinary Protestants and Roman
Catholics have wantonly killed each other.
And as the Army and the police have
tried to contain the seething demon-
strators that are a recurring fact of life
in Northern Ireland, several children
have been killed by the plastic bullets
used for “crowd control.”
Baton Wielding: At the moment,
the worst violence in Britain stems
from the eight-month-old miners’
strike. The dispute has turned into a
savage battle between the miners and
the government, which appears to be
using the police as the equivalent of a
paramilitary force of strikebreakers.
In recent weeks, it seems, no televi-
sion broadcast has been complete
without scenes of baton-wielding po-
lice smashing into crowds of cursing,
rock-throwing miners in towns and
villages throughout central and
northern England.
Two miners have been killed on the
picket lines —one had his chest
crushed in a vast shoving crowd and
the other was killed by a truck trying
to break through a picket line.
Roughly 7,500 miners have been ar-
rested and almost 3,000 have been


AP
hurt badly enough in the frequent melees to
need medical treatment. On the other side
of the lines, 750 policemen have been in-
jured, about 75 of whom had to be hospital-
ized. Police have been lured into traps by
fake emergency calls and then beaten up. In
one especially shocking incident last week, a
female police sergeant was chased from a
police station in the mining village of
Grimethorpe and attacked by a mob.
Labor violence is certainly not a new
phenomenon in Britain. But what separates
the latest unrest from most other incidents
in the past is the level of anger on both sides.
Even some law-enforcement officials admit
that the police have sometimes been unnec-
essarily ferocious in their conflicts with
the strikers. South Yorkshire Councilor
George Moores recently denounced the
Grimethorpe police as “Nazi Storm Troop-
ers.” Last week Moores told Newsweek’s
Tony Clifton that the sometimes violent
eruptions on the part of the strikers were not
surprising. “When you hear police telling
miners they could only afford to strike be-
cause their wives were out whoring, you can
fully understand why they were provoked
into retaliation,” he said. “I was appalled by
the sheer hatred [demonstrated by] the po-
lice abuse.”
Racial Attacks: Britain’s new ugliness
also extends to racial violence, which has
become endemic in many neighborhoods.
Assaults on immigrants from countries
such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh
are clearly carried out for one reason:
the victims are not white. “Any official
figures for racial attacks in this area can be
multiplied by at least 10,” says Barbara
Powis, a social worker in the racially trou-
bled East London suburb of Tower Ham-
lets. “People have stopped calling the
police because they know there is no
point—the authorities simply don’t do
enough to help these people.”
Even among the white middle class, acts
of violence have become almost routine of
late. The country’s raffish tabloids, which
once would seize on almost any incident for
a front-page headline, now cover only the
most lurid cases. One trial that achieved
that dubious distinction was held in London
last week. A gang of young toughs was
charged with torturing a shopkeeper and
his wife to make them turn over their
money. According to their own testimony,
Cecily Tipple, 56, was sexually humiliated
before being battered unconscious. Her

Mine strike victim: A savage battle
husband, Harry, 59, had half of an ear
sawed off by the alleged assailants; then
they hacked off one of his toes and stuffed it
in his mouth.
Such acts of savagery have begun to take
a heavy psychological toll, even among
those who are not the victims. In a survey
conducted for a recent government report,
almost 60 percent of women who were
polled said they felt “very unsafe” after
dark. Inevitably, growing fears from virtu-
ally all segments of society have prompted
experts to search for a reason for the rash of
violence. One of the most frequently pro-
posed theories might be called the “Clock-
work Orange” syndrome—which contends
that Britain’s huge unemployment has wid-
ened the gap between the haves and have-
nots, spawning gangs of alienated youths
who commit crimes for monetary gains or
just for kicks.
Massive Unemployment: Many experts
are skeptical of that theory. Criminologists
point out that Britain suffered from massive
unemployment during the Great Depres-
sion of the 19305, yet the country never
endured any dramatic upsurge in violence.
Experts also cite the situation in Eastern
Europe—which theoretically has no unem-
ployment. Crime there also seems to be on
the rise, they say. Those two facts have led
experts to another explanation for Britain’s
current plight: that the country’s popula-
tion now contains the highest percentage
ever of males in their late teens and early
20s, the demographic group that commits
the most crimes. If that theory is correct,
then the peace and safety that Britain en-
joyed for so many years may be gone for the
time being.

Calling Out the Army
Troops lining a road in Sebokeng during the raid:' I am your friend, trust me'
MARK PETERS
A crackdown on blacks fuels unrest in South Africa.
It was the largest crackdown on South
Africa’s blacks in years. Like an invading
army, 7,000 police and Army troops moved
before dawn on Tuesday to seal off the black
township of Sebokeng. Police armed with
submachine guns went door to door, wak-
ing the residents and searching their homes.
Then the forces replayed the scene in the
nearby townships of Sharpeville and Boipa-
tong. When they were done, police had gone
through the homes of nearly 200,000
blacks, and arrested more than 350. The
purpose of the raid, said Louis Le Grange,
minister of law and order, was to “rid the
country of criminal and revolutionary ele-
ments.” But it seemed more likely to fuel the
nation’s growing racial unrest.
The raid —code-named Operation Pal-
miet (Bulrush) —marked the first time in
nearly 25 years that the government had
called out the Army against the country’s
blacks. It was also the first time Pretoria had
used mass searches to find its political oppo-
nents. The assault followed months of tur-
moil in the country’s black townships. Since
August more than 100 people have been
killed and hundreds injured in riots
throughout the country. Hardly a day now
passes without a confrontation between
protesters and police. Last week’s crack-
down, personally approved by President
Pieter Botha, did little to quiet the streets,
however. On Thursday night several thou-
sand youths went on a rampage in the south-
ern coastal city of Port Elizabeth, stoning
police and burning a truck. Police respond-
ed by firing rubber bullets, tear gas and even
birdshot into the crowd. The next day the
government banned public gatherings of
three black organizations,
The siege of the townships was organized
with military precision. According to a po-
lice spokesman, the government decided to
raid Sebokeng because it was the “most
sensitive” area of unrest. Eight-man police
squads entered each house only after its
residents answered the door. They made no
forced entries. After completing their
searches, police marked the hands of resi-
dents with red ink and gave them stickers
saying “I am your friend, trust me,” and
“Cooperation for peace and security.’’Most
of those arrested were charged with posses-
sion of firearms, banned literature, drugs or
stolen goods—or for failing to produce
proper identification papers. Police said
special courts would be established to han-
die the cases.
‘Civil War’: Black leaders and moderate
whites immediately condemned the raid,
Trevor Manuel, a spokesman for the United
Democratic Front (UDF), an increasingly
influential antiapartheid group, said that
the use of troops signaled that the nation’s
police forces were inadequate to control
mounting civil strife, and that the country
was entering a state of “civil war.” Criticism
also came from Bishop Manas Buthelezi,
president of the South African Council of
Churches, and Peter Soal of the opposition
Progressive Federal Party. Soal said the
search failed to address “the root causes
of unrest.”
Not since the Soweto riots of 1976 has the
mood of South Africa’s 22 million blacks
been so grim. The recent wave of unrest was
triggered by elections in August for legisla-
tive chambers representing the country’s
Colored (mixed race) and Indian minorities.
The assemblies were created by a new South
African Constitution, approved last year,
that gave no power to blacks and kept con-
trol of lawmaking powers firmly in the
hands of whites. The UDF called the Con-
stitution a sham and organized a boycott of
the parliamentary elections. Their efforts
were largely successful: 70 percent of Col-
ored voters and 80 percent of Indians stayed
away from the polls.
The country’s growing economic diffi-
culties are only adding to the problem.
Lackluster demand for gold during the last
two years has sharply cut South Africa’s
export earnings. And at a time when most
industrialized nations are overcoming years
of high inflation, Pretoria is battling a 12-
percent inflation rate that is expected to go
even higher. Home mortgages now stand at
a biting 20 percent, and taxes are up.
Inevitably, South Africa’s blacks have
suffered most from the economic troubles.
Unemployment among blacks is rising,
and the country’s flagging automobile in-
dustry has laid off 9,000 workers —most of
them black —since June. Such pressures
have only added to the resentment over
political repression. A recent riot in
Sharpeville that left nearly 40 dead erupted
shortly after township administrators an-
nounced a 15 percent increase in rents.
Vote: The continuing violence, and last
week’s raid, have further tarnished South
Africa’s image abroad. On the day after
the searches, the United Nations Security
Council voted 14-0 —the United States ab-
stained —to condemn South Africa’s racist
policies and called for the dismantling of
tribal “homelands.” Britain, which has of-
ten joined the United States in abstaining
from U.N. resolutions against South Afri-
ca, chose this time to vote in favor of the
resolution. The measure denounced the
“continued massacres of oppressed people,
as well as the arbitrary arrest and deten-
tion of leaders and activists of mass organi-
zations” and called for the “immediate
eradication” of apartheid.
Before the vote, the Council heard an
impassioned plea for justice from Nobel
Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond
Tutu, who had returned to New York after
a celebratory visit to South Africa. “Blacks
are not intent on driving whites into the
sea,” he told the delegates, “but claiming
only their rightful place in the sun in the
land of their birth.” Tutu criticized the
violent tactics of both the government and
some of its opponents. “Violence is not the
answer to the crisis of our land,” he said.
But as long as Pretoria continues to harass
and intimidate the country’s blacks, the
bitterness is sure to grow, and many will
see violence as their only way to freedom.

Understandably, the comfort and
service in the Economy Class can’t be
the same as in the Business Class, nor
that in the Business Class the same as
in the First Class. But there are excep-
tions: for example, the eight music
programmes in the B-747s and DC-lOs,
amongst which nearly everyone can
find something to please the ear,
whether classical or popular. Or the
selection of newspapers, which in the
good Swiss tradition are always avail-
able in several languages. Or the range
of tax-free articles on board.
First Class passengers - how could
it be otherwise? - have the biggest
choice of things to eat and drink: on
long-haul routes, three different and
exquisite main meals, the best cham-
pagnes and wines, superb cognacs and
whiskies. And the Slumberettes in our
B-747s and DC-lOs can be adjusted for
maximum seating or sleeping comfort.
Although it has to be said that the
seats in the Business Class on these air-
craft are equally conducive to a relax-
ing little nap. And of course you can
choose the seat in which you feel most
at ease when you make your booking.
And when it comes to gastronomic
matters, not only is each course served
separately but you can also choose be-
tween two or even three main meals -
no easy task with all those delicacies.
But our guests in the Economy
Class don’t miss out either. Where the
length of the flight so permits, their
meals are presented on china, together
with proper cutlery, and their wine is
served in glasses. Which is only right
and proper.
After all, you make the most impor-
tant choice before you fly: Swissair.

CAMPAIGN'84
Reagan:
Going for
A Sweep
Walter Mondale is fighting valiantly, but the polls
show a large—and growing—lead for the president.
Never in his 20 years in public office had
Walter Mondale attracted such huge
and enthusiastic crowds. A good part of
Philadelphia turned out to cheer him in
a public square last week. Blue-collar
Youngstown, Ohio, added its own give-’em-
hell chorus. Country folk
chimed in up and down
the Mississippi. But the
high spirits faded in a Mil-
waukee hotel suite. Pass-
ing around the latest poll
numbers, campaign chair-
man James Johnson con-
firmed the upward bounce
in Ronald Reagan’s rat-
ings after Debate Two —
and the downward slide
in Mondale’s. The candi-
date resisted the message.
“That’s not what I’m feel-
ing out there in those
crowds,” Mondale said.
He knew the feel of a
losing campaign, he insist-
ed, and “these aren’t los-
ers’ crowds.”
It wasn’t much. But in
the final week to decision,
that gut instinct became
Mondale’s last hope. By every objective
measure, Ronald Reagan was positioned to
ride a potential landslide mandate into his
second term. Results of Newsweek’s final
campaign poll gave the president a 17-point
advantage and left Mondale with meager
consolation: his slashing campaign and ear-
nest debate style had won him some healthy
respect, but nothing close to the strength to
defeat his 73-year-old opponent. Reagan’s
own poll numbers showed an 8-point surge
in one day after the Kansas City debate and
recorded the president ahead in every state.
Cautious White House estimates put him in

range of his 489-to-49 electoral-vote victory
over Jimmy Carter; the optimists took aim
at Richard Nixon’s 520-to-17 thrashing of
George McGovern. Mondale ordered his
staffers not to discuss polls of any sort,
snapping: “Polls don’t vote; people do.” But
a key Democratic num-
bers cruncher acknowl-
edged that “Mondale’s
now heading for a respect-
able loss. He may get it.
Then again he may not.”
The president’s final
forays targeted the Demo-
cratic heartland of Penn-
sylvania and West Virgin-
ia as his strategists poured
campaign funds into
Democratic Hawaii —and
even into Mondale’s Min-
nesota. Quite simply, his
goal was to make history,
sweeping all 50 states.
Reagan also hoped to pre-
serve his Republican Sen-
ate majority by boosting
endangered candidates in
Illinois, North Carolina,
lowa and elsewhere. Vice
President George Bush
targeted key congressional races in his own
high-stakes assignment: to build another
pro-Reagan “working majority” in the
Democratic House. Reagan’s strategists
scheduled a final advertising blitz on Mon-
dale’s record—but were also reviving the
sugary “morning-in-America” commer-
cials of the early campaign. The president
himself was to modulate his Democrat-
bashing and stress his loftier themes; if
nothing else, said one aide, a victorious
Reagan would demonstrate that “this is
no Nixon.”
Reagan was as jovial as he was confident.

betting that the American people are more compassionate, more caring, than Reagan thinks'
LARRY DOWNING— NEWSWEEK
In an interview with Newsweek’s Thomas
M. DeFrank and Eleanor Clift, the presi-
dent declined to predict victory and only
faintly damned Mondale, acknowledging
that his opponent was “sincere” and “hon-
est in his views.” But Reagan did allow
himself a peek at a second term forged from a
“bipartisan” electorate, in which “people
are crossing the lines to vote because they
agree more with the things that we’re pro-
posing than they do with [the opposition].”
Reagan fell short of predicting the Republi-
canization of America. “Having been a
member of the other party myself, I know
how difficult it is to bring yourself to
change,” he said, adding: “It’s almost like
changing religions.” The president was con-
fident enough to forecast no major staff or
cabinet shake-ups for term two. “I haven’t
queried anyone or heard any reports” about
anyone wanting to leave, he said —adding
that he was “perfectly content” with his
first-term team.
Shift: Reagan’s cau-
tion was proper; polls
can be fickle, and even in
victory a president’s sec-
ond-term honeymoon is
usually briefer and rock-
ier than his first. Yet af-
ter Campaign ’B4, many
political scientists have
concluded, the tea leaves
reveal evidence of a fun-
damental voter shift into
the Republican ranks. At
the very least, the out-
come will dramatically
shape the style and out-
put of federal Washing-
ton in 1985. Reagan’spo-
licymakers were already
anticipating a friendly
hearing for their still-
vague plans to create
Reagan’s legacy: a balanced budget and a
significant arms deal with the Soviets. On
Nov. 6, predicted a Reagan numbers man,
“the chance of sunny skies for Republicans
is 60 percent.”
That roseate forecast—and its psy-war
inference that Reagan’s bandwagon was un-
stoppable —still had to contend with a Wal-
ter Mondale in peak form for the last week of
political combat. Despite debates within his
staff over the themes his ads should stress,
the underdog declared that he would cam-
paign on his vision of a fair and caring
Democratic future—more than that, that he
would drop his futile attacks on Reagan’s
leadership and assault the incumbent’s
“selfish” values instead. He scheduled final
dashes through his Northeast and Midwest
target regions. In a display of party loyalty,
he also flew to lost-cause Texas to boost the
Senate candidacy of fellow Democrat Lloyd
Doggett. His determination was catching.
“It’s like another burst of energy for all of
us,” said press secretary Maxine Isaacs.
“Mondale is back to bedrock.”
In an interview with Newsweek’s Mar-
LARRY DOWNING— NEWSWEEK
Cheers: Energy


garet Garrard Warner, Mondale derided
polls that “look backward” and warned
“the Reagan crowd” that “they’re getting
pretty cocky.. . . The public does not think
this election’s over. They’re not going to be
taken for granted.” He intended to place his
final political wager on the voters’ good
instincts, Mondale said. “I’m betting that
the American people are more compassion-
ate, more caring than [Reagan] thinks,” he
said. “Most Americans go to church and
synagogue and have been taught by their
parents to believe in something. Independ-
ence and self-reliance, yes. But we are not a
selfish people.”
Tough Words: Mondale emerged from
the Kansas City debate slashing at Rea-
gan’s leadership record. The strategy was
to pound home the incumbent’s numerous
factual errors —and to make up for the fact
that Mondale had failed to rattle his adver-
sary. Mondale looked fatigued, but his
words were tough. He told New Jersey
students that in the debate they had ob-
served “the most detached, the most re-
mote, the most uninformed president in
modern history.” In Youngstown he pro-
duced a 1960 letter to Richard Nixon
signed “Ronnie Reagan.” Reagan wrote
that John F. Kennedy’s program “is still
old Karl Marx,” and added: “There is
nothing new in the idea of a Govt [sic]
being Big Brother to us all. Hitler called
his ‘State Socialism.’ ” Last week, Reagan
(who has cited Kennedy freely during the
Mondale-Ferraro rally in Wisconsin: According to the candidate, ‘These aren’t losers’ crowds’
campaign) explained that he merely had
been arguing for less government. Mon-
dale in turn embraced Kennedy-style ac-
tivism: “That’s not Karl Marx! That’s not
Adolf Hitler! That’s America at its best!”
By midweek, as his attacks on Reagan’s
conduct showed few results, Mondale’s em-
phasis shifted more fully to Democratic
heroes and values. During a “harvest tour”
of Mississippi Valley towns in Illinois, Mis-
souri and lowa, he conjured up the voters
from “little farm homes,” “little stores on
Main Street” and “little churches” who had
turned out in 1948 to elect Harry Truman,
In Cleveland, after shaking off the dismal
polls, the liberated candidate rejected a go-
Battle of the Political Ads
The Seattle Seahawks and San Diego
Chargers have to stir up most of the blood
and dust on ABC’s “Monday Night Foot-
ball” this week —but don’t sell the presi-
dential candidates short. The Reagan and
Mondale campaigns each bought 30 sec-
onds of the show to get in their licks at
$ 130,000 a shot. After months of quick cuts
and clipped words, each side’s final ad blitz
will round out its message. The Reaganites
are resurrecting some of their springtime
homilies to “morning in America,” letting
the Great Communicator do much of his
own talking—and attacking the Demo-
crat’s planned tax hikes. Ads for Mondale
feature the candidate (and in some cases
Geraldine Ferraro) summing up Demo-
cratic beliefs —while other spots press
tough attacks against the Reagan credo.
For the last, frantic two weeks of Cam-
paign ’B4, the Reagan and Mondale camps
have purchased nearly $8 million in com-
mercial time on the three national net-
works alone, and an estimated $7 million
more for local ads in strategic regional
markets. Reagan was outspending Mon-
dale by nearly 2 to 1 for network time,
Mondale officials said they were concen-
trating on local advertising in key target
areas. But according to research by Wash-
ington’s National Election Services Corp.,
Reagan was outspending Mondale at the
grass-roots level as well. In Cleveland, for
example, Reagan was ahead $78,000 to
$70,000. In Portland, Ore., Mondale had
just come from behind to edge out Reagan
$61,000t0555,000. But in all, says Michael
Farley of Election Services, “Mondale is
getting blown out.”
Targets: At the local level, Mondale tar-
geted blue-collar voters in the Northeast
and Midwest, farm voters in the rural Mid-
west and young West Coast professionals,
The network battle of the superstars also
focused on important constituencies,
Mondale devoted proportionately twice
Reagan’s resources to educated news-show
audiences. To hedge his bet on Monday
football, he also scheduled the so-called
“women’s alternative” shows on CBS —
including 30 seconds on “Kate & Allie”
and a longer spot before “Cagney & La-
cey.” For his part, Reagan outspent Mon-
dale foraging for women voters among the
daytime shows. Both campaigns will court
the elderly vote more energetically. Mon-
dale and Reagan ads also will compete head
to head on NBC’s “St. Elsewhere,” a yup-
pie favorite.
As the final blitz begins, viewers will s£e
a change in the now-familiar scare ads on
foreign policy. Reagan has retired his met-
aphorical bear in the woods with its Voice
of Authority asking: “Isn’t it smart to be as
strong as the bear?” Mondale has scrapped
his flashing red phone, with voice-over
warning that once Reagan puts “killer
weapons in space . . . computers will take
control.” In its place, the Mondale camp
will begin airing a tough new ad reminis-
cent of Lyndon Johnson’s girl-in-the-dai-
sy-field. Set to the tune of Crosby, Stills,
Nash & Young’s “Teach Your Children,”
it alternates images of children playing
with scenes of nuclear missiles being
launched. However the last round of ads is
received, one thing is certain: they will be
gone forever in just another week.

for-the-jugular attack on Reagan’s Lebanon
record suggested by adviser Patrick Cad-
dell. Instead, Mondale electrified his audi-
ence with an assault on Reagan’s “selfish-
ness, this greed, this new championship of
caring only for yourself.” A day later in Des
Moines, he continued his offensive against
the “celluloid” presidency and included a
toned-down passage of the Caddell speech;
it scored Reagan for celebrating last week’s
anniversary of the successful Grenada inva-
sion while ignoring that of the Marine mas-
sacre in Lebanon. “Today we have a happy-
talk president, who’s only around for the
good news,” Mondale said.
Foreboding: His running mate, Geraldine
Ferraro, prosecuted her own feisty case for
the ticket, pursued, as usual, by vague sto-
ries about her realtor husband, John Zac-
caro. In Queens the would-be vice president
rallied the union vote, warning that a “50
percent labor turnout won’t be enough.” In
Harlem she lectured black ministers, argu-
ing that the disadvantaged “have only them-
selves to blame if they stay home and let
Ronald Reagan be president again.” As the
forebodings of Mondale’s staffers began
leaking out, Ferraro ordered her own staff to
stay optimistic. “I don’t want anyone on this
airplane talking about losing,” she told
aides. “We’re going to win”
Ferraro chose to keep silent herself about
the latest newspaper stories hinting impro-
prieties in Zaccaro’s real-estate deals. In
addition, the Manhattan district attorney
was investigating at least two matters close
to home. One probe centered on an improp-
GOP turnout in Oregon: ‘Our troops are fired up’

er credit-union loan used as partial payment
by a property buyer. The real-estate broker:
John Zaccaro. Another examined an altered
sales contract on five Queens apartment
buildings. One of the sellers: John Zaccaro.
The Reagan campaign sailed along on far
more placid waters. Amid the balloon drops
and giant flags, the Gipper was a fount of
one-liners, barbs and a quick comeback to
one heckler: “I just may let Mondale raise
his taxes.” Even after he tripped and fell on
some rain-slicked steps up to Air Force One,
a spokesman noted that the president had
“spit on his hand” to check for scrapes—
and presumably to secure the macho vote.
With only some serious mistake threatening
his victory, the president avoided press con-
ferences and risky question-and-answer ses-
sions and seldom deviated from his standard
campaign speech. He insisted that he was
keeping his fingers crossed —even as Bush
exuberantly predicted that “we are going to
win this election.” “The polling figures
support it,” the vice president told
Newsweek’s Vern E. Smith. “Our troops
are fired up. There is no complacency. There
is a determination to win and win big.”
Majority: The stress on “big” is Reagan’s
best chance of fashioning a Capitol Hill
majority in 1985. His success is not guaran-
teed. Congressional Democrats are benefit-
ing from stand-pat voter attitudes that favor
most incumbents. In the Senate, 12 Demo-
cratic incumbents are expected to win, and
the Democrats are optimistic about their
chances in lowa and Tennessee —victories
that would narrow the Republican Senate
majority to 53-47. In the House, Republi-
cans hope to chip away at the 99-seat Demo-
cratic majority. A gain of about 25 could
restore Reagan’s “ideological majority” of
Republicans and conservative Democrats.
But few forecasts award the GOP
more than 20 new House seats. And
Democrats already are anticipating
1986, the kind of off-year election that
usually hands major losses to a sec-
ond-term president.
Reagan cannot bank on automatic
support even from his Republican al-
lies. In the Senate, the balance of pow-
er might well end up in the votes of
GOP moderates who sometimes bri-
dle at Reagan’s soaring defense budg-
et combined with deficit spending. In
the House, any new Republicans are
likely to fit the superconservative
mold of Mississippi’s Trent Lott and
Georgia’s Newt Gingrich—who sup-
port Reagan’s social-spending cuts
but often demand more discipline in
the defense budget as well.
Lethargy: Reagan himself had yet
to offer any bold new legislative agen-
da beyond doing “what we’ve been
doing”—that is, cutting the budget,
keeping down taxes, thinning out
government regulations and two-
tracking his military buildup with a
more concerted quest for arms con-
trol. The agenda suggested the lethar-
gy of a second-term Eisenhower. But with
Election Day approaching, that prospect
seemed likely to satisfy the American ma-
jority. Most voters obviously shrugged off
the president’s factual slip-ups in Kansas
City—and shrugged off Mondale’s at-
tempts to capitalize on them. There were
some smaller bumps in the Reagan re-elec-
tion trail. Newspapers raised a stir when 22
of his appointed ambassadors dropped their
diplomatic reserve to endorse North Caroli-
na’s superhawk Sen. Jesse Helms for re-
election. Then Secretary of State George
Shultz delivered a speech that hinted at
American military action against some ter-
rorist groups. All such potential obstacles
shared one characteristic: they slowed down
the Gipper not a bit.
The sheer weight of Reagan’s momentum
must be some consolation to his challenger.
Mondale has not fumbled away the election
like a 1972 McGovern. He has not faded into
a bad aftertaste like a 1980 Carter. To the
contrary, he silenced the “old-fashioned
Fritz” talk with his dramatic selection of a
running mate. He eliminated the “wimp
factor” with one smooth and savvy debate
triumph over the Great Communicator.
Even as the clock ticks down on Mondale’s
candidacy, his audiences have swelled, local
pols have flocked to his side and Mondale
buttons have sprouted on the streets. “I
guess it’s about the highest possible honor,
to get the chance to define your nation’s
future on behalf of the Democratic Party,”
he says—and he intends to keep sharpening
that definition until he flies home to Minne-
sota for Election Day.

HOW THE AGUSTA GROUP MAKES
The A 129 Mongoose pictured below is the l most advanced
helicopter in its class in the world today. It is also the first
specialised defence helicopter produced in Europe. And it
was conceived, designed and built by Agusta Group tech-

Producing a helicopter like the A 129 demands immense
technological know-how. But the Agusta Group has some
impressive resources to call on. A vast organisation of scien-
tists and technicians devoted exclusively to research and

nology in action. In terms of advanced systems: the A 129 is
the first helicopter to use an Integrated Multiplexing
System. This monitors and controls the Al29’s mechanical,
electrical, electronic and warfare systems, managing auto-
matically all flight and mission functions.
In terms of new materials: the A 129 makes extensive use of
advanced composites, developed and produced by the
Agusta Group at its own new plant in Anagni.
In terms of survivability: because this factor is so vital for a
dedicated helicopter, advanced technology has been
applied to this end in key areas (rotors, transmission, fusel-
age, flight controls).
In terms of day/night capability: the A 129 incorporates ad-
vanced infra-red systems allowing round-the-clock combat

Tough Talk
On Terrorism
It sounded as if Secretary of State
George Shultz was adopting a new bat-
tle cry for American’s threatened by ter-
rorists at home or abroad: a new line from
the American television series “Hill Street
Blues”: “Let’s do it to them before they do
it to us.” Speaking before the Park Avenue
Synagogue in New York last week, Shultz
called for support for U.S. military action
against terrorists —perhaps even before
they attacked. Some U.S. servicemen and
innocent civilians might be killed, Shultz
warned, and retaliatory action might have
to take place “before each and every fact is
known.” “We may never have the kind of
evidence that can stand up in an American
court of law,” he said. “But we cannot
allow ourselves to become the Hamlet of
nations, worrying endlessly over whether
and how to respond.”
Shultz had spoken out before on the
need for strict antiterrorist measures. But
his harsh words seemed to suggest a policy
dispute within the administration. Asked
in the last presidential debate in Kansas
City why he had not retaliated for the
terrorist bombings in Beirut that claimed
more than 250 American lives, Ronald
Reagan said the United States would re-
spond “only if we can put our finger on the
people responsible and not endanger the
lives of innocent citizens.” After learning
of Shultz’s remarks, Reagan at first said
that they also represented his views, but
later seemed to backtrack slightly, telling
reporters “I don’t think it was a statement
of policy.” For his part, Vice President
George Bush openly disagreed with
Shultz, saying, “I think you’ve got to pin-
point [the terrorists] . . . We’re not going
Shultz: ‘We cannot worry endlessly over how to respond ’
RICHARD DREW— AP
to go out and bomb innocent civilians.”
White House and State Department offi-
cials hastily insisted that both Bush and
Shultz were right—and that both were re-
stating administration policy. The United
States is prepared to wage both retaliatory
and pre-emptive strikes against terrorists,
officials said, and to launch military actions
against nations such as Syria, Libya or Iran
if there is evidence linking them to specific
terrorist acts. American forces are also pre-
pared to risk “limited” civilian casualties,
but that has always been the
rub. “We’re not going to blow
up an apartment building in
order to get one guy,” said one
official.
After the bombing of the
Marine barracks in Beirut last
year, U.S. military and intelli-
gence agencies drew up de-
tailed plans for a surgical strike
on a suspected terrorist head-
quarters in Lebanon’s Bekaa
Valley, but Gen. John W. Ves-
sey Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, opposed the
plan. The United States also
has not responded to the car
bombing at the U.S. Embassy
annex in East Beirut in Sep-
tember —a fact officials said il-
lustrated the practical and po-
litical problems of identifying
the right target and justifying
such an act at home.
Evacuation: Shultz was
clearly calling for stronger
American resolve in such
cases. “Our morality must not
paralyze us,” he said. Coming
amid continuing reports that
terrorists may strike another
U.S. target before the Nov. 6
election, and the further evac-
uation of American personnel
from Lebanon last week, some observers
wondered whether Shultz’s speech also sig-
naled that some U.S. antiterrorist action
might be imminent. The answer was by no
means clear. But the contradictory voices
within the administration only under-
scored the lack of any consensus—even
among Reagan’s advisers —on how to han-
dle the growing threat of international
terrorism.

JOHN WALCOTT in Washington
Saving the Children
Last week the British Broadcasting Corporation televised a series of
reports on the massive, drought-induced famine in Ethiopia. The film
captured in horrific detail the plight of millions—literally millions—of
starving people. The BBC film, reported by Michael Buerk, was shot
partly in refugee camps and partly in the countryside. The film shows
people scrabbling for single grains of rice, squatting in primitive huts—
and burials. Several times, Buerk would point to a corpse and say: “This
baby died just after we filmed him.” And then, “This old man died just
after he was brought to this camp.”
No one anticipated the astonishing public response. In the 36 hours
after the film was first telecast, more than 10,000 people called Save the
Children to offer their help. An elderly woman living on social security
asked if they would accept a contribution in coins. A new father made a
donation in the name of his baby son. By the end of the week, Britons had
given more than $6 million to help the starving Ethiopians, and the
British government had added an equivalent $6 million. The U.S.
government committed $45 million for food aid —and at Save the
Children headquarters, the phones continued to ring.

Matsushita in Electronic Components Technology
PUTTING THE COHCEPT
OF THE LASER BACK ON THE BEAM
Few modern instruments hold as
much true consumer potential as the laser,
yet few are more misunderstood. Too often
the experimental or military applications
of the laser are emphasized at the expense
of its practical value.
Matsushita Electric is encouraging
a friendlier conception of the laser by
utilizing it in products that touch our every-
day lives. Products like Compact Disc,
a 12cm-diameter circle of coated plastic
that can hold more than 70 minutes of
pure digital music. A semiconductor laser
developed by Matsushita Electric plays
this disc—by reflecting off microscopic
pits on the surface—with absolutely no
distortion or audible noise.
Two other disc products, the 20cm-
diameter Optical Memory Disc and Optical
Document Filing Disc, can hold 15,000
still pictures and 10,000 letter-size docu-
ments, respectively. The key to recording
and playing back these revolutionary storage
media? The same semiconductor laser.
You’ll also find our laser technology
at work in optical communications systems
that can transmit voices and pictures at the
speed of light. Such systems have already
been developed for use in subway infor-
mation networks and CATV broadcasting.
But the laser is just one example of
Matsushita’s electronic component expert-
ise. We design and manufacture literally
thousands of different components—
from microcomputers to sensors. They
form the backbone of new and exciting
products that are making our lives easier'
and more enjoyable.
And that, we believe, is what elec-
tronics is all about.

WORLD BUSINESS
A Marriage of Convenience
Trade between Japan and the United States suits the needs of both countries.
As the story of international trade is
commonly told, Japan is the wicked
witch of the East. Using a variety of unfair
practices, Japan severely restricts imports
and bolsters exports. As a result, millions of
Americans are thrown out of work, and
portions of the nation’s industrial sector
verge on ruin. But as it turns out, the simple
characterization of Japan as villain and the
United States as victim is pretty much a
fairy tale. In fact, Japan returns most of the
dollars the United States spends on its
goods—and the trade relationship as it now
stands may be ideally suited to the economic
needs and priorities of both countries. “On
purely economic grounds,” says Robert
Lawrence, an economist at the Brookings
Institution, “the U.S.-Japanese relation-
ship is very nearly perfect.”
The idea that the United States, running
an overall trade deficit of $ 102 billion, is on
ideal terms with Japan may take some get-
ting used to. Indeed, at first glance the
statistics look one-sided. Since 1975 the dif-
ference between the amount of goods Amer-
ica imports from Japan and those it exports
has grown from $1.7 billion to a projected
$3O billion for 1984 (chart). And several
U.S. industries have been severely damaged
by competition from Japan. But that is only
part of the story. Growing right along with
the gap has been the flow of Japanese money
into the United States, to buy government
and private securities, real estate and to
finance joint ventures, such as the Toyota-
General Motors project to produce small
cars at a factory in Fremont, Calif. This year
the Japanese government, corporations and
private citizens will pour $25 billion into the
U.S. economy, according to estimates made
by Lawrence Kreicher, an international
economist at Irving Trust Co. That money,
in turn, will help finance the budget deficit,
modernize factories and generally improve
the U.S. standard of living.
The mutually beneficial nature of this
arrangement is gaining increased attention.
In a recent essay in London’s Financial
Times, Chicago economist David Hale pro-
posed marriage for the partners, noting that
they had that crucial prerequisite for mari-
tal bliss, “complementary neuroses” (a
compulsion to save and a compulsion to
spend). “It seems to me that more and more
Japan is becoming part of the U.S. econo-
my,” says Takeji Yamashita, general man-
ager of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. “Some
people even joke that Japan is becoming the
51st state, and that the Bank of Japan is
becoming the Tokyo branch of the Federal
Reserve.”
Asian Dynamos: Like any good marriage,
the trade bond between the Asian power-
house and the United States has been rela-
tively stable. In 1972 the U.S. trade deficit
with Japan was 29 percent of the total vol-
ume of trade between the two nations, says
Kreicher; in 1983 that figure stood almost
unchanged, at 30 percent. The explosive
growth in the U.S. trade imbalance, in fact,
has come from elsewhere. The Pacific-basin
dynamos of Taiwan, Hong Kong and South
Korea boosted their trade surpluses with
the United States by a total of $13.2 billion
last year alone. The European Common
Market turned its 1982 trade deficit of $7.7
billion with the United States into a project-
ed $ll billion surplus for this year—an $18.7
billion swing. And Latin America’s modest
export surplus of $2.4 billion in 1983 will
surge to a projected $17.6 billion this year.
What makes the relationship a two-way
street is the willingness of the Japanese pub-
lic to save. Japan’s businesses, private citi-
zens and institutions together save one-
third of the country’s total income, year
after year. That is twice the average savings
rate of America. The individual Japanese
family saves about 20 percent of its in-
come —three times the U.S. average. In the
past, domestic investment plus Japan’s own
budget deficits absorbed nearly all of those
savings. But that began to change in the late
19705, when its industries, having achieved
state-of-the-art technological sophistica-
tion, no longer soaked up as much money.
Japan then began pumping capital overseas.
Like investors in the rest of the world, Japa-
nese investors are attracted to the United
States by high interest rates and confidence
in continued U.S. economic growth. “Capi-
tal is flowing to the United States because of
limited investment opportunities at home,”
says Daiwa’s Zenichi Ishikawa.
The flight of capital has come at the


GM worker being trained in Japan for the GM-Toyota joint venture: A good influence
expense of the Japanese standard of living.
An estimated 4 million families lived in
substandard housing last year. In 1982 only
a third of Japanese homes were connected to
sewers. A study concluded several years ago
that the Japanese lived in “rabbit hutches,”
and that phrase has become the rallying cry
of domestic critics of parsimonious govern-
ment policies, including some members of
the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party.
Why, then, doesn’t Japan spend more
money at home? For one thing, enormous
public-works projects would increase Ja-
pan’s budget deficit, which is already far
higher, in proportion to total government
spending, than Washington’s. In addition,
Japan, poor in natural resources, needs sub-
stantial foreign exchange to pay for raw
materials. There may be psychological fac-
tors at work as well. “Neither the people nor
the government can believe yet that their
rising strength over the last 15 years is real,”
says Robert Angell, former head of the Ja-
pan Economic Institute of America. As a
result, they are extremely reluctant to do
anything that would weaken their
export power.
Jobs: In the presidential debates
Walter Mondale attacked “the
flood of cheap imports” and
claimed that the trade deficit has
cost 3 million American jobs. But
that analysis ignores the jobs being
generated by the breakneck domes-
tic expansion, which has been fund-
ed, in part, by flow of foreign capital
into high-tech and service indus-
tries. In addition, the expansion has
been greatly assisted by lower infla-
tion —and cheap imports have
made a substantial contribution to
keeping price levels down. Al-
though jobs have been lost in some
sectors of the economy, says Jack Albertine
of the American Business Council, during
the recovery “we’ve created 6 million plus
new domestic American jobs.”
Trade dividends aren’t confined to mere
matters of money: Japan is exporting its
way of doing business as well. As Kreicher
and others see it, competing with the Japa-
nese has forced domestic manufacturers to
place increased emphasis on workmanship,
quality control and productivity. Econo-
mist Sam Nakagama believes that the re-
cent contract between General Motors and
the United Auto Workers showed another
salutary effect of pressure from across the
Pacific because it gave “the company wide
latitude to improve efficiency and use out-
side suppliers.”
To the denizens of working-class bars in
the rust belt, though, there is nothing be-
nign about the influence of Japan. Caterpil-
lar Tractor Co., once the unchallenged
world leader of heavy construction equip-
ment, is posting its third straight year of
losses and continues to close plants and lay
Currency traders in Tokyo: Pumping cash across the Pacific
off workers. Competition from Komatsu,
the Japanese equipment maker, is one of the
chief causes. It is not a case of bad manage-
ment. “Caterpillar was the classiest of U.S.
corporations,” says Paul London, a Wash-
ington economic consultant. “If gold shall
rust, then what shall iron do?” Well, steel, at
least, sought governmental protection. Like
the auto industry, it has won some help in
the form of voluntary quotas. y.
There is no question that some Japanese
practices are just plain unfair. The govern-
ment employs a variety of measures to boost
exports, including fiscal controls that,
Washington charges, keep the value of the
yen artificially low, making Japanese ex-
ports cheaper. And Japan has found many
ways to keep big sectors of its domestic
economy, such as telecommunications,
mostly closed to foreigners. The danger is
that a major U.S. industry, facing unfair
competition at home and unable to crack a
key foreign market, could be crippled. Alan
Wolff, a former U.S. trade negotiator sym-
pathetic to Japan, says, “It should matter to
the U.S. whether we have a strong telecom-
munications industry—and we’ve now
gone into trade deficit there in part because
of uncompetitive Japanese practices.”
Ideally, trade relations between Japan
and the United States, lopsided now, will
gradually mellow into a more balanced
give-and-take. “This obsession with invest-
ing in the United States will recede,” says
Hale. In addition to improving living
standards, Japan will soon need to step up
investment in domestic industry. This year
the average age of Japan’s manufacturing
plants and equipment will for the first time
since World War II pass that of the United
States. Yet any change is likely to be grad-
ual. Japanese firms will continue to build
plants in the United States, if only to ex-
ploit a growing market without fanning
protectionist sentiment. “A massive shift
in Japan’s policies is not to be expected
anytime soon,” says Edward Lincoln of
Brookings. As long as the two nations “so
nicely complement each other, the trade
deficit is something to be managed, not
complained about.”
Sugar Daddies: Of course, if the United
States prefers to keep on attracting money
from abroad to live in the high style
of a kept woman, there are other
potential sugar daddies out there.
The Pacific-basin nations are grow-
ing more rapidly than any in the
world, emulating the high-export
policies of the Japanese. Combined
with Japan, they will do more busi-
ness with the United States this year
than Western Europe does. And,
notes Nakagama, they “have a
strong preference for the dollar.” So
even if the marriage with Japan goes
sour, the United States may not be
lonely for long.

MEDICINE
A Baby Gets a Baboon’s Heart
Born Oct. 14 with a lethal heart defect,
the little girl identified only as “Baby
Fae” had just a few days—or, at most,
weeks—to live. Only a heart transplant
could save her life. But heart transplants had
seldom been tried on anyone that young,
and surgeons at California’s Loma Linda
University Medical Center knew they didn’t
have time to wait for a suitable infant donor.
Their answer: an even more exotic trans-
plant. In a dramatic operation last Friday
morning, the doctors implanted the heart of
a one-year-old baboon into the chest of the
12-day-old baby. At the end of the week,
Baby Fae’s skin was glowing pink thanks to
her new heart and she was doing “remark-
ably well,” according to her doctors.
From a primate to little Fae: The surgical team performs the ‘ xenograft ’ at Loma Linda
Baby Fae suffered from “hypoplastic left
heart syndrome,” a congenital defect that
afflicts one in 12,000 newborns. The left
ventricle, or main pumping chamber, had
not fully developed and couldn’t provide
adequate blood flow. But Dr. Leonard Bai-
ley, Loma Linda’s chief pediatric heart sur-
geon, was ready to try the “xenograft”—a
transplant from one species to another. In
the lab, he had already performed 150 such
operations, mostly from lambs into goats.
Match: While awaiting surgery, the baby
was kept alive on a respirator and given the
drug prostaglandin. The drug was to keep
open the ductus arteriosis, a tiny blood ves-
sel that connects the aorta and the pulmo-
nary artery during fetal life, but which nor-
mally closes after birth when a baby is able to
get oxygen from its own lungs. Meanwhile,
Bailey and his colleagues selected five young
baboons and performed standard tissue-
typing tests to find the one that matched
best. Then they whisked the infant into the
operating room and, in a five-hour proce-
dure, removed the primate’s plum-size
heart and placed it in her chest. Aside from
the intricacies of working with such a small
organ and suturing tiny blood vessels, the
surgery was uncomplicated.
Heart transplants between primates and
humans have been tried before —with dis-
mal results. In 1964, in the first human heart
transplant ever, Dr. James Hardy of the
University of Mississippi implanted a
chimp’s heart into a 58-year-old man. The
patient died within hours.
The main threat in any transplant is that
the recipient’s immune system will reject
tissue from an unrelated donor. With tissue
from a donor of another species, the prob-
lem is even more formidable. Bailey and his
team, however, had some reasons for opti-
mism. Better methods of tissue typing have
come along in recent years, and there is now
a more effective drug for staving off rejec-
tion, cyclosporine. Moreover, Bailey be-
lieves that the immaturity of Baby Fae’s
immune system will also make her more
likely to accept the new heart.
If the operation does succeed, it may
herald a new era in transplantations from
animals to humans. That would go a long
way toward solving the acute shortage of
organ donors. But at the end of the week,
Baby Fae’s doctors were happy just to see
her alive. “It was a big step just to get
her out of that operating room and into her
little bed, looking pink and healthy,” said
Dr. Sandra L. Nehlsen-Cannarella. “There
wasn’t a dry eye in the house.”

You’re a business executive so you won’t mind discussing money,
will you?
You see it’s like this. When we opened the Southern Cross in
Sydney we knew we were up against some pretty stiff competition.
So we had to match it.
With spacious rooms, stylishly decorated. With staff who
understand that the sole objective of their working day is to make you
comfortable.
We added a few extras that the other luxury hotels don’t have. Like
a rooftop garden with heated swimming pool and sauna.
Having matched the competition we decided to make a stay at the
Southern Cross an even more attractive business proposition.
By offering you rates that will bring a smile to your accountant’s
face.
They’re below other international hotels and they look better the
more you stay with us.
Sydney’s new Southern Cross. It’s a great business
proposition.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Teaching Robots to Walk: A Complex Task
The seemingly simple act of walk-
ing is actually a complex blend of
balance and coordination. Bugs,
bears and human beings have each
developed their own way of walking,
and for years technicians have stud-
ied these and other gaits in an effort to
create a robot that can walk. Today
robotics firms have produced ma-
chines that can not only walk but
climb. Eventually robots may be han-
dling jobs ranging from sentry duty to
farming.
Walking robots may seem largely
unnecessary; after all, wheeled ro-
bots are already in general use for
security, bomb disposal and other
tasks. But while such machines trav-
el quickly over flat surfaces, they
cannot move across extremely rocky
terrain, manage staircases or make
their way through cluttered manu-
facturing plants.
A successful walking robot must be
able constantly to shift its weight
from one leg to another without top-
pling over. People do this by using
complicated nerve and muscle net-
works to maintain their balance while in
motion. Beetles, by contrast, avoid the
balance problem on flat terrain by always
having at least three legs on the ground.
This “alternating tripod” gait is perhaps
less graceful but is simple and depend-
able. Technicians have generally used
this gait in designing walking robots.
Have Six Legs, Will Travel
Odetics, Inc., of Anaheim, Calif., is
working on a six-legged, tripod-gaited
robot with surprising strength and agil-
ity. When controlled from a command
panel, the cylindrical Odex II can squat
so that it is only three feet high, or stand
on “tiptoe” to stretch above six feet. The
robot can amble at a pace of 2 mph and
can lift nearly 2,100 pounds, about six
times its own weight. The Odex II has
seven on-board computers —one to con-
trol each leg and a central processor to
coordinate movement. Sophisticated
software enables the robot to climb stairs
' or maneuver through congested areas
without detailed instructions from an
operator. Cameras mounted atop the ro-
bot enable an operator to see whatever
the Odex II is headed toward.
Odetics expects a walking robot to be
available in about three years. The firm
Improving the Odex: Surprisingly agile
has at least six contracts with govern-
ment agencies and private firms to devel-
op versions of the Odex II that can do
anything from harvest citrus fruits to
fight fires aboard aircraft carriers. A
price for the robot has not been fixed.
Komatsu Ltd. of Tokyo has devel-
oped what is possibly the world’s largest
walking robot, a 72-ton behemoth de-
signed to build sea walls and artificial
islands. The robot, which measures 56
feet by 33 feet, uses eight legs to make its
way through water up to a depth of 90
feet. The machine creates a slow but very
steady gait by anchoring itself on four
legs at a time and moving the other four
legs forward. The machine uses a huge
rake to gather rubble. Construction
workers successfully used the robot in a
trial project last year, according to Ko-
matsu officials. Such multilegged mon-
sters may be pressed into service later in
the decade to construct an artificial is-
land for an airport to be built off Osaka.
Climbing Ladders
Toshiba Corp., also of Tokyo, has in-
troduced a robot designed to climb lad-
ders. The 3-foot 4-inch-long LCR-1
looks more like a bed frame than a robot,
but it can carry a 15-pound load up a
ladder at a pace of 13 feet a minute.
After a worker mounts the 70-pound
robot on a ladder, the LCR-1 uses
photoelectric eyes to locate each rung.
It then uses small electric motors to
position one of four grippers around
the rung and shuts the clamp with a
shot of compressed air. Workers can
use the LCR-1 to shuttle equipment in
nuclear power plants and other dan-
gerous work environments. Toshiba
has not yet set a price for the LCR-1.
Is Running Next?
Even as these robots are being
pushed toward the marketplace, re-
searchers are working on creating an
even more sophisticated walking ro-
bot. Such a machine would be able to
maintain its balance even after break-
ing into a run and would need little or
no input from a person in order to do
its job. Scientists at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, Pa., are ex-
perimenting with laser-ranging and
other vision systems that would be
essential in a robot that could, say,
pick a safe path between tree stumps.
Marc Raibert of Carnegie-Mellon is
focusing on the problems of balance.
While a person is running, there are regu-
lar intervals during which both feet are
olf the ground. To study this gait,
Raibert has built two one-legged hopping
machines that look like space-age pogo
sticks. The first is tethered so that it
cannot tip to the left or right. As the air-
driven machine hops, a computer re-
ceives data from angle sensors. The com-
puter then decides if the machine is losing
its balance; if it is, the computer shifts the
angle of the leg until the machine has
righted itself. Raibert’s newer machine is
still more sophisticated and can hop free-
ly around a room.
By studying balance in this way,
Raibert hopes eventually to design
robots with fewer than six legs that can
run. Indeed, he has already built a four-
legged machine that has briefly scam-
pered across his laboratory floor. Even if
this research results in an autonomous
robot with a graceful stride, some experts
say that walking robots still may have a
hard time commercially—because peo-
ple will find such humanlike machines
too unsettling to buy.

New Toyota Camry
better than most Euro
After pushing new Toyota Camry through a course
of witches hats, one thing will be obvious.
It handles like you're driving something sophis-
ticated and expensive from Europe.
All you need do is take a look underneath Camry
and you'll discover why.
You see, the new Camry has gas pressure shock
absorbers at the front and fully independent suspension.
With the control of rack and pinion steering and
front wheel drive.
ALL VERY ADVANCED. ALL VERY SPORTY.
And better than a lot of other cars with similar
features. That's because Camry's advanced features are
specially tuned to work together in complete harmony.
The result is new Camry now handles even better
than the previous model that won Car of 'B3.
So even though Camry is a family car, you could be
excused for actually enjoying a winding mountain road.
You could even be excused for
enjoying Camry on the open road.
After all - you do have a Super
Responsive 2 litre engine with elec-
tronic fuel injection under your right foot.
SOMETHING THIS MUCH FUN
IS PRACTICAL TOO.
So you've had your fun and you start to pack up your
witches hats.
And before long anotherthing will become obvious.
SUPER RESPONSIVE

Camry's space and luggage capacity is totally unlike
most European family sports.
With a big hatchback and split folding rear seats,
Camry's capacity for a family and their luggage is enor-
mous. And anything that enormous is just the right size
for a family.
NEW CAMRY IS A CAR THAT CAN WEAR
MANY HATS.
Camry now has more luxury appointments.
There's a new tilt steering column for a more
comfortable driving position.
Further improvements have been made in-
side with a redesigned dash and seats with new cloth
upholstery.
The result is a more plush interior with more comfort
for driver and passenger alike.
Camry will hold the road as well as most European
family sports. Then hold your family with a lot more ease.
So Camry further builds on its unique reputation.
The perfect combination of European luxury, inno-
vation and finesse with the practicality of a Japanese car.
So if you have a family and you still love to drive, new
Camry has been built for you.

FEDERAL Opposition en-
vironment spokesman David
Connolly is going public this
week with a statement de-
signed to reassure environ-
mentalists that the coalition
regards the Franklin dam
issue as settled.
Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock, during a campaign
visit to Tasmania, condemned
the government for using an
external alfairs constitutional
power to stop the dam being
built. Peacock said he re-
garded it as no longer a main-
land issue and that a coalition
government would not stop
construction.
A concerned Connolly was
waiting for Peacock when he
got back to Canberra. Con-
nolly’s statement will say that
the coalition parties are com-
mitted to maximum protec-
tion for both the Great Barrier
Reef and Tasmania’s south-
west wilderness areas and that
the issue is settled.
The Franklin was a vital
factor in the crushing defeat
of the Fraser government last
year, costing the Liberal/
National coalition between
five and 12 seats - depending
on whose estimates one pre-
fers. Connolly, whose elector-
ate of Bradfield is one of Aus-
tralia’s safest, calculates that it
cut his majority 1 percent.

COUNTRY-Liberal Party
candidate for the Northern
Territory, Paul Everingham
plans to knock on 10,000
doors before the federal poll
on December 1.
Everingham, formerly
Chief Minister of the Terri-
tory, had a rating in the
opinion polls of 82 percent
when he called an early NT
election last year.
Territory electorates are so
small, at about 3000 people,
that the voters expect their
candidates to come calling.
Jogger Everingham, the
north’s fastest door-to-door
politician, is using the seven-
week general election cam-
paign to see how far he can
get in an electorate which
comprises the whole Terri-
tory.
Everingham and the sitting
Australian Labor Party mem-
ber John Reeves once were
partners in a Darwin law firm.

Classified
information

NZ, October 7
ARE governments in Aust-
ralia shuffling advertising
business away from certain
newspapers as a means of
showing displeasure with the
attitude of the newspaper
or newspapers in question?
It happens abroad very
frequently but only recently
did the possibility surface in
Australia when the New
South Wales government
advised the Fairfax organisa-
tion that classified ads would
no longer be placed with The
Sydney Morning Herald.
Challenged, the govern-
ment vigorously denied that
the change had any relation to
the Herald’s criticism of the
Wran government. The deci-
sion was purely a commercial
one, said a spokesman.
The Press Council took a
serious view of the situation
and requested full informa-
tion from the Premier about
the decision. The government
failed to justify its decision in
sufficient detail to satisfy the
council, which labelled the
situation “thoroughly unsatis-
factory.”
Hot on the heels of the
NSW case comes a similar
move in Queensland where
ads are to be moved from the
Courier-Mail stable to the
fledgling Murdoch papers.
The Press Council is seeking
further information from
Queensland and, in view of
rumblings from Canberra,
will also examine control
of government advertising
throughout Australia.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
SHOW a beginner a position in a
game and ask who is ahead; he is
likely to answer “White” or
“Black”. An expert would query:
“Whose roll is it?”
The difference in the balance
of the game comes down to which
player is to roll in most mid-game
situations; the margins are that
fine, the balance that delicate. You
must be aware of this to match an
expert in use of the cube.
Offered the cube, the beginner
must train himself or herself to
think not of who is ahead but of
what might be the relative
positions after rolling.
Consider the illustration: each
player has one man in the op-
ponent’s home board and each has
captured four home board points.
The game might appear to be
rather even until, that is, we are
told that White is to roll.
Suppose White doubled and
Black accepted, whereupon White
promptly rolled a 3-2 and secured
the 4 point to place Black on the
bar with only the 1 point open for
re-entry. “Ah,” you might say,
“but White was lucky to close with
a 3-2.” Was he? Let’s see. White
can capture his 4 point with rolls
2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 6-1, 3-2, 4-2, 6-2, 4-3,
6-3, 6-4, 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 6-6 - 24 rolls
in all, making him a 2:1 on favor-
ite to do so . . . hardly “lucky.”
When your opponent rolls,
“blots” are liabilities they can
be hit and sent back. On your roll,
those blots become “builders” or
assets just as they are on White’s
7 and 8 points in the illustration.
When being “cubed”, think
ahead!
BRIDGE
by B.Jay Becker
YOU ARE South, both sides vul-
nerable. The bidding has been:
West North East South
1 Dble Pass ?
What would you bid now, with
each of the following five hands?
1. 4 AJ7642 5?853 0K75 *9
2.4943 <?KJ2 OJBS 4KJ96
3.4Q82 J 8754 073 4 653
4.4AJ7 <?QJB6 0 842 4K94
5.4Q654 <?7 OKQBS 4AQ32
1. Two spades. The most
common way of identifying pro-
mising values when your partner
doubles for take-out is by a jump
response. It would be wrong to
respond one spade with this hand
and also respond one spade with,
say:
4J642 <?8532 OQ7 4 872
Your partner is not a mind-
reader and would have no way of
knowing which hand you held if
you responded one spade with
each of them.
You have about six winners
with spades as trumps and you
should identify your game-going
prospects with a jump response.
Some players would jump directly
to four spades, which also is ac-
ceptable.
2. One no-trump. Here you
have more high-card points but
less chance for game. It is better to
respond one no-trump, which
ordinarily shows 7 to 9 points,
than to respond two clubs which
theoretically could be based on a
worthless hand.
3. One spade. This is an
unpleasant situation, no doubt,
but you are not responsible for
having been dealt a poor hand
and you must make the best of it.
To pass would be dead wrong;
equally wrong to bid one no-
trump for the reasons pre-
viously given. You are not ex-
pected to enjoy bidding a three-
card suit but it is the best bid
available.
4. Two no-trumps. This is by far
the best action to take with 11
high-card points, Hearts doubly
stopped, and no-trump distribu-
tion. Change the two of diamonds
to the queen, and you would
respond three no-trump.
5. Two hearts. This is obviously
a game-going hand as you have an
opening bid of your own facing a
partner who has indicated
opening bid strength by his
double. But, under the circum-
stances, it is better not to make a
jump-shift response in one of your
three suits because you have no
way of knowing which suit will
work out best.
Instead of trying to guess
partner’s best suit, you respond
with a cue bid and thus force
North to reveal his longest suit.
You plan to raise partner directly
to game in the suit of his choice.
