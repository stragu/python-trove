THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Packer and Costigan
Congratulations on your succinct, hard-
hitting defence of Kerry Packer in The
Bulletin (October 9).
As a former Packer employee (in Sir
Frank’s day), I resent the manner in
which Frank C.ostigan has been able to
victimise a big Australian.
Like Senator McCarthy, Costigan’s
inordinate power was spawned out of
government fear and buck-passing by
succeeding governments! The Hawke
government would have served the na-
tional interest if it had replaced this
long-running royal commission months
ago with its proposed National Crime
Authority.
Despite his obvious anger and frus-
tration at being a victim of Costigan’s
Ludlum mentality, Kerry Packer might
like to know that there a great many
people like me who are on his side.

Processes of law
I refer to Editor-in-Chief Trevor
Kennedy’s article “Packer and the new
McCarthyism a Bill of Rights is
needed” (B, October 9). While I admire
The Bulletin for its incisive political re-
porting, I did not think the article in
question presented a sophisticated
analysis of the present problems that be-
set the judiciary and the processes of
law in this country.
The article, it seemed to me, was
more a statement of support and soli-
darity from Australian Consolidated
Press for their chief Kerry Packer than
an objective and rational discussion of
the advantages or disadvantages of a
Bill of Rights.

Injustice run amok
It takes a prominent person’s dilemma
to obtain publicity at last about the
ability of administrative tribunals and
royal commissions to evade natural jus-
tice which, therefore, is merely a system
of injustice.
I am a GP practicing in the isolated
town of Hopetoun in Victoria. I have
been, without any trial at all, found
guilty of “overservicing” by a commit-
tee of enquiry. Following this travesty, I
first turned to the legal profession for
help (unaffordable), then I made a sub-
mission to a special parliamentary com-
mittee on this subject (ignored). Then to
the Law Reform Commission (power-
less), to the media in a Four Corners pro-
“ I’m just calculating how much it’s costing you to sit reading a book. ”

Toyota 4 Runner. Run smooth

There is now a 4WD that you the realist
can feel comfortable with, and you the escapist
can go nuts about.
It's not a weekender, it's a 7-days-a-week
vehicle, built to run smooth in the City, wild in
the bush.
The new Toyota 4 Runner is all new. Inside,
you'll find it's sedan comfort, with good space
for five adults, front reclining seats, excellent
stereo, power rear window and power steering.
The only clues as to what you do on week-
ends are the two gear-sticks and the dashboard
altimeter and clinometer that read-off your height

and angle of climb. 4 Runner has
the Toyota HiLux pedigree of a
true 4WD, with a Toyota Super
Responsive Engine - petrol or
diesel. And the whole back
canopy is detachable,fora heightened
sense of freedom.
So if you set off to the milk bar and end up
at Marble Bar, it isn't because you're lost.
It's because you've found the only vehicle
that truly leaves the options up to you.
The 4 Runner won't let you down in public,
and won't quit on you in the bush.

4 Runner's price will be of

gram (no results as yet) and finally to
the ombudsman (proceeding).
Yet, this very structural system of in-
justice built into such a system of trial
by agency (the Star Chamber was refer-
red to by Kerry Packer but I think better
compared with Franz Kafka’s Trial
court) has been allowed to grow, not un-
like runaway inflation, an arch example
of unchecked power, run amok. The
threat to individual freedom and justice
is escalating. Where are the courts and
where are the politicians, whose consti-
tutional duty is supposed to be to pro-
tect us from this very real threat? Or are
we merely being prepared for the
Orwellian 1984?

Robinvale reaction
Although the article “Robinvale: A
town of mozzies, grass, Italians and
Widows” was in your publication some
time ago (B, May 29), I would still like
to have the opportunity to make com-
ments. The article puts forward an im-
age of the Robinvale Italian community
that is both inaccurate and highly
offensive. The Victorian Ethnic Affairs
Commission is concerned about the po-
tential damage that can be caused to
good community relations by such mis-
leading impressions.
The article deals with illegal mari-
juana growing in Robinvale and the
conviction and early release of three
men who happen to be of Italian de-
scent. The commission is disturbed that
the article then moves on to imply that
the whole of the Italian community is
somehow involved in these illegal ac-
tivities. In so doing, the article pro-
nounces a very prejudiced judgment on
that community.
The headline, for example, links in a
not too subtle way “grass” and “Ital-
ians” and the article goes on to say that
“the big talk now is that there will be a
murder a la Griffith. There is a feeling
that something big is about to happen.”
The implication seems to be that the
Italian community as a whole is im-
plicated in criminal activity and in this
context the attempt to link “grass” “Ital-
ians” and “widows” is emotive, irres-
ponsible and simply not true. In con-
trast to such sinister implications is the
projected innocence of the Anglo-
Australians. The officer-in-charge of
Robinvale police station is described as
being “affable and amusingly pragmatic
in a stolid Australian country fashion.”
The commission is concerned that
cultural stereotypes such as these only
serve to encourage a “them and us”
divisiveness in the community and are
not good for the development of Aus-
tralia.
Bob Egan, administrator of the Mur-
ray Valley Aboriginal co-operative, is


reported in the article as saying that the
number of nationalities in Robinvale
made for a more tolerant town. It is the
commission’s view that The Bulletin has
a responsibility to the community to en-
sure that it does not place this tolerance
at risk by, in this case, misrepresenting
the character of the whole Robinvale
Italian community.
I would like to repeat that unthink-
ing and irresponsible stereotyping of
ethnic communities can only damage
community relations in this country.
GARY J. SHEPPARD
Chairman, Victorian
Ethnic Affairs Commission
The Bulletin did not intend the article to
be an attack on the whole Italian popula-
tion of Robinvale and we do not believe it
was. Ed.
The power of faith
I refer to your issue dated October 9 and
the cartoons on pages 14 and 21. Icono-
clasm I can hack, satire I enjoy but un-
informed smut and childish bad taste I
find quite debasing of your publication
and demeaning of the intellects of your
readers.
Had Goliath been struck in the tes-
ticles by David’s stone, he would have
had David’s head on his spear well be-
fore David could reload his sling! As
well as helmet and breastplate,
Philistine soldiers also wore a bronze-
and-leather pubic protector as they were
doubtless as aware as your cartoonist of
the debilitating effect of a blow to that
region.
As for the second cartoon, parodying
the raising of Lazarus: (1) Lazarus was
entombed in stone hollow in a cliff. (2)
Jesus’ halo is surely a little premature.
(3) If Jesus wished, even the (anachron-
istic) toaster would be well within his
powers. To say that Jesus “doesn’t ‘do’ ”
anything is limiting the übiquity of the
miraculous powers of God which is,
in effect, a slur upon the faith which
every Christian upholds.
You may feel free to insult politi-
cians, you may feel it proper to ridicule
captains of industry and commerce,
even the royal family. But please do not
be foolish as to think that the power of
the pen holds any sway over the
Christian Faith.

Party allegiances
Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Bowen’s
call to Catholics to join the Labor Party
should be seen as it is, a call to immoral-
ity and a rejection of the Ten Com-
mandments which is the foundation of
all Christian principles.
Bowen claims to be a practising
Catholic. I don’t know what he is prac-
tising but it certainly is not Christianity.

The problem with most desktop computers
is simply that.
They're desk bound.
And the trouble with most transportable
computers is, apart from being under-powered,
they look more at home in the boot of your car
than on your desk.
Now fortunately, a computer has been
designed to fit neatly between the two.
The Apricot.
In a nutshell, it’s a 16-bit desktop computer
that folds into a briefcase.
So it can take home work when you do.
While at the office, it competes on equal
footing with the desktop heavies.
Unbelievably, it's more powerful than the
equivalent IBM PC.
It also incorporates a few practical advances
in computer technology that no other desktop has
caught up with.
For example, a Microscreen on the keyboard
which operates as a calculator, digital calendar,
time display and as a window on the mam screen.
What's more, the Apricot comes ready to go.
From $4444 with sales tax and $ 1000 worth of software included in the price. And the software includes Supercalc,


erf ul desk top computers can do.
■ is mil
And one thing they can t.
It already has its own business software.
(In fact, over $lOOO worth of it is included
in the purchase price*)
But as well as that, the Apricot is readily
compatible with the computers that boast the
most software in the business, the Sinus and
the IBM PC.
So there you have it.
A computer that does anything any other
desktop computer can do.
And you don’t have to hire a removal van
to take it home.

The Apricot is brought to Australia by Barson
Computers, Australia’s leading independent
computer company.

Seeking a sponsor
Having listened to and read of the “im-
migration debate” over the past few
months, I find it impossible to refrain
from comment any longer.
The position in my case is that for
over 14 months I (and my family) have
been unsuccessfully trying to sponsor
my brother in Scotland under the family
reunion and sponsorship scheme so that
he can be with the rest of us in Australia.
As well as myself, I have three
brothers, sister and mother all residing
here for a period of three to 20 years
and the only other member of the family
cannot be allowed to emigrate because
we cannot persuade any employer to
complete the compulsory form entitled
“Confirmation of Offer of Employ-
ment” by which an employer guarantees
the prospective emigrant stable employ-
ment for a period of time after arrival.
Despite a letter from my employer
offering an interview on arrival and let-
ters appealing to the Immigration Min-
ister, Mr West, this uncompleted form
remains the obstacle preventing any fur-
ther progress.
I feel it is unreasonable and mislead-
ing to suggest there exists a family re-
union or sponsorship scheme available
when a member of that family, acting as
sponsor, is required to grovel to an em-
ployer and ask him to sign a stat. dec.
type form offering employment to a per-
son 13,000 miles away, of whom he has
no knowledge whatsoever and has
never even met. Surely, these days, a
face-to-face job interview is one of the
few remaining “luxuries” an employer
has the right to maintain!
Although disheartened, I’ll continue
to ask around for an offer of work for
my brother, but when refused, I cannot
force myself to be bitter or upset at the
employer in my opinion the fault lies
elsewhere.

Daintree disaster
I am somewhat concerned about your
recent article on the Daintree rainforest
area.
The CSIRO are not the only people
carrying out research on rainforests.
Much work is being carried out by re-
searchers at James Cook University in
Townsville. Indeed, during Mr Cohen’s
recent visit to Townsville, he publicly
stated that his department would be
funding a study by researchers at JCU
into the Daintree area and the impact of
the road on it.
I have inspected the road at close
range and can only describe it as an
abomination. The gap it has opened in
the canopy is in many places over 50
metres wide. That can not be described
as narrow in any terms. The area
through which it runs is subject to an
average annual rainfall of over three
metres. The majority of this falls in the
summer wet season. With steep em-
bankments up to 25 metres high ex-
posing soft friable soil to the elements,
the scene is set for disastrous erosion
problems. The expense of maintaining
the road will be prohibitive. At the most
it will be usable for eight to nine months
of the year.
Other more economically and en-
vironmentally preferable routes do exist
for the road. Their only drawback was
that they didn’t pass through areas that
have been bought, subdivided and are
now being sold by a small number of
politically influential real estate agents.
The people of Queensland have been
landed with an economic and environ-
mental disaster. An elite group gets to
make some money and we have to pay.

De-sexing the language
What has happened to common sense?
Have we come to the outer limits of san-
ity? I cannot believe that a parliament
in Canberra has taken it upon itself to
prohibit the use of age-old English
words in common usage in an attempt
to de-genderise certain terms.
How far can an act of parliament
protrude into a person’s life before it
becomes obtrusive? To dictate to the
public that certain words of one’s lan-
guage are no longer acceptable is ab-
surd. It can be likened to “fixing” prices
in the free-market economy. Such a
market would cease to exist because it
would no longer be free. The same
applies to one’s language; it is a “free-
moving,” living thing which is so imper-
ceptibly revised and transformed by the
processes of time and social dialogue
and not by the dictates of a whimsical
government.
Are there any MEN among the men
in the legislature or are they a bunch of
hired wimps who will go to any lengths
to appease the vociferous appetites of
our much-loved feminist “freedom
fighters”? I have had a gutful of their
catchcries, protests and whingeing.
What amazes me is how the majority
of Australians allow a minority group to
dictate the terms of their future life. I
have always used the words “fisher-
man,” “milkman,” “seaman” ... and I
will always continue to do so. Obvious-
ly, if I a man work on a boat out at
sea, I am a seaman; that’s just common
sense. If a woman also works offshore,
by all means find a word which befits
her disposition but please don’t take
from me what is (and always has been)
mine and depersonalise it.
It is ironic how, in substituting the
word “. . . person” for the word
“. . . man,” we have depersonalised
people. If I work at sea, I am something
more than a seaperson I am a seaman.
And a woman who works at sea is some

Forget those long, hot summers when
mowing was just hard slog.
A Victa ride-on can put a little bit of
Bathurst into your backyard.
But please don’t get us wrong.
Although every one of our ride-ons is
fun to drive, each is also designed to give
your lawn a great finish.
Without skidding on corners as is so
common with our cousin, the racing car.
You see, the newest Victa ride-ons
boast transaxle drive.
A remarkable feature which allows
each rear wheel to turn independently,
much like the differential in your own car.
The result?
No more scuff marks on turns.
And since we realise that different
folks require different strokes, you can
now choose a Victa ride-on to best suit
your particular size of lawn.

thing more than a seaperson; she is a

If these feminists feel inferior, that’s
their problem. All too often they push
for changes which will give them a
handicap start on “the opposition,” be-
cause they are so aware of their own
adequacies and therefore feel the need
to be “subsidised” across the board by
statutory provisions.
Next thing, they will push to have the
entire population desexed with the ex-
ception of a chosen few who will propa-
gate the species because it just shouldn’t
happen that a man is a man and a
woman a woman since such a situation
highlights obvious differences and is
therefore discriminatory.

Looking to the right
It’s good that the New Right (B,
October 2) is emerging because the Old
Right didn’t do much last time at “the
crease” except promise a lot of simi-
lar institutional reform which it never
delivered.
But, somehow, I can’t see govern-
ment by the New-Old Right being any
different next time(?). When it comes to
implementing anything of substance,
I’m reminded of the words of Winston
Churchill who said that Attlee was like a
“sheep in sheep’s clothing” when it
came to forcing the issues.
Students of history might dispute the
analogy with Attlee, a lefty prime minis-
ter, but I still don’t see the ranks of our
present conservatives swollen with in-
tellectual giants able also to inject their
followers with the sort of dynamism and
crusading spirit which might spread
over the country and return them to the
Treasury benches.
Their “leaders” are, of course, still
well-dressed and of good stock but so
was Malcolm and next year Andrew can
join them in the back paddocks.
Until the right (Old or New) is able
to forge a credible alternative platform
which isn’t just a set of painful shibbol-
eths, of “free enterprise,” “smaller gov-
ernment,” etc, etc - then the existence
of a strong “conservative philosophy”
will remain illusory.
Meanwhile, the next “conservative”
PM will probably be Paul Keating —
when the current “conservative” PM
steps down, in about 10 years.

Call to conservatism
Nothing could have been more timely
than your cover story under the head-
line “New Right crusaders challenge the
Labor line.”
The subject was researched by Tim
Duncan with painstaking accuracy and
is presented with objectivity and with
unmistakable clarity, filling a long-felt
want. Hundreds of thousands of Austra-
lians must have rejoiced with me in
reading the article.
Although the first word of the open-
ing sentence is “Conservatism,”
throughout the article preference is
given to “liberal right.” That really is a
pity. It is unlikely that any movement
with the adjective “right” on its banner
will ever become electorally popular in
Australia.
Furthermore, it only appears to fac-
tionalise a party. “Liberal left” and “lib-
eral centre-left” don’t sound any better
than their counterparts in the Labor
party. Then there is the small 1 liberal.
And what is a large L liberal or Liberal?
Then there is a “Liberal wet.” We seem
to be playing with a word that means so
many different things to so many people
that it is in danger of becoming mean-
ingless. However, a good word is
waiting in the wings to be called into
action. Conservatism is a concept of the
utmost simplicity and clarity. Conserva-
tism is based on a philosophy which
probably approximates most closely our
desires for ourselves and our children.
Alas, it is little known.
That’s why it is so important and
possibly urgent to the same degree that
all the anti-Marxist talent described in
your article find a common, conserva-
tive base from which their research ac-
tivities can be extended to include the
political scene. Can you imagine what a
“Well, that’s enough about world domination; now I’d like to talk to you about double glazing.”


strong, Conservative third party would
do for our democracy?
And it is of no use saying that they
are not quite ready to take such a step.
The country is crying out for them and
they will never be better prepared.

Harries replies
I enjoyed John Edwards’ “profile” of
me. But just to keep my hand in as a
“polemicist of international standard,”
I would like to make a few points.
First, I note that, in several hundred
words, Edwards did not find room to
make any mention of the 376-page re-
port Australia And The Third World,
which I produced for the Fraser govern-
ment. This (also known as the Harries
Report) was widely praised, by people
with more obvious foreign policy quali-
fications than Edwards, for the quality
of its analysis and policy prescriptions.
Referring to it would clearly have
damaged his thesis that I am a “poor
analyst,” and cast doubt on his view
that the advice I offered made little
difference to policy. So its omission is, I
suppose, understandable.
Second, I’m afraid Edwards has
completely misunderstood my article on
Menzies. Its concern was not to estab-
lish that Menzies was not a “realist,”
but, more interestingly I believe, to il-
luminate some of the ambiguities and
paradoxes of one kind of realism in
some circumstances.
Third, as I remember our lunch con-
versations (over some very good wine,
courtesy of The Bulletin) it was not
merely I who became “heated” about
the Soviet Union but both of us, with
Edwards maintaining with some vehe-
mence that there were no important
moral distinctions to be drawn between
it and the United States. The heat I dis-
played largely generated in re-
sponse to this interestingly open-
minded view.
OWEN HARRIES
John M. Olin Fellow

John Edwards replies: I have no recol-
lection at all of telling Mr Harries that I
thought there were no important moral
distinctions to be drawn between the
United States and the Soviet Union. I
think there are such differences, and I
prefer the US side.
Aquino concern
Concerning the story, “Aquino
Finding” (The Week’s Action, B,
October 2), may I say that more than
anyone else the Filipino people are anx-
ious to know the findings of the Agrava
commission on the assassination of
Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. Until the

In the midst of Asia’s largest city, and a business
environment which appears to be in perpetual motion,
Hilton has created a tranquil oasis.
In Shinjuku centre a skyscraper city within a
city is a new hotel of quiet distinction. Within its
38-storeys are 858 guest rooms and suites, four
restaurants and three cocktail bars.
A business centre provides a comprehensive array of
services to keep you prepared, informed and in touch.
The top three executive floors feature separate
check-in, bar lounge, snack service and concierge.
Fitness facilities include sauna, gymnasium, indoor
swimming pool and tennis court.
All this and more you’ll find in the new Tokyo Hilton
International. But, above all, you’ll find tranquility,
and an experience that is, in every way, something
more than first class.

American alliance
In reply to James Moore (B, October 2)
one wonders whether the sophistry con-
tained in his letter is by intent or
through ignorance.
It most certainly is no myth that Am-
erica saved Australia in World War 11. I
well remember Churchill rebuking John
Curtin for enlisting American aid
after he had told us Britain had too
many commitments to help us. This is
amply borne out by the recent release of
secret documents concerning World
War 11. These revealed that Churchill
was prepared to let Japan take Australia
until after he had defeated the Axis
powers.
It was not so much the loss of Ameri-
can lives but the enormous amount of
arms and equipment which helped our
troops which we would never have ob-
tained from Britain.
Many crackpot pacifists would be
silent under Soviet domination. I have
always been against all forms of warfare
in any country.
SYD RICHARDSON
Burnie Tas
A balanced view
It was refreshing to see an article on
immigration (B, October 9) that sought
the reality of the acceptance of peoples
from our neighboring lands into Austra-
lia, rather than the cheap sensationalis-
ing witnessed in other publications that
only pursued negative occurrences and
gave undeserved publicity to extremist
fringe organisations such as National
Action.
I have had the pleasure of knowing
many Asian friends, mostly through col-
lege, who have greatly enriched my life.
As your article portrays, it is ignorance
and nonsensical rumors that cause the
small amount of discontent in society. If
Australia had only one racial group or
culture, it would be a dull place indeed.
In total contrast to the increasingly
outrageous claims of Professor Blainey,
the Vietnamese and others have blended
into our society quicker than most mi-
grants before them. Your article dis-
played the proof of this.
It was interesting to note that
Blainey declined to see this for himself
in Springvale and preferred to foist his
views on us from his ivory towers.
I hope these “academic experts” read
your article, as it dispelled most myths
they have been promoting.

The car above is the latest
Jaguar.
In our opinion, this Jaguar is
the best Jaguar ever made.
And also represents the best
value ever offered in luxury cars.
With due regard to the
memorable Jaguars of the past,
these are not statements we make
lightly.
Life with a new Jaguar begins
at around $48,450*.
To put this price into
perspective, try to think of any
other automobile which offers
Jaguar’s level of luxury,
refinement and equipment and
doesn’t cost at least ten thousand
dollars more.
You can delete the Mercedes
280 SE which, in our opinion, is
the nearest comparable
Mercedes.
That comes in at around
$61,525**.
You can also disregard the
BMW 735 i at around $59,500**.
In fact, whatever you look at,
you’ll still find the Jaguar XJ6 is
streets ahead.
The question is, how is it
possible for the best to be made
for less?
Involvement builds better cars,
more efficiently.
Three years ago, when John
Egan took over as Chairman and
Chief Executive of Jaguar cars,
the automobile industry thought
that technology was the sole
solution to all its problems.
John Egan disagreed.
“The best, most sophisticated
machines in the world will not
make memorable cars,” he argued,
“ if the men who operate them do
not have pride in what they do.”
Then, while Jaguar invested
millions in re-tooling, John Egan
began asking the people who
actually build the cars for their
thoughts on ways of making
better Jaguars.
His office was flooded with
ideas and proposals, many of
which were acted upon
immediately.
Ever since then, once a month
the staff meet with management
and continue to find better ways
of doing things.
The result, again, is best
summed up by John Egan himself.
“Productivity has doubled with
no increase - in fact a decrease -
in workforce.”
“Naturally, the
unit cost is less.”
The best Jaguar ever
made gives you the best
of everything.
While the Jaguar
XJ6 embodies
excellence of con-
struction and superb
value, its traditional
virtues should not
be overlooked
It gives you a
unique combination
of looks, perform-
ance, comfort and
peace-of-mind that
is not equalled by
other cars.
It is the only
current model to be included
among the ten most beautiful cars
of all time in a survey conducted
by “Car and Driver” magazine.
It is also considered to have
the best ride in the world.
And, in Mastercare, the best
warranty and maintenance
programme.
The Jaguar XJ6 carries a
warranty valid for two years or
40,000 km, whichever comes first.
Furthermore, Jaguar
undertakes to pay the labour and
genuine Jaguar replacement part
costs of regular maintenance as
set out in the owner’s handbook
for three years or 40,000 km.
whichever comes first.
Whether you buy a Jaguar at
$48,450,* or opt for the more luxu-
rious Jaguar Sovereign ,Vanden
Plas, or XJS-HE, the value for
money is no less apparent.
Call your nearest Jaguar
Rover dealer and arrange to test
drive the best Jaguar ever made.
It could be the best decision
you ever made.

AUSTRALIA
December 1 elections
AUSTRALIANS will go to
the polls on Saturday,
December 1, to vote for a new
House of Representatives and
for half the Senate. At the
same time they will also vote
on two referendums to change
the constitution: to provide
for simultaneous elections for
the House and the Senate and
to facilitate the exchange of
powers between the common-
wealth and the states. Accord-
ing to the office of the Special
Minister of State, Mick
Young, the elections and the
referendums will cost about
$32.7 million. Public opinion
polls predict a large Labor
victory.
Bowen apologises
DEPUTY Prime Minister
Lionel Bowen apologised in
parliament to the Senate Sel-
ect Committee inquiring
into allegations against High
Court judge Lionel Murphy
for calling it a “farce” and “a
travesty of justice.”
Hawke hit
PRIME Minister Bob Hawke
missed serious injury to his
right eye when a ball shattered
his spectacles during a social
game of cricket against the
Canberra press gallery.
Hawke’s team won by six
runs.
Employment up
ACCORDING to the Austra-
lian Bureau of Statistics labor
force figures for September,
employment rose by 27,000
in seasonally-adjusted terms
during the month, compared
with a fall of 22,900 in August.
Unemployment in the same
period fell by 6200 down
0.1 percent to 8.8 percent.
Defence report
AUSTRALIA’S defence
forces may not be able to meet
even low-level threats, accord-
ing to the report tabled in
Canberra by the parliamen-
tary joint committee on for-
eign affairs and defence. The
report also says it would be
foolish not to maintain a de-
fence force or unilaterally to
disarm, that a war between the
US and the Soviet Union
would be the most dangerous
threat to our national security
and that we should remain in
ANZUS without relying on
American military support.
Birds destroyed
BETWEEN 1000 and 1500 il-
legally imported birds, mainly
racing pigeons potential
carriers of fowl pest and New-
castle disease were seized
and destroyed by officers of
the Australian Quarantine
Service in NSW, South Aus-
tralia and Victoria.
Helicopter decision
THE federal government has
decided to equip the navy’s
frigates with American-made
Sikorsky Seahawk S 708 heli-
copters. The eight aircraft to
be bought will cost a total of
$360 million about $lOO
million more than the oppo-
sing tender for the British
Westland Navy Lynx 3. But,
argued Defence minister Gor-
don Scholes, the costlier
choice has been made be-
cause, “in buying defence
equipment, you waste money
if you do not buy the equip-
ment that is necessary.”
THE WORLD
Bomb terror
THE IRA has claimed re-
sponsibility for the bomb ex-
plosion at the Grand Hotel in
Brighton, England, which
killed four people and injured
more than 30. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, staying
there for the Conservative
Party convention, escaped un-
harmed.
VP debate
US Vice-President George
Bush and Geraldine Ferraro,
Democrat contender for that
position at this year’s elec-
tions, fought a spirited debate
on television. Most observers
gave Bush a narrow points
verdict.
ME peace overtures
A FORTNIGHT after Jordan
became the first Arab state to
Brighton’s Grand Hotel: terrorists struck at the Tories


THE WEEK’S ACTION
restore full diplomatic rela-
tions with Egypt broken by
all Arab League countries
after Cairo’s peace treaty with
Israel in 1979 President
Mubarak of Egypt met King
Hussein of Jordan in the
Jordanian capital of Amman.
The meeting has been widely
interpreted as the first step
toward the creation of a mod-
erate Arab front which could
lead to Middle East peace
negotiations.
US backing for Israel
ISRAEL’S Prime Minister of
less than a month, Shimon
Peres, flew to Washington for
an introductory visit to Presi-
dent Reagan. After their first
meeting, Peres warmly
praised Reagan as “a true
friend of Israel.” The Presi-
dent promised US backing for
Israel’s efforts to overcome its
economic problems and
pledged to help the Jewish
state to maintain its qualita-
tive military superiority in the
Middle East region.
Defence spending up
DESPITE difficult economic
conditions, the world still
spent $950,000 million on de-
fence in the year up to July
1984. This was stated in the
latest report of the London-
based independent Inter-
national Institute of Strategic
Studies. This astronomical
amount was $44,000 million
more than the defence bill for
the previous year.
Shuttle back
THE 13th Challenger space
shuttle mission, lasting eight
days, ended with a perfect
landing at Cape Canaveral in
Florida. The crew of seven
the largest so far carried in-
cluded Australian-born Dr
Paul Scully-Power.
Air lanes closed
GREECE, increasingly at log-
gerheads with its Atlantic Al-
liance partners, has closed
busy international air lanes
over the Aegean Sea to civ-
ilian flights on the grounds
that a NATO air exercise,
held without Athens’ consent,
could endanger lives. Greece
boycotts all NATO exercises
in the Aegean region claiming
that these only serve the- in-
terests of “Turkish ex-
pansionism.”
UK mining moves
THE British Conservative
Party conference at Brighton
solidly backed the Thatcher
government’s handling of the
seven-month-old coal miners’
dispute. In a related action,
Justice Donald Nicholls of the
High Court fined Arthur
Scargill, president of the Na-
tional Union of Mineworkers,
$l4BO and the union itself
$296,000 for disregarding a
court ruling that the coal
strike was illegal in two coun-
ties.
Poet wins Nobel
DISSIDENT Czech poet
Jaroslav Seifert, 83, has won
the 1984 Nobel Prize for Lit-
erature. Prominent in the liter-
ary and cultural life of his
own country (but little known
elsewhere), Seifert has
received the prize “for his po-
etry which, endowed with
freshness, sensuality and rich
inventiveness, provides a
liberating image of the in-
domitable spirit and versatil-
ity” of humanity.
BUSINESS
Bank bonus
THE recovery in the econ-
omy, an invigorated savings
bank and improved margins
enabled the Commonwealth
Bank to boost profits from
$143.2 to 225.8 million in the
year to June 30 ahead of
Westpac ($222.2 million) and
the ANZ ($197.9 million) who
balance at September 30.
Profit on the Common-
wealth’s savings bank opera-
tions was $132 million, double
that of last year.
Bleak outlook
THE Confederation of Aus-
tralian Industry issued a bleak
forecast on prospects for em-
ployment in manufacturing
industry. It said that some
120,000 jobs had been lost in
manufacturing since Novem-
ber 1977 but only 7700 added
in the past year-and-a-half in
all primary and secondary in-
dustry, with little sign of im-
provement.
News makes news
AAP took news dissemination
one step further with the re-
lease of The Corporate Re-
port, a news service with no
delays, no cables and no tele-
phone links. High-frequency
microwave beams financial,
political, sporting and other
news and information to a
computer terminal via either a
small receiver on the execu-
tive’s desk or metre-wide disc
on the rooftop. The service
can be hooked up to personal
computers.
Complex sold
KEITH WILLIAMS sold his
Gold Coast entertainment
complex Sea World to com-
panies associated with Perth
businessman Peter Laurance
for $35 million.
Profit up
DIRECTORS of widely di-
versified light engineering and
printing group McPhersons
Ltd said profit was up 30
percent for the first 10 weeks
of the new financial year,
after reporting that profit
for the June year rose 53
percent from $7.31 to 11.19
million.

Morgan Gallup Poll spells trouble
for Andrew Peacock
Opposition leader Andrew Peacock goes into the campaign for the December 1 election
for the House of Representatives and half the Senate carrying a heavy handicap. The
latest Morgan Gallup Poll shows him starting from a record low base.
THE LATEST Morgan Gallup Polls
show that the Leader of the Opposition,
Andrew Peacock, is falling further in
public esteem and that economic issues
are likely to dominate the December 1
federal election.
Both polls are further bad news for
the Liberal-National coalition, which is
already facing an uphill fight.
In the weekend of October 6 and 7,
Peacock’s approval should be treated
with a little caution because it came
from a survey covering only one week-
end and therefore represents half the
normal Morgan Gallup sample pub-
lished by The Bulletin.
However, it represents a further slide
in Peacock’s popularity since the last
poll.
The question asked by Morgan
Gallup is whether electors approve of
the way the Opposition leader is hand-
ling his position. In the weekend of Sep-
tember 29/30, immediately after Prime
Minister’s wife Hazel Hawke’s defence
of her family, Peacock’s approval rating
dropped from 25 to 22 percent. Then
came the debate in parliament between
Bob Hawke and Peacock on the issue.
In the following weekend, after Peacock
was generally regarded as having been
beaten by Hawke in the debate, the Op-
position leader’s approval rating has
slumped to 20 percent. If the results
were averaged out in the normal fort-
nightly way, Peacock would still only
receive a 21 percent rating which is
awful for an Opposition leader heading
into an election.
The only thing that can reverse this
sort of tide is a big issue but, with one
important qualification, there is no sign
of this emerging either.
A separate Morgan Gallup Poll
taken on the weekends of September
8/9 and 15/16 sought voters’ views on
the main issues.
As the accompanying tables show,
these were overwhelmingly economic.
The important qualification is that
Morgan Gallup did not load into the
poll any question on crime and corrup-
tion. Leaving this as an unknown, the
dominant issue emerged as unemploy-
ment, although concern about this was
down by a staggering 17 percent from
55 percent in 1983.
Any consolation this statistic gives to
right-wing economists will be tempered
by the fact that the idea of getting tough
with irresponsible unions has remained
virtually unmoved at 25 percent.
A new question promotion of busi-
ness growth attracted 20 percent sup-
port. Meanwhile, concern about the rate
of inflation has eased by almost half
from 31 to 17 percent.
The poll generally reflects a toughen-
ing of public support for right-wing
economics, although there are some
important exceptions. Of the con-
temporarily hot issues, immigration and
uranium are the most interesting.
A total of 12 percent thought reduc-
tion in the number of migrants was an
important issue. Eight percent wanted
no exports of uranium while 4 percent
favored it. These statistics are important
to the extent that they reflect single issue
concerns which may well override all
other considerations. For instance, a
committed anti-nuclear activist is un-
likely to be swayed by other economic
considerations.
But, on their policies declared so far,
there is little comfort for the opposition
parties in these considerations either.
The coalition is trying hard enough as it
is to hang on to traditional voters.
Declaring for a nuclear-free Australia


or higher Asian immigration would
really put them between a rock and a
hard place.

POLITICS
Why the Libs can’t fill Menzies’ boots:
By MICHAEL SEXTON*
IN MANY ways it is the elec-
tion set down for December 1
rather than the election of
March 1983 that represents
the end of a remarkable
period of domination of fed-
eral politics by the Liberal
and National parties.
For the first time since
1946 the two parties are going
into an election campaign
knowing that in the absence
of a miracle they cannot
win. Despite some real fears
before the 1983 campaign,
there was no such feeling of
certaintly about its result
when the election was called.
In the 35 years since
Robert Menzies’ victory in
1949 the coalition parties have
spent 30 years in office and
during the three years of the
Whitlam government they
quite successfully refused to
acknowledge the legitimacy
of the new administration.
Throughout the period of that
government, they always re-
mained on the verge of return-
ing to power through the
mechanism of blocking sup-
ply in the Senate and forcing
an election.
Only in the past 18 months
have they experienced the
kind of arid opposition in
which the Labor Party spent
decades in the post-war years.
This era of political domi-
nance produced two great il-
lusions which have not been totally
dissipated by those past 18 months in
opposition.
The first is that of the coalition, par-
ticularly the Liberal Party the most
prominent member as the natural
party of government. This is how the
Liberals appeared throughout the 50s,
60 and 70s and not only to themselves
but also to most of their opponents and
to the electorate at large.
Yet, for most of the 50s and 60s, their
dominance was the result of three essen-
tially unrelated factors the continued
growth of the post-war economy, the
* Lawyer and author Michael Sexton is one
of Australia's most perceptive political com-
mentators. His books include Illusions Of
Power (a study of the Whitlam years), The
Legal Mystique and War For The Asking on
the Vietnam war during the Menzies years.
Fraser campaigning: the golden days are gone forever
prominence of foreign affairs as an elec-
tion issue and the great split within the
Labor Party that produced the Demo-
cratic Labor Party (DLP).
The political benefits of economic
growth flowed naturally to the Liberals
as the incumbents from the start of the
period of post-war prosperity. By the
early 70s it was clear that the economic
machine had slowed permanently and
that no future government would be
able to bask in the aura of affluence that
surrounded the Menzies administration.
The second factor in Liberal ascend-
ancy the role of foreign affairs as an
election issue had already lost much
of its potency by the 1969 election. It
was perhaps Whitlam’s most effective
exercise in Opposition to defuse foreign
affairs as an item on the political agenda
after the damage done to Labor by
Menzies’ use of the issue at all
the elections that he won. And
there would appear to be little
risk that this issue could be-
come an electoral problem for
Labor under a Hawke govern-
ment.
The consequences of the
split lingered until 1974 when
the DLP was finally wiped out
as a parliamentary group in
the Senate. Its rationale had,
however, been effectively de-
stroyed by the election of the
Whitlam government. The
Whitlam government did not
last but the DLP never re-
appeared as a political force.
In retrospect it can be seen
how fortuitous was the combi-
nation of factors that pre-
served Liberal rule through-
out these decades. This, of
course, made the results no
less devastating for the Labor
Party and helped to produce
the debacle of the Whitlam
government by ensuring that
none of its ministers had pre-
viously held office and that
many of them were burnt-out
cases after so many years of
opposition.
Yet some Liberals seem to
believe that these halcyon
days can be recaptured. They
cannot. Quite clearly, the Lib-
erals eventually will return to
office in Canberra but not as
the natural party of govern-
ment in the sense that they ap-
peared to be between 1949 and 1983.
The other great illusion about this
period of Liberal rule is that it was
based upon principles of free enterprise
and small government and that these
philosophies hold the key to returning
to power.
Very few Liberals would hold this
view of the Fraser years, presumably.
The Valder report, which resulted from
a study by senior Liberals of the 1983
election loss, was particularly caustic
concerning the failure of that govern-
ment to live up to its incoming rhetoric
of reducing the public sector and de-
regulating the private sector. But it re-
quires a very short memory to suggest
that the Menzies government and its im-
mediate successors were different in this
respect from the Fraser regime.
The 50s and 60s were the period

This amazing PVC pitch is light enough
to take with you, yet tough enough to withstand
the force of The Windies attack. The embossed
surface gives excellent footing in the rain or hot
sun, while its pace is the same as a medium fast

In fact, Dunlop Uni-Turf is so highly
regarded, you’ll see it at the Cricket School at
Lords.
If you think a cricket pitch takes a lot
of beating, Dunlop Industrial can stretch your
thinking in many unusual ways. Imagine a
piece of rubber that not only takes the full
weight of a speeding Bullet Train in Japan, but
also protects the critical structure of the rail

when the strongly regulated
and anti-competitive structure
of the Australian economy
was established. Tariff bar-
riers were set in the manufac-
turing area that produced
totally inefficient sectors such
as the car industry. The two-
airline policy was enshrined
in legislation and the import-
ation of aircraft prohibited to
ensure that no new service
could be established. Banking
licences were frozen in the
hands of existing holders and
the establishment of foreign
banks prohibited. Interest
rates were tightly regulated
and the rates for home loans
fixed at an artificially low
level. Broadcasting and tele-
vision licences were issued to
existing media outlets and the
issue of additional licences or
the transference of existing li-
cences closely regulated. A
policy of central wage-fixing
by the Conciliation and Arbi-
tration Commission was
encouraged by the govern-
ment and adopted as far as
possible by the commission
under Sir Richard Kirby.
Whether the kind of free market
models recommended by the Valder re-
port have any utility for the Australian
economy at this stage is not an issue for
debate in this article, although it might
be argued that whatever their initial
merits it would be extremely difficult
to impose these models on an economy
that is the result of the policies de-
scribed and pursued over decades by
Liberal governments.
What is a matter for debate is the as-
sumption in the Valder report that free
market policies will be electorally ap-
pealing. The Liberal successes of the
post-war years were not the result of
free market rhetoric or, as can be seen
from the list above, free market prac-
tice. In addition to preserving this illu-
sion, the rhetoric of the Valder report
involves the potential embarrassment
for the Liberals of yet again making
promises that cannot be performed. As
Malcolm Fraser discovered, the realities
of power do not allow a great deal of
room for manoeuvre in government in
this country. It is difficult to make major
changes at either the economic or the
social level. The Hawke government has
been making the same discovery. Its at-
tempts to make two relatively minor
changes in the tax and social security
areas the lump sum superannuation
tax and the assets test for pensioners
met with ferocious resistance from the
groups affected and eventually forced
the abandonment of the changes as
originally proposed by the government.
Andrew Peacock confronts the media: the last link with the golden age
In the light of these experiences, the
kinds of policies suggested by the
Valder report are simply exercises in
fantasy or, in words previously more
appropriate to some sections of the
Labor Party, the politics of the warm
inner glow.
None of this means that the Liberals
do not have some prospects of regaining
office in 1987, although this would be a
very difficult task if they gained no
ground or even lost ground in the
forthcoming election. But they are not
likely to be helped to this end by docu-
ments such as the Valder report.
In looking at the post-war period,
there is some argument for saying that
the Labor Party is not so disconcerted
by the concept of opposition as are the
Liberals. A cynic might remark that this
is hardly surprising at the national level
because Labor has had so much
more experience in the role. But there is
another reason. In many ways the
Labor Party more closely resembles the
moderate left and centre parties of west-
ern Europe with their detailed plat-
forms and their parliamentary member-
ship of long-term politicians who expect
to spend some periods out of govern-
ment. Francois Mitterrand came to the
presidency in France, for example, after
almost 30 years in continuous opposi-
tion and after creating both a set of poli-
cies and an administrative structure for
the French Socialist Party.
The comparisons cannot be pushed
too far but the Liberal Party bears a
closer resemblance to the two major
parties in the United States. Both the
Republicans and Democrats are less
parties of detailed policies and complex
administrative structures than loose or-
ganisations that focus primarily on
elections at regular intervals. During
periods of government, this structure is
highly convenient and unobtrusive but
it is more difficult to mobilise in opposi-
tion than is the Labor Party’s more elab-
orate machinery,
None of this is much present conso-
lation to Liberals or to their beleaguered
leader Andrew Peacock. Peacock repre-
sents in some respects a last link, despite
his relative youth, with the golden age
of Menzies. He succeeded Menzies in
the electorate of Kooyong and was
looked upon even then as a future prime
minister. Except for Fraser, the Liberal
leaders since Menzies have struggled
badly. It is unfair to put Peacock in the
same category as Holt, Snedden,
Gorton and McMahon because he is
much better.
But it is quite possible that in the af-
termath of the forthcoming election,
with the long-held confidence of being
born to rule at last shattered, the Lib-
erals will reject this link also with their
glorious years.
Whatever happens to Peacock, when
the Liberals on December 2 confront
the prospect of opposition until 1987
and possibly until 1990 they will be in
no doubt that the past, real or imagin-
ary, cannot be recaptured. □


FUND RAISING
Labor gets
more and the
Libs get less
Prime Minister Hawke’s TV advertisement: Public funds will boost campaign spending
By RICHARD FARMER
and
DAVID BARNETT
LABOR ENTERS this year’s federal
election campaign with the prospect of
spending as much as the Liberal and
National parties for the first time. In
previous elections Labor has been out-
spent almost two to one. The turn-
around results from changes to the elec-
toral laws and a general expectation
that the Hawke government will be re-
turned.
Liberal officials report difficulty in
convincing their traditional business
donors to be as generous as in the past.
The introduction of public funding for
elections has given companies an excuse
for not donating at all. But more im-
portant is the provision introduced into
the electoral laws earlier this year for
the public disclosure of donations of
$lOOO or more.
There is a natural reluctance on the
part of company executives to appear
on the public record as having given
more to the Liberal and National par-
ties than Labor. This reluctance is even
more so when the polls show that Labor
has a comfortable lead.
Early indications from both the
Labor and Liberal parties is that the dis-
tribution of company donations this
year will be markedly different from
past years. Firms which may in the past
have put up $50,000 for the Liberals and
$5OOO for Labor are now splitting their
contributions equally. Labor certainly
expects such companies to make equal
donations of perhaps $lO,OOO which will
result in a saving for the company
more money for Labor, substantially
less for the Liberals.
While the Liberals are suffering with
their traditional donors, Labor has no
such problem with its traditional trade
union supporters. They have no inhibi-
tions about public knowledge of their
donations to Labor. And in any case,
affiliation fees from unions are regarded
under the new law as membership and
do not have to be made public.
The biggest plus for Labor comes
from the public funding provisions that
will apply for the first time at the
December 1 poll. Every valid vote cast
in the election will cost the taxpayer
91.8 cents.
Each vote for a candidate in the
House of Representatives will be worth
61.2 cents and there will be 30.6 cents
for a valid vote for the Senate.
With some 9.5 million voters, after
allowing for those who do not vote and
for those who vote informally, the Aus-
tralian Electoral Office estimates that
the public purse will be called on to pro-
vide about $8 million to parties and reg-
istered candidates who poll the mini-
mum 4 percent of primary votes
required to get assistance. The Liberals
expect to get some $2.3 million of this
and Labor a little more.
The importance of this public money
can be seen from the fact that at the
election last year the federal Labor
Party probably spent some $2.5 million
and the Liberals almost twice that. The
best guess of party officials is that for
every dollar spent on the federal cam-
paign there is another dollar spent at the
state and local level. In 1983 therefore
Labor might have spent some $5 million
and the Liberal and National parties
$lO million.
This year total spending might not
increase much but the $l5 million total
will split about equally.
Aware of the difficulties in funding
their campaign this year, the Liberals
have already embarked on a major
effort to raise money by way of small
donations from individuals. Party secre-
tary Tony Eggleton recently visited the
United States to study the way that the
Republican Party operates in a country
where laws about donations are even
stricter than in Australia. The result was
a mass mailing to thousands of individ-
uals asking them to fill in a question-
naire about issues and mail it back
along with a contribution to cover the
cost of the survey and a donation to the
party as well.
Labor will, for the first time ever, be
making a similar direct approach to
voters within the next week. Its begging
letters will not have a questionnaire but
the purpose will be the same: to collect
donations of less than $lOOO that do not
have to be disclosed. □

Task force
monsters VFL
Frankenstein
VFL president Aylett: sections of the report were a “load of rubbish”
DON McPHEDRAN
By TIM DUNCAN
bers well respected in the football
world. It includes John Kennedy, for-
mer player and coach of the Hawthorn
club, Labor member of the Legislative
Assembly Bob Miller who is a former
Melbourne player.
Formation was by no means an over-
night episode. A report recommended
setting up the force after years of
mounting concern that VFL boundaries
had become so vast and its activities
as entertainer, employer, investor and
political actor so varied that its con-
stituent clubs no longer could direct it
adequately.
The task force conclusions will not
surprise the Victorian football public,
many thousands of whom booed in uni-
son when Aylett walked onto the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground before last
year’s Grand Final.
It was to the folk side of footy that
the task force implicitly directed itself
and its broad conclusion was that the
VFL could be likened to a political ma-
chine with vague goals, a formal
power structure that has in practice
been superseded by informal power re-
lationships, secretive decision-making
processes and no apparent responsibil-
ity to the public which ultimately sus-
tains it.
“It is appropriate to compare the
VFL with a private company that has a
valuable product to sell,” the task force
argued. “If that company experienced a
decreasing demand for its product, if it
incurred huge debts, if a large number
of its subsidiaries were potentially insol-
vent, if there were criticism of its indus-
trial relations and public image, if the
directors were regarded at being insen-
sitive to shareholders’ criticisms, then
the shareholders might reasonably be
A TASK FORCE of its own creation
has asked the Victorian Football League
to self-destruct and reconstitute itself.
In a blunt report to the VFL directors,
the task force also has suggested that the
offices of president and general man-
ager of the league held, respectively,
by Allan Aylett and Jack Hamilton be
abolished.
As well, the task force recommends
that the directors who created it, each a
representative of the 12 clubs which
constitute the VFL, should be replaced
by club presidents. In place of the cur-
rent board, the task force has suggested
an American-style sporting commission
which would be responsible on ques-
tions of policy to club presidents only.
The report has sent shivers up the
spines of many of the directors. They
resent the analysis that has inspired the
recommendations and reject the notion
that the premier administrative body of
Australian Football runs as the political
machine which the task force says it
does. They also say that VFL football is
not in the state of crisis which its critics
presume it to be in and suggest that the
task force may have picked up a touch
of the zealotry that inspired many of the
submissions to it, made in camera by
clubs.
The task force is composed of mem-
expected to replace that company’s
management.”
Even by the standards of football
politics, that is tough stuff. No wonder
that some besieged VFL directors feel
the task force has misunderstood the na-
ture of their administration. But there
was more...
“There are widely held views that
some principal participants, including
the VFL’s president and the general
manager, exercise a disproportionate
influence on the decision-making pro-
cesses.” The task force explained what it
meant: “It was suggested that some de-
cisions were pre-determined and that
the VFL administration always had a
certain number of votes supporting its
recommendations.” The report added:
“Criticism was expressed by the clubs
that board members were only given
selective information by the VFL ad-
ministrators.”
Miller, who wrote the bulk of the re-
port, told The Bulletin that some of the
VFL’s recent moves certainly had been
aggressive but they had taken place in
an institutional context of high turnover
of personnel within the board and with-
out a clear set of goals against which to
compare its performance.
He cited the case of the move of
South Melbourne’s Swans to Sydney,
saying that the notion of making Aus-
tralian Football a national sport had not
been thought out properly. “I would
have thought that tennis or cricket are
the only truly national sports we have.
But, if we make footy a national sport,
then we have to take account of what
that will mean for Victorians. If every-
one had agreed that footy was going to
be national, maybe we could have put
Hawthorn or another very successful
club there; we could have recognised
what everyone says about Sydney that
they love winners. But Sydney was the
hardest possible market to crack and
they sent the most vulnerable club,
South Melbourne.”
The report is a mixture of the popu-
lar and the elite. It refers on one hand to
the alienation of the average footy sup-
porter and in particular to the wide-
spread cynicism in Melbourne dis-
played towards the VFL administration,
to inflated prices at the grounds for re-
freshments and to resentment at the de-
velopment of corporate superboxes.
On the other hand, the report recom-
mends a new structure of adminis-
tration. “The VFL directors will have to
self-immolate,” said Miller. “It depends
on their political will. It will require a
power shift from the directors to the
presidents.”
On top of the presidents, the task
force wants to see a commission com-
prising one full-time and four part-time
members, none with administrative
links to the clubs. In effect, the clubs


would be disenfranchised in the day-to-
day administration of the VFL.
The task force sees a necessity to ex-
pose the mythology that “the clubs are
the league and the league is the clubs.”
The problem is that there is no single
spokesman for the clubs and presidents
and their VFL representatives, the di-
rectors, are often at loggerheads. Lines
of influence have become ravelled. The
task force intends to make the centre
accountable in relation to the facts of its
power..
Not surprisingly, few at the VFL
board level or within the secretariat like
such analysis. Aylett told The Bulletin
that allegations about the secretariat
manipulating the board were “just a
load of rubbish. And, if the directors
had been asked, they would have told
the task force so.”
He added: “It’s not a surprise to me,
having been a keen football administra-
tor for many years, to see the recom-
mendation that the president and the
general manager not be there any longer
if there’s going to be an independent
commission, that is.” But the political
analysis was “totally incorrect.”
lan McPherson, VFL director for the
Collingwood Football Club told The
Bulletin the suggestion that collusion
takes place at the board at the behest of
the secretariat was absurd. “I have
never been contacted by either Aylett or
Hamilton to change my vote,” he said.
Other club directors are taking the
report personally as well, repeating de-
nials that they in particular have been
party to any form of manipulation.
Leo O’Brien, director for Geelong
and involved with football for 25 years,
asks: “Where are they going to get those
independent commissioners from?
Look, when it comes to football, the
judges, the professionals, the business
... they all become partisan; they all
level out. For this reason, I don’t believe
that the clubs should surrender their
right to be involved in the decisions of
the league.”
McPherson thinks that the idea of
crisis within the VFL has simply got out
of hand. “All this stuff about the VFL
being a disaster: it’s just a knee-jerk
charge. Only three years ago it was
booming, with record attendances.
What I don’t see is how this sort of
charge about the incompetence of the
league is relevant to what is only a re-
cent and controllable trough.”
Whatever, the case whether ma-
nipulation occurs, consciously or not
such powerful machines as the VFL are
bigger than the sum of the individuals
who constitute them. As Miller sees it,
trying to change the VFL is like trying to
change the Vatican. But the task force is
convinced that the former change must
happen to produce more flow from the
parish pump. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Wran government
would have lost
a September poll
Opposition leader Greiner (left) and Premier Wran: a 3 percent lead to the coalition
IF AN ELECTION had been held
during September, the Wran govern-
ment would have lost office, the latest
Morgan Gallup Poll has found.
The approval rating of Premier
Neville Wran was unchanged at 38 per-
cent, while 52 percent (up 1 percent)
disapproved of the way he was handling
his job. Approval of Nick Greiner as the
Leader of the Opposition was up 2 per-
cent to 51 percent.
As to whether Greiner would do a
better job than Wran as premier, 35 per-
cent said “Better”, 28 percent said the
“Same”, 24 percent “Worse” and 13
percent couldn’t say.
These findings came from interview-
ing 1506 electors throughout New South
Wales in September. Electors were
asked which party would receive their
first preference “if a State election were
being held today.” Of those surveyed, 5
percent didn’t state their preference.

30 years ago, Audi designed
the world’s most aerodynamic vehicle
At Audi, we were working on the problem of
wind resistance before most carmakers even knew
there was a problem.
As our “Baumm-sche Project,” proves.
Designed by our engineers in the fifties, it had a
tiny lOOcc engine (about l/20th the size of an average
car engine).
Yet it reached a staggering 224 km/h.
From it, we learned more efficient ways
to penetrate the almost solid wall of air that builds
up in front of a car above 70 km/h.
And we discovered that the tiring wind roar
which plagues even the best of luxury cars could be
almost eliminated.
All of this led us to develop the car below.
The aerodynamic new Audi 100. So ‘slippery’ is the
body design, that wind roar is reduced to a rustle.
You can converse with your passengers at
speed, without raising your voice. Listen to music
without winding up the volume.
And arrive less tired.
Not surprisingly, the new Audi 100 was acclaimed
by Europe’s motoring press. Winning the
prestigious ‘World Gar of the Year ’B3’ award.
In fact, the Audi breaks entirely new ground
for luxury vehicles in the eighties. Thanks to a
vehicle we designed in the fifties.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
Everingham
plans tactics
to go federal
By DENIS REINHARDT
USING the same skills which helped
him lead a landslide 19-6 victory over
Labor in Northern Territory polls, Paul
Everingham is hoping almost exactly a
year later on December 1 to defy
political gravity and take its sole federal
House of Representatives seat from his
former law partner John Reeves.
From the Territory elections last
December 3, Everingham was propelled
back into the Chief Minister’s chair by a
12 percent swing.
Three issues dominated his cam-
paign: uranium mining, Aboriginal
land rights and a proposed railway from
Alice Springs to Darwin.
With immaculate timing and a short
and punchy campaign, Everingham
honed the “them” and “us” sensitivities
which unite Territorians against Can-
berra even against the freshly victori-
Paul Everingham meets the press in Brisbane
KEITH BARLOW
ous and equally popular Prime Minister
Bob Hawke.
Everingham, 41, Queensland-
educated, 17 years in the Territory,
ventured south last week to map out his
election strategy with advisers. The
meeting significantly took place not in
Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne but in
Brisbane. This is where another bete
noire of the federal government,
Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-
Petersen, rules.
Everingham told The Bulletin that he
was unworried about the public opinion
poll-predicted swing to Hawke but
would continue to cry foul over incor-
poration of 2000 strongly unionised
Christmas Island voters into the North-
ern Territory electorate for the first
time.
He is privately confident though
publicly remarking that, “if I fail, I
might go and hang out my shingle as a
lawyer again.”
His practice once stretched to offices
in Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine,
Tennant Creek, Brisbane and Adelaide.
“I think the fight in the Northern
Territory is not going to be an easy
one,” he said. “Some people have said
it’s going to be a shoe-in but we’ve held
government in the Northern Territory
since 1974 when the Legislative As-
sembly was first instituted.
“But federal politics are different to
Territory politics,” he added. “Whether
a majority of 19 to 6 in the Legislative
Assembly will translate to federal poli-
tics I very much doubt. I think I’m go-
ing to be working hard be-
cause Mr Hawke is a popular
leader.”
Everingham will use the
same themes which returned
him last December: “Mr
Hawke hasn’t delivered any-
thing to the Northern Terri-
tory. He’s given uranium
mining at Roxby Downs to
the South Australians, said
that we can’t have Kungarra
and Jabiluka and cost us a bil-
lion dollars and 2000 jobs.
He’s reneged on his commit-
ment to build the Alice
Springs to Darwin rail link.
He’s mucking around with
our financial agreement, so I
don’t know what Mr Hawke’s
done for the Northern Terri-
tory that we should pass votes
of thanks to him.
“At least I’m going to bring
the harsh light of publicity
onto what he’s doing, which
this lapdog in the Territory
isn’t doing at the moment,”
Everingham said.
“I am doing it now but I
think I can do it a lot better in
the national parliament.” □

BUREAUCRACY
Empire grows
from a ‘small’
uranium check
Mr Justice Fox: empire builders run riot
with his recommendations
By RICHARD FARMER
THE APPOINTMENT of a group of
scientists to measure the effect on the
environment was considered to be a
way of re-assuring the public back in the
days when Australia was agonising over
whether to mine uranium at all.
In his inquiry into the Ranger devel-
opment in the Northern Territory, Mr
Justice Fox recommended establishing
an Office of the Supervising Scientist to
do the job with a small staff. The gov-
ernment of the day accepted that but
evidence has emerged that the planned
small operation has grown into a mas-
sive piece of empire-building.
Former Australian government ana-
lyst Dr Frank Peters outlined the story
of the Office of Supervising Scientist in
a recent speech to the National Science
Forum in Canberra. He related how he
had made a confidential, personal sub-
mission to the Fox inquiry after being
prevented by a head of department
from making a formal one.
In that submission, Peters referred to
the opinion of an interdepartmental
committee that the supervision of
mining activities should use existing
state and federal laboratory facilities on
the user-pays principle.
Because the uranium mines would
need their own laboratory facilities on-
site as well, the committee recom-
mended that the miners be required to
provide an area for use by the govern-
ment inspecting analyst. It was
envisaged that perhaps 10 professional
officers would be needed to supplement
existing staff. Fox’s recommendations
were basically along those lines.
What Peters and his committee
envisaged did not come to pass. When
he came to give evidence to the Fraser
government’s “razor gang” (set up to
cut federal spending) as a private citi-
zen, after being retired from the public
service on health grounds the Super-
vising Scientist had an establishment of
about 60. “We have what I consider to
be the best piece of scientific empire-
building yet,” says Peters.
The establishment strength has risen
to about 80 and a recent report by Pro-
fessor Ralph Slayter to the government
recommended even more staff.
Not only is the growth in numbers a
matter of some surprise to Peters but so
is their location.
The original plan was to have scien-
tists working near the mine, in the Alli-
gator River region but most of them
have not ventured north of Sydney
where a new laboratory is to be built.
Peters expressed disappointment
that the Ross committee into federal
government laboratory services (B, June
5) did not comment on the Supervising
Scientist laboratory. Peters thought that
seeing what relationship could exist be-
tween it and the Atomic Energy Com-
mission laboratories at Lucas Heights,
the Australian Government Analytical
Laboratories and state department of
Mines laboratories would be fruitful.
The object of such co-operation would
be to save some of the $5.16 million pro-
vided in this year’s federal budget for
the scientists’ work.
Peters’ suggestion is likely to fall on
deaf ears.
The scientific community within the
commonwealth public service has
fought long and hard to resist rational-
isation. One delightful example Peters
gave in his speech concerns water tes-
ting laboratories in the Australian Capi-
tal Territory. Peters discovered when he
conducted a survey of laboratories for
the government in 1975 that three of
them were doing basically the same job.
They still are in laboratories run by
the Department of Capital Territory,
the ACT Health service and the depart-
ment of Construction.
To support his pessimistic con-
clusion that nothing is likely to be done
about waste caused by interdepart-
mental rivalries, Peters quotes a letter
from a former Health minister Doug
Everingham to then Science minister
Bill Morrison about a plan to combine
the laboratory services of their depart-
ments.
“In summary,” Everingham wrote,
“I consider that the only practical way
in which economies could be achieved
without impact on effectiveness would
be through a common administration of
the total laboratory facilities. As the Na-
tional Biological Standards Laboratory
is so obviously an integral part of my
administration, the transfer to my de-
partment would be the only basis on
which I could support the proposal.”
Such a view still prevails. As Peters
summed it up: “If I can’t have all the
marbles, I will take mine away and play
by myself.” □

The amazing
rituals of the
new ice age
By KATHY LETTE
IT HAS always puzzled me why droves
of city-dwellers strap skis to roofracks
every winter and migrate to Australia’s
alpine zones. I mean, mankind spent
billions of years evolving out of the ice
age. Why is everyone so desperate to
evolve back ini
As an amateur anthropologist (immi-
nent, rather than eminent), I ventured
south to Thredbo to observe our arctic
clans. To familiarise myself with their
mountain dialect (schussing, slaloming
and langlaufing). De-mystify their
mating ceremonies (primitive
rituals which take place in the
Keller Bar named, I pre-
sume, after Helen Keller; a lot
of groping goes on by Braille).
And observe the initiation rit-
uals on the icy slopes (polar-
type people have a tendency
to jump to contusions; skiers
sport tribal markings of
bruises and broken legs or
simply turn into human
shishkebabs, impaled, deep
frozen, on their ski poles).
If like me you only
have to look at a picture post-
card of snow to fall over, ski-
ing is a bruising business. In
the beginners’ queue, as my
face an'd fingers color co-
ordinated with my blue parka,
I found myself wishing for
once that I could turn moun-
tains into molehills. In my
first few hours on the slopes, I
perfected an innovative and
accidental style: “Rap Ski-
ing.” Rap or Break Skiing
simply requires that you
spend most of your time on
your head, elbow, neck or
nostril.
Skiing entails many unex-
pected dangers. The begin-
ner’s brochure promised fun
and togetherness but my first
day at Thredbo was a lesson
in brotherly shove as thou-
sands combated to the one
diminishing pocket of over-
populated snow. (I had seen
more promising drifts at home
in my undefrosted freezer.)
Chairlifts proved even
more perilous, not because of
the elevation but the conver-
sation. The lifts take a long
time to reach the mountain tops and
often pause over precipices.
Share a chair with someone who has
had a charisma by-pass “Hi! I’m a
parking station cashier” and a suici-
dal leap starts to look more and more
attractive. (Even thin air is preferable to
hot air.)
But most dangerous of all is answer-
ing nature’s call. It is vital to remember
to point skis across the mountain. Tips
only need to tilt downhill for a second
and gravity does its stuff". Let me tell
you, there is nothing more embarrassing
than emerging involuntarily from the
shrubbery, trailing a steaming hot jet
stream, in the squatting position.
Traditionally, skiing has been re-
garded as the preserve of the wealthy
and winter suntanned elite rich kids
with gleaming post-braces teeth, Dad’s
Volvo and genetically inherited political
opinions. But, chastened by bad snow
seasons, resorts are vying to entice the
beginner. The snowfields are suddenly
accessible to ordinary people with ordi-
nary bank balances. Skiing trips no
longer induce cases of debt-lag. And,
after a few falls, you stop feeling embar-
rassed about your mother-knitted
beanie and the Glad Bag strapped to
your non-waterproofed jeans bottom.
The truth is, in a downhill backside
slide, nobody looks upwardly mobile.
Thredbo boasts a unique cultural
heritage. Fancy dress, Roman toga, bad
joke and body-painting ceremonies take
place nightly in the Keller Bar. New
male and female tribal chiefs are elected
on Monday evenings. Selected guests
are put through a gruelling elimination
process. Male contestants are strapped
into elastic harnesses which suspend
tennis balls between their legs. Swaying
back and fourth, they take aim at speci-
fied targets.
Female competitors are instructed to
kneel, as if in homage, before a line of
matchboxes on the floor.
Using noses only, points are
allotted to the first contestant
to topple a matchbox. While
judges leer down shirtfronts,
the audience delivers raucous
buttock evaluations from be-
hind.
Sausages are then threaded
onto string and dangled from
the waists of male volunteers.
The women, still grovelling,
have to engorge the frankfurts
as fast as possible. Special
points are awarded to anyone
who can swallow the sausage
in one mouthful. “Good gob-
bler,” came the erudite ad-
judication of the winner’s per-
formance. “Seven out of 10.
Needs more practice at my
place.”
Thredbo has a low
threshold of fidelity. A hol-
idaying husband may confide
over Irish coffees that his mar-
riage has reached a stalemate
(as mates, they’re stale). And
married women, morals in
cold storage, compete for the
attention of ski instructors.
(No one objects to sex with a
sex object.)
Balaclavas and bad visibil-
ity, add a touch of masquer-
ade mystery to alpine life. As
skiers de-robe in the kiosk hot
chocolate queues, faces are
effused with disappointment
or delight (for some older
men, beanie removal means
there’s hell toupee) but the
big-time game hunting takes
place in the Keller Bar.
The ice age has preserved a
few neanderthal attitudes
toward sex. “My face is leav

ing in two minutes,” one casanova
courted me. “Be on it.” Another’s pre-
historic approach was to ask me back to
his room for a “68-er.” I queried this
primitive term. “Go down on me,” he
explained, “and I’ll owe you one.”
Today’s breed of snow bunny is also
more savage than reported. One hot
pink specimen in Gucci gear turned on
a male at the bar: “What do you want
me to do?” (He had been whistling at
her for the past half-hour.) “Bark or just
piss on your leg?”
Hunters’ most common snow job is
an offer of defrosting. Warnings that a
drop in core temperature impairs judg-
ment, brings on unconsciousness and
comatose states are enough to have you
begging indiscriminately for extra body
heat.
But most effective in the heterosexual
hunt is to fake an Austrian “bend ze
kneez” accent. Instructors are legendary
for treating all women as sequels. At the
bar, everyone from dishwashers to lift
drivers lectures women on traversing
techniques simultaneously checking
ze body pozitunz. After midnight, yo-
dels echo through the wafer-thin hotel
walls as dedicated “instructors” issue
free sermons on the mount.
Really, it’s a major feat that any
mating goes on at all. Traditional snow
gear is an excellent contraceptive. What
with zips, buckles, parkas, ski pants,
snow gaiters and long-john thermal
underwear, once you get in, you can
never get out again.
Snow bunnies are vacuum-packed.
When they strip off in the hotel drying
room, nothing moves. There is just the
“pzzztt” sound of an airtight container
being opened. More energy is burnt up
complying with undress-regulations
than from a whole day’s schussing on
the slopes.
My Margaret Mead analysis is that
skiing is a primeval urge. You see, our
ice age ancestors were always on the run
from something dinosaurs, glacier
quakes, barbarians ... Answering this
primitive instinct, we are still on the
run, stampeding up and down the
slopes on ski runs.
But, frostbite and barbaric mating
rituals aside, you do meet a nice species
of homosapiens at the snow. As a begin-
ner, you can skewer Dad, toboggan over
Mum, shishkebab the twins and steam-
roller right over the Volvo and they’ll
apologise to you for not getting out of
the way.
And you do learn quickly. By the
end of the week, the only time I slipped
on ice was when my foot went into my
gin and tonic.
What’s more: The other day I saw an
expert coming down the mountain with
his skis not wrapped around his neck,
nostril or elbow but pointing downhill.
I’m going to try that next. □

THE ACTU
Our next union supremo -a profile
The next change in the leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions should be
as dramatic as the Hawke/Dolan transition. DEBORAH HOPE profiles the heir apparent
for the presidency, Simon Crean, a labor chief with a taste for French wines.
HOW DOES a quiet, un-
adventurous university stu-
dent rise to the top of the Aus-
tralian trade union move-
ment? In the first instance, in
Simon Crean’s case, quite by
chance over a glass of beer at
the John Curtin pub in Carl-
ton’s Lygon Street.
It was there in 1970 that
21-year-old Crean first met his
mentor, Bill Landeryou, then
Victorian secretary of the
Federated Storemen and
Packers Union and the man
who provided Crean’s entree
to the union movement. The
gloomy bars of the John
Curtin have since formed a
backdrop to much of his swift
ascendance. A familiar sight
at the hotel is the well-dressed,
boy-faced Crean holding
forth to a group of industrial
reporters. Drinking at the
Curtin is as much a part of in-
dustrial relations in Mel-
bourne as playing tennis and
following the football.
At 35 Crean is federal sec-
retary of the Storemen and
Packers Union, senior vice-
president of the Australian
Council of Trade Unions and
heir-apparent to the ACTU
presidency when Cliff Dolan
retires next September. Al-
though Crean is loath to talk
about the succession, he clear-
ly relishes the prospect of
combining with his friend and
ally ACTU secretary Bill
Kelty in playing a key role in
the development of industrial
and economic policy under another
mate, Hawkey.
Like his father, Frank, federal
treasurer under Gough Whitlam, Simon
Crean has a keen interest in taxation
policy. It is in the area of tax reform that
he would like to make an early mark.
The father is pleased with the son for
tackling this area but, Simon says, “He
is a bit frustrated that the trade union
movement in his day was not so co-op-
erative.” The father-son relationship is a
strong one and Simon Crean often seeks
paternal advice on difficult economic
points.
During Melbourne’s long, hot sum-
mer, the son often accompanies the
father to the cricket at the MCG where
both are members. Frank Crean has
only recently come to understand the
real meaning of the generation gap -
these days, he finds he is known as
Simon Crean’s father.
No clear challenger has emerged to
complicate a clear run to the ACTU
presidency but this could change in the
12 months ahead. One possibility is
John Macßean, recently elected to re-
place Barrie Unsworth as NSW Labor
Council secretary, president of the
NSW Labor Party and a member of the
ACTU executive. Some Crean support-
ers fear that Macßean’s friendly ap-
proaches to the left-wing Amalgamated
Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights
Union on the vexed question of indus-
trial policy could signal the beginnings
of a challenge to the heir-apparent.
Behind discussions of a challenge is
an underlying trepidation in some
quarters of the union movement about
the overly cosy nature of a Hawke,
Kelty, Crean triumvirate and the gener-
al acknowledgement of Crean’s longer-
term ambitions to enter federal parlia-


ment. The prospect of the presidency
becoming the road to political power in
the mould of Prime Minister Bob
Hawke is not one that many unionists
relish. A further sentiment is that the
middle-class Melbourne boy’s dream
run to the top union job should not go
unquestioned. Apart from university va-
cation jobs, Crean has never been a part
of his union’s rank-and-file.
When he joined the Storemen and
Packers Union as a part-time research
officer in 1970, Crean had completed an
Economics degree and begun studying
Law. He chose Economics to maximise
his career options and, in view of the
elevated role of unions in government
economic policy, this has proved in-
valuable. In Law, Crean found the self-
discipline necessary for thorough re-
search. He saw his future as a solicitor,
rather than at the bar: “I was fairly quiet
in those days and didn’t really see my-
self standing up in terms of a courtroom
or a parliamentary debate,” he said in a
recent interview with The Bulletin.
This early lack of confidence as an
advocate is one of Crean’s most striking
paradoxes. A star performer at Hawke’s
national economic summit last year, ar-
ticulate economic debater (most recent-
ly on national television on the night of
the budget) and widely acknowledged
as both the smooth public relations face
of unionism and as a ruthless negotia-
tor, Crean’s beginning as a shy, earnest
asthmatic comes as a surprise.
When he broached the subject of a
union job with Landeryou, at the
Curtin, he had already written to then
newly-elected and impressive ACTU
Bill Landeryou: a strong influence on the young Crean
DON McPHEDRAN
president Bob Hawke to ask if he had
any place for a bright young graduate
with commitment. There was no reply.
Crean’s upbringing was strict Pres-
byterian. Frank Crean was an elder of
the church and young Simon made it to
the “dizzy heights of superintendent of
the local Sunday school.” Religion did
not follow him into his adult years.
Simon Crean was the second of three
sons. The boys were educated at the sel-
ective Melbourne High School. Stephen
has become a senior public servant in
the Transport department in Canberra
and David is an Adelaide
doctor.
As a student at the radical
Monash campus in the heady
days of the late 60s, Simon
Crean joined the Labor Club
and moratorium marches
against the Vietnam war but
not the counterculture. He
kept living at home through-
out his university days and
was never tempted to take off
overseas or to experiment
with drugs.
His mother frowned on al-
cohol and his father did not
drink until well into his 30s
but this abstemiousness has
not rubbed off on the younger
Crean. “I’ve had a few
sessions on this stuff, which
takes you off the planet from
time to time. That’s enough,”
he said, raising his wine glass.
His father taught him to ap-
preciate Australian dry whites
but Simon recently has devel-
oped a taste for sweet French dessert
wines such as Barsac. He does not go
much for reds but believes that the Ital-
ians have the best bulk table wine in the
world.
A keen tennis player in his teens,
Crean almost gave up the game during
his university days to allow more time
to study. He plays an occasional game
these days with his local club, with Bob
at the Lodge or on the Senate courts
during visits to Parliament House.
Crean’s last match there was with the ill-
fated duo Mick Young and Eric Walsh
and the now Public Service Board chair-
man, Dr Peter Wilenski.
Crean still makes time for the Davies
Cup the annual tournament between
the Australian Labor Party and the me-
dia in Melbourne. Social and sporting
contacts between reporters and the
ACTU are a mark of Melbourne indus-
trial relations. When Crean fractured a
wrist playing on Hawke’s court in Mel-
bourne, the others in the foursome were
present Attorney-General Senator
Gareth Evans and former industrial re-
porters from the Sun-Pictorial and The
Age newspapers.
It was also during his university days
that Crean developed a serious interest
in federal politics. He would visit his
father in Canberra during vacations,
spending days in the National Library
and nights listening to debates in the
House of Representatives.
His mother, a strong-willed and en-
ergetic woman (“I get my drive from
her”), actively discouraged this interest.
She advised her son that the “numbers”
side of politics could make it a frustra-
ting and even embittering experience.
He was to experience this truism at
first-hand when Clyde Holding un-

Former prime minister Gough Whitlam with his treasurer Frank Crean, father of Simon
expectedly beat him by two votes in a
pre-selection ballot for Melbourne
Ports, the seat Frank Crean had held for
31 years. It was 1977. Crean was 28 and
assistant federal secretary of the 73,000-
member Storemen and Packers. He was
disappointed but toughened by the re-
sult: “Politics was in my blood. It’s very
hard to shake that off.” Since then, he
has directed most of his energies to in-
creasing the power of his union and the
influence and effectiveness of the
ACTU. He has been successful on both
counts.
Crean’s political sensibilities were
soured further last year when Victorian
Premier John Cain forced Landeryou’s
resignation from cabinet following an
inquiry into his financial affairs. Crean
is extremely bitter about his friend’s
sudden demotion to the backbench and
convinced that Landeryou was treated
unjustly. When Crean was asked to
name the people he admires most in
Australia’s labor movement, Landeryou
was on top of the list. The other two
named were Crean’s father and John
Ryan, legal adviser to the Storemen and
Packers and described by Crean as “a
very loyal supporter of the union.”
The salutary political experiences
have not, however, dissuaded Crean
from intense involvement in the more
machiavellian side of Labor politics. A
leading member of Victoria’s Labor
Unity faction, he has been credited with
an important role in changing the ALP’s
uranium policy at its 1982 national con-
ference and as a main player pushing
the reaffiliation of right-wing Victorian
unions left out in the wilderness. An aim
of this move is to strengthen Hawke’s
position in the ever-more-militant
Victorian branch.
Crean was elected assistant national
secretary of the Storemen and Packers
in 1974, aged 25. His reputation as one
of Australia’s greatest and toughest
union tacticians was established two
years later when he led successfully the
brawl over bale weights in wool stores.
He argued that handling bales over 180
kilograms could cause back injuries and
heart strain. In the six-week strike that
followed, 4000 wool storemen were
sacked and $3OO million in shipments
delayed. Crean’s tactic was to launch a
log of claims in the Arbitration Com-
mission during the strike, using as a
basis the largely untested work value
changes principles. The result was
union victory, with a pay rise and light-
er bale.
Crean was elected federal secretary
three years later. His tactics in the 1980
wool dispute ensured his future as an
ACTU leader. The wool storemen were
striking in protest at woolbrokers’ suc-
cessful appeal against Justice Staples’
famed judgment awarding storemen
pay rises of up to nearly $l7 a week.
Storemen in most states were sent back
to work halfway through the dispute
and levied to support their striking
mates in the key ports of Sydney and
Melbourne. The storemen eventually re-
turned to work with wage rises of up to
$l2 a week and within the next nine
months had made up and exceeded the
rise in the original Staples judgment.
With his wife, Carole, and 15-month-
old daughter Sarah, Crean lives in a ter-
race house in the fashionable suburb of
Albert Park. He intends to remain Mel-
bourne-based, is not interest-
ed in racehorses or gambling
and drives a Holden that
comes with the job. At
lunchtimes, he walks down
Lygon Street to an Italian
delicatessen for a cheese and
prosciutto roll. Carole Crean,
a maths and science teacher,
has been at home with Sarah
since the birth but her hus-
band says that she is looking
forward to returning to part-
time work.
He does not feel under any
pressure to conform to the
model of an ordinary working
bloke because of his job. The
couple eat out regularly at lo-
cal ethnic restaurants in
particular Italian, Indian and
Lebanese and travel over-
seas regularly.
Crean loves the theatre and
ballet in London, the Jeu de
Paume impressionist gallery
in Paris and wandering about
Rome in the uncrowded win-
ter months. He is probably the
best-dressed unionist in Australia, with
suits that fit and ties that match. The
couple enjoy Sunday lunches with
friends and “Sunday afternoon situa-
tions” but tend to avoid big parties
where, says Crean, you are more likely
to find “punishers” who want to take
you on.
He and Carole are looking for a
larger house in Albert Park to accom-
modate the family and to provide more
space for home entertaining.
Despite the sophistication, there is a
strong boyish streak in Crean’s charac-
ter. He has visited all the major fun
parks in the United States and is es-
pecially fond of Disneyland and its
more modern counterpart in Miami,
Disneyworld. Like his mate Kelty,
Crean likes a good spy novel and pre-
fers films to plays particularly when
it’s a good western, Alfred Hitchcock or
James Bond. Crean’s modern musical
tastes are stuck in the 60s and 70s Bob
Dylan, Rod Stewart and Neil Young
and his classical tastes romantic,
Tchaikovsky’s ballet scores for instance.
His major relaxation these days is the
football. Unlike his spectacular career,
the fortunes of North Melbourne have
waxed and waned since he began sup-
porting them 10 years ago. Crean has
hardly missed a match since: “I find it a
good social equaliser. It’s a good place
to take friends or colleagues because the
demands aren’t there to talk business or
issues of importance. You can develop a
different relationship at the football.
I’ve found it a useful relaxer.”
Crean counts Hawke as a good
friend but their relationship has been
suspended by the realities of political

office. Crean finds Hawke at his best
when they are alone and relaxed but
finding the Prime Minister in a relaxed
mood has become a rarity.
“Bob’s a very strong-willed person.
He has strong views and is prepared to
listen to strong arguments. He tries to
cast his relationships in important areas
so that he’s not wasting time. But some-
times you can be lucky and strike him
on a night when he just wants to talk
about nothing.”
Extreme stress, difficulties and frus-
trations often have made Crean think of
throwing in his job. There’s the tempta-
tion of working overseas with the Inter-
national Labor Organisation or another
trade union centre.
“I think everyone gets to that stage.
You wake up and think, ‘Why am I still
doing it?’ But I don’t have the economic
security just to say, ‘Well, I’ll see you all
later.’ It’s not like Brideshead Revisited,
sipping Moet on the banks of the river.
You don’t just head off to the country
mansion.”
Crean does not expect the next 12
months to be one continuous picnic,
either. The major tasks he is setting for
himself this year are convincing the
union movement of the need and ben-
efits of a restructured taxation system
and introducing a national superannu-
ation scheme with the fruits of next
year’s productivity case. Both are im-
portant for the stability of the prices and
incomes accord.
Hawke recently announced the pro-
gram of tax reforms and restructuring
which his government would undertake
in a second term in office. According to
his outline, the plan is for a far greater
mix of taxes than exists now. This is an
approach with which Crean agrees, al-
though it is not ACTU policy.
“To the extent that we are committed
to reforms through the Economic Plan-
ning Advisory Council, I think we are
obliged to have a look at issues like the
broad mix of tax. We are faced with the
very real problem that, if you rely on
income tax, you have to assume that it’s
progressive and that all income tax is
caught. Now, all income tax isn’t
caught. The basis for (defining) income
is not wide enough.
“If you’re going to rely on income
tax, you have to come to grips with the
political difficulties of identifying in-
come taken in other forms like capital
gains, superannuation, cars and other
parts of salary packages. Dad tried to
introduce that and he created all the flak
in the world.
“The second thing we have to face up
to realistically is how progressive and
equitable the tax system is. A majority
of people are now on a tax rate of 46
cents in the dollar. Wage-earners on av-
erage weekly earnings are paying that
rate. That’s not equitable,” Crean said.
Simon Crean, right, pictured in 1981 with Bill Kelty and ACTU advocate Jan Marsh
He is encouraged by what he de-
scribed as the “very genuine and im-
portant concession” of the employer
representatives on the Business Council
in “flagging a preparedness to embrace
capital gains taxes in the context of a
restructured system.”
He is adamant that changes to the
system will be accepted only if devel-
oped as a package in which the benefits
of change are obvious: “There’s no
point putting a position in the trade
union movement that just says we
should move away from income taxes to
consumption taxes; you will lose that
argument in isolation. But what you
won’t lose, in my view, is a proposal for
a total tax restructuring in which you
make tax schedules more progressive by
coming to grips with the 46 cents in the
dollar people, dropping them down sig-
nificantly, basing your source of reven-
ue on a range of non-basic items and
toughening penalties for tax avoiders to
make the system more equitable for
those who can’t avoid income tax.
“In a complete restructure, you
could even introduce the concept of a
negative income tax where people on
the lowest incomes are actually paid.”
As well as coming to terms with a
new tax system, unionists also may have
to come to terms with a discounted con-
sumer price index measure for the pur-
poses of wage indexation to take ac-
count of increases in indirect taxes.
Crean says he is ready to grapple with
that contentious issue. “If we move to
an indirect tax mix, then we also have to
come to grips with that not being
counted in the CPI. That’s difficult be-
cause, if we make concessions in one
area, then it will be said, ‘Well, why not
state charges and so on as well?’ ” How-
ever, said Crean, provided “the base
position from which we start is under-
stood,” the appropriate concession
could be made that is, accepting for
wage purposes an underlying rate of
CPI increases which excluded indirect
taxes.
This contradicts a comment by
ACTU president Dolan last week that
the union movement would not accept
less than full compensation for the infla-
tionary effects of any new consumption
taxes.
Crean does not foresee any major
problems in holding the accord together
between now and next year’s productiv-
ity case. However, he said, an underly-
ing long-term problem was ensuring
people’s involvement “further down the
line” than ACTU level and especially at
the state branch level.
“If people are not involved, they get
out of touch and start thinking, ‘We
might as well go and start a bushfire
somewhere’.”
Important elements of this were the
manufacturing councils, the Economic
Planning Advisory Council and the Ad-
visory Committee on Prices and In-
comes. The ACTU has asked the gov-

performance of
your banker be
as impressive
as the view
from his office?
When choosing a bank for their
international business and corporate
finance needs, some Australian
businessmen unfortunately subscribe
to the view “foreign is better”.
Yet overseas, one Australian
bank is acknowledged as a master in
the international money arena.
That bank is the ANZ.
ANZ has long been Australia’s
most active bank internationally, with
an extensive network of offices
covering all the International Financial
Centres throughout the world.
The ANZ is ideally poised to
assist Australian businesses with their
particular domestic and international
finance requirements.
Among the facilities we
can provide are foreign currency loans,
term loans, overdrafts, commercial
bills, leasing plus a full range of foreign
exchange and trade finance services.
Through the Capital Markets
Group we can also arrange specialised
facilities such as access to inter-
national and domestic capital markets,
project finance and big ticket leasing.
Best of all, we have some of the
finest banking brains in the world on
our staff and they’re at your beck and
call. They speak the same language
as you do.
And we believe they understand
Australian international and domestic
business problems and opportunities
far better than any foreign banker.

ernment to establish two new panels
one for the banking and finance indus-

for greater rank-and-file union involve-
ment in the accord through the develop-
ment of superannuation packages next
year on an industry-by-industry or com-
pany-by-company basis and through es-
tablishment of the occupational health
and safety structure.
According to Crean, the ACTU in-
volvement in the government’s taxation
sub-committee in the lead up to this
year’s budget was risky for the govern-
ment but essential for the union move-
ment’s faith in the accord the tax cuts
that eventuated represented the benefits
of the accord in the most tangible way.
The other key area, according to
Crean, is industry policy. He agrees
with the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry
and Shipwrights Union that the struc-
ture for industry policy has not been set
in place quickly enough. And, although
he sees some “dicey analysis” in the
AMFSU’s new policy document for cre-
ating jobs in the metal industry, he be-
lieves that the union has made a signifi-
cant step forward by coming to terms
with a need to review that protection
system and the need to restructure in-
dustry.
For its part, the ACTU will be satis-
fied if the government has set down a
definite direction for industry policy 12
months.hence. But, if the government
continues to baulk at this important
facet of the accord, a major brawl can
be expected at the ACTU congress next
September.
You can be certain that Simon Crean
will be working hard behind the scenes
in the next 12 months to prevent that
happening. □
VICTORIA
The moving
story of
a grand folly
By SUSAN MOLLOY
ITS HISTORY reads like a comedy
script while its future is as bland as the
sub-city wasteland in which it is
plonked. Melbourne’s Yellow Peril
sculpture must have its place in history
as one of the great follies of this century.
And all for almost SIOO,OOO.
The 30-tonne, bright yellow, geo-
metric arrangement of slabs of steel
which caused so much consternation for
so long now sits characterless in a for-
lorn park by the Yarra. Seagulls and tall
triffid-like fluorescent lights keep it
company.
Batman Park is not one of Mel-
bourne’s more gracious parks but there
are plans to upgrade it. Trains thunder
across a nearby bridge and the traffic
below chokes its way down Spencer
Street into the dead end of the city. The
Yellow Peril has a view of a large Coca-
Cola sign, traffic and factories. Behind it
looms the World Trade Centre. No sign
commemorates what this giant cubby
house may be. Graffiti are constantly be-
ing scrubbed off it.
It’s a dull ending to a once contro-
versial and often amusing saga. But the
ironies live on: Without a whisper of
fear or loathing, the Victorian Arts
Centre’s grounds now sport two med-
leys of looming shapes which are
known as sculptures. One of them is
titled Forward Surge and cost $90,000
$20,000 more than the banished Yellow
Peril-.
Meanwhile, the second Australian
Sculpture triennial is being set up as a
major arts event comparable to Syd-
ney’s biennale, and Ron Robertson-
Swann, the creator of the Yellow Peril,
has been asked to re-visit Melbourne
and take walking tours around the city’s
sculptures. He will speak on the Yellow
Peril and escort tours down to Batman
Park during the November-January tri-
ennial.
These were the events which held
Melbourne artistically captive for so
many years:
■ December 11, 1978: Sydney-based
Robertson-Swann wins a competition to
design a sculpture for the City Square
and the $70,000 sculpture is approved
by the Melbourne City Council. A
councillor, Don Osborne, describes it as
“a piece of leftover farm machinery, the
size of a London bus.”
■ February 28, 1979: the then Lord
Mayor, Irvin Rockman, defends it as
“bold, innovative.”
■ May 1, 1980: The sculpture is as-
sembled in the City Square. Vandals
soon daub “jobs now” on 12 of the 14
geometric faces. The graffiti are
scrubbed off.
■ May 28, 1980: The square is
opened by the Queen.
■ June 17, 1980: Osborne is emphatic
that the sculpture must go.
■ July 1980: Newspapers conduct
street polls asking people whether coun-
cil should spend $20,000 to unbolt the
work from its moorings in the City
Square and move it elsewhere. Most
people say it is an abomination and
should go. Osborne dubs it the Yellow
Peril. Ron Barassi says it is too big. Bert
Newton says it is a “monstrosity.” The


then- p ?emier, Dick Hamer, says he does
not think it’s very good.
■ July 28, 1980: The council votes the
sculpture “unsuitable” for the $24-mil-
lion City Square and decides it should
be moved to Royal Park. Newspapers
carry editorials on the sculpture.
Robertson-Swann blames “vindictive
old men” on the council for the demise
of his sculpture. It is as yet unnamed,
with Robertson-Swann saying he some-
times calls it The Thing. The National
Gallery of Victoria, the Colac Council
and the St Albans Progress Association
all say they want it.
■ August 7, 1980: About
500 “Save our Sculpture”
demonstrators gather in the
City Square. Among them are
politician Barry Jones, com-
edian David Argue and
Rockman.
■ August 18, 1980: Robert-
son-Swann fails to announce
the name of his sculpture after
promising he would give it
thought. “I had a very bad
weekend,” he says.
■ September 2, 1980: The
sculpture will go to the new
Batman Park. Unions say they
may ban its removal.
h March 24, 1981: Council
approves the Wantirna Art
Studios as removalists, at a
cost of $29,500. The sculpture
suddenly has a name Vault.
Builders’ Laborers’ Feder-
ation says it will ban the re-
moval.
■ June 4, 1981: Robertson-
Swann says the Batman Park
site is “a horror.”
■ June 7, 1981: Norm Gal-
lagher and the BLF apply a
black ban.
■ July 13, 1981, 3 am:
Vault is removed to Batman
Park. Gallagher vows to make
the issue into another Omega fracas. He
speaks with the National Gallery of Vic-
toria, which says it cannot buy Vault as
it is “too heavy.” Robertson-Swann sees
his work as a “tattered banner,” sinking
into the mud of a newly-created park.
Cars are parked under the 5.5 metre-
high steel slabs.
Robertson-Swann’s next commis-
sioned work was for the Devonport City
Council. He created a box-shaped steel
frame for the Devonport mall but it was
relegated to a beach-side park. In
October 1982 he was a member of the
Australian National University Art Ad-
visory committee which bought for
$3OOO a sculpture to adorn the campus
near Chifley Library. Students and tu-
tors protested in a Rally Against The
Thing and set up an Anti-Thing Action
Committee as well as a Society for Pre-
vention of Aesthetic Mishaps.
Robertson-Swann is now the Head
of Sculpture at the Canberra School of
Art. His next commissioned work will
be for the Queensland Cultural Centre
in Brisbane and he envisages no prob-
lems with this. Backlashes, he says, have
only come when he has worked for mu-
nicipal bodies.
But he still feels strongly about his
Vault. “I am a rotten loser,” he says. “I
still smart a little over it. I can take
things that happen to me fairly well but
my wife and child and my sculpture I
tend to get upset about. It was such a
Ron Robertson-Swann: “I am a rotten loser”
tawdry business. Philistinism won the
day.
“Batman Park really is such a dead
part of town. The sculpture was meant
for human contact, to be viewed on a
very human level, not from a train two
storeys up. And you take your life into
your hands crossing that road to the
park. I hope none of the ladies on the
sculpture triennial walking tour get run
over.”
The director of the National Gallery
of Victoria, Patrick McCaughey, says it
is a “terrific sculpture” but it should stay
where it is.
So now and in the future the Yellow
Peril, The Thing or Vault has a home
near the thundering train bridge. No
plaque points out to the unknowing
visitor to Melbourne what it could be.
And Robertson-Swann has learnt never
to paint his sculptures bright yellow. □
MIGRATION
Study challenges
some strongly held
preconceptions
By ANTHONY HILL
THE KEY finding of a study of the
economics of immigration is likely to
run counter to many people’s precon-
ceptions particularly the view that mi-
gration has to be reduced during re-
cession.
The study is an attempt at a rational
assessment of the benefits, or otherwise,
of immigration. Because it will chal-
lenge long and widely-held views it is
unlikely to take much heat out of the
argument over immigration policy.
The study, by the Committee for
Economic Development of Australia,
was commissioned about three years
ago by then Immigration Minister lan
Macphee. The project director ap-
pointed was Dr Neville Norman, senior
lecturer in economics at Melbourne
University.
Speaking at a migration workshop in
Canberra recently, Norman said the
early results showed that, overall, immi-
gration continued to have a favorable
economic impact on Australia though
the net benefit might be somewhat less
than during the 19505.
He said: ... “We are yet to unearth
or confirm any valid economic argu-
ment for limiting or further restricting
immigration to Australia, even in times
of substantial unemployment.”
Norman sought to allay the tra-
ditional “trade union mythology that in-
creased levels of immigration during
periods of high unemployment lead in-
evitably to greater job losses.”
Such fears he said, were generally
unnecessary, for the following two
reasons:
■ The burden of unemployment fell
mainly on migrant households them-
selves, especially those from non-
English speaking countries.
■ Both household income and the
consumption ratio were higher than av-
erage among migrants for the first seven
years after arrival and the demand gen-
eration for goods and services was in-
adequately appreciated “as a positive
job-creation influence.”
Unemployment rates among migrant
workers are certainly higher than they
are for Australian-born participants in
the labor force.
At July of this year, unemployment
among the Australian-born was 7.9 per-
cent, compared with 9.8 percent for the
overseas born.

grants are in Australia so the unemploy-
ment rate drops to a level comparable
with the national average.
These are the figures at July, 1984,
when the national unemployment rate
stood at 8.4 percent.
Migrants who arrived Unemployment rate
Before 1971 8.1
1971-75 10.3
1976-80 11.8
1981-82 11.7
In other words, there is a fairly rapid
absorption of migrants into the
workforce after an initial period of high
unemployment.
It is on this basis that the study’s pre-
liminary findings argue that the burden
of transient unemployment falls on
non-English speaking households and
suggest that trade unions have no justifi-
cation for seeing continued migration as
a threat.
But the figures do not take account of
unemployment rates within different
sectors of the job market a point that
Dr Bob Birrell, who is senior lecturer in
sociology at Melbourne’s Monash Uni-
versity, uses to question the thrust of
Norman’s paper.
Traditionally, migrants have been
concentrated in the tradesmen-labor-
ing-manufacturing industries the very
areas where the process of structural
change is leading to massive loss of
jobs.
Moreover, the emphasis on the fam-
ily reunion or refugee programs is to
bring in migrants who are either less
skilled or whose skills are not recog-
nised in Australia.
Says Birrell: “Half the jobs created
have been in the public administration
or community services areas, where
non-English-speaking migrants are not
in the race for jobs. They are forced to
compete in the most over-crowded
labor market with other established mi-
grants.”
Birrell also questions the view that
increased demand and consumption
patterns among migrants, at least during
the first seven years of settlement, have
a significant impact on creating more
employment.
The cost to the community of provi-
ding the social infrastructure flowing
from higher migration is one of the
more interesting aspects of the prelimi-
nary findings, outlined in the Norman
paper.
Basically, the studies show that the
higher the net migration intake is, the
lower the per capita cost to the taxpayer
of providing health and welfare services
although there is a slight increase in
education costs.
The main reason is that migration
tends to lower the average age of the
population. This not only increases the
proportion of workers (and thus tax-
payers) but also reduces the relative
burden of spending on services for the
elderly.
The study looked at five migration
scenarios, starting with zero net migra-
tion and rising in multiples of 50,000 to
200,000 over a 20-year period ending in
2001.
According to Norman, government
outlays at constant prices for social se-
curity, health, education and employ-
ment for each employed person would
rise from $2305 at June, 1981, to $3255
and $3221 under the zero and 50,000
scenarios over the period.
But they would fall, under the higher
rates of migrant intake, to $3lBO, $3087
and $3029 respectively.
He says: “This ‘tax cost’ of govern-
ment expenditures, per employed
worker, is over 4 percent lower with
150,000 a year than it is with the 50,000
scenario. This saving may be judged
relatively small but there can be no ar-
gument that some saving is involved.”
The reverse, however, is true with

education expenditures as might be
expected with a somewhat younger
population.
The economic consequences of in-
creased or at any rate sustained immi-
gration will have an impact beyond
these key areas of government expendi-
ture ... not least on Australian cities.
From the present population of 15.3
million people, the study has estimated
the effects on population growth of each
of its five net migration scenarios to the
year 2001.
NET MIGRATION POPULATION BY 2001
(’000) (MILLION)
Zero 17.1
50 18.3
100 19.4
150 20.6
200 21.8
Unless there is a substantial up-
grading in the development of regional
growth centres, the burden of this pro-
jected population increase will fall on
metropolitan capitals.
Using net migration of 75,000 as a
yardstick, Birrell estimates that by 2001
Sydney’s population will have increased
by 600,000, Melbourne and Brisbane
each by 450,000 and Perth by about
400,000.
“These are major increases,” he says,
“and they will happen at a time when
most of the cities are having problems
dealing with expansion.”
Birrell would like to see the net mi-
gration intake cut back to 50-60,000 a
year, a figure he considers “pretty
generous.” In fact, this is roughly in line
with what has been happening. While
the migrant intake this financial year
has been set at 74,000, account has to be
taken of migrant outflows.
The problem with discussing immi-
gration, of course, is that the economic
factors cannot be looked at in isolation
from other, intangible, advantages.
As Professor Reg Appleyard, of the
University of Western Australia, puts it,
nobody can doubt the immense contri-
bution made by the migrants of the
post-war period to Australia’s political,
cultural and social life the diversity
and richness that by its very nature is
difficult to quantify.
And while it is true that immigrants
from southern and northern Europe en-
countered hostility from the native
born, it was essentially transitory.
The same thing, Appleyard believes,
will happen with contemporary Asian
migrants. They are, he says, like a “gin-
ger group,” who will bring many en-
trepreneurial skills to the country.
“They do not let opportunities go
by,” he says.
It’s a point taken up by Ainsley
Jolley, of the Victorian Chamber of
Manufactures. Of all the sales of small
and medium-sized manufacturing
businesses negotiated by the chamber,
about half are to migrants from Hong
Kong or South-East Asia or to North-
ern Europeans, especially Germans. □

PUBLIC OPINION
Majority favor
simultaneous
elections
IF THE referendums on simultaneous
elections and the transfer of powers be-
tween the Commonwealth and the states
had been held in September, both
would have been passed.
These findings came from an Austra-
lia-wide Morgan Gallup Poll of 1952
electors last September. They were told
that at the next federal election there
would be two referendums and were
then asked:
“The first is on whether elections for


the House of Representatives and the
Senate should be held at the same time.
At the referendum on holding elections
for the House of Representatives and
the Senate at the same time, will you
probably vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’?”
“The second would allow the Com-
monwealth and the states to transfer
powers between each other, if they both
agreed. At the referendum on the Com-
monwealth and the states transferring
powers, will you probably vote ‘Yes’ or
‘No’?”
Eighty percent (an increase of 1 per-
cent since June, 1984) of electors said
they would have probably voted “Yes”
at the referendum on simultaneous elec-
tions for the Federal House of Repre-
sentatives and Senate.
Twelve percent (up 1 percent) said
they would probably have voted “No”
and 8 percent (down 2 percent) were un-
decided.
The following table shows that 85
percent (up 3 percent) of ALP voters
would have probably voted “Yes,” com-
pared with 76 percent (down 1 percent)
of L-NP voters.

CYCLING
Cycling around
Australia in
80 days plan
Willy Bechmann (left) and Jorgen Emil Hansen: driven by the Mt Everest syndrome
By CHARLES STOKES
A TEAM of eight Australian and
Danish veterans is to tackle the seem-
ingly impossible task of bicycling
around Australia in 80 days. Wealthy
Danish businessman and former cycling
champion Willy Bechmann is in Austra-
lia to make arrangements for the ride, to
start next July 14.
Their planned starting point has
been Brisbane but Bechmann is con-
sidering, instead, setting off from and
returning to - Sydney, with perhaps a
champagne send-off at the Opera
House.
Bechmann and former Olympic
Games cycling bronze medallist Jorgen
Emil Hansen will comprise half the
Danish contingent. They are on a test
run from Mount Isa to Darwin. The
crew of their support car includes
Bechmann’s wife, Lis, and general sec-
retary of the tour organisation lb Vagn
Hansen, who also was a top cyclist.
Hansen trained Bechmann in his early
days and was a judge at this year’s
Olympics.
The rest of the Danish team has not
yet been chosen and selection of the
four locals to take part will be largely in
the hands of the Australian Amateur
Cycling Federation.
Bechmann runs a complex, La Santa
Sport, in Tinajo, on the beautiful vol-
canic island of Lanzarote in the Canary
Islands, where some European athletes
trained in climatic conditions similar to
those of the United States West Coast
before setting off for Los Angeles this
year.
He has harbored the bold idea of
cycling around Australia in 80 days
since 1979, driven mainly by the climb-
ing-Mount Everest-syndrome “It’s
never been done.”
Apart from wanting to accept the
challenge and “to realise a dream,”
Bechmann seems fascinated by the
effect the test will have physiologic-
ally and psychologically “under ex

treme conditions.” Accordingly, they
are to be followed throughout their
14,446 km journey (70 stages, 10 rest
days) by cars carrying a doctor, a physi-
ologist, masseurs, mechanics and two
Danish film crews.
The trip would also enable testing
under the most rigorous conditions,
various bicycle components, sportswear
and what Bechmann calls “energy prod-
ucts” (including drinks and experimen-
tal foods for long-distance cyclists).
Bechmann, 54 and robustly fit, com-
pared the round-Australia ride to the
Tour de France but said it would be far
more of a challenge. “This is not a tour
for 18-year-old Olympic cyclists,” he
said. “It’s for mature men. No one has
ever tried anything like this before.”
The planned route from Sydney to
Brisbane is through Coffs Harbour and
Ballina. The cyclists are to go through
Gympie, Mackay, Townsville, Julia
Creek, Camooweal, Katherine and Pine
Creek to Darwin. They would cross the
north-west of Western Australia via
Kununurra and Port Hedland to Perth
and continue through Bunbury, Esper-
ance, Cocklebiddy, Ceduna and Port
Pirie to Adelaide. Then the route leads
to Mount Gambier and on to Mel-
bourne via Warrnambool. They plan to
go to Sale and Bega, on to Canberra
and back to Sydney through Goulburn.
“I expect we’ll be on sealed roads for
more than 92 percent of the trip,”
Bechmann said, “but we’ll bring more
than one kind of bike professional for
the good roads, a tougher bike for the
rough roads.”
He has been making arrangements
with the co-operation of the Australian
embassy in Copenhagen.
“We will make Australia known out-
side Australia,” said Bechmann an
opportunity not lost on state tourism
authorities who have offered help to
promote and publicise the event.
By October 1 next year, millions of
European television viewers would
have seen parts of Australia they never
dreamed existed. They also would have
had the chance to try to get their
tongues around names such as
Cloncurry, Willeroo, Nanutarra,
Minilya, Jerramuncup and Billabong
not to mention Cocklebiddy. □
FISHING
Tuna men -a ‘raw deal’ for survival
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
“IT’S LIKE playing rugby all day: The
first 10 minutes is exciting; the next 10
kills you and, for the next few hours,
you just go numb.” This is Joe Puglisi’s
description of poling, the backbreaking
task of hooking on to 20kg or more of
vibrating tuna muscle and hoisting it
on to the deck of a boat.
Puglisi, like other tuna
fishermen, has damaged discs
in his back a legacy of
younger days as a poler. At 47
years of age, he poles no
more. He says resolutely that,
if he has anything to do with
it, neither of his sons will find
themselves on the end of a 3m
pole.
Puglisi is one of a colony
of fishermen on South Austra-
lia’s Eyre Peninsula who are
busy fine-tuning their boats
for the start of the tuna hunt
which begins next month.
Some of the South Australians
will join NSW fishermen off
Eden and other southern
ports of that state in search of
prize specimens of southern
bluefin tuna, the predominant
species weighing in at more
than 50kg. This is where the
older, bigger fish appear.
After that season, the boats
will steam south for smaller
prey in the waters of the Great
Australian Bight, in Port
Lincoln’s backyard. A salt
with more than 25 year’s ex-
perience fishing out of Port
Lincoln, Puglisi says that the
Bight has become the final resting-place
for some 20 fishermen since he began
pursuing the catch.
This year, the crews face more than
tempest and the elusiveness of the big
fish. Stringent government quotas have
been imposed” to protect stocks of the
southern bluefin, depleted through

years of overfishing. Puglisi says: “We
accept the government’s efforts to try
and stabilise the industry but we are up-
set about the fact they didn’t place mini-
mum size limits on the catch.” He and
others from Port Lincoln would have
preferred size limits to check the high
catch of smaller bluefin, mainly by West
Australians. The westerners
answer that the South Austra-
lians, with two-thirds of the
annual bluefin catch, take just
as many fish under the skg
mark as they do. Head of the
WA branch of the Australian
Fishing Council, Graham
Stewart, says the larger fish
caught by South Australians
lift the average size of the SA
haul.
Port Lincoln’s fishermen
say that quotas to be slapped
on individual boats will make
some million-dollar vessels re-
dundant and will claim the
jobs of many of the 500
people who have worked the
boats around Australia.
The total quota of 14,500
tonnes compares with last sea-
son’s Australian catch of
around 15,000 tonnes a
poor season and an average
of 18,000 over the past three
years.
Port Lincoln’s most
famous resident and fisher-
man, Dean Lukin, his Los
Angeles Olympic weightlift-
ing triumphs behind him,

Polling in the tuna: quotas are taking the edge off the business
ROWAN FOTHERINGHAM
year when he swaps barbell for tuna
pole. On the prospect of quotas, Lukin
says: “Well, there’s no point in grizzling
about it; that’s the way it is now.”
His family is one of those of
Yugoslav extraction which dominate
the Port Lincoln industry.
A conservatively-estimated $4O mil-
lion is invested in Port Lincoln in boats,
fishing equipment, on-shore refriger-
ation and the planes that spot the prey.
Lukin’s father, Dinko, says the
quotas will mean the family business
will have to sell three poling boats
which should bring around $250,000
each. Such a sale would leave the
Lukins with two boats one both a
poler and processor of fish and the other
a purse seiner, a vessel that lays a long
net around the tuna to get them in a
purse-type trap. The Lukins also have a
couple of spotter planes.
The quotas have forced fishermen to
look for ways of at least maintaining
their incomes on lower hauls. The god-
send is the sashimi market.
Sashimi is the raw fish delicacy
sought eagerly for Japanese eating.
While tuna supplied to canneries can
fetch around 80 cents to $1 a kg in the
marketplace, tuna for sashimi can bring
an average of three and four times that
price. Prices as high as $5O a kg are
known on the Tokyo market, which
means $5OOO for a 100 kg fish.
It is, however, the exception rather
than the rule.
Fishermen operating out of
Ulladulla and Eden can have their catch
on the Tokyo market within 36 hours by
putting it on ice in crates and flying it
directly from Sydney to Japan. But
from South Australia, without access to
direct flights, they have to freeze their
fish at sea. It is normally shipped to
Japan.
What will stop many fishermen from
reaping the full benefits of sashimi
prices is the high cost of buying on-
board freezing equipment a million-
dollar investment. Most will choose to
transfer their fish to sashimi processors
at sea.
Dinko Lukin has been a pioneer in
the sashimi area. He began supplying
the Japanese market seven years ago.
Last year, he ploughed capital into a
sashimi cold store in Port Lincoln. Be-
cause of the quotas, however, he says it
will be operating well below capacity.
Whether it ends up on a Japanese
plate or in a can, tuna must first be
caught through expensive technology
coupled with traditional backbreaking
strain.
Echo-sounders, radar, planes and the
fish “spotter” who peers through bin-
oculars in the crow’s-nest atop the mast
all help in locating a school of surface-
feeding fish.
Once a poling vessel reaches a
school, the task is to excite them. A
“chummer” on a platform above the
deck ejects live bait over the heads of
the polers. With jets of water sprayed
over the water on either side of the boat,
the bait usually has the desired effect of
“chumming” the voracious tuna into a
wild feeding cycle.
Tuna will accept just about anything
thrown at them when they are “on.”
They find the feathered, barbless hooks
of the polers irresistible.
Fishermen have their own industry
to blame for the quotas. Relentless har-
vesting of the bluefin by local and
Japanese fishermen has
slashed the spawning stock
what scientists call the parent-
al biomass from some
590,000 tonnes in 1960 to
about 220,000. The local
quotas came after talks be-
tween Australian, Japanese
and New Zealand fisheries,
extensive research on stock
numbers by the CSIRO and
an Industries Assistance
Commission report on the
bluefin.
The CSIRO estimates that
a catch of 33,000 tonnes a year
by all three countries would
not reduce stock levels. Last
year, in addition to the locals’
15,000 tonnes, the Japanese
took an estimated 16,000 to
17,000 tonnes and New
Zealanders around 1000.
The year before, Austra-
lians took a record 21,000 and
the Japanese about 17,000.
The Japanese have reduced
their catch dramatically over
the past 10 years but have resisted
quotas being imposed on their boats
outside the 200-nautical mile Australian
Fishing Zone. There will be increasing
pressure for the Japanese government to
act on this.
The beleaguered southern bluefin is
hunted for most of its migratory life.
Spawning north-west of Australia in the
Java Sea, the tuna swim south along the
West Australian coastline and then fol-
low the coast across the Bight, go
around the bottom of Tasmania and up
the NSW coast. Meeting warmer water
around Port Macquarie, the fish head
back south. (On the way down the West
Australian coast, however, some have
turned right and headed for South Af-
rica and are found as far west as the
Cape of Good Hope.)
The Lukins and other Port Lincoln
boats will start their season this year off
NSW, searching for the larger fish more
suitable for sashimi. The tuna are usual-
ly more than five years old by the time
they arrive in NSW waters, ensuring an
average catch of over 20 kg. But their
numbers have been depleted by West
Australians who have first shot at the
younger fish, and then by fisherman in
South Australian waters.
The small average size of the fish
taken by Western Australia’s 90-odd
boats has been a concern of the eastern
fishermen. Most of the West Australian
boats are half the size of their eastern
counterparts and not capable of going
far to sea.
The bulk of the west’s catch of some
4000 tonnes last year consisted of fish
around and below 5 kg. A size limit of
3.5 kg was imposed during the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry’s interim

management plan. The South Austra-
lian catch also was kept to a size limit:
7.5 kg.
The department has elected to drop
the limits for the coming season. It says
that the system was ineffective: under-
sized fish caught and thrown back
usually died anyway.
Under the new management plan,
the only restrictions on West Australian
fishermen will be the individual quotas
and seasonal closures of some areas off
their southern coast.
A disillusioned Dinko Lukin says:
“The government has gone to a lot of
trouble in terms of time and money
to introduce a system that will make a
lot of people suffer.”
He says many West Australian boats
with small quotas will quit the industry
and sell their quotas. Otherwise, they
would have to spend heavily on bigger
and better equipment to stay viable. The
department acknowledges that West
Australian boats will be first out.
Meanwhile, local fishermen are
learning about sashimi. The Japanese
rate on the size of the fish, where, when
and how it was caught, the method of
freezing and how carefully it is pre-
pared. Color, texture and fat content of
the flesh also are all factors in determin-
ing price.
Catching on poles or in a purse-
seining net may bruise the tuna and cut
the price. The Lukins have exper-
imented with air beds to help break a
fish’s fall and cushion it as it thrashes
about, haemorrhaging on the deck.
Long-lining, used mainly by the
Japanese, where a boat releases a cable
up to 130 km long with up to 10,000
hooks attached at intervals, is likely to
become more popular among Austra-
lians. The method catches the bigger,
deeper-swimming tuna and generally
results in minimal damage to the fish.
Refrigeration for sashimi has been a
major problem for local boat-owners.
Sashimi must be gilled, gutted and fro-
zen to minus 60 degrees Celsius within
hours of the catch and then stored at
that temperature. Only the Lukins and a
few others with experimental boats had
freezing facilities on board last year. To
fill the gap, the Japanese trading com-
pany Marubeni engaged two Japanese
and one New Zealand refriger-
ation/processing vessel to follow the
fleet from Eden and across the Bight.
Fishermen using the motherships re-
ceive a better price than they would get
from a cannery but much less than if
they processed the tuna themselves.
Dinko Lukin and another sashimi
specialist, Australian Southern Bluefin
Exporters in which Puglisi is a part-
ner also brought processing vessels
out from Japan for the season. This
year, the Japanese will again largely be
showing the Australians the way. □

‘Nifty’
Edited by c ßfnSaw
So far, the saga of Dorothy Stratten, the
Playboy centrefold who was murdered
by her estranged husband, has been told
three times: in Star 80, by producer Bob
Fosse, in NBC’s Death of a Centrefold
and in The Killing of a Unicorn: Dorothy
Stratten 1960-1980, the recent book by
Peter Bogdanovich. Now Playboy mogul
Hugh Hefner wants his turn. He charges
that the others “had nothing to do with
what Dorothy was really like,” is to do a
documentary on the crime for pay-TV.
It will feature previously-unreleased
footage of Stratten and, says Hefner,
“refute Bogdanovich’s claim that
Dorothy hated posing in the nude.”
In March, Leonie Weldon the second
daughter of Sydney publisher Kevin
Weldon will be married on Goat
Island, in Sydney Harbor (Port Jackson
to the pedants). The Weldon family has
for a long, long time been big on Goat
Island, so ... for the Something Old the
bride will have and be married beneath
a magnificent Port Jackson fig which
her great-great-grandfather planted at
the western Balmain tip of the island.
Something New? The island itself: until
only about a century ago it was known
as Cockatoo Island.
Nat Shapiro, who has edited a number
of books, mostly about popular music,
has just edited one published in the
US by Messrs Simon and Schuster
titled Whatever it is, I’m Against It. It is
not the biography of some famous Irish-
man but “a distillation of venom from
the pens of great misanthropes.” For in-
stances, Gore Vidal said in 1973: “Every
time a friend succeeds, I die a little.” Sir
Thomas Beecham, describing the sound
of a harpsichord: “Two skeletons
copulating on a galvanised tin roof.”
Ronald Reagan: “A hippie is someone
who looks like Tarzan, walks like Jane
and smells like Cheetah.” William
Faulkner is alleged to have said: “Henry
James was one of the nicest old ladies I
ever met.” Oscar Wilde: “Bernard Shaw
has no enemies but is intensely disliked
by his friends.”
And still it is bruited about that Morgan
Ryan, the Sydney solicitor, gave NSW
Premier Neville Wran the nickname of
“Nifty”. Well ... Nifty Neville is about
as unusual as Chalky White, Dusty
Miller, Jimmy James or Ding Dong
Bell. Distinguished Niftys have inclu-
ded Neville Sellwood, the great jockey,
Neville Whitmarsh, the News Ltd crum-
pet photographer and, for all we know
Neville “Peace in our time” Chamber-
lain.
For reasons possibly to do with names
such as Lawson, Paterson, Mackellar
and Wright, The Bulletin has always
encouraged Australian poetry; not only
its writing but its recitation, which
makes a refreshing change from Mort
d'Arthur, The Canterbury Tales and The
Valley of Dry Bones from the Book of
Ezekiel. In the City of Sydney Eistedd-
fod there are Bulletin awards for verse-
speaking by children 16 and under and
17 and over. This year the winning 16s
were Louise Fuller (Wamberal), Patrina
Lee Sheldon (Castlecrag) and Chris-
topher Henville (Longueville). The
oldies were Jennifer-Lynne Ebrill (of
Strathfield) and Roslyn Frances Jamison
(Birmingham Gardens). The literary
possibilities of the Jamison girl are that
one day journalists may have just as
much trouble spelling her name as they
had with that of Katharine Susannah
Prichard.
Philosophers may only sing of the
troubles of a king or a queen or their
relatives but a philosopher or pretty
well anybody can wail piteously over
the financial struggles of the royals or
relatives who, for arcane reasons, don’t
get on the free list. Earl Spencer, who is
the father of the Princess of Wales, is so
hard-up that he is having a sale of an-
tiques and jewellery at Althorp, his un-
comfortable family seat. But things are
moving along nicely for Princess
Michael of Kent, who used to be a
Double Bay girl named Marie-Christine
von Riebnitz. She may share in a $l5O
million inheritance dating from Franz
Josef of Austria at the turn of the cen-
tury. It will help: the Kents are not paid
from the public puse, must pig it on
$30,000 he earns as a company director.
They do, though, have a grace-and-
favor apartment in Kensington Palace.
Bob Hawke, Andrew Peacock, Neville
Wran, Lionel Murphy ... in matters of
hair, hues or hooters either they’re sensi-
tive or the more pusillanimous public
servants are sensitive for them. But
that’s nothing new. In the 1950 s Marina
Shaw, the distinguished painter and
sculptor whose collection is now to be
sold (most of it going to the Australian
National Gallery and the Art Gallery of
WA), designed a new Australian stamp
based on the great black palm cockatoo.
Her entry, one of 663, won 50 pounds
a pretty big deal in awards for art in
those days. But the stamp never felt a
tongue: Shaw was told, sub rosa, that
those frightful fowl had the imperti-
nence to look too much like Arthur
Augustus “Cocky” Calwell.


The Queen’s Scribe, Donald Jackson is a
dab hand at all those Gothic loops and
whorls seen on royal proclamations.
But sometimes all those wherefors and
herebys induce, even in the maestro, a
state of droopy somnolence in which
the old goose quill tends to wander.
Jackson, who is just completing a highly
successful Australian tour for the Crafts
Council, admits to having made a mis-
take in writing the royal consent for the
marriage of Lady Di and Chiller. And
when you’re writing, as he does, with
100-year-old carbon-based ink on fine
velum, it’s not just a matter of a quick
rub-out. He had to do the whole thing
again. An American once suggested the
Queen could have saved him appalling
trouble if she’d simply scribbled a note:
“It’s OK, Chuck! signed Mom.”

For years it was believed that true
craftsmanship began and ended in Brit-
ain. Then it was the United States, then
Japan. Then, in tune with the new na-
tionalism, it was realised and it came
almost as a blow to the traditionalists
that Australians had craftsmen of their
own and pretty good ones at that. One
of the results: the Australian Heritage
Commission has made a 68-minute
color film, Artisans of Australia, about
people such as George Proudman, a
stonemason, Jack Thomas, a moulder
and iron craftsman, Kevin Little, the
stained glass artist and Bill Boyd and
Mark Garner, axemen who do rather
more than chop logs at agricultural
shows and split firewood. Another of
the unsung arts is yours: you paid for
the film. So you may as well see it: first
viewing at Film Australia, Lindfield,

Is this the end
of folding money?
Box Archer Emery El9B
Let’s say it’s the beginning of the end.
At Woolworths and Food Plus, it will
buy the family groceries. At BP service
stations, it will Fill the family car.
In the not-too-distant future, it will
buy anything folding money can buy -
with none of the drawbacks. The whole
procedure is completed right there at
the checkout.
Introduced by Westpac, the revolu-

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Business deals that are hard to swallow
ONE is saddened to report that the in-
sidious American custom, the business-
man’s breakfast, is spreading fast.
Stanley Korman instituted them here
back in the 19505. Korman, when he
had plans for rebuilding Melbourne
and even erecting an Eiffel Tower in St
Kilda Road, adored to get his execu-
tives into the Chevron at 7am and have
them brain-sharpened over bacon and
eggs.
The American Chamber of Com-
merce in Australia announced with
pride that last month it had conducted
its 500th breakfast briefing. You get
your briefing this way, according to its
leader: The briefers gather at 7.45 am
for juice, sit down for breakfast at 8 and
wind up at 9, ready to go off super-
charged to work.
Months back, we had Gordon
McGovern in town, Now, McGovern is
president and chief executive of Camp-
bell Soups. He has 40,000 employees
and an annual turnover of $3.5 billion.
Not a second to be wasted by Mr
McGovern, glory be, he invited the
press to breakfast at 7.30 at the Hilton.
Your correspondent arrived there in
Melburnian Antarctic darkness. Mr
McGovern, tall, blue-suited and alert al-
ready was sitting down ready to go. One
asked him whether normally he was a
rocket in the early hours.
“I kinda like to get up early,” said he.
“How early?”
“Aw, 4 am every day. That’s when
my mind works best.”
Was he dozing over his desk by 11
am?
No, indeed, but he did concede that
he was done by 9.30 pm when he went
to bed.
The business breakfast apparently is
booming in the United States. Hotels
and restaurants are packed with
businessmen discussing deals over their
eggs, hash browns, pancakes or even
Eggs Benedict. Indeed, queues are so
long in Manhattan it is difficult to get a
decent table at breakfast. The restaur-
ants are ulcerous with buyers, sellers,
deal-makers.
This is something we have to fight.
Australia was always an appalling place
to eat breakfast. Few restaurants open
before 11 am; motels provide deadly
half-chilled, fat-laden fare with three-
ply toast, jam in plastic pill boxes and
only the hotels provide a sort of a break-
fast.
I do hope we can keep it this way.
Americans are fanatical about break-
fast. According to surveys, at least 50
percent do not eat at home. They break-
fast at a diner, a Macdonald’s or at
much fancier places. So it has long been
the custom to do business deals at
breakfast. The theory is that you have to
fight the traffic anyway so why not get
in earlier, do your business over the
breakfast table at 7.30 and arrive at the
office by 9 already with spendid
achievements literally under your belt?
I have always felt that breakfast is a
time for meditation, a time for being
alone.
Once upon a time, I had to co-exist
with an appalling group captain com-
manding officer. He used to say: “All I
want at breakfast is a cup of black coffee
and a long, slow look around.”
Nothing civilised, nothing human,
nothing compassionate should ever be
decided at breakfast. It is a time when
the mind is at its most savage.
Regrettably, my occupation is that of
a columnist. I am bombarded with food
and drink. It is a peculiar thing in this
country: There is a strange theory that
no deal can be settled, no permanent
arrangement can be organised, nothing
bought or sold without eating or drink-
ing. In publicity and public relations
there is even a well-established law:
“The thinner the story, the wilder the
idea, the better the food and drink.”
With the business breakfast taking
over, the greatest problem is trying to
explain your day to your wife when you
get home especially when she has
gone to the trouble of cooking roast
beef with three veg. You can imagine
the scenario:
“Did you have a hard day at the
office, dear?”
“Shocking, will you pass me an Alka
Seltzer or something. At 7.30 am, I had
to meet Gaylord Bloggenheimer of
Conglomerate Inc at Hassoni’s... Oh, I
tried to keep it simple just smoked
salmon, a little caviar, croissants and
raspberry jam.
“And, honestly, the coffee was
decaffeinated and I only used butter
substitute and artificial milk. Then I
went right through the morning with
just Perrier but you must appreciate
there was the International Group Man-
agement Conference at Blow Blows at
1 pm.”
“Oh, darling, what you have to go
through to make a living for us,” she
said stroking his brow with a hot towel.
“You haven’t heard anything yet,”
he groaned. “We started with a french
onion soup coupled with a marvellous
Hunter Valley sauvignon, blanc, then
moved into lobster souffle served with a
slightly aged Montrachet, then a crown
roast of lamb which came with a vintage
Bordeaux. I don’t think Elroy J., the
third, liked it when I didn’t eat the
mousse and rejected his Chateau
D’Yquem.”
“Oh dear.”
“Then I had to go to pre-dinner
drinks with the World Advertising Inc
boys at Three Faces.”
“Oh mercy, darling, and it will be
even worse tomorrow.”
There is just one saving hope in all
this. One notes that the insidious fun-
run, get healthy, sweat often, jogging
craze is becoming worse. Maybe by next
year we will see the businessman’s
breakfast being organised at one of
Ranald Macdonald’s gymnasiums.
Maybe conferences between important
bodies could be arranged with all the
conferees sitting around on their exer-
cise bikes.
The idea is so stunning that I am sur-
prised that I am the first to think of it.
Lunchtime deals could be con-
summated at various jogging tracks
around the city.
It is admittedly hard to take notes
while jogging but this is no problem
with modern electronics and the brilli-
ance of mini-recorders. It is well known
that the brain is sharper when the blood
is circulating under exertion. What’s
more, there could be a new intimacy. At
the end of the session, the businessmen
could compare pulse rates and blood
pressures. □


A problem of women in the hallowed halls
DAVID M c NICOLL
EVER SINCE women started invading
the sacrosanct top deck of the members’
stand at the Sydney Cricket Ground
there have been volcanic rumblings
from the old male members who believe
that cricket is too serious a business to
be disturbed by the sometimes inane ex-
clamations of the ladies.
The protests have apparently in-
creased in volume and the trust has now
issued a questionnaire seeking the
opinion of members on certain matters.
The question which will interest the
crusty brigade is, “Do you see the need
for providing a ‘Members Only’ area?
(This area would exclude all forms of
guest tickets, both male and female.
However guest entry to all other areas
of the Members’ Reserve would remain
unaltered.)”
Many members of the SCG believe
that the rot set in when the rugby league
element started to outweigh the cricket-
ing element at the ground. Women fol-
lowers of league are notoriously noisy
and assertive, according to cricketing
members, and they bring their winter
habits into the sacred enclosures when
cricket takes over.
I’d be surprised if the trust doesn’t
return the top deck of the Members to a
male preserve.
ON DECEMBER 4, 1934, an Airspeed
Envoy plane set off from Oakland, Cali-
fornia, to fly to Australia. Five hundred
miles out from Honolulu, radio contact
was lost, and the aircraft dis-
appeared for ever.
Charles Ulm, who, with
two companions, was lost on
that flight, is the nearly forgot-
ten man of Australian avi-
ation. He was always over-
shadowed by Kingsford
Smith, yet his contribution to
pioneer aviation in Australia
was probably greater than
Smith’s, or in fact any other of
the early birdmen. Ulm was
not merely the pioneering avi-
ator, he pioneered attempts to
make aviation a commercial
success.
Ulm was a remarkable
man. Under age in World
War I, he enlisted as Charles
Jackson, was wounded twice
in Gallipoli. Sent back to Aus-
tralia, he enlisted again, this
time under his right name,
and went off to France, where
he was again wounded. In
1917 he made his first flights, and his
passion for aviation was kindled. Ten
years later, he had linked up with
Smithy for their memorable flights.
Dick Smith, the electronics whiz and
helicopter record maker, believes that
the time has come for Ulm to be given
some recognition. For the 50th anniver-
sary of Ulm’s disappearance into the
Pacific, Dick Smith is organising a
memorial dinner for which he intends
picking up the entire tab!
808 HAWKE will be at such long
odds-on, that betting on the election
will be stifled.
But it would be interesting to know if
the odds will shorten or lengthen be-
cause of the extraordinary long run-up
on which he has decided. In my view, if
Hawke had decided on a quick cam-
paign, he’d have come up with a stun-
ning victory. But after a drag-on eight
weeks, in which all sorts of things can
happen, he’ll still win, but maybe not
with as big a result.
A racing aficionado like R.J. should
know that when stewards’ inquiries run
over the quarter hour, punters start to
feel uneasy. The longer the deliber-
ations, the greater the possibility of a
protest being upheld. Not that the
December 1 result will be affected but
a lot of people are going to be heartily
sick of the whole thing after eight weeks.
SYDNEY restaurateur Johnnie Walker
Charles Ulm: nearly the forgotten man of Australian aviation
has, over the years, helped dozens of
new migrants by giving them jobs in his
bistros and steak caves. One of these
was Maria Chris, eldest of eight Cypriot
children who arrived in the early 60s.
Johnnie gave Maria a job as a waitress,
and today, 18 years later, Maria is one
of the senior manageresses of the Walk-
er establishments.
But that’s only part of the story.
Maria got her next sister into the Bistro,
then helped her when she studied den-
tistry. That sister is now married to an-
other dentist in England, and runs six
dental clinics. The next sister supported
by Maria got her degree in Arts and be-
came a high school teacher.
The next sister decided on law, and
Maria helped her through. The next sis-
ter set her sights on specialised teaching
of spastic children.
What about Maria’s own private
life? Well, she married a young man
named Kyriacou, and helped support
him while he qualified as an engineer.
There were of Maria’s mar-
riage Chris, who took an honors de-
gree in psychology, and now teaches in
Sydney and Kerry, who graduated in
science last Friday from the University
of NSW. It’s no wonder Maria is a
proud parent-sister, and no wonder
Johnnie Walker feels a warm glow.
WHEN ARE television reporters going
to stop asking people they are in-
terviewing about their “feelings”? You
know what I mean. The re-
porter gazes into the face of
the victim and asks “What
were you feeling when ..
It seems to me a very arid
type of interviewing. The vic-
tim’s caravan has been burnt
down, and he has lost all his
worldly possessions and he
is asked about his feelings. Is
he expected to say he found
the experience exhilarating?
Generally in these emotional
interviews the unfortunate
victim can do little more than
mumble a few incoherent
words. Wouldn’t it be possible
for television editors to give
their reporters some instruc-
tions in asking pertinent ques-
tions relating to the particular
incident or situation, and not
fire off the vapid “What were
your feelings when you saw
the tractor flatten your grand-
mother?’’ □

My blood pressure’s going swimmingly
RON SAW
I WAS LOLLING in a warm spa
rather as the emperor Nero must have,
at full 1011, I imagine when it occurred
to me that I should write a piece about
the Hyde Park Club. I mentioned the
idea to a glistening creature across the
pool.
“Oh, yes,” she said. “Sucking up to
Kerry Packer, are we?”
“No.”
I have no objection to sucking up to
Kerry Packer. If a journalist can suck
up to politicians, cops, foot-
ball heroes and film stars, why
would he stop at a man who
owns not only the Hyde Park
Club but the magazine at
which said journalist earns his
crust?
If I thought that it would
do any good, I’d pitch a tent
at the entrance to his little cot-
tage in Bellevue Hill and
genuflect to his every passing.
But it wouldn’t do me any
good at all.
And the fact is that, more than once
over the past year, I’ve thought that I
should make public what I have found
to be a good thing.
For a long time I thought absolutely
nothing about the Hyde Park Club.
Then, in a conversation about bilharzia
or piles or something, my doctor drew
my attention to my having for four
years taken about as much exercise as
the aforementioned Nero and that it
was doing nothing to improve my blood
pressure, which was then 155/95 not
really dangerous but nothing to write
home about, either.
Because we got a cut well, lightly-
nicked rate ($550, instead of $650 a
year), I joined early. And I presented
the club with one of its most vexing
problems:
My four years of pale, fishbelly-
white, spaghetti-muscled and shock-
ingly-unhealthy loafing had been due to
a stroke. My left leg could walk but not
even half-way properly; my left arm
could flop around. It was unlikely, then,
that I’d tie up the squash courts or that I
would be an extra body for the aerobics
classes. My lack of balance made me a
non-starter for the Nautilus machines
and the trampolines and with my blood-
pressure in that state I’d have been mad
to try the sauna, the steam room or the
spa pool. So, what in God’s name was I
to do?
“Swim,” they said. “There’s a whack-
ing great 22-metre pool down here.”
“I’m not sure I can swim 22m laps,” I
said weakly. I had always been a reas-
onably good swimmer and even after
my stroke I had been taught to swim
one-armed by Patricia Coleman, the ge-
nius physiotherapist at Coorabel, my
first rehabilitation hospital. But, be-
cause of Beta-block-pills I was taking
for my thrice-damned blood-pressure,
as it happened I tended to run out of
puff about the 18m mark. I would swal-
low water and choke and stand there
making noises like a randy bullmoose
yet feeling the way a bullmoose must
feel whose lust has been four-times
sated; and all this I explained to the
people at the Hyde Park Club. They
were not to be denied.
“So you don’t swim the full length,”
they said. “You swim across the pool.
It’s only 9m wide.”
I tried, God knows I tried, to bring
up more arguments for the defence of
my sloth but eventually I found myself
swimming across the damn pool: push
off, six strokes, turn, push off, six strokes
back.
For some reason possibly to do
with my attractively-portly dimensions
or the lopsidedness thereof I went
straight instead of in circles as, I’m sure,
the laws of physics say a one-armed
swimmer should. I was in no danger of
drowning from exhaustion. Still, after
10 laps (across and back five times), I
was exhausted. I had to be helped from
the pool and led to the solarium.
This was something like the engine
(or whatever it is) that gives Andrew
Peacock his healthy tan: a sort of hot-
meat sandwich with banks of ultra-vi-
olet light above and below giving one
not only a slow tan, free of skin cancer,
but also warmth and relaxation that
restored the soul.
While swimming, you tended to
think: “Hell, I’ve a piece to write; can’t
waste more time down here.” Then,
after five minutes as the meat in the
sandwich, you said aloud; “Aaah, so
who’s in a hurry?”
After my first month, my blood-
pressure was 145/90.
After six months and with the okay
of Dr Buster Summerhayes, the club’s
full-time physician, I increased my
swimming from 10 to 16 laps and my
visits from two to three times a week.
There were minor obstacles, mostly
polemical: “Hyde Park Club, eh?” said
a friend. “ Wish I could afford that rich-
man stuff.” He was, as he
spoke, lighting one of the
cigarettes that cost him rough-
ly $3O a week which is
about three times as much as
the club costs me.
Another three months and
I was doing 20 laps, now at
four to five strokes a lap, and
my blood pressure had come
down to 135/90. And, quite as
importantly, my weight had
dropped from 94kg to 88.
Now came vanity ...
Ever since my stroke, my friends
seeing me still breathing had said:
“Hello, Ron. You’re looking well ...”
Meaning: “You’re not in a wooden box
yet but...”
Now they were saying, in unmasked
awe: “Gee, you DO look well.” And,
though it was my opinion that my dash-
ing good looks probably owed as much
to the Hot Meat Sandwich as to the ex-
ercise, I loved hearing it.
And I was down to 135/85; I was do-
ing 24 laps three times a week, there was
talk of reducing my medication and the
club had fitted a sort of stirrup one of
those used by racing cyclists that
would keep my left foot on an
exercycle.
I had always been pretty active but
since my earliest years had loathed the
fresh-air friends, too often beefy prel-
ates, who bleated about the benefits of
cold showers and muscular excess.
Now, as I’ve said, I loved it. And still I
love it, though I wouldn’t like to give the
impression that I even think about
taking cold showers.
The Australian Brain Foundation
has urged me for the past four years to
lend a hand to the marvellous work it
does which, among other things, helps
people who have had strokes. So, okay:
People keen for rehabilitation could do
much worse than join the Hyde Park
Club or something like it.
And, if that’s sucking-up, then I’m a
sucker unashamed. □


Adams’ guide to next season’s ghastly viewing
PHILLIP ADAMS
ADAMS’ FIRST LAW of television
held that the weight of the backside was
greater then the force of intellect. But
that was based on the era before remote
controls. There was a significant body
of evidence proving that people simply
couldn’t be bothered getting up to
change channels. So if a network won
with its news service at 6.30 or 7, they’d
keep the majority of the audience all
night long.
Now every Norm has his remote at
his side and my First Law is old hat.
Norm can change channel at whim.
What’s more, he does. Increasingly
there’s a tendency for people to pixilate
their viewing, to watch one, two or more
shows at once, leaping from movie to
movie, from Love Boat to M*A*S*H.
Well, if you’d like to take your remote
control in hand, I’ll now allow you to
flick through a sneak preview of the new
American series, hot from the cathode
tube. These are some of the shows we’ll
be seeing in the months ahead, whether
you like it or not.
CALL TO GLORY: About a test pilot and a
family man with the right stuff in the 60s.
STREET HAWK: A techno-drama in the style
of Knight Rider starring a souped up,
supernatural motorcycle.
THREE’S A CROWD: A re-upholstered ver-
sion of Three’s Company which was, as I
recall, recycled from the BBC series
about a boy and two girls sharing an
apartment.
PAPER DOLLS: With Lloyd Bridges, Morgan
Fairchild and Brenda Vaccaro. About
“high fashion, romance and intrigue.” I
don’t know how Brenda Vaccaro fits into
the world of fashion as, when we once
met, she explained that she ran a society
for the cultivation of natural body odors.
No armpit sprays, no vag deodorants.
JESSIE: Starring Lindsey Wagner who, was
as I recall, the Bionic Woman. This time
she’s a police psychiatrist.
WHO’S THE BOSS? Taxi veteran Tony
Danzer is a single father who becomes a
live-in housekeeper for a single-minded
career woman. Nothing new about that.
For the past 30 years almost every so-
called “family comedy” on American
television has been a single parent fam-
ily. Or like the Brady Bunch, a merger of
divorced families. Whatever happened to
tne good old days of Father Knows Best?
Before the nuclear family was blown
apart?
HAWAIIAN HEAT: Another cop drama that
returns to those Five-0 places.
FINDER OF LOST LOVES: “Tony Franciosa
and Debra Adair are romance cops, re-
uniting guest stars with old lovers.”
Whatever that means.
E.R: A hospital emergency room comedy in
the spirit of M*A*S*H starring Elliot
Gould who was, come to think of it, in the
original movie of M*A*S*H.
CHARLES IN CHARGE: About a college
student who acts as a live-in house-
keeper-babysitter to three kids.
PUNKY BREWSTER: A kiddy comedy about
a “cross-generational Odd Couple.”
HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN: Made by Michael
Langdon of Little House on the Prairie
fame this time he’s an angel on Earth.
PARTNERS IN CRIME: Think of it, Loni An-
derson, the pneumatic blonde from that
show about the radio station in
Cincinnati, and Linda Carter, erstwhile
Wonder Woman, are San Francisco pri-
vate eyes. Given that 90% of SF’s male
population is gay, you can imagine the
squeals of terror, not to mention horror,
as Loni and Linda bear down on them.
BILLY GRIAR, BILLY GRIAR, BILLY GRIAR:
No, the word processor hasn’t the hic-
cups. The title is said three times to em-
phasise its sadness. It’s another one of
those “boy with a disease” movies.
Having used up all the mainstream
ailments, with the exception of AIDS, this
one tackles progeria, the rare and inevi-
tably fatal illness in which the victim ages
at supersonic speed. I know the feeling.
From old.
Now to mini-series.
HOLLYWOOD WIVES: From Jackie Collins’
seething, over-sexed, sensual and sop-
orific best-seller.
THE EWOK MOVIE: From George Lucas. It
features those little furry characters from
Return of the Jedi which look like a cross
between wombats, crockers, koalas and
busbies.
A BUNNY’S TALE: In 1963, Gloria Steinem
went undercover at a Playboy club. Little
did the playboy Hugh Heffner realise that
the nubile blonde with the little bunny tail
plonked on her posterior was a famous
feminist, America’s version of Germaine
Greer.
HEARTSOUND: James Garner is a physician
who suffers a massive heart attack. Mary
Tyler Moore nurses him through it.
All these disease series and the
endless melancholia of day time
“soapies” recalls a recent Punch car-
toon. A woman lies on the psychiatrist’s
couch looking morose, shattered, devas-
tated. “Yours is the most interesting
case of depression Mrs Banks have
you ever thought of writing for tele-
vision?”
TOPIKA KANSAS ... USSR: A variation on
The Day After. Rather than being
bombed to smithereens, the US has
been taken over by the Soviets. Appar-
ently the White House didn’t like The Day
After very much tended to imply that
US presidents were nuclear butter
fingers. Well, this series should be much
more popular with Ronnie Raygun.
SPACE: The 13-hour treatment of the James
Michener novel, starring James Garner,
Kate Kennedy and Werner Von Braun.
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS: A six-hour
historical drama based on the unfortu-
nate navigational error that led to the dis-
covery of the US. Ah, if only Christopher
had found an uninterrupted passage to
China!
A.D: Not to be confused with E.T. A 12-hour
epic on the early days of Christianity star-
ring Anthony “Teddy Bear” Andrews,
Ava Gardner, the late James Mason and
a few hundred others. Co-written by
Anthony Burgess
All things considered, it looks like
another dose of deja veiwing.


Paul Hogan, Edna Everidge, Vegemite Sandwiches,
Winged Keels, Koalas, Kangaroos and Platypuses.

COVER STORY
The winning ways of
racing’s wonder boy
Darren Gauci, second from left on Prolific, number 12, his Caulfield Cup mount
“He’s one of those freaks that comes along every quarter of a century, ” says
former ace jockey Roy Higgins of record-breaking Darren Gauci, who is
Melbourne’s reigning champion rider, even as an 18-year-old apprentice.
LENORE NICKLIN looks behind the sporting headlines.
THE SEPTEMBER day Roy Higgins
became business manager for Darren
Gauci, the 18-year-old champion ap-
prentice jockey took delivery of a new
Mercedes car. “Times have changed,”
muttered Higgins. “When I was 18, I
put a deposit on a Malvern Star.”
Gauci is the wunderkind of Victorian
racing, the rider to whom top trainer
Bart Cummings has offered the pick of
his stables for the Caulfield and Mel-
bourne cups.
Gauci kicked home his first winner
in a three-horse race at Bairnsdale, a
Victorian “bush” track, in April, 1982,
and has hardly stopped riding winners
since. He celebrated his 18th birthday
last Boxing Day by riding a treble “in
town” at Sandown. In one winning
spree, he rode at least one winner a day
in 18 consecutive city meetings. Last
season, he became the first apprentice
since Vic Sleigh in 1921-22 to win the
Melbourne jockeys’ premiership.
Gauci is the first rider to have won
the apprentice and jockey premierships
in both the country and the city and was


Gauci at Caulfield with business manager Roy Higgins
voted the state’s Racing Personality of
the Year.
Higgins still holds the state record of
75 city wins in a season but probably
not for much longer. Gauci rode 65 city
winners despite two suspensions, a
couple of illnesses and a journey
through a plate glass door that came
perilously close to finishing his riding
career and kept him out of the saddle
for six weeks. All up, he rode 173 win-
ners, 138 seconds and 118 thirds from
1209 mounts in the city and country a
win every 6.99 rides.
Not surprisingly, in a city that loves
heroes, there is a Darren Gauci fan club
with a membership of more than 3000.
Thousands more belong to the “Gauci
Gang” the punters who put money on
his every ride. They forgive him when
he loses (most of the time, anyway) and
worry for him in adversity. Early this
month he came a cropper with Zatina at
Flemington his first race fall and
the small body in its colorful silks lay
still on the track for an alarmingly long
time. He was taken to hospital with con-
cussion and cuts to his right wrist and
head, but was back in the saddle the fol-
lowing Saturday. He rode two place-

Surrounded by racing history, Gauci at Caulfield after early-morning trackwork: “I love riding, that’s the main thing”
getters just to show the fans he was
alright.
“He’s just a born natural one of
those freaks that comes along every
quarter of a century,” says Higgins: “A
boy of 18 with the thinking of a 25-year-
old and the actions of a 30-year-old. He
has the combination of balance and
light hands that don’t put too much
pressure on a horse’s mouth. They used
to call George Moore ‘cotton-fingers.’
Gauci’s also got cotton fingers and the
understanding of the animal and judg-
ment of the speed of the horse.”
“He does the right thing instinctive-
ly,” says arch-rival Brent Thomson who
first saw Gauci ride when he was 16 and
knew that he would “kick on.” “He
rides fairly short, sits very low on the
horse. Obviously, he’s got very good
balance and horses race well for him
run freely. And he’s got the advantage
of a short leg.”
As well as cotton fingers and a short
leg, Gauci has the good looks of a mini-
film star dark wavy hair, blue eyes
and a melting smile. When he was 12 he
was runner-up in a film promotions
Storm Boy lookalike competition. He
was destined for stardom of one sort or
another.
When he was 12, he was breaking re-
cords as a runner and captaining the
school football team. When he was 12,
he was already riding trackwork (the
minimum age is 14 and the stewards put
a stop to it when they found out). He
knew that he would be a jockey and in
vain did his headmaster try to convince
the boy who was also a promising schol-
ar that he should continue with his aca-
demic education.
Gauci at 15 became apprenticed to
Frank King who, like Theo Green in
Sydney, is better known as a trainer of
apprentices than of horses.
The cheerful, rosy-cheeked King is
himself a former jockey and has only
four horses in work. For him, appren-
tices are for teaching and not a source
of cheap labor.
“Darren’s lucky with his family but
you’d be surprised how many appren-
tices come from broken homes,” King
says “kids looking for a new family.”
King remembers his master, Vin
O’Neill, with affection: “I had a great
master hard but fair.” King is easy-
going but he says with twinkling eye
that after 40 years in the game it is not
easy to put one over him, either.
For the first six months of his ap-
prenticeship, Gauci continued to attend
the Caulfield High School but mucking
out stables at 4.30 am did not combine
successfully with mathematics at 9.30 am
an hour when he still likes to have a
nap. Schooling was given the miss. Like
the headmaster, Gauci’s mother Shirley
was disappointed. There was already
one jockey in the family Darren’s
older brother Michael and she was
not sure that she wanted two. Besides,
Darren was so good at his schoolwork.
“He had top marks at school I used to
think, ‘Darren, don’t be a jockey be-
cause you have the opportunity to be
something else’,” she said. “But he had
great determination in him.”
The Gauci house is five minutes walk
from the Caulfield track and Darren
still lives at home, sharing a bedroom
with his younger brother David. David
is 14 and rides trackwork but, to his sor-
row, will be too heavy to be a jockey.
“I’d like to be a racing commentator,”
he says. Twenty-four-year-old Michael
Gauci, who rides mostly at country
meetings, lives nearby and is married to
former jockey Gay Mullins. Gay is five
months pregnant but the baby scarcely
shows. “Sure to be a jockey,” she says,
with satisfaction.
When their second son determined
to become a jockey, Bill and Shirley
Gauci moved to Caulfield from the fam-
ily home in Glenroy where they had
lived for 24 years. They wanted the fam-
ily to stay together. Bill Gauci was born
in Malta, migrated to Australia when he
was 15 and works as a crane driver on
the Melbourne wharves.


Shirley’s father also
worked on the wharves and
the two men shared a passion
for racing. As soon as
Michael, Darren and David
Gauci could walk they were
taken to the races with their
grandfather a punter who
never missed a Melbourne
Cup or any other race meeting
if he could help it a man
who loved both horses and the
history of the racing game.
“He had a big influence on the
boys,” says Shirley Gauci,
who still sorrows that he did
not live to see his grandsons
riding winners.
When Michael became ap-
prenticed to Don Shannon,
11-year-old Darren would
spend weekends at the stables
helping out. Shannon’s stable
jockey, Geoff Bamford, found
a quiet pony and taught
Darren to ride. Bamford re-
calls that Darren “took on
real quick.” He graduated to a
well-behaved galloper called
Ching. The little pekinese that
gets under everyone’s feet in
the Gauci house is named
Ching in the horse’s honor. A
jockey remembers his first
racehorse.
“We’re a very close-knit
family and Darren’s success
seems to have made him very

close,” says Shirley Gauci. “It’s great,
because when they’re 18, you don’t ex-
pect to see so much of them. He’s a very
homely boy. Nothing has really
changed. Darren brings the lot of us
closer together.”
THERE ARE days when Darren Gauci
doesn’t ride a winner or even a place.
Marlboro Cup day at Caulfield, bleak
and wet, was such a day. Afterwards, he
sat at the family table with his brothers
and sisters eating the vegetable soup his
mother had made and the Kentucky
Fried chicken his father had bought.
“Just one of those days,” said Gauci,
who is neither monosyllabic like Lester
Piggott nor a chatterbox like Malcolm
Johnston.
While the rest of the family were still
eating, Darren and Michael went to
play squash. Michael, taller than
Darren, already faces the misery of
beating weight the constant fasting
and wasting that so often give jockeys
the faces of old men. King sees no prob-
lems for Darren Gauci. “Darren can
still ride at 48kg and, even if he gets to
51, he’s got his score on the board,”
King says. “Usually, the weight comes
up between the ages of 16 and 17 and
Darren has passed that danger period.
He will probably get to 50kg and, if he
can stay at that, there’s no worries at
all.” King sees as a bigger worry for
Darren “all the backslappers and
hangers-on that gather round when
you’re successful.” But among Gauci’s
virtues is his mental equilibrium suc-
cess has not gone to his head.
“I’ve seen kids who could have been
great apprentices but, soon as they had
a few bob, they wanted to ride in taxis,”
says King. “Wine, women and song
that sort of thing.” Darren does not
drink and he dates, every other Satur-
day, the entirely suitable 14-year-old
Karen Dunkerton, a star of TV’s Young
Talent Time. He undoubtedly sings all
the way to the particular bank where the
Victorian Racing Club keeps his trust
account. His earnings stay in trust for
him until he is 21. Already he has more
than $lOO,OOO there. When his mother
called to him at home, “How much
would you make in a year?”, Gauci re-
plied (with just a touch of irritability):
“Aw, gee, Mum; I wouldn’t have a
clue.”
Calculations can be made. At $4O a
losing ride, he makes $lOOO a week be-
fore he rides a place-getter. A winning
ride gives him 5 percent of the stake
plus the traditional 5 percent “sling”
from the owners. Last season, he just
missed out on riding winners of more

than $1 million in stakes. Higgins has
been appointed business manager to ad-
vise in the matter of endorsements, in-
vestments and personal appearances.
The money machine which Gauci
has become nearly ground to a spec-
tacular halt on April 30 this year the
day he put his hand through the plate
glass door. He and fellow apprentice
Lee Richardson had been “horsing
around” in the living room when Gauci
stumbled over one of the saddles they
were meant to be polishing. Gauci put
an arm out to balance himself. Glass
shattered and blood flowed. (The six
plate glass doors in the Gauci house
since have been replaced by wooden
ones.)
The deep cut in the fleshy underpart
of his right arm, between wrist and el-
bow, required 21 stitches and three
hours of surgery to repair two arteries
and sew back tendons and muscles.
While Shirley Gauci rushed to the tele-
phone to ring an ambulance, Darren
staggered out into the street and hailed a
passing motorist to take him to a nearby
medical centre. He was passing out
through loss of blood and the driver had
to keep prodding Gauci awake to ask
for directions. At first, it was thought it
would be three months before he could
ride again. He was back in the winners’
stall in eight weeks.
IN THE GREY and cheerless chill of a
recent Friday morning at Caulfield,
Melbourne trainer Colin Little was one
of the rugged-up track-watchers. Darren
Gauci rode past on three-year-old chest-
nut Testimony which Little trains and
which Gauci had ridden to victory the
previous Saturday. “When Roy Higgins
was at his top, he could not command
the money on the tote that Darren
does,” said Little. “Testimony on Friday
was 4/1 but, after Darren was engaged
to ride the horse, the price shortened to
6/4.” Little had asked Gauci’s father if
the boy could be apprenticed to him.
“Everyone knew he was going to be
great. He never had to be taught. He has
natural ability a beautiful seat, beauti-
ful hands.”
Overhearing the conversation, an
old-timer nearby said: “What he’s got is
brains .” Even trainer Geoff Murphy,
known as The Fuehrer, treats him with
respect. Murphy usually shouts at ap-
prentices to “Get on this” or “Get on
that” but with Gauci it is “Thank you,
Darren.” That, said the track-watchers,
was real status.
Gauci often has the pick of four or
five mounts in a race. He rides as many
as eight horses a meeting, four meetings
a week. As well as riding work at
Caulfield, he rides track for Bart
Cummings at Flemington. He presented
himself in King’s cosy, cluttered office
for our interview at 8.30 am.
The champ was weary and only with
effort did the blue eyes stay open. An
early tip for the Melbourne Cup? Kiwi,
he said, had to be a good chance. He
will ride Prolific in the Caulfield Cup
but has not yet decided what to ride in
the Melbourne Cup.
Winning the Oaks on Taj Eclipse
had been the biggest thrill of his career
and winning the four premierships
last season.
Yes, he said, he still sat on bales of
chaff and practised his whip action.
“I’m only young there’s plenty of
room for improvement.” (How Vin
O’Neill would have approved.)
When Gauci slashed his arm, he
thought it might have been the end of
his racing career. What would he do if
he did not ride? He shook his head. He
could not think what he would do if he
did not ride horses: It was not the
money or the fame or the awards, it was
the riding.
“I love riding; that’s the main thing,”
he said. Minutes later, he was alseep. □

SPONSORED BY TOYOTA
A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF THE BEST MODERN AUSTRALIAN WRITING
SINCE the appearance of the latest Sup-
plement, a spirited correspondence has
taken place in the columns of The Bul-
letin about modern poetry and the varieties
of it published in the Supplement. It is ironic
that there have been complaints that few of
the poems in the Supplement rhyme since, in
my poetry (which is published elsewhere), I
have been trying for years to revive the noble
art of rhyme.
Of course, critics were arguing about
rhyme back in the 16th century. Shakespeare
in his plays and Milton in his epics and
Wordsworth in The Prelude dispensed with
it. Milton even went in for a variety of “free
verse” in Samson Agonistes. T. S. Eliot still
has the last word, that no verse is “free” for
the poet who truly attempts it.
Nor is prose for the prose writer who is a
true artist.
Hal Porter, one of the greatest masters of
prose in Australian literature, died recently
after a long
period in a
coma after
an accident.
Porter was
for many
years a much
valued con-
tributor to

NIGHT VISITORS
by Ethel Webb
English-born Ethel Webb is federal president of
the Australian Society of Women Writers and has
had many short stories and poems published
SHE HEARD THEM breaking into the
house. The television was on but with
the sound turned down. Her hearing
was still good.
Sixty-eight and with her arthritis
the way it was, there wasn’t much she
could do. So Gwen sat still and waited.
She was curious to see what they
looked like, how many of them, what
they were after.
The marmalade cat, Lucy, didn’t
stir; she lay like a warm cushion
pressed against Gwen’s recently-
acquired stainless steel hip joint.
The laundry door gave way with a
groan. Must get a chain put on that
when I get it fixed, she decided. Crazy
to have one on the front door and not
on the back.
When she was sure they were in-
side, she stood up. She was frail and
light and the thick carpet muffled her
steps as, on her walking stick, she
made the awkward journey to the
kitchen.
They blinked in the sudden light.
“Would you like some coffee?”
Gwen studied them. Stunned mullet
for the moment but it wouldn’t last.
Two. Children. Boy about 19. Girl two
years older, or younger. It was hard to
tell with girls. Dark hair everywhere,
of course, and regulation unwashed
and unbrushed.
Clothes nondescript and
bedraggled. Uniform of the young,
these days. The boy in jeans and green-
striped T-shirt, dirty and frayed. A but-
ton gone from the top of the jeans.
The girl looked cold in a thin brown
Indian cotton skirt, uneven tatters
round her ankles. A too-tight dark T-
shirt showed the ribcage startling
clear.
“Something to eat with your
coffee?” Gwen moved toward the stove.
“Money . ..” The girl’s voice was
high and light. “Money. We want
money.”
“Or else!” the boy growled.
Gwen filled the kettle. “What for?”
The boy put up a hand to silence the
girl. “Petrol. We ran out of petrol.”
“What a shame.” She put the kettle
on the stove. “At this time of night, I
doubt you’ll find a garage open even
on roster. Do you belong to the RAC?”
They stared at her unmoving, ex-
pressionless.
“You might as well sit down.” She
indicated the chintzy chairs beside the
kitchen table. “I’m going to make some
toast.”
Neither of them used the chairs.
“We came here for money and we’ll
leave with money.” The girl slapped
her shoulderbag on the bench.
“Have something to eat now you’re
here.” Gwen switched on the toaster.
“What do you want the money for? It’s
not petrol, is it? You’re out of work?
Clothes. With better clothes, you’d
have more chance of jobs. They have
very good things at the op shops; I go
there myself. See these Jaegei slacks?”
Leaning on her stick, she stretched a
leg. “Two dollars fifty.”
The boy folded his arms across his
chest and, head lowered, looked at her
through slitted lids.
“We’re not interested in your pants.
Or what’s in them. We don’t want any-
thing to eat. Just give us the money.”
Gwen forced herself to put the in-
sult aside, along with the beginnings of
fear. She went to the fridge for margar-
ine.
“I always have supper at this time.
Thought you might like some, that’s
all.”
The girl dashed the dish from
Gwen’s hand. “The money. We told
you: The money.”
Gwen stared at the fragments glit-
tering on the cork tiles. Crystal. Her
mother’s. So much for her great idea of
using the good things, rather than
leave them untouched in the side-
board.
Not that it made any difference in
the end. They went through the house
methodically. Together they smashed
everything that was smashable, ripped
everything rippable and used the solid,
indestructible things to scratch and
mar the rest even the telephone.
It was noisy, of course, but Gwen
had no confidence in the neighbors.
The houses were far apart in this
street, residents elderly and those not
hard of hearing were addicted to sleep-
ing pills both applied in some cases.
It was all done in 20 minutes.
Gwen stood and watched for a while
but she went back to the couch when
the trembling became too bad. Lucy,
cowardly creature that she was, scur-
ried to hide behind the TV. When the
screen was smashed by a thrust from
the legs of a chair, she let out a howl
and fled to a better refuge under
Gwen’s bed.
Gwen tried to hold on when the girl
wrenched the walking stick from her
hands but couldn’t suppress a tiny cry
when it was broken in half.
She discovered that she was
praying. She stopped, feeling it un-
worthy to ask the Almighty to help her
now when she hadn’t given Him a
thought for 40 years. But soon she
realised that she was praying again.
Perhaps that, in itself, was some kind
of answer. She was past knowing.
The young people ... She no longer
thought of them as children . . . The
young people found the money.
She wasn’t stupid enough to keep
much in the house. But, somehow, she
had never thought of Father’s coin col-
lection as money. Some notes were in
her purse and the visitors took them,
too.
They left the jar of coppers in the
kitchen: it was too heavy to take with
them but not too heavy to heave


Ice-oh!
Illustration by DONALD FRIEND
Although we loved the gentle horse whose nose
of worn-out velvet nudged us for rye-grass,
Antarctica come to the suburbs was what drew
us through the heat; we trotted by its slow
and straining bulk or swung on the creaking cart.
Only the ice-man galloped through each gate,
bent double over the hessian-cushioned block
that weighed him down the side, around the back
and in with never a knock, boots puddling mud
cm the lino, till clunked on the chest edge to teeter and thud.
Hot-foot, hot-foot on the road we’d wait,
breathing the wet sack smell, the oats, the sweet
sour yellow dung, force-feeding weeds to Horse
to earn our chunks of slithery dripping ice.
“Now clear off kids and mind the bleedin’ wheels.”
So perched on the fence we kicked our heels,
watching the cart lurch up to Duthy Street.
Johnny always waved as it turned right
and into just a faint clip-clop applause;
while fast as we could suck or slurp, our ice
was licked off at the corners by the sun
or sent in shivery runnels down our skin,
trickling chocolate drops across the dirt.
And when we held the chips up glistening bright,
greyly among the frozen bubble swarms
there went a crooked mile between the palms
to question mark the light. Beyond us, time
hung round on the wall; at every touch was home
green streets, my brother’s laugh, a sunny day
only half-grasped, forever melting away.

The exercise had done them good,
Gwen observed. They were a more
healthy color and the eyes seemed to
focus better as they stood before her
side by side, relaxed but wary.
It’s my turn now, she thought.
They’ve smashed everything else in the
place; now they’ll start on me. Don’t let
me cry out, she prayed. Don’t let me
cry.
She heard her voice. Voice? Croak,
perhaps.
“I was going to offer to sew on that
button for you. But I don’t think I
could find the needle in this haystack
you’ve made.”
The boy laughed. She hadn’t
thought that he could. He reached out
and she willed herself not to flinch.
But he clapped her on the shoulder.
“You’ll do, old lady. You’ll do.”
The girl touched his wrist lightly
with two fingers. The look that went
with it was nothing, was everything.
They left then. In Gwen’s car.
She stayed where she was, on the
couch, for a long time.
Lucy stayed under the bed even
longer. ■

on the top of its head. Eyes like
marbles. And swivelling like a snail’s.”
“But it’s not a snail?”
“No,” he said, shaking his much-
photographed Baroque head as
Time called it; other journals had said
his head was Amerindian.
“More like an animal’s eyes. To-
night I saw its head distinctly. A blunt,
square head. The other times I just
heard it hopping loudly after me along
the hall. This time, it nearly caught me.
Tiny white, sharp teeth below that
blunt head. Round eyes on top like
marbles.” Johnson laughed. “Some
people say that, if you don’t wake up
from a falling dream, you’ll die when
you hit the ground. Nonsense, of
course. People have a genius for cred-
ulity. And if it the creature
catches me?”
Louise said: “Perhaps you should
see a doctor?”
“A shrink?” he asked. He laughed
riotously.
“They’d have some fun with me.
What a feast for a neo-Freudian!”
“Did it have legs?”
“I didn’t see them only the head.”
He got out of bed and dressed hur-
riedly, although it was only 4.30 am.
“Must you start painting now?” his
wife asked. “You should take it easier.
Please, for my sake.”
“I’ll be better painting,” he said.
His heart was now beating normally.
He walked down through the lawn
and his trouser cuffs were wet through
when he reached his studio. The lawn,
he observed, was overdue for mowing.
He started what he knew was his ritual
to reach that calmness that led to
creativity mixing paints, cleaning
brushes, excluding active thought.
This calmness, beautitude almost he
had once compared it to the state of
mind when listening to a late
Beethoven quartet this he found
difficult to achieve now. He stretched
his arms, much as a newly awakened
cat does. Then he tensed and relaxed
his legs, recalling his three years in
Japan when a sumi-e master had said
that the arm was more important than
the fingers, the shoulder more than the
arm, a calm stomach more important
than the shoulder and more import-
ant even than the heart, a bold mind.
That creature in his dream was as
fugitive, as evanescent as a distant
mist-draped peak in a Chinese land-
scape or a late Turner. Couldn’t he
think or feel anything except in terms
of art? At 75, it is hard to change the
habits of a lifetime.
He looked steadily at the six-metre
abstract he had started a few days
earlier. He had no idea what it would
evolve into; as was his wont, he had to
feel his way as he went guided by
what appeared to be chance but what,
he was sure, was not.
If he had lived in mediaeval times,
he’d have believed he was bewitched.
“The Quattrocento painters had it
easier,” he told himself as he mixed a
light tint of green. “Just do a bloody
Madonna.”
And why paint anymore? He was as
sure of immortality as any painter liv-
ing. And he said what he had often
said to himself but to no one else be-
cause it was altogether too literary: “In
my own way, I’m as chained as any one
of the captive kings hooked to Timur-
the-Lame’s chariot. I am a man ob-
sessed with painting because I haven’t
much time left.”
He worked for three hours, until
Louise called him to breakfast, and
resumed painting to the ticking of the
demanding clock that would some day
any day be stilled for ever.


The nightmare recurred that night
and again he woke, screaming in ter-
ror.
“He got closer this time,” he told
his wife. “Wet eyes on stalks no,
more like a frog’s. And there was a
smell ...”
“What kind of smell?”
“Can’t place it. A hospital smell!
lodine?” He shook his head.
“I shan’t go,” she said. “Not while
you have these dreams.”
“They can’t kill me.” He paused. “If
one had a weak heart, they might.”
“I’m not going.”
“You are,” he said. “Jane is expect-
ing you. She has been looking forward
to your visit.”
Jane was their daughter. So his wife
went. He returned home in the early
afternoon, after seeing her off on the
plane to London. He put his key in the
lock, opened the door and then froze
still. A burglar? Sounds he couldn’t
identify at first were coming from the
back of the house. From the bathroom.
The splashing of water.
Recovering, he went resolutely
down the hall and into the bathroom.
Empty. The floor was awash and water
swirling in a dizzying circle down the
plughole. He went into every room in
turn. All empty.
He went into the living room, sat
down and lit a cigarette. He decided
that there was no point in calling the
police. He telephoned a locksmith and
arranged for him to put new deadlocks
on all doors and secure all windows.
“And the studio?” asked the lock-
smith.
Johnson thought for a time. “No,”
he said. His paintings weren’t even in-
sured. “The premiums would impover-
ish me,” he’d said once and added:
“Does it matter if they’re stolen? It’s
not so different from selling one. Be-
sides, I paint for myself.”
He went to the kitchen and put
coffee in the percolator. He sat to wait
for it. He saw a large fish scale near his
feet. And a second. And a third.
“I thought I’d swept them all up,”
he said to himself, remembering the
New Zealand sole he’d bought a few
days ago and had to scale. Flaying the
fish, the scales had shot everywhere.
With his cup of coffee, he walked to
the living room and sat down. A minute
later, he happened to look down and
saw two more scales. He realised that
his heart was beating rapidly and his
brow was wet.
“I must have carried them here on
my cardigan,” he assured himself. He
looked at his cardigan closely, adjust-
ing his spectacles. He brushed it with
his fingers. He saw no scales fall. He
remembered abruptly that his wife had
vacuum-cleaned the room that morn-
ing. He felt a sudden frisson of fear
and told himself that it was absurd.
The dream recurred that night and
this time he saw the creature more
clearly. “Why, I believe it’s a fish,” he
told himself in his dream as he fled
before it, tremulous, along the car-
peted hall of his house. It was about a
metre long, inching itself along on pec-
toral fins and every now and then rear-
ing on its tail and springing forward
three metres at a time. He narrowly
beat it into his bedroom on shaking
legs and woke up screaming as before.
He got up, put on the light, went
into the hall. Normally fearless, he al-
most screamed. Sounds of heavy
splashing came from the bathroom,
under the door, and down the hall were
lively puddles of salty water. (He
smelled it).
He put on his slippers and went to
the bathroom. The splashing within
was very loud. He tried the door but it
was locked inside.
He called out: “Who’s there? Open
up! Open up!”
The splashing stopped. Then he
heard the water running swiftly out of
the bath.
He threw his shoulder against the
door. It held. He went to the laundry to
fetch a hammer to batter it down.
When he got back, the door was open
and the bathroom, awash with water,
was empty except for something that
made his heart race and his mouth dry
as though he’d tasted verdigris: In the
tub was a large frond of kelp.
In the morning, he found himself
unable to paint. He chainsmoked,
drank many cups of coffee. Reproach-
ing himself for an old man’s foolish-
ness he was a rationalist he
telephoned the curator of fishes at the
museum.
“The fish you describe sounds like a
mud skipper,” the curator said. “One
of the gobies. Periophthalmus and
Boleophthalmus. They live on mud
flats and among the roots of
mangroves. Africa and the
Indo-Pacific. Popular names
are mud skipper and kanga-
roo fishes. They can stay out
of water for a long time be-
cause they carry water
around with them. They store
it in spongy sacs that keep
their gills wet. Of course,
they have to renew their sup-
ply from time to time.”
“I see.”
“Only catch is they don’t
grow to a metre. Just centi-
metres. Twelve or 15 centi-
metres.”
“That’s only a guess,”
Johnson said, remembering
that he’d only ever seen the
fish in a dream. He was em-
barrassed suddenly that he
had so confused reality and
his dream.
“Where did you see it?”
“Oh, up north,” he said,
weakly. And asked, after a
pause: “How far can a mud skipper
travel out of water before having to re-
new its supply?”
“It doesn’t usually travel all the
time,” the curator said. “It hunts
insects. A few minutes only . . . I’m not
squeamish but it’s not a nice sight to
see one gobble up a live grasshopper.”
After he hung up, Johnson went
back to the studio but was unable to
achieve the state of calm he knew he
needed. “I’ve been a Zen Buddhist all
my life without knowing it,” he once
had joked. He returned to the
house, armed himself with an
axe and searched every room.
He found nothing. Perhaps
it was someone’s idea of a
practical joke? He
walked into the
kitchen. His heart
started jumping
painfully. A
large fish scale^
Clay
When I was four I dug a hole and hoped,
on imperial advice, by six o’clock, to be
sitting upside down in China sipping tea.
I struck clay.
Now I am nearing forty, and steering
a book with tattered sails over the China Sea
I read with finality: put away your spade,
you must be born from oriental clay
«
Mao and Tao, like Bamboo and Rice, must simmer
for generations. Understood with Plum Sauce.
I take up my shovel, go out into the garden
and start working shit into the clay.

Bcm long lay on the floor.
Unwilling to confide in anyone,
Johnson decided to Sleep in the studio
that night. “That’ll fool that bloody
fish!” he said. “If there is a bloody
fish.” His decision made him feel fool-
ish but, he told himself, there was no
gainsaying what happened. The
pungent kelp frond was no dream.
Because he could not settle to paint-
ing, he went for a walk. And told him-
self that it was an ironic joke that a
nightmare had intruded on reality. A
polymath, an agnostic, he’d told an in-
terviewer: “Our very existence is a
kind of dream a nightmare even.
Blind chance has produced us.” And
he had chuckled. “Bloody chance or
sheer bad luck produced the universe,”
he said. And remembered that he had
quoted Sir Bernard Lovell. Sir
Bernard had been reported as saying
that if, within a second or two of the
Big Bang, the force of an attraction
between the protons had been only a
few percent stronger all the hydrogen
in the primeval condensate would have
turned into helium ... “No galaxies, no
stars, no life would have emerged,” Sir
Bernard had said. Johnson told the
suitably impressed young interviewer:
“Life is a bad joke on us.”
Johnson then said that he often
paused to think that existence which
was meaningless and without purpose
was a dream. “I cannot understand
why people aren’t humbled into good-
ness and charity by this very thought.”
He strode quickly. His spare body
retained much of its vigor. “We
painters are often a long-lived bunch
of obsessionals,” he’d said once. “It’s
all that hard manual work. It’s a ridicu-
lous occupation, really.” He recalled
that he had abandoned a promising ca-
reer as a biologist after seeing an exhibi-
tion of early abstract masters
Kandinsky, Mondrian and others.
“We screw ourselves,” he told him-
self. “There’s no need for others to do
it for us.”
He recalled amusedly that, though
he spurned metaphysical and religious
questions as meaningless, people
claimed to find these qualities in his
work. Years ago, when a very young
man, he had entered a canvas in a re-
ligious painting contest and won it.
He returned home relaxed and be-
gan work instantly on the large paint-
ing. He worked steadily for four hours.
The dream recurred that night ex-
cept that this time he was feeling over
the lawn in the early dawn, his feet wet
from the dew, and the creature was
now much, much larger and its leaps
were longer. It gained with every flip-
flop thrust of its great tail. Johnson
ran screaming towards the house and
it seemed that the creature suddenly
slowed.
“Running out of bloody water, my
beauty!” he exulted.
The creature buried its head rav-
enously in the wet grass. And Johnson
screamed very loudly when he saw
what it was doing.
A neighbor, a woman, awakened by
the screaming, ran to the fence and
looked across the lawn. She screamed,
too. A few seconds later, she was the
only one screaming. “Just like a bird
with a locust or a butterfly,” she kept
saying obsessedly later. “Gobbled up.
Like a butterfly.” ■

It was sex.
Yes. It was sex
but it was arrogance too
they were having
having sexual arrogance. (Lots of times.)
According to him, it was her
making him arrogant;
according to her, it was him
making her arrogant.
At least they knew it was
sexual arrogance they were having
because they’d had sex without arrogance &
arrogance without sex all too often
if never before in a foursome
with each other
& now especially humble & grateful

they can’t have with themselves

I’M STILL HERE,
AREN’T I?
by Iris Milutinovic
Iris Milutinovic has won several short
story competitions and has written the
book Talk English Can’t Ya.
THAT WOMAN in the other bed, Mrs
Phillipson, I wonder why they call her
Mary all the time. I wouldn’t like that
so it’s just as well they, nearly always,
call me by my proper name. It’s
strange, isn’t it? I mean, how do they
measure? Mary Phillipson is still quite
beautiful. Mother of five large sons,
grandmother of about a dozen, and
judging by her rather slow speech and
the way her visitors talk and dress
she’s a superior kind of woman soci-
ally, yet she gets called “Mary” by
every little nursing aide in this place.
The cleaners say “Good morning,
Mary” to her and so do the nurses.
Sometimes they call me “Dear” but
usually not more than once or twice.
Perhaps I look forbidding and scare
them off, which is a good thing. It’s bad


enough being here without having to
endure familiarity from 16-year-olds.
Perhaps the difference in treatment is
the difference in speech. Mary Phillip-
son handles words very slowly and
doesn’t speak much, whereas I suppose
you could call me a compulsive conver-
sationalist. Talking and, I hope,
some listening has always made up
much of my life, a rather pleasurable
part. Most people like talking.
Even young babies discover that
conversation is enjoyable and some-
times beguile themselves, as well as
perceptive hearers, by modulating
their voices quite cleverly.
Even if it is all instinctive, it sounds
as if they meant it and they seem to
enthrall and comfort themselves with
the sound of the human voice their
own. I noticed this yesterday when a
visitor who came with a six-month-old
child talked to Mary Phillipson while
her baby conducted a long, varied solo
conversation in the background.
Life, I sometimes find, can still
even in this place offer some inter-
est to offset the shame, the indignity,
the sheer absolute misery of being a
patient in a Permanent Care HOME.
It shouldn’t be called a Home. This
place is properly an institution in
which hygienically to hide the unwant-
ed. The few who are hopelessly lost in a
mental maze are the lucky ones. They
don’t know what’s happening. But the
rest of us ... Doesn’t anyone see that,
underneath these ailing and almost
worn-out bodies, we’re still here? Still
ourselves, wanting and longing for
most of the things we’ve always wanted
and sometimes had.
When I was young, the old stayed
with their own. Oh, yes, they blew up a
few storms and sometimes crucified
their own daughters shat on their
own clean linen, perhaps but they
were there, whole, alive, still loving
and hating, taking and giving. Still
people. But what am I become? Christ,
what am I become? a not-too-
pleasant job for youngsters, a paid job
for the uncaring, and why should they
care?
We’re nothing to do with them.
Nothing at all but we’re still here,
aren’t we underneath, we’re still
here. Still with it. Still with it all.
Now that I can’t read much, I try to
pass the time remembering though,
in truth, all I want to do is forget. For-
get this place, with its dull brick walls
inside and out, windows that are
opened too seldom, artificial
heat that is like a culture in
which the terrible odors of
extreme age proliferate. At
night we must use our bed-
side commodes, even those of
us who can walk and manage
our own toilet needs. All
night the heat pours down
through the ceiling vents un-
til there’s no fresh air left to
breathe. It’s all polluted by
age and corruption and heat.
Perhaps, if we ever felt really
cold, we’d like this excessive
warmth better; I don’t know.
Although I keep remem-
bering the farm and fresh
mornings with sunrise a
glory and the birds singing to
high heaven, it doesn’t seem
to help anymore. I can’t re-
call anything worth having
because I know it’s all gone
for me and finished. Even
Ben and his love. It’s nothing
any more. He was lucky to get
away while he could still
move round and do things for
himself. This place would
have killed Ben but it’s not
killing me soon enough. They
should put something in our
food. It would be kinder.
A long life should surely
make one feel nearer to
truth. But what is truth? If I
say what I truly and honestly
feel, I’ll surely give pain; few
people can take honesty, pre-
ferring to live behind
fireproof doors. Even now, at
almost the end of life, I
wouldn’t dare to be honest
to tell the truth for no one
is alone and it is easy to hurt others.
We are forever linked to other people.
John Donne knew what he knew when
he said, “No man is an island”. Better
perhaps if we were. Islands, I mean.
Because my life has been full and
exciting most of the time, I thought I’d
be safe in age after all, I was the one
who’d had everything and still liked
reading, music, people, and surely al-
ways would enjoy. Nothing, I foolishly
thought, could alter these eternal in-
terests. I was sure age would lead to
real maturity and a kind of freedom
a time to read, think and perhaps ex-
plore one’s own consciousness.
But it isn’t that way. Reading has
failed me and, if it’s the kind I want to
read at all, I’ve yet to find one of those
recorded books I haven’t already read.
Music well, perhaps in a room alone

With his face like a bat

To the young
(for Jay and Aaron)
This is for memory,
long after your face-painted, _
tiger’s stripes have vanished;
when r-r-robyn is possible without
elastic grimaces around the V;
when merry-go-rounds are fixed antiques
their ponies tossed haphazard in a shed,
leftover debris from the past
that neighbours find themselves unable to burn.
But how we ride today
dauntless among the crocus-blaze of lights.
One side
the carillon of tinkling music
wedges us in on excitement,
the other
is mirror
flashing gilt round our joy;
one tall lady
two small boys.
Incongruous
we are caught level in that time-snap,
just enough speed to make us equal
and the horses are real:
hooves gleaming with steel
sweat glistening their sides
red tongues lolling with exertion.
The harbour gapes its blue mouth
surprised.
And I am glad your disbelieving eyes
faced with this scrap from a stranger’s past
swung me from my adult carousal,
abandoned, reckless,
to rush the barrier and clamber aboard,
not fool enough to care.

but not here. Music must be attended
by mind as well as ears and I seem to
be unable to concentrate. People, even
people where have they gone?
Friends sometimes visit but I can no
longer share their lives. What they tell
me I can’t seem to hear I hear the
words but they have no meaning.
Waiting for Godot. Death seems a
friend because it will finish this de-
terioration. But shouldn’t there be
tranquility and the faith that, some-
how, something of us will go on will
survive. I must stop. I won’t won’t
won’t go on thinking like this. It’s stu-
pid and makes no difference. Old
hearts break as easily as young and no
one cares.
It is 4 o’clock on an early summer’s
morning. The room is dark but the first
pale light must be touching sea and sky
outside. And the birds will be waking,
though their voices cannot reach this
dark place. I wish they’d do our room
early but they don’t.
Perhaps about half-past 6, sister
will bustle in pulling up blinds and try-
ing to make her harsh voice sound
cheery and kind. I think she is a kind
woman though she doesn’t like me
since I told her that, sleeping pill or
not, I always wake before dawn.
“Ridiculous,” she said. “It’s just
your stubbornness.”
“I’ve never liked bed too much. I ex-
pect living in the country on a farm has
conditioned me to early rising.”
“Conditioned you. We are smart
this morning, aren’t we?” Why
“smart”, I wondered. Why the obvious
resentment?
I didn’t think I’d said anything re-
markable but she evidently didn’t like
it. Yesterday, one of them asked why I
can’t be tranquil and contented. I don’t
think many old people are. In my case,
all I am is incapable. To move hurts
and tires, so I try to keep still but
inside a volcano would be more like it.
I expect others are the same, though
they lack words to say what they feel.
Perhaps, like me, they sometimes feel
listless emptied by age. No, not emp-
tied; it’s still all there somewhere.
“... someone’s been buying into my company and has
gobbled it all up ...
The child, happy and not happy,
learning a little but never enough. The
girl, feeling but not recognising sex,
hunger, envy, disappointment and
greed. The young married woman, ex-
periencing love, lust, motherhood, be-
trayal, disgust everything was there.
Nothing left out nor, one would have
thought, wasted. At last the tentative
whole person vaguely in view. Then
why did this person this woman,
this I why did she never become
whole? Fulfilment and completion al-
ways just out of sight. Never properly
visualised or known. Why? There must
be a reason. Why am I still incomplete,
wanting things I cannot properly re-
alise, can never have or be?
But I won’t think about anything
except the good things ... Ben making
love to me one summer morning as the
rising sun gilded the grassy bank
where we lay. As he bent above me and
our bodies rose and fell in harmony,
magpies laughed and sang as I wanted
to do as I was doing in my heart.
And the time the local paper printed
what I fondly thought was my poetry
but which experience later revealed
was only sentimental verse. Seeing my
name in print was like drinking cham-
pagne. And when Esther, slow at first,
started to talk without impediment.
And when we bought the farm. All
those great plans, most of which came
to nothing. Most but not all. There was
some fruit, some very good sound fruit.
Age is a desert of time. Hours, days,
weeks, perhaps years with nothing to
do only remember. Some old frail
hands still knit or sew. Some old
hearts pretend they do not suffer, that
all is well. They are the brave ones. My
arthritic hands do nothing. My heart
knows too well its anguish and some-
times cannot carry the burden without
complaint and then I am ashamed.
Now I can hear voices and move-
ment outside. The night has been so
long, so cruelly long. My roommate
still sleeps, lucky woman. The air is
hot, heavy with the unpleasant odors
of ageing bodies and their functions.
The footsteps come to our door. Sister
Morris comes in, goes over, pulls up
the blind and opens the window a frac-
tion.
“Good morning, Mary”, she says
brightly. There is no answer. Mrs
Phillipson is still asleep.
“Good morning, Mrs Austin. Did
you have a good night?” I can be
bright, too, if I try.
“Yes, thank you, Sister. I think it’s
going to be another beautiful day,
don’t you?” ■


Ballad of the Laid-faced dog
This is the saga of Scotty Mcßride,
dogger of famed renown
Great-grandson of a Glasgow lag
deported to Sydney town.
Took to the bush at an early age,
deadly of eye and hand
Seeking the scalps of native dogs,
in a ferine forbidding land.
Battling his way on Queensland miles,
where the dingo thrived and bred
’Til one day to the gate of Springfield run
his adventurous footsteps led.
And under the pepper-trees round the porch
he lost his heart that day
To a servant girl from the shores of Eire
whose name was Katie Mulcahy.
Foundling born in a Dublin slum, red hair
and grey eyes wide
And on instant meeting in love she fell
with the dogger called Scotty Mcßride.
The Springfield squatter gave him a job
at five bob a scalp and meat
And daily he sought the dens of the dogs
in the depth of their wild retreat.
Long weary tramps on acres vast
in the outback’s lonely void
Far beyond living future dreams, all hope
of wealth destroyed.
But the Irish colleen dispensed her love
with a lust that was undenied
To the penniless dogger on pittance pay
whose name was Scotty Mcßride.
The squatter came one day to the camp,
and expression of gloom he wore
For the Bald-faced Dog was back in the hills
he’d vacated a year before.
Merciless canine that loved to kill,
he ravaged the flocks at night
And left in his wake a trail of death
when the moon on the hills gleamed white
“It’s worth a hundred”, the squatter said,
“for each week he costs me more,
To see the scalp of the bald-faced brute
pegged out on the stable door”.
“You’ll get your wish”, said Scotty Mcßride,
“come famine or fire or drought
I’ll lift the scalp of the bald-faced dog
and take the hundred out”.
That night he kept a tryst with Kate,
as the stars winked low and pale
And with tender emotion he listened long
to her sad and sorrowful tale.
“The wages of sin are paid”, she said,
“as soon you will plainly see
The good Lord willed that two should love,
and that two will soon be three”.
“Send word to the Father”, Scotty said,
“let no gossiping tongues deride
In town at noon on Saturday next, I’ll make
you Mrs. Mcßride.
I’ve nothing to offer but love and faith,
and these provide small fare
But go to the church on Saturday next,
and take my oath, I’ll be there”.
Then with nosebag holding limited food,
rifle oiled and clean
He made for the hills where the dingo pest
had the day before been seen.
It was sixteen miles from the homestead gate
to the place where the kill was made
And plain on the floor of that woeful gorge
the tracks of the dog were laid.
’Twas a desolate region the wild tribes shunned,
granite and gibber and sand
Where the spirits of old kaditcha men
with death walked hand in hand.
Three weary days he searched the place,
relentlessly hunting on
’Til his feet by the rocks were blistered raw,
and his scanty grub was gone.
A fire at night he dare not light,
lest it warn his elusive prey
And his muscles ached in the chilling wind
that rose at the break of day.
For the great outback no mercy shows,
and its hardships never abate
And he sweated by day and froze by night
for his dream of a life with Kate.
Suffering unyielding privation and pain
that the forces of nature hurl
For the hope of a fabulous hundred pounds,
and the love of the Irish girl.
Friday dawned and Friday went, and no dingo
dog he spied
Then at dusk he sighted a cluster of rocks
where the ground was barren and dried.
There the wild dog’s lair yawned gloomy and grim
two hundred yards away
And plain in its mouth sat a lean red bitch
with her warrigal pups at play.
And Scotty Mcßride sank down in the brush
to offer a gory prayer
For he knew he had reached the end of his quest
and the goal he sought was near.
Through the long Stygian night he crouched,
by exposure and hunger worn
’Til the sun delivered it’s cheering beams
down that sinister gut forlorn.
Hard by the den stood a statue in red,
its pointed ears alert
With a baldy patch from nose to skull
as white as a dinner shirt.
Dull saffron rocks were a camouflage sound
for the dingo’s rusty hide
“It’s a bloody long chance, but time’s runnin’ out”
said the dogger called Scotty Mcßride.
The wind was wrong and the light was bad
and the marksman’s eyes were tired
But he lined his sights with a prayer for Kate,
Then squeezed the trigger and fired.
“’Tis left in the lurch you are, my girl”,
said the squatter’s bosomy wife
“A shiftless fellow; he’s rolled his swag
and gone for the lick of his life.
“A sad disappointment for all our friends,
and a greater one surely for you
“He hasn’t been heard of since Monday last,
so certain it is he’s untrue”.
Dressed in her bridal best was Kate,
fighting the tears that flowed
Then just as the clock in the church struck
noon, they saw down the rutted road
A long lean figure smothered in dust,
by hunger drawn hard and grim
And Dublin Kate gave a shout of joy.
“Begorrah, it’s him!! It’s him!”.
Wild eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep,
like those of a feral beast
He raised the rifle in bold salute
at the squatter, the girl and the priest.
Exhausted and bloody, unshaven and foul,
but maintaining a true man’s pride
“It’s Saturday noon and I’m keepin’ me word”
said the dogger called Scotty Mcßride.
Then he tossed the scalp of the bald-faced
dog in the dust at the squatter’s feet
“Here’s what yer asked for, boss”, he said,
“though he bloody near had me beat”.
“You can write a cheque for a hundred quid,
to give us a start in life
I’ve taken the scalp of the killer dog,
now I’ll take the girl to wife.
“I’m hardly dressed as a groom should be,
but me heart is duty bound
And perhaps I’ll be able to buy a suit
when the christenin’ time comes round”.
Out on a free selection block,
by a river sluggish and slow
Lives a man with a sizeable bank account,
and it isn’t so long ago
That he hunted the dogs for starvation pay;
now the children he loves with pride
Are the riotous offspring of Kate Mulcahy
and her husband Scotty Mcßride.

REFLECTIONS
ON A
LITERARY LIFEE-
an interview with Betty Roland
BETTY ROLAND playwright, novelist and author of a
remarkable book about Russia in the 19305, Caviar for Breakfast
at the age of 81 has just published her autobiography,
The Eye of the Beholder. For 10 years she lived in
Australia and Russia with the communist scholar Guido Baracchi
and for more than seven years lived (platonically) with Justus
Jorgensen and his extraordinary community at Montsalvat.
by Giulia Giuffré
Why do you write? Do you think
about that or do you just write be-
cause it’s natural to do so?
Why do I write? In the beginning, it
was a means of escape. When I was
nine, I went to boarding school and
was very unhappy. You see, I was a
country child; I could ride, round up
sheep, skin a rabbit and all the other
girls were city children very refined
and thought I was peculiar, so my
great solace was the school library. I
had had a very sketchy education and
the only subject I was good at was
English composition. Oh, and Scrip-
ture. I once got 100 marks for Scrip-
ture. Then, one day I remember it
clearly I was writing an essay and
realised that it was even more exciting
than reading a book. It was the first
thrill of creating something of my own
and I knew that I wanted to be a writer.
I forgot all about being homesick and
lonely and that’s the way it is with
writing: It’s the best therapy I know;
you forget your troubles once you sit at
the typewriter.
When you started reading, what
were your favorite sort of books?
The first book I remember was a lav-
ishly illustrated book of Shakespeare.
There were scraps of dialogue under-
neath the pictures and I can remember
painstakingly spelling them out. That
probably accounts for my love of the
theatre. I started off as a playwright,
you know. Then there were the
Waverley novels, I adored Walter
Scott’s Ivanhoe, The Talisman and
Quentin Durwood. I was a true roman-
tic. Then there was Ethel Turner and
Mary Grant Bruce, the Greek myths
and legends I devoured them all.
Do you consciously model your
characters on people you know? Do
you model your heroines on yourself
or do you feel that it’s inevitable
that some self-portraiture will come
through?
I think it’s inevitable. Someone
said, “We sign our name on every page
we write” and I agree with that. As to
modelling my characters on people
that I know, to some extent that’s true.
But you only select certain incidents or
certain characteristics and then you
enlarge on them, let your imagination
take over. For example, I spent some
time in the Northern Territory and
years afterward I wrote a novel called
Beyond Capricorn. It was set in the
Territory and little incidents I thought
I had forgotten began popping up out
of my subconscious: scraps of dialogue,
the way the stockmen walk and sit a
horse, faces, scenery. They all helped
to make the story real. If I hadn’t been
there and seen them for myself, it
would not have been so good.
In your book Caviar For Breakfast
you say: “What skill I may have
must be used to serve the party line.
Farewell ART!” And you did that for
a time, didn’t you?
Indeed, I did. I wrote political
propaganda plays, articles, even
verses. That requires a certain amount
of skill but has nothing to do with art.
And what made you stop that sort of
writing?
Disillusionment. I was a member of
the Communist Party at the time it
was 1935 to 1939 and after the
Hitler/Stalin non-aggression pact I
lost my faith in Stalinism and began to
write for radio. I did that because I had
to earn a living. Not much art in that
but it was good practice, good disci-
pline.
What that you’ve done do you think
is art? What do you think art is?
That’s a curly one! What constitutes
true art and what doesn’t is largely a




matter of personal taste, so let’s stick
to the first half of the question. I can
look back on my first play, The Touch
Of Silk, with a good deal of satisfac-
tion. I wouldn’t say it was great art like
Chekhov or Moliere or Shakespeare
but it had merit.
Then there is the book I wrote
about the island of Lesbos; I’m not
ashamed of that or Caviar For Break-
fast which is an account of the 15
months I spent in the Soviet Union. I
think they have some merit. And a play
called Granite Peak not an earth-
shaker but I think it’s good. Then there
are the five books for children. The
kids seem to like them and that says
something but I’d never class them as
high art. Never in the same class as
The Water Babies, Kipling’s Just So
Stories, Alice In Wonderland ... I’d
class them as great art.
Where would you place your roman-
tic novels? Do you make any apol-
ogy for them?
No, I don’t. They were workmanlike,
they fitted into their category: Good
lively entertainment but have no pre-
tensions about being works of art.
What do you feel about the way in
which women are portrayed in those
romantic novels? They tend to be
very concerned about their appear-
ance and rather subservient to their
men and they devote themselves to
love and follow it mostly.
I suppose you could say they are re-
flections of myself.
We’ll get onto that! I’m quoting
from The Other Side Of Sunset
where the heroine says: “Whatever
Tony decided, she would follow
him.”
To tell the truth, I wouldn’t mind
following Tony myself. He’s the kind of
man I would have liked when I was
young. I was a country girl, remember,
and to live on a beautiful country prop-
erty and breed thoroughbred horses
and stud sheep and pedigreed dogs was
my ideal. Especially with a man like
Tony.
Your heroes are nice but do you
think that attitude would be some-
what anachronistic today?
Oh, I don’t know. You can’t general-
ise about these things; you can only
speak for yourself. In these days of the
liberated woman, that attitude is sheer
heresy but I don’t think so. I believe
that living with the man you love and
admire is better than any career and
I’m speaking as a very liberated
woman. But that was none of my
choosing. I was “liberated” in spite of
myself when the man I’d been living
with for 10 years went off with another
woman and left me to fend for myself.
What happened to him? Did he ever
want to come back to you?
No, no! He never went back to any
of the women in his life and there
were quite a few of them. He always
went on to “fresh fields and pastures
new.”
Do you think that perhaps you
achieved more because he left you?
No question about that. I would
never have done the amount of writing
that I did. I had to. It was a case of
economic necessity. So he did me a ser-
vice in a way, though it didn’t seem like
it at the time.
And did you find it difficult to meet
other men?
Not difficult to meet them but diffi-
cult to form a permanent relationship.
The shock of losing Guido had made
me distrustful, I was wary of men.
You’ll read all about that in this new
book of mine. As well as being a bi-
ography of the painter Justus
Jorgensen, there’s a lot about me as
well.
This Jorgensen you write about. Did
you have an affair with him?
No never! Physically, he didn’t
attract me but mentally he interested
me enormously. Because I was a writer
above anything else, he fascinated me.
I knew that in him there was a wonder-
ful story. Also, he never bored me
which is more than can be said of most
men I knew.
Were there other major
men in your life after
Baracchi?
Not really. Temporary
affairs, that’s all.
Did that make you cynical
or unhappy?
Both, I’d say. I’ve got a
peculiar attitude toward the
male sex. I like them yet dis-
trust them. I think men are
awful, really.
Why?
They can be so brutal.
They’re wonderful while
they’re in love with you but
when they fall out of love
they’re absolutely vile. No
mercy, no pity. The nicest
men I’ve known are homosex-
uals; they’re sensitive, intelli-
gent and sympathetic but not
much good as husbands.
Particularly in your ro-
mantic novels, you seem to
have an ambivalent re-
sponse to that very quality
of brutality you are
describing: it may be brutal but it’s
also exciting.
Yes, it is. Someone said to me: “You
like forceful men,” which is true. I
can’t bear weak men; I need someone
strong.
Was your husband, Ellis Davies, a
weak man?
No, he was a very strong man, a
powerful character.
Why didn’t you get on with him?
For one thing, he was 21 years older
than I was and we weren’t in tune at
all. I wrote The Touch Of Silk while I
was married to him and he didn’t like
that at all. I can understand that. He
felt it was a threat to him, that I was
breaking away and, of course, I was. At
the same time, he was proud of me. It
was a hopeless situation, really.
Do you regard those years as lost in
any way?
Nothing is lost absolutely
nothing! Even the blackest years are
good for your development, especially
for a writer.
How did you meet Guido? Was it
through the Communist Party?
No, I met him in Jorgensen’s studio.
He had a studio in Brighton long be-
fore he went to Montsalvat. It became
a centre for Melbourne’s intelligentsia.
All kinds of interesting people used to
gather there: painters, writers, musi-
cians, philosophers, poets, even com-
munists, and that’s how I met Guido.
To what extent do you think your
political beliefs were influenced by
Inner history
Events collide, and compete in memory.
These are the things I build summer on:
prising cockles from rocks at Burleigh Heads,
being summoned to salads of tomato and sand;
watching the jewelled sides of fish
flipping around the rented boat,
kid-ignorant of the story of pain.
Long walks over dunes chasing ghost crabs,
ignoring the clear language of the sea.
Driving home, we would stop at roadside stalls
to prod avocados and admire sliced pawpaws
oozing a shiny caviare of seed.
Half-dozing with my sisters
we’d awake near Brisbane’s bridges
looped across the river, slack strands of pearls.
I still return to watch the sea:
it threatens to master me
with images I never fully understand.
PETER E. LUGG


personal involvement with Guido?
Tremendously. You might say “al-
most totally.” Someone said to me:
“You’re not a communist; you’re only
in love with a communist.” I was very
indignant at that but have to admit
that it was largely true.
Would you say that you are a
apolitical now?
Absolutely. I have no confidence in
either the left or the right.
Do you have any opinions about
issues such as the arms race or
world peace?
Of course I support world peace but
I don’t believe it’s possible. I did at the
time of the Spanish Civil War. I
marched and shouted slogans and did
all the things the anti-nuclear people
are doing now. And what did we
achieve? Nothing, absolutely nothing.
Franco won the war, then came World
War II and Hiroshima. How desperate-
ly we fought against all that but it just
rolled on like a great juggernaut and
nothing we could do made any differ-
ence. You can’t do anything against
the great powers. They’ve got all the
aces.
When you say you’re apolitical, do
you think there’s not much to
choose between the left and the
right?
I think I prefer the left. At least
they’re fighting for an ideal. But I feel
a little sorry for them, they so seldom
win. On the other hand, look what hap-
pened when the left got into power in
the Soviet Union. Nothing could be
more pitiless or more ruthless or more
unscrupulous than the people in Com-
intern. “Absolute power means absol-
ute corruption” didn’t Karl Marx
say that?
Here in Australia, have you found
any party person or commune
that gives you any kind of hope?
What did Montsalvat, for instance,
represent?
That, too, was an ideal and to many
people it spelled hope for better things.
What was this ideal?
In a way, it was another version of
joining the Communist Party. You did
not go there for yourself, you were
there to serve something greater than
yourself in this case, Justus
Jorgensen. You could say he was a dic-
tator, he certainly demanded implicit
obedience. But there are a lot of people
who don’t mind being told what they
should do; it saves them having to de-
cide for themselves. For a time, it
worked surprisingly well. That’s when
all those beautiful buildings were built.
He was an extraordinary man, he was
in love with the middle ages and
wanted to be like the Medici and
Lorenzo the Magnificent. That’s why
Montsalvat looks like a medieval vil-
lage. It is an incredible achievement
and all done by willpower and a hand-
ful of devoted people.
Artists?
Not all of them. They were a mixed
lot but they all took painting lessons,
though none of them got very far with
that.
What was your role in Montsalvat?
Were you as detached as you seem?
I tried very hard to attach myself, I
really did. When my relationship with
Guido broke up, I felt very much alone
vulnerable, you might say. And I
thought I could find a refuge at
Montsalvat. But it didn’t work; I
couldn’t conform. Jorgensen de-
manded too much obedience and I was
too strong willed. If he’d been a bit
more tactful, less dogmatic, I would
probably have stayed there.
How long did you stay?
I was there for two years, from 1948
till 1950. After that, I went to Europe
for several years and didn’t come back
to Montsalvat till 1972 and this time
stayed for seven years.
What brought you back?
The book, of course. I wanted to
write it more than anything else in life
and could only do it by being at
Montsalvat.
Did you notice much difference
after the intervening time?
Yes, especially in Jorgensen. He
had had a lot of disappointments, a lot
of his original people had either died
or got disillusioned and there were
only half-a-dozen left and he was a
very chastened man. He didn’t want to
dominate. He’d grown rather sweet
and was extremely nice to me. I think
he was glad to have someone come
back to him. None of the others did. I
got very fond of him in those last years.
I’d always admired him, though there
were times when I detested him. But he
was intelligent; that’s a thing that
fascinates me. I can forgive almost
anything as long as the person is intel-
ligent.
You left Montsalvat in 1979. Where
did you go? What did you do?
I came to live in Sydney. Jorgensen
had died two years before that and
Montsalvat wasn’t the same. Also, I’d
got all the material I needed for the
book but felt that I had failed. I’d
worked on it for years and years and
was never satisfied, so thought I’d give
up the attempt. But it kept on nagging
at me and I rewrote it for the sixth
time. Now, warts and all, it’s being
published and I don’t know if I’ve suc-
ceeded or failed.
When you look back on your life,
what do you remember in particular
or is it all a rich tapestry? Do you
think about your life?
Yes, indeed I do. I live alone, you
know, and there’s nothing like that /
to make you introspective. I’ve /
grown to like solitude; I didn’t /
at first but it was very good /
for me. It helped to make /
me strong and
ant. It also made me /
very unhappy at /
times but that /
was also goody'

for me. It helped me to understand
other people, also get to know myself.
Do you belive in God?
At times I don’t but there seems to
be a curious sort of pattern in my life
that makes me wonder. Let’s say I’m
an agnostic and leave it at that.
Do you think about death?
Sometimes. Death’s alright. I’m not
afraid of death.
Have you come to terms with death?
I did when I was quite young. I was
very ill and met him face to face. It was
a strange experience, as I was in no
pain and quite conscious but I knew
that in the next few hours I might be
going to die. I had T.B. and was
haemorrhaging very badly and there
was no blood transfusion in those
days. So I just lay there, getting
weaker and feeling very peaceful. The
thought of struggling my way back to
health was too much trouble; I just
wanted to quietly slip away and death
seemed like a friend who was going to
set me free. Since then, I’ve never been
afraid of him. And, the older I get, the
less I’ve been afraid.
You have said that what you believe
in is a “fair go” for everyone, toler-
ance for the other person’s point of
view. Is that your statement?
Yes, I absolutely believe in that
though I don’t exactly support the idea
that “to know all is to forgive all.” Cer-
tain things are unforgivable. But I
loathe intolerance. I hate dogmatism,
people who think that their ideas are
right and everybody else is wrong. I
just don’t want to know them. Sinners?
They’re alright, they’re generally
rather nice. At least they’re human. ■
THE BUSH CHRONICLES
OF STEELE RUDD
AND CLEMENT SEMMLER
by Clement Semmler
Former deputy general manager of the ABC,
Clement Semmler has written several books, the
best known being The Banjo of the Bush -a
biography of Banjo Patterson
IT IS almost 90 years ago that Arthur
Hoey Davis, then a 27-year-old Queens-
land public servant, had the first of his
“Selection” sketches (Starting The Sel-
ection) published in The Bulletin. He
used the pseudonym Steele Rudd a
combination of his admiration for the
English essayist and dramatist
Richard Steele and of a love of rowing
(Davis was writing a column on the
sport for a Brisbane journal and he
wanted to bring into the name some
part of a boat, so “rudder” was trunc-
ated.)
It has always seemed to me some-
thing of a literary tragedy that these
vignettes of outback life a unique
contribution to Australian writing
should have degenerated, as the years
have passed, into the tasteless slap-
stick of “Dad and Dave”.
This was largely because dramatisa-
tion of the Selection stories or, more
precisely, of the characters (since inci-
dent and dialogue came more and more
to be invented) for film, stage and
eventually radio focused almost wholly
on the farcical. It was the inevitable
element of a process that began with
the caricaturists.
When the first collection of Rudd’s
pieces was published by The Bulletin,
in 1899, as On Our Selection (now a
collector’s item), it was profusely illus-
trated by the journal’s powerful stable
of cartoonists including George Lam-
bert, Frank Mahony, Alf Vincent and
others. But they tended to slant their
drawings toward the humor of the
crude and ridiculous, to the exclusion
of the real purposes of Rudd’s writing.
Indeed, Rudd once complained to
Vance Palmer that the artists “in-
creased the pace” as he wrote more
and more stories they had to have
poor old Dad falling down a well or
being trampled by a cow or have Dave
being snagged in a bramble bush. It
was a development which, as far as the
central character of the stories went,
left very little of the sturdy cocky-farm


er and the homespun of his grit and
determination in battling with an en-
vironment of drought, dust, crows and
heat and one, incidentally, which
led to the gradual deterioration of the
literary quality of the stories. Much of
the great deal that Rudd wrote after
the early Selection books has, rightly,
gone into limbo.
For what Rudd was getting at in his
early sketches was that the life of these
early outback pioneers was so poor,
spiritually as well as materially, that
what may have seemed absurd to the
reader was not at all absurd to them-
selves; in an almost miraculous way
human dignity was preserved even
in the more comic episodes which
could so easily in themselves be inter-
preted in terms of vulgar farce.
Perhaps I can put it in another way
and be forgiven for injecting autobio-
graphical notes ...
I spent the first 15 years of my life in
a situation similar to that of the
Rudds. My father was a cocky-farmer
in the Murray Mallee of South Austra-
lia, an environment no less hostile and
disheartening than that of Emu Creek
in the Darling Downs. Somehow, in the
drought and heat, our family contrived
to wrest some sort of existence just
as the Rudds did.
There were no regular newspapers,
no postal deliveries it was a matter
of a sulky journey over an horrendous
bush track to the nearest township.
But among the few things to read,
apart from the family Bible, was The
Bulletin (which was, indeed, the
bushie’s bible) and, as I well remem-
ber, copies of some of the Selection
books with their tattered paper covers.
They were read, re-read and loved
largely because we appreciated them
as a true picture of those in our pos-
ition. We knew how hard life was on
the land; it seemed a good thing that
others, especially city people and those
somewhere in power, should know too.
There was an old saying that it took
three generations to make a successful
farm in the Australian bush, the first
and second generations being worked
to death or ruined on the way. We
didn’t go the full distance. But, in the
time we battled it out in the bush, our
experience and that of so many others
in our position paralleled uncannily
the Steele Rudd stories. That was why
we read him so avidly and with such
enjoyment and why, I am sure, the
stories sold in such remarkable num-
bers in those early days.
We well understood that much of
Rudd’s humor stemmed from neces-
sary evils. Certain facts of life were in-
evitable. Before we sat down to eat in
our kitchen-eating room, with its
galvanised iron roof, we used sheets of
newspaper to drive the flies out. De-
spite temperatures of well above 100
Fahrenheit (38C), the wood stove
burned all day during those pitiless
summers as it had to. There was no
refrigerator the word had not been
invented not even a cool safe. We
had no running water it was got in
buckets as it was needed, from the
underground tank outside. (We often,
with good reason, had awful doubts
about what was in the tank.)
When we sat down to eat, the invari-
able parental exhortation was “Go
easy on the butter, boys.” There were
more famines than feasts and I can re-
member one winter when we ate boiled
wheat and treacle (not for nothing was
treacle called “cocky’s joy”). So when
we read in Steele Rudd that, at an
evening meal, “Mother sat silently at
the end and poured out the tea while
Dad, at the head, served the pumpkin
and divided what cold meat there was,
Mother wouldn’t have any meat one
of us would have had to go without if
she had taken any ..we warmed to
Rudd because we realised how well he
understood our situation.
The sketch A Splendid Year For
Com begins: “We had just finished
supper. Supper! Dry bread and
sugarless tea.” That was within our ex-
perience, too. And, similarly, how we
appreciated this passage from “When
The Wolf Was At The Door: “Dave’s
only pair of pants were pretty well
worn off him; Joe hadn’t a decent coat
for Sundays; Dad himself wore a pair
of boots with soles tied on with wire.”
This was all gospel to those of our gen-
eration who walked five kilometres in
bare feet to the little bush school.
I can remember my father sitting in
front of the kitchen stove in hopeless
resignation, none of us daring to say a
word, when (in a bad year anyhow) a
mice plague had pretty well finished
our wheat. But at least there was fel-
low feeling in the last passage of
Rudd’s Our First Harvest where, after
the storekeeper had told Dad that the
return from his corn hadn’t even
cleared his store account:
... he went home and sat on a block
and stared into the fire with his
chin resting in his hands till
Mother laid her hand upon his
shoulder and asked him kindly what
was the matter. Then he drew the
storekeeper’s bill from his pocket
and handed it to her, and she too sat
down and gazed into the fire.
THEN there was the loneliness of the
bush, so feelingly described by Henry
Lawson in such a story as The Drover’s
Wife. It is hard to realise in this age of
the motor car and aeroplane, of good
roads and rapid communications. But,
in the days of bush tracks and the
nearest neighbors many miles away,
there is a wealth of understanding in
this passage from Starting The Selec-
tion:
I often wonder how the women
stood it in the first few years and I
can remember how Mother, when
she was alone, used to sit on a log
where the lane is now and cry for
hours. Lonely! It was lonely.
It was Rudd’s capacity to discern
and describe the comic relief of this
often sad, bitter and back-breaking
existence that made him such a popu-
lar writer in his day. If some of his
humor was primitive it was because
much of life was primitive. In that con-
Economy
He used to chop the wood
With what he called,
“A Canadian splitter. Adze and axe
In one, you know”.
When he swung and cleaved the air,
The dogs knew they could stand close,
No chips flew and wood yawned clean.
When he carved the flesh,
Deciding who was for leg
And who was for wing,
The goose was stripped to frame.
When the young sheep’s neck was slit,
The white, chipped, enamel basin
Caught the spurt for dogs lick.
When the rabbits had been shot,
Always in the eye,
He gutted the inner warmth
With sudden grip and pull.
When he lifted bales of hay,
Always two for balance,
There was a gasp of rhythm.
When he threw the shorn fleece,
It landed flat and whole,
And helpers skirted fast
Around the grease-grown boards.

Few people can experience the regal quality you'll
find in Toyota Crown Royal Saloon.
It's not just that it is a very exclusive car, Crown also sets
very high standards.
The fact is, for all their princely price tags, a lot of
so-called luxury cars offer you relatively few standard
features.
Our crowning glory is that Toyota Crown is one of the
few offering a complete set of standards, each a gem of
luxury and engineering.
Such as our full frame chassis. A feature shared with only
a few other cars in the world, one of them being the
Rolls-Royce.
Combine this with fully independent suspension with
Toyota Suspension Tuning and Crown
becomes one of the smoothest, quietest
cars on the road.
TOYOTA SUSPENSION TUNING
Whilst exterior styling is elegantly understated, the
interior is quite palatial.
You're pampered with such luxury features as
power windows, automatic air conditioning, moquette cloth
seats, electronic AM/FM stereo cassette with motorised
antenna and six speakers, central door locking, cruise
control, full instrumentation and a telescopic tilt steering
column.
There's even a small refrigerator to keep drinks cool!

This power is matched with ventilated four wheel disc
brakes and four speed automatic overdrive transmission.
And handled with a minimum of fuss with speed
sensitive power steering.
But, possibly our crowning achievement is that Crown

text we accept passages like this, from
the opening of the story When Joe Was
In Charge:
Joe was a naturalist. He spent a
lot of time ... in ear-marking bears
and bandicoots and catching
goannas and letting them go with-
out their tails or coupled in pairs
with pieces of greenhide. The pad-
dock was full of goannas in harness
and slit-eared bears. They belonged
to Joe.
WHAT MIGHT be seen as cruelty, was
a fact of life in the bush. In my day, we
killpd our own sheep and pigs and
some of the details are indescribable.
We could extract humor from the chop-
ping-off of the rooster’s head for the
weekend pot when its convulsive death
throes scattered blood over the axe-
wielder. So it is that some of the humor
of the Selection stories has an element
of cruelty related to the commonplace
brutalities of the bush environment.
The RSPCA, had it existed then,
would have had field days at Shingle
Hut. In We Embark In The Bear Indus-
try, when Dad had found out that bear-
skins fetched five shillings each and
times were bad, and he, Dave and Joe
set out with dogs, sticks and a toma-
hawk we know what to expect. And
in the day-by-day life on the Selection
foals were staked, kangaroos suffered
dreadful fates, horses were stirred into
action with rocks and waddies and
cows were found bogged with their
eyes picked out by crows. And it was
fair enough for A. D. Hope to stigma-
tise as “pretty barbarous” fun an epi-
sode in One Christmas where Dad, with
a long knife and an axe, set out to kill a
cow. But all this goes back to the hon-
esty with which Rudd chronicled life
on his parents’ selection it was this
very honesty that struck so many
chords among the readers of his day.
Rudd, like other great Australian
short-story writers such as Lawson,
Brian James and E. 0. Schlunke, had a
particular genius for pithy descrip-
tions of the bush “characters” of the
pioneering days. His story Cranky Jack
is near enough to a classic about the
traveller who arrived one day at
Shingle Hut without a swag:
And such a man. Tall, bony,
heavy-jawed, shaven with a reaping-
hook, apparently. He had a thick
crop of black hair, shaggy, unkempt
and full of grease, grass and frag-
ments of dry gumleaves. On his
head were two old felt hats, one
sewn inside the other. On his back a
shirt made from a piece of blue
blanket, with white cotton stitches
striding up and down it like lines of
fencing . . .
THEN there was Casey who arrived
one day . a starved-looking, tooth-
less little old man with a restless eye,
talkative, ragged and grey, he walked
with a bend in his back (not a hump)
and carried his chin in the air.” And
flitting between the sketches was Dad’s
oldest son, Dan (Daniel Damascus
Rudd), the prodigal a ne’er-do-well,
kicked out as often as he was welcomed
home. Rudd’s descriptions of the love-
hate relationship between Dad and
Dan are among the highlights of his
better sketches. I keep saying “better
sketches” because it is the consensus
of the regrettably few critical studies
of his work that his claim to literary
fame lies in only a few of his earlier
books.
His output, from the time On Our
Selection appeared to his last book
The Rudd Family, in 1925 was pro-
lific. He wrote 23 books, including two
unremarkable novels, and attempting
to capitalise on his earlier successes he
brought out in 1904 Steele Rudd’s
Magazine which survived for 4 years
and was revived as Steele Rudd’s Xmas
Annual in the 19205.
Yet, much of his writing remains
ephemeral I think because, to use
that ugly but apt word, he tried too
much to commercialise his output.
Thus, his short sketches about the
prodigal Dan led to The Book Of Dan.
The success of The Parson And The
Scone prompted the series The Poor
Parson. His experience as a public ser-
vant (he became Under-Sheriff of the
Queensland Supreme Court) gave the
background for Dad In Politics.
But none of these is worth serious
attention. Rather, it is on a handful of
his early collected sketches On Our
Selection, Our New Selection, Stocking
Our Selection, Sandy’s Selection and
possibly the later Grandpa’s Selection
that Rudd’s reputation rests. And it
is enough to guarantee his place in our
literary history for his best stories are
unique in that, as H. M. Green wrote,
“... in them, the native strain in Aus-
tralian literature appears almost un-
affected by influences from overseas.”
This is what Archibald and A. G.
Stephens of the early Bulletin recog-
nised from the beginning and to
them and their journal it is, thus, a
further debt we owe among their great
discoveries of Australian writing in the
1890 s. ■

of my Antarctic nights
they wander

meandering circles,
tragic purpose

I am an icicled man

I live
in the pit of my stomach
singing stupidly
at the top of my voice
and glancing back

ray dreams are majestic
penguins, Emperors and Kings
waddling
with their wings clipped
they’d look down on me
if they could,
the little bastards
are so proud
of their clean kingdom
their sunnier sun
and driven snow
and underfoot the ice
of milleniums
is keeping its silent secrets
from the scratching
and shuffling
of these ancient webbed feet, oh

my dogs are uncontrollable
they are sexually

ALAN CLOSE


THE KIDS
by Dianne Highbridge
Sydney-born Dianne Highbridge lives in Tokyo where
she is writing a book on Japanese folk art. She
is the author of The Unequal Half -Women
in Australia since 1978.
THE ROAR of the trucks along the
highway is blurred, absorbed by the
heat waves that rise up from the metal-
grey surface of the road like mist from
a river. Some of the trucks must be
coming from the city where I know the
streets are deep and shady, smelling of
flower shops and coffee, and where the
spray that lifts off the harbor glitters
and falls prickling cool on the up-
turned faces of the people leaning
against the rail of the Manly ferry.
They have to cross a glaring wilder-
ness of flag-hung used-car yards and
factories that smell, instead, of
smoking oil and hot steel and baking
biscuits, before at last they come out
here among the poultry farms and
Maltese fruit stalls and furtive caravan
parks of the almost-country. They will
climb with grinding gears along the
dotted purple line that is the route of
the explorers in my Social Studies
book and they will coast down the
other side, out onto the plains the
sunlit plains extended further than
I have ever been.
In Mr Roberts’ garden beside the
highway (weeded by the boys on after-
noons when we girls sew pink cesarine
into ink-stained aprons under the
placid eye of Mrs Roberts), the veg-
etables lie wilting on their beds.
The dogs wait panting under the
teatrees, haunches spread in the dust,
yellow eyes fixed on the verandah
where the doors of the schoolrooms
stand open. Noses lift and ears prick at
the sounds drifting out onto the heavy
air, barely distinguishable through the
endless shrill of cicadas the low
barks and murmurs of teachers, a
chanted table or muted handclaps, the
drawn-out whisper of pages turning in
unison.
Inside, we 101 l over our books,
colored pencils drooping from sweaty
fingers. At the back of the room there
is less pretence. There, hands fumble
under the lids of desks with pencil
cases and matchboxes of treasures (lo-
custs or berries), with ruined nibs
carve symbols into the already deeply
pitted wood, scratch secrets on scraps
of paper. Everywhere toes, bare or in
damp cotton socks, curve around the
cool iron scrolls of the desks tracing
the intricate shapes over and over. Hot
cheeks rest on clammy forearms.
I jump as a piece of chalk comes
hurtling through the air. I jump
though I know it’s not for me. It hits
the floor and splinters between my feet
and the feet of Michael McGee who
sits across the aisle.
“That boy! Out the front and on the
double!” Mr Roberts remembers the
Western Desert. Our commands are
military. At assembly, he cries: “Ten-
shun! Stand at ease!”
Michael stands up and walks, but
not fast, to Mr Roberts’ desk, by the
blackboard. There is no bravado in his
walk.
He puts out his hand. Mr Roberts, a
tall man, thin and flexible as his cane,
bends back a little from the waist,
keeping his eyes on the target. He
raises the cane carefully so as not to
break the light bulb above with its
swish. Quick and accurate, the cane
cracks down. And three more times.
Michael McGee returns to his seat.
He doesn’t grimace or exchange wry
grins with the other boys. He sits look-
ing at his hands between his knees. It
is known that he never carves the num-
ber of cuts he’s had into the underside
of the desk lid, as the others do. He
keeps no score.
There is no letting out of breath. I
stare at my open exercise book, at the
Olympic rings, at wool bales represen-
ting exports. I have colored in the
bales, shading the sides to give a re-
alistic rounded effect. This page bears
a red tick and a stamped star.
Mr Roberts catches a movement in
the front row.
“Something funny, Barry?” he asks.
Barry, who is retarded, smiles his
broad smile and nods his neat brown
curls. Mr Roberts often enjoys a joke
with him. When Mr Roberts reads out
the test results, he always says: “And
Barry did very well!” and Barry beams
around the room. But Barry never gets
the cane and he’s allowed to mix the
ink.
Is it over? Whispers break out. Mr
Roberts sighs. “All right. Hands on
heads,” he says. We raise our arms
heavily. And so we- sit and watch the
minute hand of the clock edge its way
around to home time.
A blowfly bangs frantically against
a window pane and Mr Roberts scoops
it outside with the edge of his rollbook.
The sound of cicadas seeps in to fill
the room, in the absence of any
other. They’re out there all
around, green beauties puls-
ing with their harsh sweet
shrill. My head is filled
with them and my
arms hurt.

wipes his red

A transparency divides
air from air.

face with his chalky handkerchief. And
gives the signal. We may go.
Carefully, we put our books in our
desks and do not bang the lids. Care-
fully, we walk to the door, walk to the
edge of the verandah, walk not jump
down the steps and then away we go,
screaming, giggling and pushing into
the sunlight.
The dogs go crazy. “Get away from
here with those animals!” bawls Mr
Roberts and their owners make off
with the dogs snapping and wagging
after them.
Those of us who get the school bus
straggle down to the highway where
we’re supposed to wait in line. A young
infants’ teacher is on bus duty. She’s
laughing with the little kids and pre-
tending to knock their heads together.
As I clamber into the bus behind
Heather, my best friend, I see my little
sister’s head down the back yellow
fringe and big, round glasses. She’s sit-
ting next to Heather’s little brother
and he’s kissing her. Heather and I
pretend not to know them as we shove
past.
The bus driver is handsome, my
favorite. As we drive along the high-
way, he turns dangerously in his seat
and roars, “Sit down, youse kids! Sit
down or I’ll come back there and bite
youse!”
I look out of the window and I see
the McGees, Michael and his little
brother, walking home. They walk
every day, in all weathers, and we
usually overtake them here near the
old general store. They walk side by
side along the dusty edge of the road,
in their grey shorts and grey shirts and
grey socks and their shoes that are pol-
ished to an unvarying brightness.
Their mother keeps them so tidy. Their
shirts are patched with very tiny
stitches that you can hardly see. I
think their mother cuts their hair, too.
It’s strange, cut longer on top and
shaved fiercely up the back of the neck
so they look old-fashioned and some-
how institutional, like soldiers or the
kids from the Home near the convent.
The McGees live in a shed. Not a
shed made into a house but the old
shed at the back of the Thompsons’
place, with a dirt floor and a tin roof.
When the McGees first came from up
the country, with their things in the
back of their old utility and nowhere to
go, Mr Thompson met Mr McGee in a
pub. Mrs McGee and the kids were
waiting outside, asleep in the truck,
and so Mr Thompson whether out of
the goodness of his heart or because
he was looking for rent offered to let
them live there for a while.
If the McGees are paying rent for
the shed, it’s a disgrace, says my
mother, because it has no running
water and no electricity. Mrs McGee
cooks on a kerosene stove. She carries
water for washing in buckets from the
Thompsons’ outside tap and boils it up
in a drum over an open fire. Sometimes
you can see her through the trees
chopping wood for the fire.
The place where we live is very quiet
and there’s something about the clear-
ness of the air and the way the land
lies that makes sounds carry. In the
early evenings you can hear a dog bark
a mile away, somebody’s cocky calling
a long-grown-up child in for tea (“Pa-
atrick! Pa-atrick!”), the keening of a
cow that has lost its calf. At that time
of day, the sound of Mrs McGee’s axe
falling floats pure as bells through the
bush.
Oh, but this axe the one she uses
to chop firewood is the one she has
been seen desperately trying to hide
some nights when her husband is
home late from the pub. She has been
seen running with the axe in her arms,
in the headlights of the utility drawn
up outside the shed. She carried it
once down to Mrs Thompson, appear-
ing on the Thompsons’ verandah, rat-
tling the locked screen door, thrusting
it into Mrs Thompson’s hands and beg-
ging her to keep it till morning, then
turning back without another word
into the darkness.
The McGees are not rowdy; far from
it. Their voices are not heard after Mr
McGee comes home, early or late. But
Mrs McGee hides the axe and once Mr
Collector cemetery
LATE WINTER
Old afternoon surrounds us with threat of coming frost;
we are foraging for family names on fallen blocks of stone.
Weedhigh, the place is overgrown and we are careful of our feet,
thinking of snakes waking early from their winter’s sleep,
leaving the dead’s cold company to slough among the living.
An old woman, cardiganned and gloved against the cold,
flutters about us with eyes as beggars for casual talk.
(Nodding, we pass, looking for chisel marks which spell our name.)
Starved of speech and company, she claims our caring,
makes herself our guide and is a shadow to our seeking.
“That’s a bushranger’s grave,” she tells us. “A priest lies there;
a trooper’s buried here, murdered a hundred years ago.
All, poor souls, carried here from the Church across the road.”
A little mist hovers about its spire as she pours out words
which move like fingers in the evening, begging sympathy.
Slyly, she guides us through the monuments of other dead
and finds, by chance it seems, the newer mound of dirt
that is her husband’s grave, a few months’ buried;
and talks of lost family, of children gone, of loneliness,
so that, compelled to hear, we’ll weep and pray a while with her.
Walking among the weeds which hide the unknown dead,
we find at last three stones which are the shards of family,
pieces of past dropped like debris out of memory;
and she, beside us, needs a sharing. We throw her words,
mites donated to rattle in the poor-box of her solitude.
And then our talk is finished. Having exacted her tithe,
the given words of sorrow, she smiles and bobs at us,
tells of further family graves, of further destinations
where perhaps dead fathers lie, and watching the death of day,
waves at our leaving, satisfied that we, a moment known, have
paid with company.
PATRICK COADY


Thompson, on a bitterly cold morning
when the frost was thick on the grass,
discovered the two boys curled up
asleep under his verandah in the
very place where, he said, he had only
days before killed a big black snake.
When he shook them awake, they got
up and bolted home.
The Thompsons lie awake listening
for the sound of the utility on the
track. They see its lights swing past,
across their bedroom walls, and they
hear the slam of the driver’s door.
Then nothing. They are afraid of what
they might find in the morning but
they hear nothing at all. They want the
McGees to go but cannot ask them to
leave. The Thompsons are afraid of Mr
McGee.
My parents talk about the McGees.
“The man’s an animal,” says my
father, standing among the rows of let-
tuces, his face tight with anger. “The
bastard ought to be flogged.”
“It’s the kids,” says my mother,
lifting steaming sheets from the copper
on the end of a stick. “If it was only
her. But where could she go with the
kids? I suppose she’s got nowhere. No-
where and no one.”
One afternoon, a few days before
Empire Night, my mother decided to
walk up and see Mrs McGee. We went
with her, up the rutted track behind
the Thompsons’ place, talking to let
Mrs McGee know it was us. We
couldn’t see the utility. The McGees’
dog, an ugly cattle dog chained up at
the entrance to the shed, hurled him-
self in a frenzy in our direction. Scared
that he might slip his collar, we
huddled together.
The shed had no proper door and
Mrs McGee emerged from it through a
curtain made of sewn-together feed
bags. She wore a clean apron over a
straight skirt and a shrunken red car-
digan and, although it was autumn and
the afternoons were getting cold,
broken sandals on her long blue-
veined feet. She shushed the dog and
greeted us in a low voice, no more than
a murmur.
My mother said what she had come
to say: “We’re having a few crackers
for the kids on Empire Night, Mrs
McGee, you know, and a bit of a bon-
fire. We was wondering if you’d like to
bring the boys down and join us?”
We looked around for the boys but
they were nowhere to be seen. Mrs
McGee hesitated.
“We got sparklers,” piped up my sis-
ter, holding onto Mum’s hand with
both of hers and swinging one foot.
Mrs McGee smiled. “Well, that’s
very nice of you, Mrs Bryan,” she said,
still very softly.
As she spoke, I saw a movement in
the dimness of the doorway behind
her. Under the curtain, I could just
make out the corner of a bed with grey
army blankets on it, like ours, and it
seemed as if someone had sat up at the
other end of the bed. There was no
sound. Then Mr McGee stood in the
space where the door should have
been, gathering back the curtain with
a large freckled hand. His shirt was
rumpled, his trousers sagged under his
solid belly. With his other hand he
straightened a lock of sandy hair the
same color as the boys’, that fell over
his forehead.
He nodded to my mother. Then he
looked at his wife. There was some-
thing like a smile on his face but it was
not a smile. He raised his eyebrows
slightly, as if waiting for her to speak.
And he stood very still. He kept hold of
the curtain and there was not even a
shudder in the rough fabric bunched
up in his fist.
Mrs McGee said nothing. She didn’t
meet his eyes and she didn’t move.
Suddenly, looking at her, I thought of
a bright red thread of stranded cotton
that Heather and I had twisted to make
a cord in Mrs Roberts’s sewing class
Heather twisting in one direction and I
in the other so tight that the thread
had to twist back upon itself again if it
didn’t first leap from our fingers and
unravel, twitching, in a second on the
floor. That was Mrs McGee.
Mr McGee’s eyes shifted from her
to us. Something made me take a step
back and I found myself clutching at
my mother’s skirt, like a little kid.
At last my mother spoke. “Well, the
days are drawing in,” she said. “We’d
better be getting home while we can
still see our way.”
Mr McGee let the curtain fall.
“Watch out for them potholes,” he
warned jovially. “You could break an
ankle; nothing easier.”
Mrs McGee didn’t say goodbye, only
clasped her hands in front of her and
turned aside as we began to pick out
our path single file down the rough
track, the sound of the dog’s fury fol-
lowing us all the way home
answered in kind by our Blue from the
end of his chain by the toolshed.
We had a lot of crackers for Empire
Night. Sparklers and rockets and
jumping jacks and Catherine wheels
and tom thumbs.
We locked Blue in the old pig pen.
Not that he would run away scared like
other dogs. Just the opposite: The year
before he had got free and attacked a
jumping jack, thinking we were in
danger, and burned his paws. Now he
howled anxiously from the pen.
It was a lovely cracker night, cold so
we jigged up and down clapping our
hands, and with the stars very clear in
the sky. Our bonfire was nice and dry
and the sparks twirled up from the
centre when we set fire to it and every-
thing around us was strange in its
shifting glow.
Dad set the first rocket in a lemon-
ade bottle, lit the paper and ran back,
quickly. We watched, hardly breathing,
as it disappeared into the black sky
and then, against a background of
stars, exploded into a million spears of
golden rain. Then all the excited cries
burst out of us.
“Now they’ll know we’ve started,”
said Mum.
When the McGees came, we were
holding sparklers, sweeping them very
fast through the air to make squiggles
of light, laughing at the feel of the sil-
ver sparks as they spilled over our
hands, slivers of fire falling on our skin
as harmless prickles, as if some magic
protected us.
Michael and his brother had on the
Fair Isle sweaters they wore through
the whole winter, knitted in different
colors from scraps. They were pretty
sweaters, in soft old wools, grey, green
and violet, but in patterns that were
almost random bands of stars,

bands of snowflakes, the colors chang-
ing haphazardly so that, at school,
they were laughed at. (“Your mother
must be barmy,” the other boys said.)
The little one carried a crumpled
brown paper bag of hungers.
Mrs McGee stood in the shadows,
her long brown hair falling around her
face, cardigan pulled tight, her thin
arms crossed against the cold night
air.
The boys came close to the fire.
They took sparklers from Dad and held
them in their hands, held them hard, in
clenched fists, looking down at them
intently until they burned right away.
Then they smiled at each other. Not at
us.
Dad sent up more rockets, one after
the other. The swoosh, the bang, the
brilliant blossoming and the silent fall
of light into our eyes made my sister
and me jump and squeal.
Michael and his brother stood with
their heads thrown back and their eyes
were bright. Michael’s arm was around
the little boy’s shoulders and they
stayed like that, not moving but watch-
ing and watching.
At the end, when we’d finished the
last hunger, Mrs McGee said “Thank
you. It was lovely” to Mum and then, to
the boys, “What do you say?”
“Thanks,” they said.
Mum ruffled the hair of the little
brother and asked: “Did you have a
good time, love?”
He nodded, looking down.
Then they went home, walking up
the dark road in the sudden quiet.
“Poor kids. Poor little buggers,”
said Mum, looking after them, and
then she bent down to pick up the
scraps of burnt paper once so bright
with Chinese letters encircled by
flowers.
I have never spoken directly to
Michael McGee. I speak to some boys
and sometimes kick them in the play-
ground but I have never spoken to
Michael McGee and he has never
spoken to me.
And there are the McGees, trudging
down the highway, and the bus is whiz-
zing past them. Heather is showing me
again her grandmother’s ring, pulling
it out of the neck of her blouse on its
long chain that reaches almost down to
her tummy, and the handsome driver is
whistling a song over the screaming of
the kids.
We turn off the highway and the dri-
ver lets my sister and me out at the
corner of our road.
Passing the entrance to the track
that leads down to the creek, we meet
“Richard is researching his new novel set in London’s mean streets.”
Joy Greenwood and her baby. The
Greenwoods live down by the creek in
a collection of derelict slab huts, corru-
gated iron humpies and old cars. There
are a lot of kids there, the Greenwoods
and their cousins, and they go to
school only sometimes. Joy went to our
school until she got too big and looked
silly and floppy playing basketball and
then she stopped. The Greenwoods
don’t go to high school at all. Some
people say the Greenwoods’ brothers
are sometimes their uncles, too,
though I’m not sure how that works
out. Some people say the Greenwoods
shouldn’t be allowed to have babies.
Anyway, now Joy has a baby.
She is wearing a thin, shapeless
floral dress that slips off her fat
shoulders. It’s the same one that even
in cold weather she wears under a
man’s old suit coat. Her feet are bare
and dusty.
“Hullo!” she yells, in her hoarse,
friendly Greenwood voice. “How yer
goin’? How’s school goin’? How’s them
silly old buggers of teachers treatin’
youse? See me baby?”
We look into the old pram. Al-
though it’s so hot, the baby is loaded
down with dirty blankets and is scarlet
in the face.
“It’s pretty,” I say, to be polite, and
then worry about “it”. Joy doesn’t
mind. She laughs delightedly. The
baby starts to scream. She leans over
and, after some scrabbling among the
blankets, brings out a dummy which
she dips into an open tin of condensed
milk fixed to the handle of the pram
with wire. Brushing away the flies, she
sticks it in the baby’s mouth. Then she
bends over the pram and kisses the
baby’s red forehead a big, smacking
kiss.
“Well, better be off round to the
store,” she says, adding proudly as she
plods off: “There’s a lot to do with a
baby! I’m always that bloody busy!”
Mum is sitting at the kitchen table
with a pot of tea, doing the crossword
puzzle in the evening paper. There’s a
sprinkling of talcum powder in the
crease at the top of her breasts, from
her afternoon bath, but she sits sur-
rounded by the sweetness of stewed
apples, the hot scent of cloves. Only
when I hug her can I smell gardenias.
I go out and let Blue off his chain.
He can hardly stand still for me to slip
the catch from his collar. I follow slow-
ly as he rushes crazily away to check
his territory, left undefended all day
through no fault of his own.
I cut grass for my rabbit. I feed the
chooks, calling “Here, chook! chook!
Sparrow
Asphalt brown, camouflaged, you pause
Are you really that colour
Or just dusty and underneath
The feathers exult like rainbows
CAROLE WILKINS


chook!” as I scatter the grain. When I
come back, Dad is home and standing
by the toolshed with a bucket in his
hand. He’s talking to Mum about Mr
Bone, the foreman. Almost every night
he has a new grievance against Mr
Bone, who is a tyrannical bastard. His
very name is horrible and I hate him.
Now I hear Dad say that Mr Bone’s
daughter is sitting for her Leaving
Certificate and Bone hopes she’ll go to
teachers’ college next year. Mr Bone
has a daughter! I poke my nose in to
hear more.
There is the sound of a car, further
up the road. It is backing out of the
track by the Thompsons’ place, gears
whining. We hear it turn and presently
it goes past. It’s the McGees’ old utility
and Michael and his brother and the
dog are sitting in the back, facing the
way they’ve come. The dog is standing
up, balancing, with his nose pointing
over the backboard and his ears are
pinned against his head by the wind.
They don’t see us.
I go in and lie on my bed and read
Jane Eyre, after a fight with my sister
who wants me to play with her. I’m up
to my favorite part where Jane, from
miles away, hears Mr Rochester crying
out her name in anguish. “Jane! Jane!”
I’ve read it over and over.
“And you owe thirty seven pounds fifty on this one.”
Mum calls us for tea. As she’s dis-
hing it up, we hear Dad outside talking
to someone. “Goodnight!” we hear and,
“Looks like that southerly’s getting up,
don’t you reckon? Should be a bit cool-
er tonight!”
Dad comes in and goes into the
laundry to wash his hands. “That was
Bill Thompson, about borrowing the
scythe,” he says over his shoulder. “He
tells me the McGees have gone.”
“Gone?”
The McGees have piled their few
things into the utility and gone. The
rent (so there was rent) was paid up,
with a couple of days to spare. She
didn’t say nothing at all and the poor
little kids looked like they didn’t know
what was bloody going on. According
to Mr Thompson.
“I don’t know,” says Mum, standing
there with the pot in her hand, dis-
tressed. “Where will they end up? Oh, I
just don’t know sometimes.”
It’s rabbit stew. Mum likes to get a
rabbit occasionally. It was a treat
when she was a kid in the Depression.
We’ve eaten it before but now my sister
bursts into tears.
“I won’t eat it! It reminds me of
Bunny!” she sobs. Bunny is my rabbit.
He’s a fat white Angora, almost spheri-
cal and too heavy to play with. I don’t
like him much any more and I’m think-
ing of selling him. But I start to cry,
too.
Mum sits and looks at us. “You
great pair of dills,” she says. But she
gets up and takes away the plates and
scrapes the stew back into the pot. “All
the more for us,” she says to Dad and
begins to fry us some eggs.
As we’re finishing, there’s a scratch-
ing at the door. Dad leans back in his
chair and opens it and there on the
step is the possum, with her baby un-
blinking on her back. I get up and put
some tinned jam (not Mum’s plum jam,
because the possum doesn’t know the
difference) on a slice of bread. I hand
half to my sister and we give it to the
possum in turns. She takes each piece
in both her paws and nibbles it neatly
along the edges. She gets jam on her
whiskers and wipes it away, licking her
paws. Her eyes and her baby’s are huge
and innocent in the light from the
kitchen.
Suddenly, she turns and leaps clum-
sily away onto the base of the tree by
the door. She clings there for a mo-
ment and then lightly scampers up,
claws rattling the bark, and is gone.
Late at night, I lie in bed and listen.
I hear crickets, birds, the cries of cats
gone wild in the bush. Far away, al-
most no more than a vibration in the
air, the coming and going of the

FILLETS OF PERCH
by Robin Sheiner
Western Australia has been fertile ground
for writer Robin Sheiner whose first novel,
Smile, The War is Over has recently
been published
THE RED PERCH had been evading
him for weeks. Robin knew that it was
there, in the deep pond beyond the
overflow from the lake. It would have
been hard for it to escape because past
the pond the water only trickled, thin
and clear, over rocks to seep down
toward the green paddocks; no place
for a red perch.
At the far end of the paddocks, kan-
garoos grazed and in the mornings
emus sharpened their beaks on baby
karri trees pushing their way in
clumps through the marshy ground
their parents in the background,
guarding. After days of autumn sun,
Robin had found circles of mushrooms
in the paddocks and had
taken them to his wife to
cheer her. Beside their tent,
the mud-brick house he was
building for her looked about
to topple over and crush the
dozens of baby trees which
he had grown from seed
now lined up in jam tins,
ready for planting.
“How dae ye ken they’re
nae poison?” she asked, stir-
ring the mushrooms with
butter in a large pan over the
open fire outside their tent. It
was like her to fuss but he
comforted her as he always
did, speaking softly through
a circle of red curling beard
which made his eyes look
startled even wild. “A
Heilander, a hunter,” his
wife told the local people, her
eyebrows curving. “A breeder, too,”
she added though they had no children
after 15 years of marriage, something
about which they didn’t talk.
Robin bred trout and had been
brought from Scotland to teach the
people of the dying forest town in the
womb of West Australian karri
country how to breed them, too. His
wife disliked the town, the coarse West
Australian people and the karri trees.
It almost seemed, from the way she
spoke, that everyone in the place was
against her even Robin, soft on one
side and brutal on the other. When he
held her he was so gentle that her
anger melted but at times, looking at
him, she imagined him to be as mur-
derous as his Highland ancestors.
He always carried a gun tucked
under his arm: “Tae shoot the shags.
They eat the weans,” he said. He had a
licence. The minute he spotted one of
the black and white birds, long neck
outstretched like an arrow above the
lake, he would cock his gun on one hip
and, hardly seeming to take aim, rarely
missed, a clutch of feathers and a long
soft neck plummeting to the ground.
Now that he was after the red
perch, she knew it didn’t have a
chance. It had been in the pond for
weeks, eating his trout babies. It often
flashed in arcs of red through swirls of
mud, showing-off, daring him with flips
of its tail: A big one but no one would
believe him when he told them how
big. He’d seen bigger. In the rock pools
of the Highland streams, they some-
times grew to a metre and almost 10kg.
But they were females. This was a
male. He knew by its flamboyant color
and thrusting tail. Frustrated. Why
else that violent threshing? The only
outsider in the pond. He could hardly
mate with the trout or perhaps he did
but that didn’t stop him from eating
their babies. A cannibal, his fiery gills
as red as Robin’s beard.
Robin sat by the pond in the even-
ings, dangling a line for marron and
watching for the red perch to show it-
self, daring it to come close so that he
could take it with the hook he had
ready. But it kept its distance, inciting
him to fury with flips of its tail and the
glare of its gills. At the fire beside their
Cockatoos
Our almond trees are turning pale
They’re shaking with indignation
Magpies are swooping, butcher birds cry riot
I see defiant eyes in the foliage
Some visitors with lemon punk hairdos
Are helping themselves with gusto
There’s a party going on and we’re not invited
Table manners passed away with spats
Discards hit the garage roof like beercans
Communication sounds like a saw on concrete
Our gang has had enough and they’re bored
The sky shrinks behind yellow and white

tent, his wife cooked sausages or made
black pudding.
Most evenings at this time of year,
the sky glowed with pink clouds tus-
sling for attention in the mirror of the
lake and robins fluttered after one an-
other through the half-finished mud-
brick house before disappearing into
nests high in the karri trees. But
Robin’s wife did not see them; she was
sheltering beneath the rounded, tree-
less mountains of Glencoe, the heather
turning russet, gold and brown and the
whin and gorse waiting for their sum-
mer flowering, blackbirds darting
through the heather. “Robins are the
blackbirds’ cousins. They must hae fol-
lowed us here,” Robin told her but it
made no difference.
When he returned from the pond,
gleaming through the darkness like
the pink sky, he would throw the
marron he had caught into a pot of
boiling water for a minute and then
together they would suck the sweet
flesh from the shells. Later, in their
double sleeping-bag, he would caress
her and tickle her with his beard but
her cries were more of pain than of
pleasure. He would rock her close to
him, feel her tears on the fur of his
chest and call over and over in
unrelieved passion, “Ma puir wee
bairn.”
There was always a new reason for
her to be miserable. Lately, she had

DORIAN GRAY
taken to blaming the karri trees. “They
grow sae tall, blocking out the sky. I
cannae breathe here,” she said, know-
ing that snow soon would be falling on
her rounded mountains. She was
losing weight. He had always admired
the plumpness of her breasts and
thighs but now, when she stood naked
beneath the makeshift shower he had
hung from the trees, he could sense a
hollowness.
He had taken her to the local doc-
tor, an old man who had practised in
the area longer than he should have.
He had said bluntly that nothing was
wrong with her which a visit home or
having a baby would not cure..
“Are ye telling me I’m no’
man enough to hae weans?”
Robin had shouted. His wife
had calmed him, told him
hush, and the fire had gone
from his eyes as she ran her
fingers through his beard. As
soon as the trout farm was
established, he would send
her home to her Mum in
Scotland. He thought that
that would cure her. He could
not bear to think that he had
brought her to this womb of
earth to waste away.
“I’ll have tae drain the
pond,” he told her when her
hollowness became too much.
Now it was the red perch she
blamed. It was there growing
fatter, eating all those babies
while he sat on the bank
watching helpless. He’d
tried everything he knew to
catch it but had to be careful
because there female trout,
valuable breeders, were in
the pond and he needed them
for his farm. They must not
be harmed. If possible, they
must be removed to his control tanks
at the hatchery. But they were the
shyest of all, hiding beneath the large
rocks while the red perch flashed
around their pond.
Robin wore long waders and
brought the town mechanic, Neal, to
fix the water pump. Neal knew more
about trout than anybody else, even
Robin, and could fix anything but he
stuttered so badly that he only com-
municated through a notepad his
life spread out on paper. He had filled
hundreds of notebooks with his con-
versations and said that they would
make a novel one day. “Not since Billy
Budd ,” he wrote, proud that in all his
notebooks not a word was wasted.
Robin’s wife understood him. Each
sensed the aloneness of the other.
“Robin hae his troot,” she spoke to
Neal in her self-pity. “Whit dae I
have?” And Neal watched her push her
brown hair from her face. They sat
together while the robins spun in the
trees, the males scarlet and black, the
females fawn with breasts of pale apri-
cot and always the males swooping
fearlessly near their faces.
“Robins, nightingales, blackbirds
all thrushes,” Neal wrote. “Small
joys travel.”
They sat in comfortable silence, un-
til Neal rose to go. “He wants to clear
the pond,” he was printing.
“Well, let ’im,” Robin’s wife said.
Why bother, she thought. There’s no
point. As soon as he catches the red
perch, there’ll be another then an-
other. If it’s not the perch, it’s the
shags. “ ’e cannae go on protectin’ the
weans for ever,” she said. “There’s
alway somethin’ gets them in the end.”
“Not only the red perch. It’s the
breeders. He wants them safe.” Neal
wrote in a large, round hand.
A kangaroo hopped right up to the
mud-brick house and left droppings
through the open passageway. It was
as if the humans were not there.
Robin’s wife clapped her hands at it in
sudden anger. “Ye’d best be off then
and fetch the pump, ’e’ll be that mad if
ye don’t. Ye’ve ne’er seen ’im in one o’
’is rages.”
“What he needs is a kid,” Neal
wrote. “Takes the rawness off.”
Robin’s wife picked up one of the
logs she had collected that morning
and dropped it on the fire. She kept a
fire burning most days; it was like com-
pany. Sparks flew around them and
Neal stamped out the coals that scat-
tered on the grass. “Sssssorry,
mmmmmmate,” he stuttered when he
saw her face.
Quicksand
Which face
do you prefer
The diplomatic
professionally unrevealing and calm
Or the tactless
shifting to emotion?
Look at the face of the quicksand.
Four horses broke from a mob,
Leapt down the bank of Cumbil Creek
And dropped through a stretch of white sand.
Not even a bubble showed where they disappeared.
The surface stayed calm and unmarked. '
Agony could not disrupt its features
It was featureless.
In the sky on the other hand,
A vast place,
If little Pegasus jumped wrong
His annihilation would be recorded
In a burst of coloured lights.

“Where the hell is Neal?” Robin
was shouting from the pond.
The campers had gathered in a
semi-circle, the rocks tiered around the
pond forming natural seats, like an
amphitheatre. They had come to watch
the draining of the pond and were
making bets on how many trout there
would be. Some guessed as many as
200, others as few as 10. None of them
knew about the red perch. They all
thought it was the breeders that Robin
was after. He had the large watertank
ready for them on the back of his
truck, with a smaller tank for the
breeders. An oxygen cylinder was near-
by, as well, so that air could be pumped
through the water when they needed
reviving. He wasn’t taking any risks.
On the outskirts of the crowd his
wife stood watching. Neal and Robin
struggled with the pump, noticing no
one, lifting it over the bank and then
lowering it to a ledge, their muscles
straining. Then Robin stood knee-deep
in the muddy water, using his chain-
saw to cut through a large log which
blocked the way for the pipes. He and
Neal were working together, under-
standing each other without talking,
moving in rhythm as men do when a
goal is shared. They had removed their
shirts; both were strong, one chest
dark, the other furry red. The chain-
saw vibrated, buzzing through the air,
creating tension among the campers.
The log snapped. They pushed and
heaved until it opened wide enough to
allow the pipes from the pump to slide
easily through and into the water. The
men moved from their seats, stalking
forward with their nets. The women
huddled closer together and talked in
whispers. Outside the circle, Robin’s
wife watched alone in silence.
The waterlevel began to drop, slow-
ly at first and then in gushes pouring
muddy brown liquid into the “put-and-
take” the artificial pond Robin had
created for his hatchery. The trout be-
gan to jump, water frothing. “Ready!”
Robin shouted to the male campers.
They raised their nets. “Now!” and the
men strained forward, blood pounding,
scooping up the trout some two at a
time then running up the steep bank
to lower them into the tank. Neal
worked the pump. Robin stood knee-
deep in water, gripping his net,
tense.
“What’s he waiting for?” the female
campers whispered. Only Robin’s wife
and Neal knew but Robin’s wife stood
outside the circle, near the tank thick
with trout. “Oxygen!” Robin shouted at
her. She didn’t move. It was not her
business. Let them die; what did she
care? She stood, arms folded. Robin
did not look her way again. In the far
corner of the pond was a flash of red.
He raised his net. No one must get the
red perch but him. The men continued
to scoop, sweating and straining, all
with shirts removed, white bellies
rolled above girdled waists. A hundred
or more trout were in the tank already.
They gasped for air. Robin’s wife
watched them and thought that they
were just like her but she did not move
to help. Neal was busy with the pump,
re-aligning pipes and mending leaks.
Robin was crouched above the muddy

You're not dyslexic at all-
you’re Welsh!”
water. They hadn’t got the breeders
yet; they would be the last and the most
difficult to shift. They were already be-
neath rocks in the deepest part of the
diminishing pond and knew, like the
wily red perch as always how to
move out of reach of nets.
The women began to scream: A pair
of lampreys slid up the bank, tenacious
bloodsuckers who were finding their
way to the sea to breed. Robin moved
forward and crushed their heads with
a heel of his waders. Another appeared
but Neal wounded it with a stone be-
fore it could clamp onto Robin’s leg.
The children screamed together with
the women, loudly in fear and delight.
One woman about to faint left the
arena escorted by a friend.
Then Robin saw the first of the
breeders, twice as large as any of the
trout in the tank so far, bright eyes
watching from beneath a rock. She
fought him with surprising strength
but he had her netted and there was
nothing she could do but gasp and flap
her tail. He had a special tank for the
breeders. “Ready with the oxygen,” he
shouted at his wife. “It’s a breeder.”
“Sae whit?” she said beneath her
breath but when she saw it, daringly
striped but silver-soft below, vulner-
able and gasping alone in the small
tank, she moved forward. She released
oxygen through the tube and felt
breath pour into lungs that had been
closed. Soon there were four of them,
large breeders with no fight left; one
floating on its back, belly exposed, eyes
glazed. “Swim,” Robin’s wife said.
“Please, please swim.” She saw Neal
watching her from the pump.
The male campers were exhausted.
They mopped their faces with their
shirts, sat back with their women and
received congratulations. Only Robin
was left in the pond. Everyone was
watching him but they were losing in-
terest. The pump had given out. Not
even Neal could get the pipes to suck.
Little water was left and all the trout
had been removed, except for one or
two lying flapping in the mud, and a
solitary lamprey was slithering along
the bank. Abruptly, from a crouch,
Robin sprang across the water. He
sank above the level of his waders as
he thrust out his net, plunging with a
grunt nearly face down in the water.
One of the campers laughed and they
all moved off then, smiling, men with
arms around the waists of women.
At the far end of the pond was a
flash of red. Robin turned, eyes wild,
mud staining his red beard. He thrust
out the net again and again until
finally he had it. He raised the net with
both hands and there it was, gills and
fins dark red, eyes red as well, catching
the reflection of the sun, tail threshing,
defiant to the end. Robin took a stone
and struck him three times on the back
of his flat head before he was still.
Only three of them were left now:
Robin, Neal and Robin’s wife. The
blood from the red perch was on
Robin’s hands, mud covering his beard
and striping his bare chest. They said
nothing. At their feet were the crushed
lampreys and the large, red, dying
perch. In the karri forrest, the birds
were singing and the Sun was directly
overhead.
“It’ll dae for tea,” Robin said.
Without his notebook, Neal walked
in silence. Robin washed his
hands in the “put-and-take”.
Robin’s wife had returned
to help the breeders.
They were quiet,
stunned. She

one which had been the closest to
death righted herself, concealing her
soft silver underside beneath a rain-
bow arch.
“I think they’ll live,” Robin’s wife
said but no one heard. Robin was anx-
ious, agitating to get the trout over to
the hatchery. “They’ll hae to be
nursed,” he said. He couldn’t bear to
think of any of them, especially not the
breeders, dying. Robin’s wife would not
leave them, either, now that she knew
it was through her air they lived.
It was hours later, when the trout
were safe, that Robin had time to scale
and gut the red perch. He cut it into
fillets and they invited Neal for tea.
The pink clouds were again flirting
with their reflections in the mirror of
the lake and promiscuous robins
teased each other in an orgy of delight,
a final fling before dark fell and they
returned subdued to nests.
The fillets of perch rolled in flour
hissed and spat in the large pan on the
fire. They drank tumblers of the thick
malt whisky Robin kept for special oc-
casions. “A guid day’s work,” he said.
They ate the fillets with tossed spin-
ach salad. Neal said nothing but
looked content. Before leaving for the
night, he wrote: “There are hunters
and there are breeders” and he showed
it to them both. “Rrrrright
mmmmmmmates?” he said. Robin and
his wife smiled at each other. They
knew what he meant.
They stood together naked under
the shower Robin had made beneath
the trees. Audacious robins dived
around them seeking moisture, too.
And for one delightful moment a bird
with black back and chest of brilliant
scarlet landed in Robin’s wife’s cupped
and outstretched hand then flew off
with the others, high into the karri
trees.■

IAN KENNEDY WILLIAMS
THE
DANCING WIFE
by Richard Carey
THE MUSIC in the darkened bar was
like something solid that thumped the
furniture and the flesh.
The girl asked could she get them
anything. Robert, who had led the way
downstairs, did not know what to say.
He mumbled and, even had his voice
had not been engulfed in the disco
beat, he would not have made sense.
“Would you like a table?” the girl
asked helpfully.
“Yes!” Robert exclaimed.
Having got' past the bouncer at the
door was enough excitement for one
night. To be confronted immediately
afterward by a bare-breasted girl was
too much. And the question of what to
do next stopped him in his tracks.
Then he was amazed that the answer
could be so simple and offered so nat-
urally.
“For three, please,” he said.
This was intended to show that he
was in command but, as he said it, he
realised it betrayed him as a novice.
Surely a waitress with such friendly
grace, when she was topless, would be
able to add up two men in dinner jack-
ets and a lady in an evening dress and
get three!
“It’ll have to be on the other side of
the dancefloor; I’m sorry.” The wait-
ress smiled apologetically.
“That’s fine,” Robert answered. He
could not think quickly enough to say
without giving himself away that
they wished to stay near the bar where
the topless waitresses homed like
pigeons.
“Please come this way,” the girl
said, leading them around the
dancefloor from the narrow bar room.
Flickerings and splashings of the
many-colored lights broke the dark-
ness. Snapshots of writhing bodies,
flailing arms, jerking heads and laugh-
ing faces fluttered like a magic lantern
show gone crazy.
She showed them to a dingy alcove
in which a dozen small, round tables
and cheap chrome chairs were set up.
Only two of the tables were occupied.
Robert was aghast. When James
had said after the long dinner
that they should find a girlie bar for a
nightcap before they dropped him back
at his hotel, Robert had been at a loss.
He was ashamed that he did not know
of a place, not personally, even though
he had lived in Adelaide all his life.
But the idea had great appeal.
A taxi-driver had brought them to
the disco and, despite Robert’s hopes
and fantasies, it turned out to be a low-
class, sordid, little hell. It was even in a
basement. But he was reassured when
he saw that James seemed to be happy.
“What will you have to drink?” the
waitress asked as they settled so they
could get a view of dancefloor and the
bar. Her breasts were level with
Robert’s face when he sat down.
She was no more than a teenager
but the large breasts were already
slack. Robert knew that this was his
best chance for a good look but he
could not do it without betraying him-
self. He looked at the girl’s face, re-
turned her smile and stayed with it.
“Two beers and a tomato juice,” he
said.
“I’m sorry: We don’t have tomato
juice.”
“Then I’ll have orange,” Helen said,
too quickly. The girl made her uncom-
fortable.
“Two beers and an orange juice,”
Robert confirmed, to show that he was
the host.
They watched the waitress as she
walked away. At the bar, she turned
side-on but it was too far off.
“You men!” Helen laughed. “Your
eyes are sticking out like organ stops.”
“It’s what we came to see,” James
said. “We paid the cover charge, so
we’d be mad not to take an interest.”
He grinned. “I got a really close look
while Robert was ordering the drinks.”
Helen continued to smile but Robert
knew there was no happiness in it. It
was the smile she used to hide embar-
rassment or boredom or to suffer fools
gladly. He knew that she was upset and
uncomfortable but that she was too
civilised to let it show.
Helen was ashamed to be sitting
there while young girls were forced to
show their breasts. And she still felt
humiliated by the way the men had
used social blackmail, with James pre-
tending the he would be insulted if she


didn’t come and Robert going along
with it, to drag her to a commercialised
sex place.
James and Robert watched the wait-
ress all the way as she returned with
the drinks. Her nipples were of the
large kind that capped the entire end
of the breast and reminded Robert of
acorn cups. She put the glasses on the
table and accepted a $5 note from
Robert. He watched for a glimpse of
breast as she turned away and won-
dered if she would bring any change.
“We need the front view,” he
observed loudly, “if we’re going to get
our money’s worth for the cover
charge!”
Helen flicked a look of contempt at
him. Robert understood. She despised
him for taking up that weak crack of
James’ and she wasn’t fair. They
would both benefit but she expected
him to be the only one to pay the price.
They watched as the dancers
throbbed with the beat of the music.
Floating veils of smoke were cut by
beams of light flickering as hard and
sharp as knife blades.
“They’re dancing by themselves!”
Robert exclaimed.
“I beg your pardon?” James leaned
across the table, close to Helen who
was sitting between them.
“I said they all do their own thing;
they don’t really need partners, do
they?”
James nodded and drew back into
his seat. He was smiling and rocking
with the music.
“I suppose that’s why they like it,”
Robert shouted. “That and the fact
that they couldn’t possibly be expected
to talk to each other.”
“Yes,” Helen said grimly. “It does
make good conversation impossible,
doesn’t it?”
Robert gave his wife a savage look.
They knew each other so well that com-
munication was almost telepathic:
Helen had just told him that he was
making a fool of himself.
She went on smiling . . . but not at
him or James. She was smiling at the
scene, for James’ benefit. Looking
happy when she wasn’t... playing her
part, at least as far as James was con-
cerned. It was not too much to ask.
With the sort of man James was, the
sort of good he could do, this little bit
of innocent slumming could be worth
... who could know? Robert was sure
that there were lots of worse places
more hard core to which they could
have taken her. In a way, she was
spoiling their night. So she couldn’t
complain, really.
The waitress went past with a tray
of drinks for another table. She
handed Robert a note and some coins.
He fumbled and she moved to the next
table before he could offer a tip.
“You can’t even give it away,” he
laughed, speaking to James, as he
stuffed the money out of sight into a
jacket pocket.
The waitress had snubbed him.
Maybe she thought a tip from him
would not be worth waiting for. Robert
felt hurt.
“I observed the waitress, you know,
as she came toward us,” James said,
leaning forward confidentially. “There
was nothing pornographic about her
at all.”
“You see better on a topless beach,”
Robert said.
“Oh!” Helen faced him. “I didn’t
know you’d been to a topless beach!”
Robert shrugged evasively and, be-
cause James was watching, gave her a
friendly smile.
“That’s precisely it!” said James.
“There’s nothing stimulating about
naked women on a beach in public.
Good pornography, you know, can be
very erotic. In Sydney, we have some
really excellent places. I’ll take you to
some when you come over.”
The offer was made as much to
Helen as to Robert. Going a bit far.
“Thanks I’ll look forward to it,”
Robert answered. “I’d like to see a
really good strip,” he added in a man-
of-the-world voice. “You’re right about
this lot there’s nothing erotic here.”
“There could be if you were watch-
ing outside their bedroom window. You
see, there’s a whole complex of things
needed for a turn-on.”
Robert avoided Helen’s glance.
“For example, Helen is more erotic
... more tantalising ... excuse me”
he put a hand on Helen’s arm and
grinned at her “I’m only quoting you
as an example!’ He addressed Robert
again: “Your wife is more of a turn-on
than all of those topless girls put
together.”
“You embarrass me!” Helen gave a
social laugh. “You make me feel as if I
weren’t really sitting here.”
“Oh, no! No! No! No! No! Don’t take
it like that! Look at your evening gown:
“Name’s Jack London and this is
my new book. ”
Just apart
Just you touching
the tips of my fingers
and never letting go.
Just you receiving
the glance of my eyes
and never looking away.
Just you returning
the crack of my smile
and never breathing out.
Just the part of your hair,
symmetry that attracts.
Just apart from you,
no-one to take the love.
Just part your mending lips,
breathe in and return
my broken smile.
Heal me.
VIN MASKELL


It seems transparent but it’s not. Now
that’s a turn-on. It makes a man think
he’ll see more than, in fact, he can. It’s
the classic come-on the promise so
far exceeding the delivery.”
“Then maybe I should exercise my
prerogative ...”
James pretended to be alarmed.
“Not... the classic prerogative?”
“No!” Helen answered harshly:
“The prerogative to wear tweed!”
“James is joking, Helen!”
“No, I’m not!” James protested.
“But ... well, yes, about the classic
prerogative, I am joking not about
the gown, though. No! I’m quite
serious about that. And, Helen, you
should not be offended. I mean, if you
accept responsibility for the gown, you
shouldn’t be embarrassed by having it
described. Just as you shouldn’t feel
shy about seeing yourself in a mirror.”
Robert broke in urgently. “If the
waitresses were covered up a bit,
they’d be better ...”
“Exactly! If they wore a see-through
top so much more attractive. I
mean, Helen ...” James shook his
head as he searched for words, “you’re
so much more appealing because we
can see the way your gown moves with
your body, the way the material flows
with the movement! And there’s the
sense” He held his hands in front of
him, unconsciously cupping imaginary
breasts, “of your naked body inside
your gown . ..”
“Well, er ...” Robert began.
“And the cleavage is exposed!”
James shouted amid the music. “Just
the top, the suggestion that’s all!
Minimal exposure! So much the better.
It leaves one’s imagination free to go
down to ... er ... to complete the pic-
ture ... So much better than the full
statement of the totally exposed boob!”
He waved a hand airily in the direction
of the bar. “These girls have no appeal
because they don’t appeal to the im-
agination. If the whole truth is re-
vealed, there’s no room for anything
but the truth. People human beings
can’t stand plain facts; we must
have drama, drama made by the im-
agination. But the waitresses, I’m
sorry to say, are just plain facts.
Boring!”
“I think they’re terribly sad,” Helen
said. “It’s so degrading when everyone
else is dressed normally. They have to
humiliate themselves to earn a living. I
feel so sorry for them! It’s awful to
watch and be part of.”
“Oh, not these days,” Robert began.
“I say it is, Robert!” Helen retorted.
She glared at him for trying to stop her
from having a say. “And I know exactly
how they feel.” She paused. “And I
know how / feel, too.”
“Some females like getting their
gear off in public,” Robert said
petulantly. “Anyway, they’re such bags
here we ought to get a refund. With
boobs like these, they should have a
cover-up charge!”
“That’s foul, Robert! It’s just so
mean-minded and disgusting! And to
think these young girls have to bare
themselves for that sort of smart-alec
talk!”
There was emotion in Helen’s voice:
She was serious. Robert and James
were quiet for a minute and then she
spoke again. “I feel like dancing,” she
said. She smiled powerfully at James.
“Robert doesn’t dance,” she confided.
James took the hint. “Then ...” he
offered gallantly, “shall we?”
He pushed back his chair. Helen
was standing before he could move to
help her up.
She stood very tall and erect.
Robert shuffled to his feet out of polite-
ness. She smiled at him, smiled at
James. Robert was alarmed without
knowing why. There was something
too grand in her manner.
“Working girls of the world
unite!” she exclaimed and then said to
James, with a laugh: “Come on let’s
enjoy ourselves!”
James followed her through smoke
into the stuttering lights. Robert
watched as if he were looking into an
aquarium tank. They had gone out of
reach.
He saw them face each other, pause,
then yield to the music. He was pleased
to see that James was a poor dancer,
with middle-aged, inhibited move-
ments. But, from her first steps, Helen
was so light that she seemed to be
dancing above the floor bare arms
raised and moving like those of a
Hindu god, head tossing so that her
long hair was dancing, too. And her
gown danced with her, refining her
movements into its own flow.
Robert watched with horror. Where
did she learn to dance like that? They
never danced; he had not known she
could.
He expected her to stop soon or at
least to dance like the others, without
so much show. But it was no quick
joke: She had given herself to the viol-
ent music, the strobe lights and the
smokey air and she let them shape the
movements of her body.
Everyone was watching her. The
other dancers had drawn back to give
her room. Robert could see the sick-
looking faces of the people at the
tables. They were all watching his wife.
Even two of the waitresses had stopped
to watch.
James was standing like a post,
barely jigging, while Helen danced
around him advancing and retreat-
ing offering herself and then draw-
ing back. Lights splashed on her hair,
punctuated the movements of her arms
and the sway and flow of her dress.
James was right: Helen clothed was in-
finitely more erotic than any of those
bare-chested waitresses. Erotic to
others.
To see something like this was the
adventure Robert had thought of when
James suggested a girlie bar. But a
turn-on, to use James’ expression,
could not be his own wife. This was not
part of the bargain. Not Helen perform-
ing!
So abandoned and yet so in control!
There was so much life in her! Robert
had never suspected. So professional!
And quite impersonal. She was the
dancing girl of all the ages, totally
strange to him. She was a stranger out
there on the dancefloor. If that was
Helen, Robert had never known her.
The music would have to end sooner
or later and then she would come back
to the table ... but this would not end,
this that he was seeing now. Things
would never be the same. Robert did
not know what would happen but he
knew that he would never be able to
feel sure never be able to feel in
control again.
He sat quite still, hand clasped
around his drink on the table, and
watched his wife as if she were on the
other side of a wall of glass. ■
Leadlighting
The needling scratch of the cutter
traces butterfly wings, thumbs brace
dividing shape from backdrop.
I snake the lead, lock the glass
body trapped in. the membrane, like
jigsaw juggling words in a poem.
On the desk, light is stoppered
in ruby, in amber, in amethyst.
Solder melds the web. I hold
to the first streamering of light
a frozen symmetry of flight
and feel capricious, not earth bound at all.
GAIL HENNESSY


THE ARTS
Robert Hughes: reflections of
Time’s tame cockatoo
Australian may be the “flavor of the month ” overseas but expatriate Australians
long have been noted for their achievements in a variety offields. CLYDE
PACKER, himself an expatriate, has recorded their experiences and views in a
book, No Return Ticket. Here he talks to art critic Robert Hughes.
PACKER: “You would maintain, then,
that you are a journalist, not a critic?”
HUGHES: “Both. There is a won-
derful phrase in French; people say that
they practise la haute vulgarisation,
which doesn’t mean vulgarisation; it
means intelligent general discussion
which doesn’t damage the work. This is
what I attempt to do. I had to learn it
elsewhere. I left Australia because there
were things you just can’t learn in Aus-
tralia. Think how little there was to see
in Australia. This is the situation that
(James) Mollison is up against now.
That National Gallery (Mollison is its
director) should have started
25 years ago.”
PACKER: “I notice
your’re critical of it?”
HUGHES: “I dislike the
building but the collection’s
essential. If you cast your
mind back to what there was
to see in Australian museums
in 1963, there was no way that
one could have educated one-
self in the history of art from
that. I wanted to have some
reason for going on as an art
critic. I’d been thrown into be-
ing an art critic entirely by ac-
cident. I was a cartoonist on
the old Observer [a journal of
opinion which merged with
The Bulletin in 1961]. Here
were Michael Baume, Peter
Coleman and I sitting around
all drunk after lunch.
Donald Horne, who was then
the editor of that journal,
came in and said. ‘l’ve just
fired the art critic. You must
know something about art.’ I
was the only one not under-
neath the table - I was still
sitting more *or less erect
and so that’s how I got it. Oh
God, when I think of it!
There’s no possible way that
you could start a career as an
art critic in such a fashion
today. People know more
now. If you tried, you’d make a total ass
of yourself in public. And the reader-
ship, being more sophisticated, would
write to say, ‘Get rid of this idiot.’ The
editor would, too, although perhaps not
quite so quickly in Australia as they
would here in America. America has an
unemployable proletariat created by the
art-education system. Every year,
35,000 people graduate from American
art schools with tickets saying they’re
painters, sculptors, potters. They have
serious professional intentions 35,000
people a year! The total population of
Florence in the last quarter of the 15th
Robert Hughes, the young artist and critic
century was 70,000 people and that in-
cluded everybody, from Leonardo to
the dustman. So every two years we se-
crete that many artists, art historians
and potential critics here. The problem
is not a lack of professional expertise.
However, in this country, the graduates
write so very badly. Lucky for me.”
PACKER: “You said earlier that
everything that happens is accidental.”
HUGHES: “Well, I didn’t get up one
morning and say, ‘l’m going to go to
Europe and then I’m going to get to
America and then become the art critic
of Time.' It never runs out according to
the guidelines, in my experi-
ence. Eugene Istomin, as far
as I know, wanted to be a con-
cert pianist from the age of
seven onward, so I suppose
you might say that he had a
plotted career; he never be-
came a lumberjack, anyway.
It was so simple with me be-
cause I didn’t have a manual
skill, a virtuoso skill of that
kind. The people in the per-
forming arts tend to emerge
early as virtuosi.”
PACKER: “But your
training in Australia was actu-
ally quite good. You had the
early schooling with the
Jesuits which taught you to
think. Then you had the archi-
tectural stuff which you didn’t
finish, which must be handy
for what you do now.”
HUGHES: “Oh yes, absol-
utely. For instance, I can ren-
der a drawing of the Par-
thenon in 140 washes of
Chinese ink in the full beaux
arts manner which they
stopped teaching everywhere
in 1930, except Australia.
Watch out, Michael Graves.”
PACKER: “Then there was
your cartooning and your
early criticism. Is Australia
really a place where you make
mistakes and survive them?”


HUGHES: “It’s like the Woomera
Range. You remember the Jindavik, our
national defence drone. We were all like
early little Jindaviks; we’d rise off our
launching pad amid much farting and
flame and then we’d crash 20 yards
down-range and we’d pick ourselves up
and run round and get off again. The
thing is, you only have one chance and
it’s a huge big chance and, if you grab
the ball and run with it, it may change
your life. In Australia, you get lots of
chances but they’re all little chances.
Nobody in Australia is going to pay me
the kind of money for writing a weekly
art column the way Time does. It isn’t
feasible within the given structure of
Australian newspapers and magazines.”
PACKER: “And, obviously, Time is
very good to you. I’ve never managed to
find you at the office, so obviously they
let you work at home. They don’t care
where you go as long as you turn it in.”
HUGHES: “Exactly. They don’t
mind where I go and they pay the fares.
But I always have turned it in.”
PACKER: “And yet, Bob, you re-
main aggressively Australian.”
HUGHES: “What choice do I have?
It’s not a pose. I remain an Australian
citizen, not out of sentimentality but
simply because it would be absurd or
opportunistic to change.”
PACKER: “How did the convict
book germinate?”
HUGHES: “When Alan Moorehead
was writing that book of his, The Fatal
Impact [Hamish Hamilton London,
1966], about the arrival of the white man
in the South Pacific, he showed it to me
in manuscript so that I could vet it for
possible errors about art. I remember
reading it with admiration and I said to
him, ‘I wish I could find some subject
that didn’t have to do with art some-
thing connected with my deepest preoc-
cupations.’ He said, ‘Give it time; you
will.’ He was right. In 1975, I did a
series for the ABC on Australian paint-
ings. We were in Port Arthur, which I’d
never been to before. It’s the Paestum of
Australia; this great creepy ruin. And
what is it, our Paestum? It’s a jail. And,
as we were going over it, it occured to
me that there wasn’t an available book
which gave the whole story of what the
convict system was like. There’s an ex-
cellent administrative history by A. G.
L. Shaw called Convicts and the Colonies
but it gives you very little sense of what
it was like being a convict. It’s history
from above, not from below, although
it’s a standard text and a very good one.
I thought, ‘Heavens above, there must
be scope for a book here!’ I then saw a
New York publisher about it. At the
time, there was no interest in Australia
in New York. But they took it in the
end.
“Now, almost 10 years later, the sub-
ject is hot. There is a lot more interest in
Bryan Brown and Helen Morse in A Town Like Alice: more boring than Brideshead
Australia in America than there ever
was. This has to do with films. They
have this picture of us as being the Poles
of the South Pacific. You remember that
great fandango about the Polish cinema
in the late ’sos and early ’6os. Now, it’s
our turn. Twice a month. I go and lec-
ture in remote campuses in Idaho or In-
diana and after the lecture comes ques-
tion time. The students ask, ‘What about
this great renaissance of Australian
films?’ I explain to them that we col-
onials, who for years have been cultur-
ally colonised by Hollywood trash, just
like Jack Lang said, have now at last
through sheer self-awareness and na-
tionalistic effervescence succeeded in
making our own rubbish. I try and point
out to them that there are Australian
films, and Australian films. And they
only see the very best of them.”
PACKER: “I was talking to an Aus-
tralian writer recently who said the
trouble with setting a novel or a film in
Australia is that if you’re writing a saga
like (Colleen) McCullough, yes, that’s
all right, and if you’re writing something
quaint or weird that’s fine, too, but she
feels the huge US market is not yet pre-
pared to accept Australians in a novel
as ordinary people.”
HUGHES: “Yes, why is this?”
PACKER: “Perhaps they don’t think
Australians are interesting?”
HUGHES: “Americans don’t have a
coherent picture of Australia; it’s just
cultural unfamiliarity. They want to
think of Australia as being exotic, a dis-
tant pioneer country, pre-Freudian, pre-
political that’s their fantasy but it’s
very diffuse. You try to explain to them
the realities of Australian economic life
and the realities of Australian popula-
tion distribution and they don’t want to
hear about it. If you tell them that most
people live in cities with the same popu-
lation density as Los Angeles, they don’t
want to know. They think it’s all Bryan
Brown and the Qantas koala.”
PACKER: “That’s why A Town Like
Alice was so successful.”
HUGHES: “God, it was as boring as
Brideshead without even the house.”
PACKER: “I would have thought
that, as a member of a fine old Catholic
family, you would have been rolling in
the aisles when you watched
Brideshead .”
HUGHES: “Naturally. I’m as much
a snobbish ex-Catholic as anybody else.
It’s a poor novel, the work of a spiritual
groupie. It’s not Waugh being rude
about other people’s snobbery, which
would have made it a great novel; it’s
Waugh manifesting his own spiritual
parvenuism with a beatific vision of
God as the product of the English class
system.”
PACKER: “Talking about God and
classes, how do you fit into the Time
corporate arrangement?”
HUGHES: “I’m their tame cocka-
too. I’m the sort of interesting white
bird with the large voice and erectile
crest that gives them a good squawk
every week. I don’t help run the maga-
zine. As the subaltern said when asked
about his role in the cavalry, ‘My job is
to lend tone to the brawl’.”
PACKER: “... You were brought to
New York from London?”
HUGHES: “Along with two other
contenders: John Russell (art critic for
the New York Times) who was then
writing for the Times in London, and
Pierre Schneider who was the art critic
for L’Express in Paris and fluently bi-
lingual. At that stage, I had just been left


not quite definitively by my first
wife who had gone off to Algeria in pur-
suit of Eldridge Cleaver. So there she
was in Algeria, pursuing the Living
Theatre and the spectre of Black Revol-
ution, and there I was left high and dry
or high and wet in London and
very short of money. There is a firm
there called Nathan and Nathan;
they’re private bailiffs. The world div-
ides into those who know what Nathan
and Nathan means and those who
don’t. In my ears, the words Nathan
and Nathan sound like a bell. A
Pavlovian reflex is set off engendering
flight. Under English law, bailiffs can-
not force an entrance. But, if somebody
happens to go in, they can follow hard
on their heels. I was very circumspect
about who I opened the door to. My
neighbors knew this. Nathan and
Nathan were more or less on 24-hour
watch, waiting to distrain my furniture
and possessions.
“Early one morning, my telephone
having long ago been cut off for non-
payment, there was a scratching at the
window. Outside was this Rumanian
painter, Leonard Hessing, who had
crawled along the ledge between our
windows. I opened the window and
Hessing said: ‘There’s a call for you
from New York.’ So I clambered out
through the window and in through
Hessing’s window and there was this
strange American voice going on about
how they (not identifying who the\
were) wanted me to come over. He
wanted to know if I wanted to work for
them. I was slightly deranged and
thought it may be the CIA. This fellow
said, ‘We want you to come over and try
out.’ I got extremely cunning and said
something like, ‘Well, I would prefer
that you paid my fare.’ And then he
said, ‘Oh yes, of course expenses too
How much would you need?’ I said
hopefully, ‘A thousand dollars.’ And the
fellow, sounding rather disappointed
that I hadn’t asked for more, agreed.
“So, over I flew to America. All my
English friends cautioned me against
taking the job. They all said, as if one
voice, ‘You will be edited, you’ll be
turned into Time style.’ The curious
thing is that I’ve never had so little edi-
torial interference from a magazine in
my whole life. They don’t rewrite me,
they don’t do any of that kind of thing.
Which leads me to suppose that either,
like the gentleman in Moliere who dis-
covered that he’d been speaking prose
all his life, I had been writing Time style
all my life or else they are not the de-
monic that one had been led
to suppose they were. When I got there,
I made it a condition of the employment
that I should have a byline. Up to that
time, no Time writers had had a byline."

THEATRE
Company
goes after
another crowd
By SUSAN MOLLOY
A FUNNY THING happened on the
opening night of the Brecht/Weill The
Threepenny Opera from the Melbourne
Theatre Company.
There was a first night party. That is
not unusual for most theatre companies
but for this one it was extraordinary.
Not only was there a party but also it
was not peopled by the usual company
subscribers. Instead, there was a throng
of non-Establishment established artists
and eccentrics; reeling members of a
Fitzroy/Carlton push; others including
playwright Barry Dickins, singer Jane
Clifton, former Marihuana Party per-
son J. J. Mcßoach; friends of the show’s
director, Graeme Blundell; friends of
musical director Red Symons who first
rose to attention as a member of the de-
finitive 1970 s rock band
Skyhooks; friends of the com-
pany’s new publicist, Dale
Evans, a buoyant 34-year-old
who came to it from research
work on the Don Lane tele-
vision show.
Things are changing at the
Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany. The city’s most loved
and most hated shrine is
undergoing a facelift.
Admittedly, The Three-
penny Opera’s party was a bit
much for 61-year-old director
John Sumner. A non-drinker
who is plagued by ulcers, an
artist who brings cut lunches
to work when arriving
promptly at 8.45 am, an ad-
ministrator who dislikes first
night or long lunch razza-
matazz, Sumner was seen
briefly at the party at the
Victorian Arts Centre and dis-
appeared quickly. But he con-
cedes that he will have to get
used to such events.
Sumner is a pioneer who
came from England to man-
age the Union Theatre at the
University of Melbourne. He
has for 31 years built up the
most successful company in
Australia.
The Melbourne Theatre
Company last year played to
325,000 attenders. The Sydney Theatre
Company played to 129,000 in the same
year and the South Australian Theatre
Company with a state government
grant of $1.54 million played to
63,000 people. Despite the numbers, the
Melbourne Theatre Company recently
boosted its advertising budget by
$60,000 in an effort to attract a more
general audience.
The company has 20,000 subscribers
and 40 percent of its audience is under
the age of 26. Sumner sees a need to
widen its audience and to pep up its
image.
Melbourne is very good at throwing
buckets of negativity at success and the
company has long been a target for
criticism, whatever its output. Says
Sumner: “You can get a bit paranoid.”
The increase in advertising and a
higher public profile are the beginnings
of a drive which should become more
apparent as the year goes on.
Moving into the huge Playhouse of
the Arts Centre for 40 weeks of the year
while continuing to play in Russell
Street and the two Athenaeum theatres,
coupled with next year’s 20 percent cut
in funding from the Australia Council,
have necessitated the change of policy.
While he knows that his company must
widen its audience and advertise and
market itself with less decorum, Sumner
Melbourne Theatre Company’s John Sumner: great influence
DON McPHEDRAN
looks with horror at the high profile of
some other theatre companies in Mel-
bourne.
“We are not interested in specious
advertising,” he says. “We go for a lot of
substance, rather than display. But we
do realise we have to try to widen our
audience and we have to go for a pro-
gram more accessible to the general
public. By going into the Playhouse a
commercial arena for basically a non-
commercial company we will be more
exposed.
“Melbourne audiences are masters at
finding excuses for not going to the
theatre ... If it rains, you’ll get wet. If
it’s sunny, you’ll get hot. If there’s a
royal visit, forget it. If there’s a budget,
you stay home to see if there will be any
money. Royal visits and politicians are
big competition and they are more high-
ly subsidised.”
Sumner has had an enormous influ-
ence over theatre since 1953. Shy,
shrewd, influential and strong, he has
his share of artists who hate or who
adore him. One detractor said of him:
“Considering there is so much hatred of
him he is a real heavy; people’s ca-
reers have been ruined it is amazing
he has had so much success. He is a
genuine pioneer. His success has been
built on failure, as he really wanted to
create in Australia a model of an
English company with verbal
actors in the English style.
“His company is tremen-
dously successful but it is not
the company he wanted.”
Sumner has fierce loyalty
to the 130 staff of actors, de-
signers, milliners, carpenters
and others who work at the
Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany. He expects high stan-
dards. Said a loyal ap-
preciator: “It is his enormous
generosity of spirit which has
enabled him to allow people
to fail today because he be-
lieves they will succeed later.
He hands people a platform
on which to build their abili-
ties. He is not the dictator
which people believe him to
be.”
One example of this was
when, in the early 70s, he gave
rent free the Grant Street
Theatre (then leased by the
company) to the originators
of Hoopla Blundell and
Garrie Hutchinson. Hoopla
became the Playbox Theatre
and a main competitor.
Sumner gave Hoopla help
with wardrobe.
Sumner this year put the
power of his company behind
a group of actors who, when
they first approached him,


had only one script and some general
ideas. The result was a highly successful
season of three new Australian plays at
the Athenaeum 2. One of those plays,
David Allen’s Cheapside, was so popu-
lar (although some subscribers walked
out and others wrote letters of com-
plaint about the language) that it re-
turned last month for another season.
Cheapside is a dynamic comedy-thriller
set in Elizabethan London. Cleverly di-
rected by Simon Hopkins, it has been
one of the theatrical highlights in Mel-
bourne this year. Sydney’s Nimrod
Theatre is to do a production of the play
at the Seymour Centre next year.
The Melbourne Theatre Company is
not subsidised to tour, it is not allowed
to use any subsidy to develop exper-
imental work at the Athenaeum 2 and
losing Cheapside to the Nimrod has
railed Sumner.
Sumner is used to but not insensitive
to criticism of the company. “In those
people’s eyes, we have been here too
long and we have been too successful. It
is part of a pulling-down-the-tall-poppy
syndrome. They want change but they
do not know what else they want; they
just want change ...
“There is that other myth that the
MTC never puts on Australian plays.
We have done over 200 and that is out
of a repertoire of 500 plays.
“There is no question there were
enormous pushes when the arts became
subsidised. Other companies felt they
had to attack the established companies
to get their subsidy. The attitude was to
decry other companies’ existences to
prove their own reason for existence.
That is the reason the Pram Factory and
certainly the Playbox have risen.
“We were perhaps guilty of not
spending a lot of time jumping into
print defending outselves. We were
more involved in putting on plays and
talking was not something we had time
to do. And they were very political.
“As a company, we have always pur-
sued an apolitical line which makes us
vulnerable as we have never chased
after any person in power. And if a play
comes along we feel is worth doing it
would be seldom we would say, ‘Let’s
not do it on political grounds’.”
Besides producing Ray Lawler’s
Summer Of The Seventeenth Doll in
1955, the company showed Alan
Hopgood’s anti-war play Private Yuk in
1966, before the anti-Vietnam move-
ment had pierced the theatre. Sumner is
proud of such firsts. He also notes that
the company commissioned David Wil-
liamson’s second play.
“We do a lot more work than anyone
else,” Sumner says. “We put on more
productions than anyone else. We play
to an enormous amount more people
than other companies. We are most
under-subsidised.” □

If I have to type, please make it a Sharp.
When the office manager asked my
recommendation on new electronic typewriters
to replace our old electric models
I called up several of the better
known brands and arranged
demonstrations. I took the
comparison seriously -
typewriters are a high
cost item, and if I have to
live with one I want a
model that does thejob with speed and style. I must
say that Sharp impressed me most, for features, touch,
and a built-in understanding of what today's
typists need.
And Sharp have a typewriter for every
typist, from lightweight portables and
compacts up to highly sophisticated
models. I like myjob, and typing is an
important part of it. The office manager
agrbed - Sharp is simply the best.

FILMS
A very French
study of
friendship
Bernard Girardeau as Alain in Croque la Vie: a taste for detail
By SANDRA HALL
THERE IS a moment in Jean-Charles
Tacchella’s comedy Croque La Vie
(Grab at Life) when his three main
characters realise ruefully that, after
eight years of friendship, they neither
admire nor agree with one another.
All that binds them is their abiding
flippancy a shared belief in the pro-
found importance of the seemingly in-
consequential.
It is a very French conclusion in a
very French film, in which Tacchella
raises all those supposedly large themes
such as failed ambition and com-
promised principles before turning
away with a Gallic shrug. American di-
rectors such as Faurence Kasdan {The
Big Chill) and Arthur Penn ( Four
Friends) may like to use stories of youth-
ful friendships growing to maturity as
an excuse for a little political science on
the side but Tacchella enjoys his charac-
ters too much to try to score points with
them. It’s detail which interests him
he is a domestic anthropologist whose
taste for the inconsistencies and in-
congruities of human behaviour is so
strong that it sometimes runs away with
his narrative line. Best of all, he loves to
study people in crowds. His big hit
Cousin Cousine would not have been
nearly as successful without the quiet
chaos of its artfully staged family gath-
erings and, here, the formula is repeat-
ed. As three students who meet at art
school and go on meeting intermittently
as they fall into and out of jobs and
marriages, Carole Faure, Brigitte
Fossey and Bernard Girardeau test the
bounds of their friendship at a suc-
cession of lunches, picnics and parties,
as if the social rituals of eating and
drinking together were the most reveal-
ing of all.
Therese (Faure) marries for love and
regrets it. Alain (Girardeau) marries for
money so that he can paint, then is
trapped into a career running a book-
shop. And Cathy (Fossey) falls in love
with a rich man (Alain Doutey), buries
herself in his house in the country and
takes care of her dead sister’s child
while maintaining that she does not be-
lieve in being married or having chil-
dren.
Each fiercely disapproves of the
others’ lovers and they frequently disap-
point one another in all sorts of ways.
Yet they try again every few years, using
their friendship as a touchstone for
everything else in their lives.
Therese, the most sexually adventur-
ous, solves most problems by taking a
new lover; Alain is a pragmatist whose
talents as an extrovert help him manipu-
late every situation; and Cathy is so de-
cent and accepting that those around
her invariably take advantage of her no
matter how much they love her.
None of them changes. Tacchella has
no time for that very American concept,
“personal growth.” As far as he is con-
cerned, time makes no difference at all
to anybody and, at the end of the film,
his characters are behaving more or less
as they were in the beginning.
Therese has a new man; Cathy is still
talking about going away to “find her-
self’ (although, this time, it seems as if
she will have to go all the way to Ethio-
pia); and Alain, the prankster, has just
been indulging his insatiable curiosity
about friends and acquaintances by or-
ganising a fancy dress party to which
everybody has been asked to wear drag.
The film demands a great deal of its
actors. Tacchella, who also wrote the
script, does not go in for punchlines and
quotable dialogue. His characters talk
in a desultory fashion about President
Mitterrand, unemployment and where
they might go for their holidays but they
reveal themselves less in what they say
than in how they look while saying it.
Tacchella is a great believer in set-
pieces and incongruous sights and, al-
though there is nothing as grand or as
inspired as the family wedding from
Cousin, Cousine, he tries hard to match
some of its highlights notably with a
competitive party game which rapidly
accelerates into a brawl without a word
being spoken, as well as the spectacle of
a flirting heterosexual couple dressed in
drag and assorted quarrels conducted
before fascinated observers in streets
and restaurants.
Sometimes these work. More often,
they fail to spark because their direction
is so deadpan that the actors need to
become clowns to carry them off. And
none of the three leads is a clown.
Fossey and Girardeau, in particular,
make perfect sense of their roles but
they can summon up neither the hilari-
ously manic touches Tacchella got from
Marie-France Pisier in Cousin, Cousine
nor the unselfconscious humor supplied
by Marie-Christine Barrault and Victor
Fanoux.
These lapses mean that Tacchella is
never able to settle on a mood for the
film, so that it teeters arbitrarily between
seriousness and slightly inspired ab-
surdity.
It has a neat ending, though, in
which he has one final joke at his
characters’ expense a joke which
seems pleasantly astringent and very
salutary after the heavily self-conscious
air of so much of the soul-searching in
Four Friends and The Big Chill. □

‘4*4-- a
Quintet by Rove
When you find the car that you always wanted,
life can get pretty exciting.
Particularly when it has all the verve and grace of a
Rover. And Japanese economy reliability and high re-
sale value.
Best of all is a modest price tag of $13,400.*
(Which is about what you’d normally pay for a
Toyota Celica Hatchback,
Mazda 626 Super Deluxe
5-Door, or a Telstar
TXS Ghia.)**
The luxury in exciting detail.
When you discuss the Quintet, it’s best to start
with a long list of comforts and features.
Power steering. Electric windows. Electric aerial.
Twin remote control exterior mirrors. Pioneer stereo
radio/cassette. Seats, doors and headrests beautifully
finished in crushed velour.
Carpet you’d be happy to have in your
home. (Even the load space is carpeted.)
Alloy wheels. Radial ply tyres.
Tachometer. Interior releases for the

fuel filler cap and rear hatch. Electric sunroof and air
conditioning are attractive options.
Exciting performance.
The Rover Quintet is more than a second quicker
up to 100 km/h than the Camira SL/X 4-speed and the
Toyota Celica 5-speed 3-door. 1
And uses between IV2 and 3 litres per 100 km less
petrol around town. n
It has a highly efficient 1.6-litre, 4-cylinder engine
with overhead cam, alloy cylinder head and electronic
ignition.
To cap it all off, the Quintet has cat-like agility. With
4-wheel independent suspension and front wheel drive.
Exciting but sensible.
The Rover Quintet is also a surprisingly practical
car. It has four doors, a rear hatch, and rear seat backs
that fold down independently.
It is so well built, you are assured of trouble-free
motoring.
All in all, can you think of a more exciting way to
spend $13,400?*

BOOKS
The flow of
travel writing
at its best
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Great Rivers Of The World, edited
by Alexander Frater,
photographed by Colin Jones.
Hodder & Stoughton, $29.95.
WHILE YOU read this book, the great
rivers flow through your soul as-
suming that you have a soul. At any
rate, through your being. The 11 rivers
are in Europe, the Americas, Asia, north
and central Africa.
Over lunch one day in London,
Alexander Frater (who was born in
Vanuatu which has no rivers to speak
of) devised a series for the color maga-
zine of the London Sunday newspaper
The Observer with the help of a photog-
rapher named Colin Jones.
“A river is a fine literary device,”
Frater notes in his introduction. “It has
a beginning, a middle and an end and
possesses its own narrative flow.”
Frater and Jones began formulating
their reasons for a choice of rivers. The
Nile, Amazon and Mississippi were
more than 6000 km long; the Yangtse
Kiang came in at 5495 km. These were
the top four. The world’s fifth in length
was Ob, discarded as an obscure
Siberian stream on which nothing much
happened. Then came the Volga, the
Zambesi and the Danube which was to
be the chief European river.
Frater regretted having to write off
the Tigris and the Euphrates, the diffi-
culty being the Iraqi-Iranian war.
They said no to the Murray and yes
to the Ganges and finally yes to the Ir-
rawaddy in spite of enormous diplo-
matic, bureaucratic and communication
difficulties. Earlier, they had chosen the
Zaire (formerly the Congo) for what it
represents in colonial and neo-colonial
history as well as for its own magnifi-
cence and the Loire for being the
longest and prettiest river in France.
The writers matched to the rivers,
whether by their own choice or that of
the editors, are stars on their own ac-
count Bruce Chatwin, Norman Lewis,
Paul Theroux, Piers Paul Read,
Geoffrey Moorhouse, Geoffrey Grigson,
Frater, who took the Irrawaddy himself
after months of frustration or dis-
tinguished travel writers in Ronald
Fraser, Libby Purves (the only female)
The Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers merge at Devprayag to form the Ganges proper
and Nicholas Wollaston who got two
hard ones, the Zambesi and the Zaire.
They have treated their assignments
in quite different, highly individual and
sometimes egocentric ways. Which ac-
count of which river most excites the
reader will be a matter of taste. For
many, the definitive (modern) Missis-
sippi already will have been enshrined
in Jonathan Raban’s Old Glory (Fla-
mingo/Collins paperback).
The writers are opinionated while
letting off a few political firecrackers.
They seem to be telling the truth about
what they saw and heard, odd as it often
is. Theroux points out that as far as the
Chinese are concerned there is no
Yangtse but a river called Ta Jiang,
Great River, or Chang Jiang Long
River. He joined a tour, 2400 km down-
stream in two boats, Number 39 and the
Kun Lun, but there were 3200 km of the
river he did not see. The tourists were
American millionaires who were friend-
ly for some the trip was their second,
at $5OOO a ticket except for one
woman who said to him crushingly:
“Oh course I’m happier than you; I’ve
got more money than you.”
Chatwin also travelled by cruise
boat, the MV Maxim Gorky, full of Ger-
mans, down the Volga. “Some had been
panzer officers who had wasted their
youth in Siberian labor camps and were
revisiting the scene of lost battles.”

begins: “On the road to Mandalay,
where your shock absorbers self-
destruct” and goes on, “I had long re-
garded Mandalay as a place where the
citizens lived in palaces of sandalwood
and put up uncut rubies as collateral for
the purchase of their elephants. But the
streets smelt of sundried fish and were
full of blaring transistors and kamikaze
cyclists, many of them monks.”
But it is clear that what we all sus-
pected abut the Irrawaddy is true: it is
one of the great mysterious wonders of
Asia and will remain so while the
Burmese keep it so jealously to them-
selves.
The rivers Zambesi and Zaire are at
the same time rumbustious because of
the people and formidably lonely and
distanced from what we think of as civi-
lization. Drifting along somnolently on
a hot afternoon coming, into Kinshasa,
Wollaston’s boat met a yacht going the
other way. Sitting on a platform, wear-
ing a leopardskin hat, was President
Mobuto Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa
Za Banga of Zaire, Father of the Na-
tion, Guide of the Revolution.
Thanks to publishing and television,
we are relatively familiar with some of
these rivers but surprises remain.
For instances, there are a million
nightingales along the Loire; at Mem-
phis on the Mississippi, famous Beale
Street was derelict, closed to traffic and
not a blues trumpet was there to be
heard; on the Nile delta, a man with a
switch supervised a gang of children
working for the equivalent of 40 Austra-
lian cents a day.
Travel writing becomes better and
better. This book sets a new high stan-
dard for it in what can be called the
short burst. □
What the early
Irish wrote
home about us
Patrick O’Farrell: soldiering on, with an infinite amount of campaigning to do
By GERRARD WINDSOR
Letters From Irish Australia 1825-
1929, by Patrick O’Farrell. New
South Wales University Press,
Sydney, & Ulster Historical
Foundation, Belfast, $19.95.
PATRICK O’FARRELL wears the
writer’s badge of authenticity; he sol-
diers on, with great stylishness and hu-
manity, against myth, cliche, and tyran-
nical orthodoxy. And having chosen
Ireland for his province, he has an infi-
nite amount of campaigning to do.
Popular notions about the Irish at
home and abroad are legion. And more
often than not they represent stereotype
and nonsense to the power of infinity.
O’Farrell is our main hope for liber-
ation from silly or simple-minded ro-
mance. He is the most distinguished and
prolific authority on Ireland and Irish
Australia that the antipodes have
produced.
His major history of the Irish in Aus-
tralia is planned for 1986. He describes
this present work, Letters From Irish
Australia 1825-1929, as “an ancillary
volume” to the forthcoming history.
The least pretentious and yet most sub-
stantial contribution to the 1988
Bicentary that I have yet heard of was
made public at the launching of Letters.
The Irish ambassador announced that
his government would subsidise the
writing and publication of Patrick
O’Farrell’s history. Erin go bragh!
This gesture has a largeness of mind
to it. For these letters from Irish mi-
grants are culled from Irish archives,
and Northern Ireland, O’Farrell tells us,
has made a much better fist of archival
collection than has the Republic. So,
this is not a collection of missives from
merry little leprechauns hailing from
Kerry or West Cork, breathing republi-
canism, papistry and wit in every line.
As the author says, “Protestants, and
those who came from the Ulster coun-
ties generally, are overrepresented.”
That is an understatement. They
must take up about 90 percent of the
book. But an author must work with
what is at hand. Ulster Protestants were
more literate, as well as more likely to
correspond with a home district that
had never become denuded by the mi-
gration of whole families as happened
in parts of Munster or Connaught. So,
for the experience of southern Cath-
olics, we must wait for the history.
There is no one way these letters
show Irish migrants adjusting to Austra-
lia, working out an attitude and code
toward those still at home or moving
toward a primarily Australian identity.
Diversity is all; not a few of the “mi-
grants” return to Ireland or move on to
America or, in one case, Africa. Loans,
gifts and bequests from Ireland were as
much part of the traffic as remittances
sent home from Australia. Five sons of
the Maxwell family came to Victoria in
the 1880 s; the line seems to have died
out in Australia but some of their de-
scendants still work the original farm at
Ballygannah, County Down.
Some of these Maxwell brothers
write the most thoughtful letters in the
collection. Hugh gave freely of his
opinions. He exhorted his sister in

ticoats from bands over the shoulders
instead of buttoning them around the
waist. But his considered opinions
could be much more abstract than this.
He commented in 1886: “The Austra-
lian bush impresses newcomers very
much on their first run up country.” He
admits he prefers the scenery at home
but he adds: “Of course, art has done
more for that of the home counties than
it has yet accomplished in Australia.” A
remarkably pregnant observation, par-
ticularly coming from one who else-
where never mentions art or literature
(or indeed reading of any kind). The ab-
sence of such subject matter is universal.
Most of the more voluminous writers
took up small selections and their fights
to survive on the land were all-con-
suming.
Many of the writers are eloquent on
the pros and cons of Australia. A con-
vict in 1835 says it “is for salubrity of
climate equal to the garden of the world,
Italy, but with this exception, not sub-
ject to brain fevers, or European dis-
eases that them countries are.” Isaac
Sloane, an elderly wit, writes in 1892 of
Hay where “they are all but roasted ...
not a green blade of grass, a bad place
for an Irishman and he wants some-
thing green to look at.”
The most moving letter is from a
convict, Thomas Fallon, beseeching his
wife in 1835 to find her way out. “Der
mary let me know in youre next letter is
my fathere live or know or did my sister
go to meracar or know Der mary this is
fine cuntry is there is in the wourld for
ateing and drinking ... if you wore in
this cuntry you cud be worth pound per
week but by owne labour ...”
But the bon vivant’s paradise is
castigated as the civilised man’s hell by
an Antrim doctor visiting his sister in
the Grampians in 1849. “.There is
nothing almost in any of the settlers’
heads but some half dozen things, to wit
sheep, wool, bullocks, drays, servants,
horses, and occasionally a little about
tallow and boiling down and huts and
such like. That is the eternal, never ceas-
ing lingo, day and night, summer and
winter ... last year when the most in-
tense interest was prevailing amongst,
one would have said, the whole civilised
world with regard to the stirring affairs
of Europe and the fearful changes and
catastrophes occurring so plentifully on
the continent, they out in Port Phillip
neither read nor cared one fig about the
entire matter and never would speak al-
most on the subject, except to curse the
French for spoiling the price of their
wool, and then they smoke and drink
and drink and smoke.”
Max Harris, Donald Horne, et al,

BOOK BULLETIN
The Facey industry booms
by Patricia Rolfe
ALBERT FACEY’s A Fortunate Life is
now not so much a book as an industry.
Penguin Books who acquired rights
from original publisher Fremantle Arts
Press have sold almost 150,000 in paper-
back, 4244 of an Allen Lane cased
hardback and are printing 5000 of an
illustrated edition to be published next
month.
PBL Productions is spending $6.3
million on its eight-hour television
mini-series based on the book. The
series is generating work for about 1000
people. Bill Kerr is playing Old Albert
and Dorothy Allison is Grandma Carr.
Filming is very much a West Australian
thing.
PBL Productions has built a 4000-
square metre complex in Perth. Filming
is being done at about 60 locations. The
production unit has even planted seven
hectares of 70-day wheat.
Penguin’s illustrated edition has a
cover painting belonging to Robert
Holmes a Court of the West Australian
countryside. End papers are fragments
of the manuscript, handwritten in
school exercise books. The book is illus-
trated with Facey family photographs
and other photographs of the Australia
about which Facey wrote.
TV’s Life: Antony Richards with Willy Fennell
THE New Yorker magazine has a long
and strong history with the short story.
Many admirers of its writers may at
times innocently believe that these live
the rich life seen in the magazine’s ad-
vertisements, shopping at Bergdorf
Goodman, holidaying in the Bahamas
and so on, but sadly this is rarely if ever
true.
John Cheever, who died in 1982,
wrote for the magazine for many years.
His daughter Susan Cheever, an author
of fiction, has written a memoir of her
father Home Before Dark (coming
from Weidenfeld and Nicolson next
March) which makes clear that life
for him was not smooth or sunny.
Susan Cheever writes about her
father’s difficult but lasting marriage, his
snobby need to invent a suitable New
England background for himself, his
long-repressed homosexuality, his heart
attacks and death from cancer. His
writing did not bring him a great deal of
money and sometimes little critical ac-
claim.
Life for him and with him was at
times a joy, at other times an abomina-
tion.
WRITERS are in their nature inventive;
sometimes their invention
knows no bounds.
United States’ Random
House is delaying publication
of the title Telling Right From
Wrong because duthor Tim-
othy Cooney forged a letter,
under the name of the presi-
dent of the Philosophy de-
partment at Harvard Univer-
sity, praising the book. Ran-
dom House would have pub-
lished without the letter and
may yet do so. Cooney’s thesis
on morality expounded in the
book is that only actions
which hurt others are
“wrong,” so the forgery was
not.
Noted African writer Doris
Lessing (coming to Australia
next year for Canberra’s
Wordfest) has just revealed
that two recent novels she
wrote under another name,
Jane Somers, were turned
down by her regular publisher
Jonathan Cape and were
ignored or coolly treated by
reviewers and that only 2000
of the 5000 copies printed
sold. □

NEIGHBORHOOD
Kiwis come out fighting
for world market share
New Zealand over the past 20 years has taken an economic hammering.
But now, says lAN TEMPLETON, Overseas Trade minister
Mike Moore is leading a crusade of aggression and optimism.
EBULLIENT Mike Moore, New Zea-
land’s Minister of Overseas Trade and
one of the architects of Labor’s July vic-
tory, was speaking the other night in
parliament about the transformation
that had taken place in New Zealand in
the past 12 weeks. “We were,” he said,
“a nation that was turning rotten before
it was ripe. For so long our country was
dispirited and negative. We were be-
coming engrossed with our differences.
The fresh air that has blasted through
the parliament and the country in the
last few weeks has been an important
factor in lifting the spirits of the New
Zealand people. There is a mood of
realism and hope. It’s springtime again
for New Zealand.”
Even allowing for an element of pol-
itical hyerbole, Moore had accurately
charted the mood of the country.
It is so buoyant that it absorbed the
shock of inflation returning to a double-
digit annual rate with equanimity. And
the Federation of Labor has accepted
with hardly a murmur the dismissal of
its case for an immediate $l5 a week
general wage rise.
But the transformation goes deeper
than the resilience to absorb bad news.
Again to quote Moore, the Nationals’
policy had been the policy of the cring-
ing dog before its master. He said: “At
one stage they wanted to hide under the
skirts of Britain but then they sought
economic and political security in the
pockets of other great nations. We are
saying New Zealand will be a good
friend and a good ally but never a good
colony. We seek an alliance of equals,
an alliance of friendship, but never
unquestioning, never totally compliant
and always acting in the best interests of
our people and our region. The tired
and desperate politics of the past have
damaged New Zealand immensely but
not terminally.
“We are no longer an imperial farm
for Britain, where life was secure under
an empire on which the sun never set.
Those days are gone.”
It is clear that the new attitude in
New Zealand is as yet imperfectly
Overseas Trade minister Moore: springtime for NZ
JOHN SELKIRK
understood among some of its tradition-
al friends and allies. Moore articulates
what is a generational change. The
Labor cabinet largely represents the
post-war generation, while the previous
National cabinet had lived and fought
through World War 11. The young min-
isters of the Labor cabinet reject the mo-
tives and philosophy which guided pre-
vious governments. They have a Pacific
perspective. They see New Zealand less
as a member of the western alliance
than as part of the South Pacific region.
Where previous governments patiently
worked to inject an economic element
into the ANZUS alliance, so that New
Zealand could lobby
effectively in Washington,
they believe that they can
make their trade case on its
merits.
As Moore told parliament
in a debate on foreign affairs:
“The government is not look-
ing for a special deal. A com-
mercial logic is behind its
case.”
Since he became minister
of Overseas Trade at the end
of July, Moore has visited
Australia, Japan, Korea, Bra-
zil and Europe. He tells his
hosts that he is a Pacific
Islander, a New Zealander,
not a lost European.
Moore notes that in the
past 20 years New Zealand’s
share of world trade has
dropped dramatically. Had
New Zealand maintained its
1960 position, in relative
terms, it would be earning an
extra $lO billion in income.
Yet New Zealand, so rich in
resources, has not been able to
sustain its place. Living stan-
dards and income per person
have slipped from third in the
world to about 20th.
Moore sees it as his job to
restore New Zealand’s role as
a great trader. The challenge
is to diversify products as well
as markets. He wants to create what he
calls the “New Zealand co-operative,”
and to establish a New Zealand “world
brand.” Moore himself is mounting a
global market strategy. Where New
Zealand once concentrated on supply-
ing a few principal markets with com-
modities such as butter, cheese and
lamb in bulk, the aim will be to tailor
the product for particular markets.
Already Moore has had a consider-
able impact as his country’s marketing
overlord. New Zealand, particularly
after the 20 percent devaluation, has be-
come a formidable competitor in Aus-
tralian markets and against Australian


Jack and Hanjiah Smoke with their family: a way of life similar to the Torres Strait Islands
products in third world markets.
New Zealand plans to put 10,000
tonnes of lamb into the Australian mar-
ket despite the opposition of Australian
sheep men. Eventually, too, it expects to
sell more dairy products across the Tas-
man, though it restrains sales at present
under a gentlemen’s agreement with the
Australian dairy farmers. □
BORNEO
Smokey finds
his place in
the Labuan sun
By CHRIS ASHTON
FOR John Jack Smoke, Labuan began
on June 10, 1945. That was when he saw
it for the first time a long low fringe of
coconut palms, a strip of land about 13
kilometres by five, 50km from the coast
of Borneo.
Labuan marked the first step of the
Borneo compaign, spearheaded by the
AIF Ninth Division under General
Morshead. “Smokey,” as John Smoke
was called, was part of the Beach Group
which ferried soldiers, ammunition and
supplies ashore in landing craft.
“We thought the Japs would be there
waiting for us,” he recalls. “We came in
at 9 in the morning and not a shot was
fired. They’d gone inland. There were
casualties later on, though.”
He had no inkling then that Labuan
was where he would settle and make his
life. But the Australian forces gave way
a year later to a British military
administration. Volunteers were called
for to stay behind and help rebuild what
the war had destroyed. Smokey was the
only Australian to offer himself.
“The people were very friendly,” he
explained. “It was like home.” He
talked of Thursday Island where he was
born in 1914. Apart from the Islanders
and white Australians, there were al-
ways Malay divers, Chinese shopkeep-
ers and fishing boats from Taiwan or
Japan.
But something else drew him to Bor-
neo. Everything centres on the maze of
rivers and the coastline with its treach-
erous reefs. Everyone moves about in
shallow-draft boats. It was a way of life
he knew from the Torres Strait Islands.
So he stayed.
He worked with the British
administration, then with British Petro-
leum and then with an Australian
named Norman Pagett who had been an
air force squadron leader and gone back
to buy trees from the tribespeople of the
interior. Smokey hauled the logs down-
stream to a log pond at Labuan.
Other work followed. He took a
landing craft to Singapore and worked
for a former British navy commander,
salvaging sunken shipping in Singapore
harbor. There Smokey married a Cocos
Islander, a Malay girl called Hanjiah,
15 years his junior. On return to Borneo,
there was other work: hauling river
gravel in Brunei; salvaging war wrecks
for an Australian scrap metal dealer
called Sullivan living in Kota Kinabalu,
capital of what is now the Malaysian
state of Sabah; stevedoring ashore in
Labuan; and, from 1970 to 1982, build-
ing off-shore oil rigs for the construction
company Brown and Root.
“There’s no life like the sea,” he says.
“If it wasn’t for my arthritis, I’d go back
tomorrow.”
His father had worked sailing ships
and tried to persuade his son not to go
to sea. In vain. At 14, Smokey signed on
as a diver to a pearling lugger and
worked along the Barrier Reef for 10
years. He does not move about much
now, living in a small but comfortable
and modern bungalow on the edge of
the jungle. If he wants x to go to town,
one of his Malay relatives drives him.
He and Hanjiah had no children of their
own but they adopted five, all Malays
and all adults now.
After marriage, Smokey became a
Moslem. He is an easy-going one who
does not forgo alcohol. He remembers
how he heard on short-wave radio of the
Japanese surrender, how the 15 mem-
bers of the Beach Group ferried eight
crates of beer ashore and sat on the
beach drinking themselves into a stu-
por. All his war stories are of the good
times.
Everyone on Labuan knows
Smokey. In a population of 30,000, two-
thirds of whom are Malay (the balance
are Chinese, Indians, Europeans and
mixed-race), he is something of an odd-
ity a dark-skinned Australian married
to a Malay.
The first taxi I hailed was driven by a
Chinese. Could he take me to someone
called Smokey? No worries. Everyone
knew Smokey.
He still thinks of himself as Austra-
lian.
On Anzac Day, he pins on his De-
fence Medal and Pacific Star and a
couple of others whose names he forgets
and joins other Australian and New
Zealand expatriates in a dawn service at
the war cemetery. And he acts as un-
official host every year or two when par-
ties of Returned Services League vet-
erans arrive, showing them the graves
and Surrender Point where the Japanese
command threw it in.
The Labuan office of Harrison and
Crossfield, a British commercial firm,
gave him a return air ticket to Australia
in 1980 - his first trip back since settling
in Labuan. The RSL, he says, feted him
like a governor-general.
The Department of Veterans’ Affairs
had no record of him but he had his
certificate of discharge. Under RSL
pressure, the department acknowledged
liability for deferred pay and war ser-
vice pension.
That Smokey should chance upon
Labuan in a water borne invasion was
one of the fortunes of war. And he says
that, no, he has no regrets about de-
ciding to stay on. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Getting a share of the
bloodhorse breeding boom
Australian thoroughbred racehorses have taken further strides toward putting the nation's
studs firmly on the world breeding map. MICHAEL MEAGHER examines the industry and
the opportunities which the latest developments offer the investor as well as the punter.
WHEN a Kentucky stud-
master offered a reported $lO
million for the champion
racehorse Strawberry Road
last week, he did the Austra-
lian thoroughbred industry a
big favor. The bid for the stal-
lion by Whiskey Road whose
grandsire is Northern Dancer,
the most successful sire in the
world, is a valuable step
toward putting our studs on
the world breeding map.
The offer is even sweeter to
the Sydney owners of the
horse, a syndicate headed by
John Singleton and Ray
Stehr. Their gamble in taking
Strawberry Road to France
for Europe’s richest race, the
Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe,
paid off when he ran a credi-
table fifth behind winner
Sagace.
Strawberry Road could
have been making hay on a
NSW stud property, serving
37 mares a season at $15,000 a
time, but the connections
chose France and have seen
the horse’s value increase by
six to seven times as a result. The Ken-
tucky bid is only one of those coming
from the United States breeding indus-
try which has discovered that there are
real bargains to be made out of our
horseflesh. Americans can buy race-
horses with form on the board in Aus-
tralia our best in many cases as
cheaply as parting with their money for
unraced yearlings back home.
American interests last week paid
Sydney owner David Royle an es-
timated $1.2 million for the New Zea-
land-bred three-year-old colt Royal
Troubador and the owners of top three-
year-old Red Anchor recently said
“No” to a $3 million offer.
Paradoxically, the offers are both
good and bad news for the local indus-
try. If accepted, they enhance Austra-
lia’s international breeding reputation.
Breeders have fought for the past 10
Breeding expert Les Young in stables at Muskoka Farm
KEVIN BROWN
years to throw off a tag of dumping
ground for European and US leftovers.
But the offers mean the cream of the
industry’s future may be skimmed off.
Possibly even bigger news for the lo-
cal breeders is the imminent public float
of a thoroughbred stud the first of its
kind in Australia.
Like the Australian Racing and
Breeding Stables Ltd (ARABS) which
comes up for its first anniversary on the
stock exchange next month, the new
company Blandford Park Ltd will
offer the man in the street the chance to
invest without parting with extraordi-
nary amounts of money and taking the
gamble of personally buying and racing
a horse. Blandford will differ from
ARABS in that its main asset is a stud
three properties covering some of the
most idyllic horse breeding country in
Australia in the Hunter Valley of NSW.
ARABS is considering
buying some equity in a stud
but its main asset outside
broodmare and stallion syndi-
cate shares is a recently pur-
chased half share in the Nebo
Lodge training complex at
Rosehill in Sydney.
The most exciting element
of the Blandford float, a back-
door listing whereby the prop-
erties belonging to the
Blandford Park Trust will be
sold into an existing listed
company, is its American con-
nections. One of the biggest
and most prestigious studs in
the US has agreed to take
equity in the venture and,
under foreign investment
guidelines, can take up to 14.9
percent. Broker to the issue is
John Messara who has exten-
sive interests in thorough-
breds through his Middle-
brook Park Stud, also in the
Hunter Valley, at Scone.
Blandford, embracing
about 2300 hectares, was
bought by a trust in mid-1983
at the instigation of property
managers, the Hyperion Thoroughbreds
management group. The trust was set up
to raise $l5 million from 300 units at
$50,000 each to purchase and develop
the Timor Creek, Blandford Park and
Pentlands properties in the Hunter.
It is understood that, subject to ap-
proval of the Sydney Stock Exchange,
the directors of Blandford will inject the
Blandford properties into the company
at a value of $4.6 million (against a re-
cent independent valuation of $6 mil-
lion) plus nominations in two stallions.
Blandford will receive 27 (out of 42)
shares in imported Irish stallion The
Fort, one of Britain’s best two-year-olds
of 1982, and 12 shares (out of 42) in
1981 Sydney Golden Slipper winner
Full On Aces. Both stallions also carry
free nominations for standing rights at
Blandford.

$400,000 while those in The Fort will

the new company, is a director. The pur-
chase price is $300,000.
A release of 2.7 million shares will
take issued capital in the new company
to 5.5 million $1 shares.
Blandford is to be base for US-
owned racehorses in Australia. Con-
versely, local mares and stallions could
find themselves doing duty in the US.
In search of bluebloods, Messara re-
cently travelled to Europe to buy well-
performed middle distance galloper
Tolomeo, which also raced in the US.
The chief attraction of the four-year-old
is that he is a grandson of Northern
Dancer.
Messara made the trip with highly-
respected Sydney veterinarian Percy
Sykes and Tolomeo has been syndicated
for $4.5 million to stand at the Gooree
Stud, of wl ich Sykes is chairman.
Gooree Stud ilso nestles in the Hunter.
Messara, or whom hocks and fet-
locks are be coming just as common
terms as the refs of the broking game,
says that Toh meo will provide “a greal
cross to Aust: alia’s Star Kingdom line.’
Star Kingdo n is perhaps Australia’s
most influent al bloodline his progen}

Kingdom.
The app eciation of bloodstock

gauged from the accompanying table

led out.
Averaging often g ves a distorted
view of the market but here is plenty of
money for quality.
At last year’s Sydn :y sale, 42 year-
lings went under the I tmmer for more
than $50,000 each. T 1 s top price was
$375,000. All breeders are shooting for
the top 5 percent of th< market.
Syndicated prices for stallions,
whose market capitalis itions are geared
to their nomination fee , have shot up in
Europe and the US \ here a share in

thrift Farm in Kentucl y) recently, sold

A share in leading sire Sir Tristram
sold for $280,000 in New Zealand,
placing a value of $1 million on the
sire. And Golden Slipper winner Sir
Dapper is valued at $5 million in Aus-
tralia. The price escalations have
brought new sophistication to racing
and breeding.
The breeding and racing game is
now being approached with the tech-
niques and principles similar to those
used in the stock, property or commodi-
ties markets. The new breed of players
are of Messara’s ilk.
Methods of raising capital have
changed, too. New Zealand has several
thoroughbred companies listed on the
stock exchange and it looks to be a
trend in Australia with ARABS, al-
though slow to leave the gates, asserting
itself as a breeding force.
ARABS and Blandford offer cheap
entry into racing at reduced risk. Mana-
ging director of ARABS, Les Young, il-
lustrates the high cost for the man in the
street of buying into racing or breeding.
Young says that a horse costs between
$lO,OOO and $12,000 a year to race in the
metropolitan area whether it cost $1 or
$lOO,O )0 to buy.
If 1 le investor decides on a brood-
mare • • which, if it has won a few races
“in to vn,” may cost from $15,000 to
$20,00 ) she will cost some $3OOO a
year t< maintain at stud. To breed from
her ad Is a stud fee which could be up to
$50,00 ) in Australia. Further costs arise
when he mare is in foal and the foal at
foot is another mouth to feed.
Ra< ecourse-bound progeny then be-
gin to generate a new cycle of costs.
Set up in 1969 by former Sydney
Turf ( lub chairman George Ryder
ARAE 5 is designed to give cheaper en-
try in o racing, even if you have to
watch a winner being sashed on the
other ; ide of the paddock fence.
Wh ;n ARABS joined the stock ex-
chang last year, its capital comprised


Les Young, trainer Brian Mayfield-Smith and strapper at Muskoka
KEVIN BROWN
5.72 million shares at 20 cents each and
220,000 contributing shares with the
shares trading in a range between 12
and 40 cents. Following rights issues
and placements this year, there are 11.8
million fully-paid shares w ith 4.1 mil-
lion options and a limited number of
contributing shares. ARABS is trading
at 35 cents a share and has held its value
well despite the expansion of scrip. The
new scrip invariably has been issued to
introduce stud nominations or other
assets to the company.
Young says that the difference be-
tween going into BHP and ARABS is
that shareholders invest in BHP where-
as they follow ARABS.
They publish a monthly newsletter
and shareholders weekly can call a re-
corded message to catch up on stable
activities.
Young says that he was “forced” into
the racing game as a child when bedrid-
den with asthma. With little else to do,
he listened to the races. The asthma left
him but the interest in racing stayed.
He works closely with one of Austra-
lia’s leading thoroughbred owners, Bob
Lapointe, holder of 44 percent of the
ARABS capital. Lapointe made his for-
tune through introducing Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut fast food
outlets to Australia. He retains Pizza
Hut properties in Sydney and in Adel-
aide.
Lapointe is believed to own outright
or lease (although ownership is the
exception, rather than the rule) some
300 thoroughbreds. His partners include
Robert Sangster, Sir Tristan Antico and
Michael Willesee who owns the Trans
Media Stud near Cootamundra, NSW
and who has a significant holding in
ARABS through a placement.
Lapointe and Young the financial
and the breeding expert met soon
after Lapointe had bought a property,
Muskoka Farms, at Wisemans Ferry on
the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney
and became inspired by a quarterhorse
boom of the late 70s. Young talked
Lapointe out of that interest and they
formed a company, Doncaster Breeding
Services, which Young ran with
Lapointe a silent partner. Doncaster, a
stock and station agency, was merged
into ARABS this year.
Muskoka has been converted into an
extensive pre-training operation for
thoroughbreds.
Pre-training allows trainers to push
more horses through their stables space
by having the thoroughbreds there only
six weeks before racing them, against 12
weeks without pre-training.
Muskoka Farms, is a partnership be-
tween Lapointe, (who has a 50 percent
interest), real estate developer John
Ledgerwood, stockbroker Brent Potts,
Tom Van-Brugge and Geoff Wild who is
managing director of advertising agen-
cy John Clemenger NSW.
Muskoka Farms has plenty for which
to thank Young. He was the one who
trekked to a lonely paddock in the
middle of the drought a few years ago
near the NSW town of Narromine to
inspect a nameless, gangly filly by
champion sire Bletchingly out of Gun-
synd mare Ammo Girl.
Grazier and owner Mark Hough was
looking to lease the filly as he could not
afford to race her himself. Leased to
Muskoka on Young’s say-so, she be-
came Emancipation and won well over
$500,000 in stakes. She is now a prized
broodmare.
The first time that Lapointe and
Young teamed up and went to a sale
the Adelaide yearling sales in 1979
they made five buys for only $41,000.
Between them, the horses won 40 races.
The pick of the crop, November Rain,
was a triple Oaks winner and also took
out the St Leger Stakes in Sydney. An-
other was Port Carling which, among
other achievements, won the Australian
Jockey Club’s Summer Cup and ran
third in a Perth Cup.
Young and Lapointe are looking to
take as much of the risk out of racing as
possible by controlling the fate of their
steeds from foaling to breaking-in at
Muskoka and on to the racetrack.
ARABS recently bought a 51 percent
interest in the Nebo Lodge at Rosehill,
with Sangster taking the other 49 per-
cent. The $1.27 million share gives
ARABS access to 113 yards and boxes
and an accommodation block for em-
ployees which is not far off hotel stan-
dard. Master of the stables is poker-
faced trainer Brian Mayfield-Smith.
Young says that he hopes to see the
number of horses going through the es-
tablishment increased from 50 or 60 to
100. With annual training fees of, say,
$ll,OOO over a total of 150 to 200 horses
some of which would be in pre-train-
ing, others racing and others injured or
spelling ARABS could generate rev-
enue of some $1.5 million a year from
Nebo.
ARABS biggest asset is horseflesh
though, as Young explains, the com-
pany cannot be judged on profits but on
asset appreciation. In its balance sheet
at June 30 are breeding interests of $2.7
million made up of broodmares
owned outright and under lease
($869,200), shares in syndicated stal-
lions ($212,800), shares in syndicated
stallions under lease ($17,000) and the
plum asset, 40 nominations for the sire
Bletchingly (eight a year for five years).
They are in the books at $1.6 million, as
judged by an independent valuer.
The Bletchingly nominations were
injected into ARABS by Lapointe for
$1.2 million, in exchange for shares and
cash. Bletchingly takes a big chunk of
the company’s assets of $5.3 million.
Bloodstock values often are intan-
gible and highly variable. The vagaries
of the business are pointed out by valu-
ations in the latest balance sheet.
Dancelot, bred as a filly by the family of
Antico, has been valued at $BO,OOO after
slipping a foal during the year. This cast
doubt on producing potential. But the
mare is in foal to Bletchingly and
Young suggests that the valuation could
double by next June.
Two years ago, Dancelot produced
Take Your Partner which shaped up as
one of this season’s top early two-year-
olds. Take Your Partner brought
ARABS $lBO,OOO of its $969,000 reven-
ue in the year to June. □

MINING
Curiosity over
Powell’s gold
find mounts
By ROSS LOUTHEAN
covered under a calcrete capping which
had discouraged earlier explorers.
Powell has recovered about $1 mil-
lion in gold.
His early rich crushings at the
Coolgardie state battery caused a stam-
pede of explorers, entrepreneurs and
journalists. Offers included up-front
payments of millions of dollars and
even guaranteed that machine-happy
Bill could continue to operate the mine
machinery.
The Powells resisted for months but
doubts began growing as he collected
the new machinery.
Powell was sure that he had a bon-
anza, most geoscientists agreed that he
had something phenomenal, but was it
just a near-surface enrichment?
While Powell has made a big quid, he
also has been spending.
The consensus is that his new fleet
far more sophisticated than machines of
equivalent mining operations is cost-
ing about $93,000 a month, if all leased.
After all the exotic offers, Powell
sprung a surprise a few months ago by
signing a first right of rufusal with
Wayne Ryder’s Great Eastern Mine Ltd.
This honeymoon soured quickly and
eyebrows were raised again when Cord
exuberantly announced a deal with the
Powells. Its six-month exploration has
netted the Powells about $250,000 cash
and $200,000 fully-paid vendor shares.
A brief war of words broke out be-
tween Great Eastern and Cord and the
issue is still in the legal melting pot. If
Cord is still there four months from
now, this wrangle could become the
sharemarket bunfight of 1985.
If Cord proceeds through all stages
of its agreement, it will pay the Powells
A THICK security blanket has not
dulled curiosity over work on veteran
prospector Bill Powell’s famed gold dis-
covery at McPherson’s Reward, south
of Coolgardie, Western Australia.
Cord Holdings Ltd started a drilling
program with a touch of high drama,
including security guards.
However, work stopped abruptly
after a series of holes over the discovery,
the guards and drills disappeared and
all contract geologists were laid off.
That left Cord’s geologist Bob Clinch
on site. The grapevine worked quickly
and pessimists suggested that Powell’s
find was no great bonanza.
But Cord says otherwise. A company
official told The Bulletin last week that
drilling had been getting too far ahead
of the assaying process and heavy rain
had hampered work. Drilling, he said,
would resume in about a fortnight.
Most of the drilling was reverse cir-
culation to about 35 metres below pit
depth and the core of one diamond hole
will fascinate many goldfield geologists.
Powell has carved a pit almost 500 m
long, 103 m deep with his fleet of ex-
pensive new earthmoving machinery.
From this he has created hills of over-
burden and has been stockpiling and
identifying the quartz stockwork he dis-
about $25 million. In other words,
McPherson’s Reward would have to
produce for Cord at least two tonnes of
gold to cover the Powells before any-
thing else.
Ryder may be in a no-lose situation,
except that his company must sit in the
shadows of the sharemarket stage. Great
Eastern does not have to commit risk
exploration capital and can view
whether it has to match the Cord offer
when the time comes for resolution.
Despite the rich crushings, the de-
posit has been an unknown quantity, a
real blue sky exercise.
Independent geologists consider that
the regional association of gabbro sills
and porphyry has been reserved in com-
parison to neighboring workings at
Tindalls, the Dreadnought, Brilliant
and Burbanks. At these other mines,
gold is depleted near surface (3 to 5
grams/tonne in the oxide zone) but in-
creases significantly in the sulphide
zone (6 to 12 g/t).
Because it is a first-phase exercise, to
judge Cord’s assays when released
could be unwise but it will be important
to know just what the average grade in
the porphyry (if it is a porphyry) is go-
ing to be. Powell’s unswerving faith in
his find prompted him to buy a large
parcel of Cord shares.
Cord in the meantime has begun
drilling on its large neighboring ten-
ements under joint venture with pros-
pectors Jim Paul and Mick Muir.
Paul, an astute plant operator, man-
ages the vat leaching gold recovery pro-
ject on the Burbanks tailings in partner-
ship with Cord and also holds the
famous Londonderry lease WA’s
richest gold patch where, in the trail-
blazing days, a syndicate pulled 311
kilograms of gold from roughly a 1.2 m
square hole and the lease went on to a
colorful but short mining history.
Cord has carried out limited drilling,
using lag time for a rig assigned to
McPherson’s Reward and has a series of
targets code-named Possum. Though
announced grades were highly encoura-
ging, details on drill co-ordinates and
widths were scant.
Possum less than a kilometre from
McPherson’s Reward appears to be
on a different trend and the hope is that
further drilling will delineate an
orebody extending across to an earlier
Powell open cut.
But immediate interest centres on
when Cord releases first drill details on
the Powell ground.
The discovery is unlikely to be
proved or disproved on a first-phase
drill programme and it may be that
Cord is using the current lull to be more
selective, based on evidence already
gained from drilling.
The results could show rich but very
patchy mineralisation. □

THE MODEST FARMER
The tariff wind swings
by Bert Kelly
LAST WEEK I described the import-
ance of the tariff wall to the citizens of
the Living In the Past (LIP) city be-
cause, sheltered behind this wall, their
protected industries are encouraged to
give in to extravagant wage demands
from their powerful unions and then
these are passed on to us who live in the
rough cruel world (RCW). Then I won-
dered why the current federal govern-
ment seems less willing to give its milk
down to this kind of blackmail than was
the preceding Fraser government, which
usually ran to water in spite of splendid
speeches.
That the tariff wind has gone round
there is no doubt. For instance, on Sep-
tember 17, Prime Minister Bob Hawke
addressed the Heavy Engineering
Manufacturers Association in Can-
berra. They meet there every year to beg
for yet more protection from the RCW.
This time, they were even more vocifer-
ous in their demands for increased pro-
tection but the PM would have none of
it.
After talking about the need for in-
dustry to be competitive he said: “This
sharpened focus on competitiveness
raises doubts about some suggestions
that the problems of your industry can
be addressed effectively by increased
protection from imports and higher
public sector expenditure on the output
of your industry. Such palliatives could
have quite the opposite impact to what
is intended. They would raise costs
faced by other industries and the com-
munity at large. In this way, the nation-
al strategy for general economic recov-
ery would be put at risk ... We should
also consider the increased costs to ex-
porters of increased tariff or non-tariff
protection from imports. There is also
the possibility of adverse reaction to
such measures from our trading part-
ners.”
So, clearly, the government realises
that higher tariffs are no solution to
higher wage demands. Why did not the
Fraser government see this also? There
are three main reasons.
The Country Party that was and the
National Party that is were reared in the
McEwen stable where the motto was
“Protection All Round.” Second, the
Liberals though eloquent in their de-
termination to reduce trade barriers
were mainly Melbourne-based and
most Melbournites have been reared on
the tariff bottle.
However, the main reason for the
Fraser government’s impotence in this
matter was that most of its ministers had
been away from their farms for too long
and so did not realise how little fat there
was on the export industry animal. I
know it was a shock to me, when I came
back to the farm in 1977, to discover
how farming costs had rocketed while I
was busy governing the country.
Being Depression-reared, I was be-
mused by the high prices that I heard
my family was receiving. I remembered
that I sold my wool for 12 pence a
pound the year I got married. So, when
I heard that farmers were getting about
250 cents a kilo for wool, I thought they
must have money running out of their
ears. And a price of $l5O a ton for wheat
seemed outrageous. But I have found
out the hard way that the real price for
wool that is, the price adjusted for
inflation is lower today than it was in
1906 and far lower than in 1947.
I remember selling my wheat in 1932,
in the depths of the Depression, for two
shillings and two pence a bushel and
being sure that I was being ruined.
Now, John Hyde (and he is almost al-
ways right) tells me that the real price
that the farmer today receives for his
wheat at the farm gate (expressed in
1932 money) is two shillings and two
pence a bushel. So I can understand the
difficulty of the Fraser ministers realis-
ing what was going on in the RCW. It is
hard to get a clear picture of this in Can-
berra.
You can understand then why the
voice of the farmers is so strident when
we complain about the way in which
increased wage costs are loaded on our
backs. And even the miners, who are in
the same mess as we are, are trying to
screw their courage up to join us in our
campaign for a different wage-fixing
system. There are a few of them at the
RCW headquarters but they are careful
not to be noticed. And manufacturing
exporters, of whom there are a sur-
prising number, are hit as hard as we are
by a wage-fixing system that exposes
them to the winds of the RCW. A few of
them are with us, too.
The campaigners at the RCW head-
quarters are well aware that we have a
long and bitter battle ahead. Most of us
are confident that our case is so strong
that we must win in the end. I am not so
sure about this, having seen democracy
at work from the inside. We will have a
closer look at this next week.

WILDCAT
Western Mining may tighten grip on nickel
WORD has been buzzing around Kal-
goorlie that Western Mining Corpora-
tion is contemplating strengthening its
grip on Australia’s nickel industry by
buying up or into the ailing Agnew
nickel project.
Agnew owned 60 percent by
Seltrust Mining Corporation and 40 per-
cent by MIM Holdings has been
plagued by mounting losses from four
years of lamentable nickel prices,
though it was toughing that out until re-
cently.
Last month’s decision by the joint
venturers to rationalise the Agnew
workforce, to curtail some major devel-
opmental work and studies on lifting
production and to place greater empha-
sis on mining high-grade zones appar-
ently was precipitated by a loss of
patience over the dilemma by Seltrust’s
parent British Petroleum and some con-
cern in the MIM camp over its commit-
ments elsewhere.
Unlike the Agnew partners, Western
Mining (which controls the refining and
smelting of sulphide nickel concentrates
in Australia) has been able to ease its
nickel woes by having tandem gold
mining operations at both its Kambalda
and Windarra operations.
The nickel slump might even have
been a blessing in disguise for WMC
because it galvanised the company to
‘I hear NASA may be getting in on
the America’s Cup challenge!”
move rapidly into gold production in its
own right distinct from its equity pos-
itions in Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, Hill
50 Gold Mine NL, Central Norseman
Gold Corporation Ltd and a Fijian ven-
ture with Emperor Gold Mines.
“I hope you milked'em first!”
As a direct producer,
WMC has become one of
Australia’s top producers
from a virtual standing start
three years ago, and this is
mainly due to the perform-
ance of the open cut-under-
ground operations of the Vic-
tory-Defiance mine group at
Tramways near Kambalda.
As well as easing the nickel
pains, the gold mining profits
allowed WMC to maintain a
vigorous marketing campaign
and to secure some of the best
undeveloped nickel discover-
ies in Western Australia in-
cluding a group on the
Widgiemooltha Dome west of
Kambalda. WMC is now vy-
ing with Falconbridge, of Can-
ada, to be second western
world producer, behind Inter-
national Nickel Co, of Canada
(INCO).
Agnew was the great dis-
covery toward the end of the
nickel boom but it took years
to launch and prices unfortunately
nose-dived as it moved into the project-
ed profit phase through full mining de-
velopment.
If WMC’s eye is on Agnew, another
factor surely is involved. Wildcat knows
that some Western Mining executives
would like to become involved in the
original Mount Keith discovery, the
world’s biggest undeveloped sulphide
nickel orebody with an in situ resource
of 419 million tonnes of 0.6 percent
nickel.
Late last year, the Agnew partners
bought Freeport’s 50 percent interest in
Mount Keith and one-third of the
neighboring Kingston deposit.
WMC involvement with Agnew also
would give it a position in every Austra-
lian sulphide nickel project. According
to the latest edition of Register of Aus-
tralian Mining, there are good pointers
that nickel will stabilise at around
SUS2.BO a lb by early next year. These
are the fact that few producers today
risk high stockpiles, consumer demand
is strong and that the London Metal Ex-
change and not the INCO price is the
standard.
Change of plans
WESTERN Australia’s biggest custom
milling gold plant, at Mount Magnet in
the Murchison Goldfield, was destined
to be vended into a proposed public


Our new foreign
exchange model is rapidly
gaining currency
When the prestigious financial journal
Euromoney surveyed the technical models
used to predict currency trends, none proved
as consistently profitable as
the ITC Momentum Model.
Euromoney reported in
its August, 1984 issue that in
the previous three years the
SUS 'fast' model yielded a
return of almost 16% p.a.
By contrast, forecasting based
on economic fundamentals
is frequently no more success-
ful than tossing a coin.
First developed in
America by a Midland Bank
affiliate, the ITC model is
now also available to clients of Midland
International Australia Limited and can be
accessed directly through an international
timesharing network.
Daily buy/sell recommendations are
given for the $A against 14 other currencies.
The Momentum Model is a totally
unbiased decision-making tool which turns
foreign exchange forecasting from an art into
a science. The list of subscribers includes
some of the worlds biggest corporations.

float called Central Murchison Gold
which has strong United Kingdom con-
nections.
The Black Cat mill is owned by V
and D Ridolfo Pty Ltd which also is
involved in transport and earthmoving
ventures.
The company is run by Vince
Ridolfo who made his fortune from car-
ting about half the power poles now
standing throughout the state.
The mill is managed by Peter Smith
who apparently is a key to any plans for
a public float.
Wildcat understands there have been
major changes to the planning and,
though the Black Cat may still be
involved with a UK company, there are
moves to have it involved with a listed
company which recently had an admin-
istrative change.
Part of the deal is likely to include
not only the gold treatment plant but
also the Ridolfos’ open-cut mines in the
Mount Magnet district and the as-
sociated earthmoving plant.
The first resort
WHEN you have overseen the expan-
sion of a group of liquor stores from
one to 252 in 14 years, it’s not hard to
develop a chain mentality which is
why Stephen Woods, managing director
of the Liquorland group, says that the
$7.5 million Pelican Shores resort at
Port Macquarie on the NSW north
coast, is only the first in a line.
The resort, which opens officially this
week with federal Minister for Sport,
Recreation and Tourism John Brown
cutting the ribbon, is a joint venture be-
tween insurance company Aetna Life
and Casualty Ltd (which has a 40 per-
cent share), Woods (30 percent) and
property investor John Large (30 per-
cent).
Woods sold 25 Liquorland licences
to G. J. Coles Ltd in 1981, for $l4 mil-
lion, and has stayed on as managing di-
rector. He was paid by Coles in shares
and cash, as was Joseph Brender when
he sold the chain of Katies stores to the
retailer recently. With more than 1 per-
cent of Coles capital, Woods is the
largest individual shareholder in the
company.
Pelican Shores, a 90-room resort, is
to be followed by two other joint ven-
tures between Aetna and Woods.
Operating on a 50:50 basis, they have
bought a seven-acre site outside Coffs
Harbor the tourist destination north
of Port Macquarie for $l.B million.
To be called Pelican Beach, the es-
timated cost of that resort is $13.5 to $l4
million.
Also planned is Pelican Ranch. No
site has been chosen but the develop-
ment is expected to be on a river site
and run as a viable grazing property
with the tourist resort concept as “an
overlay.”
Pelican Shores is Aetna’s first ven-
ture into leisure/resort investment.
Woods introduced the idea to the in-
surer after returning more than two
years ago from a trip to Sardinia where
he visited the Aga Khan’s resort at
Costa Smeralda. □
THE CHARTIST
Plymouth under buying pressure
by Russell hander
IN THE resources sector of the
stockmarket there are presently few
heroes, most stocks having fallen into a
state of suspended animation.
One exception, however, is Plymouth
Petroleum Resources NL which joined
the public lists on December 1, 1983,
with interests in Eromanga permits ATP
298 and ATPs 299 A and B, NTP 28 (off-
shore Bonaparte Basin) and WA 58(S)
and (N) (offshore North-West Shelf).
Subscribers did not have to wait long
for some action as Tintaburra No. 1 on
ATP 299 A came in as an oil producer
early in January, 1984, from six zones in
the Cretaceous and Jurassic sections.
Step-out wells have subsequently
proved this to be a viable oilfield.
Surviving subscribers to the Oil
Search issue launched in 1929 must be
marvelling as to how their company
could have spent 55 years looking for
oil but remaining totally innocent of an
oil discovery per se when Plymouth can
waltz into an oil find in the space of one
month from listing.
The Bridge Data charts show Ply-
mouth on both a weekly and daily plot.
In each case the stock is enjoying an or-
derly uptrend which gives no hint of im-
pending exhaustion. In this respect
Plymouth belongs to a very select band
of exploration outfits in a generally
lacklustre oil and mining market.

To you, our longevity is a real reason to
choose a Volvo over an ordinary car.
That’s because our history-making

paying your service bills.
And with a ride that doesn’t deteri-

of squeaks and rattles.
At bottom line all this can
also mean a higher
re-sale value, too.
Check your
local paper and you
will see that a Volvo holds its

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The perils of insider trading
THE NATIONAL Corporations and
Securities Commission has been trying
very hard in its short life to stamp out
insider trading. Quite right. In this en-
deavor it has the Speculator’s total sup-
port on the grounds that almost every
time he had seen a bit of insider trading
attempted, it has been disastrous.
Sundowner Minerals is a good case in
point. The first time this company
struck gold literally the news was
known to a few insiders, as Speculator
understands it. On the grounds that they
had heard the whisper that Sundowner
had a “hot hole” (all this is hearsay of
course, and therefore could never be
told to a senator) speculators rushed out
and bought shares.
The company declared a hot hole
known technically as drillhole SIR-17.
It assayed 7.7 ounces (not grammes,
mind you) per tonne over 21 metres.
The sharpies who had dived into the
stock at 19 cents saw it move all the way
to 18 cents after the announcement.
Speculator, being the bravest chap
who never won a Victoria Cross, waited
for a bit and eventually bought some of
the options at six cents.
Speculator sold them soon after-
wards at eight cents and switched into
Coronet Resources NL, which also has
50 percent of their hot prospect, the Si-
beria Consuls gold find in WA.
Last Wednesday Sundowner, the op-
erator for the joint venture, came out
with another progress report but for all
the attention it got in the financial press
you would think the company had lep-
rosy.
Because you are not likely to read
much of this anywhere else, Sundowner
reported that the main shaft had been
made safe and that a drive had been
extended into the actual area of
drillhole SIR-17.
“Visible gold was noted from the 6
metre mark to the end of the drive,”
they said. Visible gold was also evident
along the 2 metres of crosscut which ex-
posed the drillhole.
“Results of samples taken from the
face and recovered ore are awaited. The
gold occurs as a shoot in a flattening (or
roll) and is part of the footwall
mineralised zone.”
Logging of the service hole found
that it had also discovered high grade
ore. “A screen sample of a one metre
sample returned an average of 570
grammes per tonne of gold,” the report
said. “This intersection is from a second
stratigraphic position, different to that
exposed in SIR-17 which averaged 11.5
oz per tonne over 60 ft.
“The gold mineralisation is similar to
that in the shoot located by drill hole
SIR-17. The gold located in the service
hole is free, coarse and located within a
new zone some 5 metres into the hang-
ing wall. Exploration operations under-
ground are continuing.”
The company added that 60 tonnes
of bulk samples from the exploratory
development were now on the surface
awaiting metallurgical test work.
All that came out last Wednesday but
by the end of the week the stock still
hadn’t moved much. Thursday night
Sundowner closed 4c up, having rallied
from 14c to 18c. In other words, it was
only just back to the point where the
insiders had given up in disgust months
ago. The shares even had trouble sus-
taining this level, slipping to 16c at the
end of the week.
Speculator, having shown devilish
shrewdness in switching to Coronet,
was rather worse off. Speculator got into
Coronet on September 14 at 80c. After
the announcement that Siberia Consuls
had struck visible gold in the drive, the
best the market could do was 68c for
Coronet shares. It’s enough to make a
share trader honest.
Meanwhile I have unloaded my Cord
Holdings. I still like the company, but I
don’t like the way its share price has
been sagging lately.

PIERPONT
More changes in addresses than in prices
YES, PIERPONT had a great holiday
and thank you for asking.
He sojourned for a while in Tokyo,
where he toyed with the notion of buy-
ing a few steelmills, and returned via
England where he went for a boating
trip on the Thames.
All frightfully civilised. Indeed,
when one returns from countries that
evolved the kimono and the Eton boater
and is confronted by the inevitable
hairy-chested Kingsford-Smith taxi dri-
ver (Pierpont’s chauffeur was indis-
posed), it becomes immediately appar-
ent that civilisation in Australia is still
largely a thing of the future.
It was reassuring, of course, to know
that nothing had changed sartorially in
Pierpont’s absence and for a while it ap-
peared that nothing had changed on the
financial front either.
Gold was still falling, the US dollar
was still rising, BHP was milling around
the $10.25 mark and there was even a
story on the financial pages about the
Sydney and Melbourne stock exchanges
discussing computer compatability.
A reassuringly static scene, Pierpont
thought but he was wrong. The real
movement in the broking world these
days is not on the trading floor but in
personnel and premises.
Your correspondent first learned this
when he ran into one of the chaps from
Roach Tilley Grice. The fine old firm has
forsaken its longstanding offices on the
first floor of the Barclays Credit building
and moved into P & O House.
This represents something of a return
to the womb for some members of the
firm because Roach Tilley Grice con-
tains a quota of former Patrick Partners
employees and in the palmy days of the
Poseidon boom Patrick Partners occu-
pied the 15th and 16th floors of P & O
House, which must have been the best-
known broking address in Australia.
This Pierpont had to see, so he
strolled down to No 2 Castlereagh
Street and into the building foyer. This
was a mistake. The P & O building is
undergoing renovation and the entrance
looks like a large, vandalised telephone
booth. The ceiling had been removed;
long, thick, black wires were hanging
everywhere and the general impression
was that the Russians had just taken
Hitler’s last bunker. As a scene of indus-
trial desolation, it surpassed even the
1959 interior of the John Fairfax build-
ing.
Propped against one wall in building
dust and rubble was the tenants’ board.
This showed Roach Tilley Grice at the
seventh floor.
It may be a sign of the times that in
1969 you could see the harbor from the
16th floor but the building is now sur-
rounded by newer skyscrapers and you
would need a helium balloon to see Fort
Denison.
Another sign of the times is that the
16th floor where Ric Dowling ruled is
occupied by Tress, Cocks and Maddox,
solicitors, and the Great Northern Wool
Dumping Company.
When Pierpont mentioned this to
Bill Edwards, he said: “Yes, we do see
the odd bale flying past the windows.”
The office move by Roach Tilley
Grice had taken place only two days be-
fore and had been pretty standard. That
is to say, the lady who was landed with
the job of supervising the shift collared
the best office for herself and the board-
room has a view of the Castlereagh
Street parking inspectors booking part-
ners’ cars.
The most attractive feature about the
old Roach Tilley Grice office was the
bank of charts around the walls, show-
ing the trends in silver, gold, zinc and
whatever. It used to look like a war
room and Pierpont was often tempted
to over-investment simply because he
had strolled into the sanctum and seen a
hot-dog run going in October tin or
May copper. When Pierpont arrived at
the new offices the walls were still bare.
But the charts will be up again by the
time this column appears, so you have
been warned.
Nor was Roach Tilley Grice the only
office where great changes had been oc-
curring. Pierpont also spent some time
catching up with the latest moves at
Rivkins.
This was no easy task because the
new offices of Rivkin Ltd are of course
not listed in the current telephone direc-
tory. So Pierpont rang inquiries and was
told there was no listing for Rivkin Ltd.
This news left Pierpont somewhat
slack-jawed. He knows brokers are eter-
nally anxious to enhance their status but
this was the first time he had come
across a stockbroking firm with an un-
listed number.
Anyhow, there have been a few
changes at Rivkin Ltd too. Pierpont
knew Rivkin had taken over Hurst
Pollock but it was news to your corre-
spondent that Ross McFadyen had
joined the firm. Your correspondent
had last met Ross when he was launch-
ing a bond trading and information firm
called Australian Gilt and had been
under the impression that Ross was con-
sidering the fixed interest market as a
permanent career. He is still chairman
of Australian Gilt which is now 50 per-
cent owned by Kleinwort Benson but is
now a director of Rivkin Ltd together
with Rene Rivkin and Andy Lakos.
Even more interesting to Pierpont
was the news that Timothy Allen had
also joined Rivkin. Your correspondent


had an eerie feeling that he was being
haunted by former shades of Patricks,
because Tim is yet another veteran of
that firm, except that he has spent most
of the past decade in the wine business
most recently in the Australian Wine
Centre down at the Rocks.
Pierpont rang the unlisted number
(Sydney 235-9346) to check and Tim
confirmed that he indeed was back in
the share market.
“I haven’t got a chair or anything yet
but I’ve got an office, so why don’t you
come around and have a drink some
time?” he said.
Great changes indeed, Pierpont re-
flected as he strolled around to yet an-
other broking firm. The chaps at this
one were playing with the Bridge Data
screen, looking at a stock which ap-
peared to have suffered a vertical hic-
cough on its last day’s trading.
“Looks interesting,” said Pierpont,
“But I don’t know the code. What does
MGM stand for?”
“Moruya Gold,” said the chap at the
screen. “It closed at 17c last night,
opened at 24c today and hit 30c before
coming back to 24c.”
Pierpont suddenly realised that he
had been away for too long. Not only
had he missed the price move: until that
second, he had been quite unaware of
Moruya’s Gold’s existence.
It turned out that the stock had been
listed since late May with an issued
capital of five million shares. This is
pretty tight by modern standards. No
fewer than 503,000 of the shares were
traded last Tuesday, October 9 some
10 percent of the issued capital. The
rumor was that the company had
bought into a gold mine in South
Dakota.
All of this convinced Pierpont that
his ignorance of what is happening at
the moment is even greater than usual,
so he will just have to see a broker and
find out what is happening. If Tim can
provide a bottle of wine, Pierpont will
bring his own chair. □
CHESS
Olympic trials encouraging
by Terrey Shaw
FOR OUR strongest players, the main
obstacle to climbing to the top branches
of the international chess tree is lack of
regular tough opposition. To get this,
our best players need to spend consider-
able periods competing overseas par-
ticularly in Europe.
The top three boards of the Austra-
lian team for the chess Olympics in
Thessaloniki, Greece, this November,
are all in Europe. If their results are any
indication, we look set to record our
best ever Olympic performance.
National champion Darryl Johansen
(board 1) and Greg Hjorth (board 3)
have just done well in the British cham-
pionship while lan Rogers shared first
place in a strong tournament in Yugo-
slavia, ahead of grandmasters Tringov
and Janosevic and five international
masters.
On his way to sixth place in an ex-
ceptionally strong field in the British
championship, Hjorth defeated top
English grandmaster Tony Miles in the
following cut and thrust duel. Miles
tried to exploit Hjorth’s weak, isolated
queen’s pawn but an inaccurate 27th
move allowed Black’s pieces too much
scope. Greg’s nicely calculated sacrifice
on move 31 put paid to any further re-
sistance.

Thatcher’s Narrow Escape
Brighton’s Grand Hotel the morning after the blast: ‘The bomb attack was an inhuman, undiscriminating attempt to massacre innocent, unsuspecting men and women’
The IRA’s brutal bombing raises the stakes in its battle against Britain.
Most of the guests in Brighton’s Grand
Hotel were asleep. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, however, was still at
work in the Napoleon Suite at 3 a.m., pre-
paring her keynote address to the annual
party conference of Britain’s Conservative
Party. “I just turned to do one final paper,”
she said later. “And then it went off.” A
deadly bomb, planted by the Irish Republi-
can Army, ripped through the upper floors
of the Victorian-era hotel. Thatcher was not
injured, but the toll of the attack was steep:
4 people killed and 34 injured.
It was the latest act of savagery in the 12
years since the IRA first took its campaign
of terror across the Irish Sea into Britain. It
was also a chilling escalation of the organi-
zation’s crusade: never before has the out-
lawed army tried to assassinate a British
prime minister. After the attack the IRA
issued a statement leaving no doubt that it
was ready to raise the stakes in its battle over
Ulster’s future: “Thatcher will now realize
that Britain cannot occupy our country,
torture our prisoners and shoot our people
in their own streets and get away with it.”
The statement, signed with the IRA’s trade-
mark pseudonym, P. O’Neill, ended on an
ominousnote: “Today we were unlucky, but
remember, we have only to be lucky once.
You will have to be lucky always. Give
Ireland peace and there will be no war.”
Pinned: The explosion killed and injured
several prominent Tory politicians and
members of their families. One of those
killed, Sir Anthony Berry, 59, had served 20
years in Parliament. Eric Taylor, head of the
party’s Northwest regional branch was
found dead under the rubble, as was a wom-
an thought to be Jean Shattock, whose hus-
band, Gordon, is president of the Southwest
Conservative Association. The Tories’ chief
whip, John Wakeham, 52, was pinned under
the debris for six hours. He was pulled out
alive, though his legs were crushed. The
lifeless body of his wife, Roberta, lay nearby.
One of the severely injured victims was
the man whom many political observers
consider Thatcher’s heir apparent in the
Conservative Party: Norman Tebbit. His
room was destroyed, and Tebbit, minister of
trade and industry in the Tory cabinet, ap-
parently fell through several collapsed
floors of the hotel and was buried under the
rubble. He lay trapped and in shock for
nearly four hours, and was found when
rescuers spotted his bare feet in the debris.
As they dug him out, firemen kept Tebbit
talking so that he wouldn’t lose conscious-
ness. Covered with blood and suffering from


EUROPE
unsuspecting men and women ’
DAVE CAULKIN— AP
broken ribs and a thigh injury, Tebbit said,
with a wan smile, “Get off my bloody feet.”
The stiff upper lip was in the British tradi-
tion, and it was doubly needed: his wife,
Margaret, was even more seriously hurt; she
suffered back and spinal injuries, and may
be paralyzed from the neck down.
After the bombing, Thatcher went out
into the hall and asked, “Is there anything I
can do to help?” Coupled with that compas-
sion was her determination to press on, to be
the “Iron Lady,” as so many Britons call
her. “You hear about these atrocities, these
bombs,” she told reporters shortly after the
blast, “but you don’t expect them to happen
to you. But life must go on. The conference
will go on as usual.”
Silence: And it did. At 9:30 in the morn-
ing, just 6V2 hours after the explosion, the
Tories’ meeting opened on schedule in the
modern Brighton Conference Center.
Thatcher received a rousing ovation from
her Tory loyalists as she stepped to the dais.
After a solemn two minutes of silence, the
first order of business was a motion support-
ing the government’s policies on Northern
Ireland and the activities of the armed forces
and police in the province. The delegates
ovewhelmingly approved the measure.
That afternoon, Thatcher amended her
prepared speech to begin with a condemna-
tion of the IRA guerrillas. “The bomb at-
tack,” she said, “was first and foremost an
inhuman, undiscriminating attempt to
massacre innocent, unsuspecting men and
women.” The attack had failed to break the
will of the government, she said calmly,
just as “all attempts to destroy democracy
by terrorism will fail.” That got her a
7 V 2 -minute ovation. Then Thatcher went to
the Royal Sussex Hospital, where she spent
two hours visiting some of the injured.
The often acrimonious divisions in the
world of British politics were temporarily
washed away in the wake of the bombing
attack. Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock
sent a message to Thatcher expressing his
“outrage at this terrible atrocity.” Kinnock
called the terrorists “sworn enemies of all of
the people of normal mind and reasoning
politics” and praised Thatcher for going
ahead with her party’s conference.
The force of the bomb crumpled part of
the 122-year-old hotel. The upper floors of
the eight-story building collapsed, leaving a
U-shaped gash in the fagade. In Thatcher’s
suite, the windows were blown out and the
bathroom, which she had left only moments
before, was demolished. “It looked like a
film set gone wrong,” said party vice chair-
man Emma Nicholson. “The chairs we had
been sitting in when we were joking and
laughing only a little while earlier were
shattered like matchsticks.”
‘AJungle’: In the early-morning darkness,
rescue workers began digging through the
rubble, searching for victims. Those who
were not injured—some still in evening
clothes, others in pajamas^—aided in the
search. Long after sunrise firemen and po-
lice were still at work. “There is a jungle of
floors in there,” said one. “The whole thing
went down like a pack of cards.” Late in the
day, demolition crews were pulling down
parts of the crumbling fagade.
No one yet knows how the IRA terrorists
managed to get into the hotel, or when the
bomb was planted. The date for the party
conference was set a year ago, and the explo-
sives could have been put in the hotel any-
time in recent weeks. The bomb, possibly
wrapped in cellophane to hide the scent of

explosives from bomb-sniffing police dogs,
could have sat undetected until it was trig-
gered by a timing device. The IRA boasted
that the bomb contained 100 pounds of
gelignite explosives, but authorities estimat-
ed that it weighed closer to 20 pounds.
Security around the hotel seemed lax dur-
ing the week, especially considering the fact
that the conference is the one time in the year
when Britain’s entire cabinet gathers in a
public place. There was immediate criticism
of the security precautions, and police began
an investigation. Background checks were
said to have been conducted on all hotel
employees, but the hotel remained open to
the public during the party’s conference. All
that was needed to enter was a simple card-
board accreditation card, which could have
been obtained illegally. Some people
claimed their bags were not checked. At the
time of the explosion, guests, delegates and
journalists crowded the lobby and pub. Rog-
er Birch, police chief for the Brighton area,
said he was “reasonably satisfied’’ with the
security setup. Still, he acknowledged, “I
suppose if an explosion takes place that
means something has gone wrong.”
New Tack: Though the IRA has carried
out its terror campaign over the years, last
week’s bombing was a distin'ct departure
from the norm. In the past, attacks have
been directed randomly at police or civil-
ians, or directly at prominent individuals
outside the government whose deaths
would have great symbolic impact. In 1979
IRA terrorists killed Lord Earl Mountbat-
ten, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth 11, and
Airey Neave, one of Thatcher’s closest po-
litical advisers. Former Prime Minister Ed-
ward Heath escaped a similar attempt on his
life in 1974. Since 1972, when IRA guerril-
las took their campaign of violence outside
of Northern Ireland, 89 people have been
killed in Britain, almost all in bomb attacks.
No one yet knows —nor has the IRA said —
why it decided now to attempt to assassinate
the prime minister and her cabinet.
One theory is that the attack was meant
to show that the IRA could still take
revenge. The organization has suffered
some significant setbacks recently. Late
last month the Irish Navy confiscated a
seven-ton shipment of arms, ammunition
and explosives bound for the IRA, pre-
sumably sent by backers in the United
States. Only days before that, police raided
a clandestine bomb factory north of Dub-
lin and arrested a man described as a top
IRA explosives expert. In the past when it
felt under attack, the IRA has been known
to counterstrike quickly, if only to show
authorities that it is still in business.
But some officials doubt whether an opera-
tion such as the Brighton bombing could
have been organized in the last two weeks.
Others are convinced that the IRA hoped
to derail scheduled talks next month
between Thatcher and Irish Prime Minis-
ter Garret Fitz Gerald in an attempt to
The IRA’s Litany of Terror
Last week's bomb blast was only the
latest incident in a litany of IRA terror
outside ofNorthern Ireland. In the last 12
years more than 80people have died and
1,300 have been injured in a campaign of
violence to “bring it all back home ” to
Britain. While bombings and other acts of
terrorism have become a way of life on the
IRA home ground, they are relatively
rare elsewhere—making them all the
more frightening when they do occur. The
IRA has generally targeted prominent
pfitical or military figures, guaranteeing
maximum publicity for their actions.
Such attacks have been judged so success-
ful by the IRA that Sinn Fein has boasted
After the cavalry blast, 1982: ‘One bomb in London is worth 100 in Belfast ’
that “one bomb in London is worth 100 in
Belfast. ”A brief chronology of the terror:
1972: In February an explosion ripped
through the officers’ mess at the head-
quarters of the 16th Parachute Brigade
at Aldershot, 35 miles south of London.
Two men and five women were killed,
including a military chaplain who had
recently returned from duty in North-
ern Ireland.
1973: IRA blasts off Trafalgar Square
and in London’s Old Bailey court killed
one person and injured 243.
1974: In the Irish nationalists’ bloodi-
est year ever on the mainland, explosions
at two pubs in the London suburbs, a bus
in the north and at a tourist-packed
Tower of London claimed 20 lives. The
worst single day was Nov. 21, when
bombs went off in two crowded Bir-
mingham pubs, killing 20 and injuring
more than 180.
1975: IRA terrorists planted bombs
in London hotels and a tube station.
Six people died. In November Ross
McWhirter, editor of the Guinness Book
of World Records, was shot to death in
London. He had urged death sentences
for convicted terrorists.
1979: Airey Neave, the Conservative
Party’s shadow Northern Ireland secre-
tary and a close confidant of Margaret
Thatcher, died in March when an ex-
plosion destroyed his car. Later, in per-
haps the most celebrated IRA attack
outside of Northern Ireland, a bomb
planted aboard a yacht killed Lord
Mountbatten. He was one of Britain’s
most distinguished soldier-statesmen, a
viceroy of India and a favorite cousin of
Queen Elizabeth 11.
1982: On a single day, July 20, the
British military came under attack in
two separate incidents, resulting in the
loss of 10 lives. An explosion under a
bandstand in Regent’s Park bloodied
the scene of a concert by the Green
Jackets musical unit. And a car bomb
tore through the ranks of the Queen’s
Household Cavalry as they made their
way through the London streets to
Whitehall Palace.
1983: Harrods and the maze of streets
around it werejammed with shoppers on
the last Saturday before Christmas Eve
when a car bomb exploded outside the
London department store. Five people
were killed and 97 injured.
1984: A bomb at the Grand Hotel in
Brighton killed four and injured 34.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the
intended target, was not hurt.

It is unlikely that Thatcher will try to
strike back at the IRA in retaliation for the
attack. In fact, there seems little more that
she could do to combat the organization.
The British reportedly have deployed spe-
cial “hit teams” in Northern Ireland to
track down —and kill —IRA terrorists. The
British Army uses electronic jamming de-
vices to try to intercept the signals from
IRA radio-controlled bombs and blow
them up in their makers’ hands. As for now,
such IRA backers as Gerry Adams, who
has refused to take his elected seat in the
Parliament of a “foreign power,” may be
questioned. But without any evidence link-
ing them directly to the Brighton bombing,
they will almost certainly not be detained.
The Tories had traveled to Brighton in a
buoyant mood. Not only were Conserva-
tives in firm control of Parliament, but the
Labor Party was in thorough disarray, bat-
tling more with itself than with Thatcher.
An opinion poll the weekend before the
conference began showed that the Tories
had a lead of 8 percentage points over La-
bor. Yet by the time the 2,000 delegates
arrived in the seaside resort, their spirits
were already dampened. Record unemploy-
ment had some members calling for greater
efforts to help the jobless. And the day
before the opening session, the archbishop
of Canterbury openly criticized Thatcher’s
economic programs and her confronta-
tional style of governing (box).
Endorsement: To be sure, the problems
facing Britain’s Conservatives pale in com-
parison with those of the Labor Party,
whose own annual conference a fortnight
ago was a model of extremism and divisive-
ness. By contrast, the Tories seem largely
committed to Thatcher’s leadership, and
they consider their victory in last year’s
general elections to have been an over-
whelming endorsement of her administra-
tion’s policies. On most issues, the ideologi-
cal differences within the party are
relatively modest.
Perhaps most important, Conservatives
have no loyalty to Arthur Scargill, the presi-
dent of the striking National Union of
Mineworkers. Scargill provided a conven-
ient bogyman for Conservatives early in the
week. The miners’ strike is a source of anger
to the British public, and the Tories sought
to link him with the opposition—and with
virtually everything else wrong in the
country. Scargill’s image was further tar-
nished in midweek, when a London judge
fined him $1,250 and fined his union
$245,000 for contempt of court after Scar-
gill refused to appear in court for publicly
maintaining that the strike was legal, de-
spite the judge’s ruling to the contrary. On
the conference’s opening day, virtually ev-
ery speaker blasted Scargill as a Marxist
rascal bent on destroying the country. “The
main cause of high unemployment,” said
Nigel Lawson, chancellor of the exchequer,
Thatcher Talks to Her Tories
Only hours after a bomb planted by the
Irish Republican Army ripped through
the hotel where she was staying, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher delivered
her planned, if slightly amended, speech
to the Conservative Party conference in
Brighton. The speech covered a range of
issues, including the terrorist attack, her
party's foreign policy and the domestic
economy. Excerpts:
On the Bombing
The bomb attack . . . was an inhuman
. . . attempt to massacre innocent, unsus-
pecting men and women. ... It was an
attempt not only to disrupt and termi-
nate our conference, it was an attempt to
cripple Her Majesty’s democratically
elected government. . . . The fact that
we are gathered here now —shocked,
but composed and determined —is a
sign not only that this attack has
failed, but that all attempts to destroy
democracy by terrorism will fail.
On Nuclear Disarmament
No responsible prime minister could
take the colossal gamble of giving up our
nuclear defenses while our greatest poten-
tial enemy kept theirs. Policies which
would throw out all American nuclear
bases . . . would wreck NATO and leave
us totally isolated from our friends in the
United States. . . . We are the true peace
party. And the nuclear deterrent has not
only kept the peace, but it will continue to
preserve our independence.
On the British Economy
Unemployment, we all agree, is the
scourge of our times. ... It is the spirit of
enterprise that provides jobs. And what is
the role of government? It is in cutting
taxes. It is in cutting inflation. It is keep-
ing costs down. It is cutting through regu-
lations and removing obstacles to the
growth of small businesses.. . . Those are
the policies that. . . will ultimately create
the genuine jobs for the future.
On the Hong Kong Accord
It is an agreement designed to preserve
Hong Kong’s flourishing economy and
unique way of life. We believe that it meets
the needs and wishes of the people.
On Relations With the EEC
Through firmness and determination,
we have achieved a long-term settlement
of Britain’s budget contributions. Patient
diplomacy and occasionally, I confess, a
little impatient diplomacy did the trick.
On the Coal Miners’ Strike
It seems that there are some who are out
to destroy any properly elected govern-
ment. They are out to bring down the
framework of law. That is what we have
seen in this strike.


“is the determination of monopolistic trade
unions to insist on levels of pay that price
men out of work altogether.”
But the rhetoric couldn’t disguise the
many substantive differences among the
Tories over the handling of the strike, some
of the government’s economic programs
and its efforts to reduce unemployment,
which last month reached nearly 3.3 mil-
lion. Said lan Gilmour, a leading Tory
“wet” (liberal): “Unemployment can only
be brought down if the policies are changed.
Just to carry on with policies which have led
to a doubling or more of unemployment
seems inexcusable.” And despite Thatch-
er’s control over the majority of her party, a
resolution calling attention to the “gap
between help available and the needs of the
unemployed” passed overwhelmingly.
Such differences seemed somewhat in-
consequential after the explosion. At a time
like this, Thatcher also becomes a focal
point for the country’s patriotic spirit. The
prime minister isn’t likely to benefit as
much as she did after the Falklands war
nearly a year and a half ago, however. The
horrible images of the bombing will fade
long before the next election, which isn’t
required *until 1988. But what will surely
come of the tragedy is greater attention to
the security surrounding British leaders.
That will be a loss in the standard of British
civility, but the leaders themselves probably
won’t quibble. As the IRA pointed out, next
time they might not be so lucky.

The Bishops’ Rebellion
The Church of England has often been described as “the Tory
Party at prayer” —but not at the moment. In recent weeks, one
bishop after another has publicly questioned the Tory govern-
ment’s handling of the nation’s seven-month-old coal strike.
Last week, on the eve of the Conservative Party’s annual confer-
ence in Brighton, the venerable archbishop of Canterbury
himself took up the cause. In an interview with The Times of
London, Dr. Robert Runcie contended that Conservative eco-
nomic policies were leading to long-term unemployment, pover-
ty, violence and despair. “I believe,” the archbishop said, “that
people one day will wake up and see that that is not a decent sort
of society in which to live.”
Anglican bishops have often spoken out forcefully—usually
on moral questions or such issues such as nuclear disarmament.
But they have generally refrained from attacking the govern-
ment of the day. One reason, of course, is that in Britain the
church is intertwined with the state. Queen Elizabeth 11, as
“defender of the faith,” is the official head of the church. And 26
bishops, including the archbishop of Canterbury, are members of
the House of Lords. Bishops have been expected to support the
government, whatever their private
views may be. But with Prime Minis-
ter Margaret Thatcher’s Conserva-
tives moving farther to the right and
the Labor Party moving farther to the
left, a number of bishops now believe
that they are the sole voice of the
middle —a position that puts them at
odds with tradition. “It’s almost as if a
member of the royal family broke
with convention and criticized the
government,” said Clifford Longley,
religion writer for The Times of Lon-
don. “It’s just not done.”
The “rebellion” began last month
in the city of Durham, the center of
one of Britain’s major coal-mining
areas. In his inaugural sermon, the
city’s new bishop, David Jenkins,
declared his support for the striking
miners and called for the replace-
ment of the government-appointed
chairman of the Coal Board, lan
MacGregor. Conservative M.P.’s
were already shocked by Jenkins’s
comments on such church tenets as
the virgin birth (he said he doubted
that the Biblical version was accu-
rate) and the Resurrection (he ques-
tioned if it happened). When Jenkins
took to the pulpit with his comments
Runcie: ‘This is not a decent sort of society’
PRESS ASSOCIATION
on the strike, they bitterly accused him of abusing his office by
indulging in “politics.” They demanded that he be reprimand-
ed by the archbishop of Canterbury. Runcie refused, saying
that he agreed with the thrust of Jenkins’s sermon.
One such speech led to another. The bishop of Birmingham,
Hugh Montefiore, charged that the Thatcher government was
trying to destroy the striking miners. As annoying as Jenkins and
Montefiore were to the Tories, it was Runcie’s interview that
truly rankled. “Economic growth, better living standards, high-
er pay for those in employment [and] the recovery of national
pride are all self-evidently worth aiming at,” Runcie said. “But if
the human consequences of such aims mean unemployment on
an unprecedented scale, poverty, bureaucracy, despair about the
future of some communities [and an] inequitable sharing of the
sacrifice called for, then the objectives must be called in ques-
tion.” He was particularly concerned about unemployment,
which reached a record 3,283,000 only a few days before the
interview. “We need to find some way of giving voice to the
voiceless, to the people who feel caught up in this and don’t have
hope for the future of their children,” he said.
Thatcher did not reply to the archbishop’s remarks. That task
was given to Tory backbenchers. M.P. Tony Marlow said that
the Church of England was led by “muddled old men.” M.P.
Edward Du Cann called Runcie’s
comments “naive and foolish,” while
M.P. Anthony Beaumont called the
interview “mindless.” The Tory rank
and file, however, found the arch-
bishop’s remarks more appealing. A
poll released last week indicated a
growing concern among Tory voters
over the government’s economic pol-
icies. Only 49 percent of the Conser-
vatives polled were satisfied with
Thatcher’s handling of the miners’
strike, and 68 percent thought that
the prime minister was doing a bad
job dealing with unemployment in
general.
The bishops are likely to continue
their criticism of the government.
“The church must be concerned with
public affairs,” Runcie said, “but this
does not entail pronouncing on all
public issues. Much public concern
can be expressed in ways which are
deliberately low profile.” But if such
methods fail, the likelihood is he will
not hesitate to speak out forcefully
again. And when the archbishop of
Canterbury speaks, people in Britain
tend to listen.

WORLD AFFAIRS
Fragile Signs of Change
An anti-Pyongyang demonstration in Seoul, exchanging gifts after delivering the flood relief aid: Is the anger cooling?
The ‘two Koreas’ send each other some surprising, and intriguing, peace feelers.
At Freedom Bridge near the border with
North Korea, hundreds of tearful
South Koreans gathered last week for a
poignant ceremony. As bereaved relatives
looked on, Prime Minister Chin lee Chong
unveiled a 55-foot-high granite tower, a me-
morial to 17 of his countrymen killed by a
North Korean bomb blast in Rangoon a
year ago. But amid the outpouring of emo-
tion were hints that South Korea’s anger
was beginnning to cool, if ever so slightly.
Although Seoul was clearly in no mood to
forgive or forget, there was an undertone of
forbearance. “We can retaliate [against] the
North Korean communists tit for tat,” said
Chin, “but we have been patient in order to
avoid a fratricidal war and to achieve peace
and unification on the peninsula.”
The mood at the memorial observances
was all the more striking in light of a recent
flurry of intriguing peace feelers between
South and North. The overtures began two
weeks ago, when a convoy of North Korean
trucks and ships delivered $l2 million of
cement, textiles, rice and medicine to the
South —relief aid for victims of heavy floods
in central South Korea. Although Seoul
had made it clear from the start that it did
not really need the supplies, it accepted
them as a gesture of conciliation.
No sooner had the North Korean mission
returned home than the two sides moved to
capitalize on the gesture. There was a tiny
sign that North and South might be willing
to listen to each other: Red Cross officials
agreed to restore “hot line” telephone links
across the border that were cut by the North
in 1976. On a larger scale, the rivals sepa-
rately proposed talks aimed at reducing
tensions on a peninsula that has been split
by ideology and hatred for nearly four de-
cades. They remained at odds, however, on
what form the contacts might take. Any
genuine changes still seemed remote.
But the overtures between Seoul and
Pyongyang have produced some tantalizing
signs of movement on a few significant is-
sues. Late last week, South Korea proposed
new talks with the North to promote trade
and economic cooperation. Just days be-
fore, South Korean Red Cross President
Yoo Chang Soon suggested reopening long-
stalled discussions on the plight of an esti-
mated 10 million families separated by the
political partition. And South Korean
Olympic Committee President Roh Tae
Woo offered to resume meetings aimed at
fielding unified Korean teams for interna-
tional athletic events, including the 1988
Olympic Games in Seoul.
Different Approaches: So far, the North
Korean government has not responded to
any of the initiatives, preferring to stick to a
more modest proposal of its own. In a radio
broadcast this month, the North offered to
begin a single set of broad, vaguely defined
discussions on enlarging exchanges in eco-
nomic, cultural and athletic spheres. It is
too early to tell how the two sides might
come to terms; they clearly favor different
approaches. Said one South Korean observ-
er: “We prefer to seek solutions to smaller
issues one by one, but the North wants to
talk about everything at the same time.”
Ironically, the Rangoon bombing may
have forced the North into its seemingly
outward-looking posture. Faced with a
badly sputtering economy, the North has
recently expressed interest in expanding
commercial and technical ties with Japan
and the West. But Pyongyang may be
increasingly aware that efforts to break out
of its economic isolation are doomed un-
less it can give at least the appearance of
being more accommodating in its interna-
tional relations.
Bluster: Bearing that out, a little more
than a week ago North Korean Foreign
Minister Kim Yong Nam told the Washing-
ton Post that his government was willing to
consider longstanding U.S. proposals for
“confidence building” security measures —
including mutual notification and an ex-
change of observers during military exer-
cises—to help defuse tensions in Korea.
South Korea has also toned down its blus-
ter. After repeated demands for an apology
for the Rangoon bombing derailed athletic
talks in May, sports officials in Seoul now
say they will not let “past events” hamper
future negotiations.
Given the peninsula’s bitter history,
there is reason for skepticism on the ques-
tion of improved relations. Observers point
out that so far neither party has yielded
anything of real substance. Yet the new,
fragile signals of flexibility in both Seoul and
Pyongyang have raised modest hopes
among Asia analysts that enough momen-
tum could be generated to create a thaw. If
nothing else, the guarded proposals have
nudged relations between the two Koreas
off dead center for the first time in years.
Korean leaders may now feel obliged to
follow through on at least some of the initia-
tives. That, in turn, will inevitably raise the
most complex and emotional issue of all:
reunification. At this point, negotiations on
that question are still as remote as ever. If
the situation is ever going to change, the two
old foes will have to replace their diplomatic
one-upmanship with concrete actions.

WORLD AFFAIRS
Downsiders Vs. Optimists
PHILIPPINES
As the Agrava Commission approached its
final report on the murder of Benigno
Aquino last week, the State Department and
Pentagon were locked in a dispute over how
far the Reagan administration should dis-
tance itself from Ferdinand Marcos and how
hard it should use its enormous economic
leverage to move his regime toward reform.
Newsweek’s chief diplomatic correspond-
ent John Walcott and Pentagon correspond-
ent Kim Wi Henson talked to strategists from
both camps and assembled the following
account of a country —and a policy—in
disrepair:
Pentagon officials now believe the Mar-
cos regime is in deeper trouble than the
State Department is willing to admit. Re-
ports from the Defense Intelligence Agency
conjure up a worst-case scenario that gives
Marcos as few as two more months in power.
State Department strategists cite data from
the Central Intelligence Agency that predict
Marcos can hang on for at least another two
years. They argue that American pressure
will only hasten his ruin—as it did in the fall
of Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza. In reply,
some Pentagon analysts say the U.S. Em-
bassy and CIA station in Manila have made
the mistake of relying on Philippine govern-
ment sources for their intelligence—just as
U.S. officials in Iran once erred in counting
on the shah and SAVAK.
Among the voices in the downside school
is Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard
Armitage’s; its views have been bolstered by
staffers Carl Ford and Fred Brown of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
who made two trips to the Philippines
over the summer. Some of the evidence
that has accumulated is highly disturbing:
■ The insurgents of the com-
munist New People’s Army
have doubled their activity
over the past year. Armi-
tage says they now have
influence in about 20 per-
cent of Philippine villages.
The NPA has an estimated
10,000 to 15,000 armed
guerrillas and an additional
10,000 trained but unarmed
“active supporters.” Guer-
rilla units of up to battalion
size have started to appear
in the field. They have
shown themselves able to
fight toe to toe with govern-
ment troops and, in one or
two cases, to defeat them.
They have yet to establish
an absolute no-go area for
the Philippine Army. But
there are large parts of Min-

Ver: Disturbing charges
danao and northern Luzon where govern-
ment troops can no longer stay put. Gov-
ernment officials have had to be withdrawn
from these areas for their own safety.
■ The Philippine armed forces are not in top
shape. Five years of money-pinching poli-
cies have reduced military outlays by 20
percent in real terms. Leadership, equip-
ment, mobility and supply
are all problems. Troops are
short of uniforms and boots.
Some units have to forage
for food while they are in the
field and to use palm oil to
lubricate their guns. Many
units lack field radios, forc-
ing commanders to rely on
runners. The Navy and Air
Force have large numbers
of ships that can’t put to sea
and planes that can’t fly.
■ The Aquino assassination
and its fallout have diverted
the regime’s attention from
the nation’s economic crisis
and from the NPA build-
up in the countryside. “The
government has been preoc-
cupied with the dangers in
Manila, not in the prov-
inces,” says one top official.
The pessimists still believe the situation
can be retrieved, in part because there is as
yet no evidence of major arms shipments to
the NPA from Vietnam or elsewhere. If
Marcos goes under, it will be because his
regime has fallen apart, as Somoza’s did, not
because the NPA has defeated the Philip-
pine military. According to the downside
school of thought, the church and the mid-
dle class are turning against Marcos, and he
is trying to fight back in-
stead of compromising. The
downsiders argue that talks
on rescheduling the Philip-
pines’ $26 billion debt, curb-
ing inflation and trimming
unemployment offer Wash-
ington substantial leverage
over Marcos. Some officials
argue that the administra-
tion ought to pressure him to
clean up the corruption that
diverts so much wealth to
Malacanang Palace cronies.
The immediate case in
point involves whether to
replace Gen. Fabian Ver,
chief of staff of the Philip-
pine Army—and a promi-
nent figure in the Agrava
investigations. Some U.S.
officials believe Ver had a
major role in the Aquino
murder; they also blame him for a serious
decline in the morale and quality of the
military. (He denies all such allegations.)
“We should have leaned on Marcos three
months ago to fire Ver,” said one adminis-
tration hand. The task may not be so easy. It
is believed that Ver, an admirer of J. Edgar
Hoover, may have thick dossiers on senior
Philippine officials and Marcos cronies—
perhaps even the president’s wife, Imelda.
The pessimists complain that Assistant
Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz and Un-
der Secretary of Political Affairs Michael
Armacost, a former U.S. ambassador to the
Philippines, have been opposing attempts to
MATSUMOTO— SYGMA
The president and the First Lady: Worst-case scenarios
draw up a new national-security decision
directive for changing directions in the Phil-
ippines. “I don’t think anybody has con-
cluded there’s an imminent threat to the
authority of their government,” said one
senior official of the optimist school. Arma-
cost returned from an inspection trip to the
Philippines last week convinced that there
was no need for immediate and drastic ac-
tion. “We can be more effective sotto voce,”
said one source close to him. “We should let
the pressures come from within Philippine
society. That is more helpful than the gra-
tuitous, highly public criticism which tends
to arouse a highly nationalistic response.”
Frustration: The NSC staff has also
shown no interest in getting tough with
Marcos. So the administration’s Interagen-
cy Group on the Philippines has been un-
able to agree that a new approach is needed,
much less what it should be. “The tragedy is
that we still have a lot going for us in the
Philippines,” argues one frustrated down-
sides “But if we don’t act now, we could
lose everything.” He wasn’t just talking for
effect. As a hedge against disaster, the Pen-
tagon has quietly leased 18,000 acres on the
islands of Tinian and Saipan. It openly de-
scribes the leasehold as a “fallback basing
area.” And the United States would only
have to fall back if Marcos founders and the
United States loses the use of Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay naval complex.

CHINA
Deng’s Risky New Reforms
Deng Xiaoping barreled on down the
capitalist road last week —but he
might be headed for a collision. To revital-
ize China’s sluggish economy, the govern-
ment announced that it will lift state plan-
ning quotas on 60 of 120 industrial products
and 19 of 29 farm products. And in coming
weeks, Peking is expected to announce far-
reaching urban reforms that will revamp
the country’s wage, price and tax controls.
In effect, Deng hopes to let supply and
demand —rather than state planners—help
set the direction of the country’s economy.
But the reforms could lead to inflation,
price hikes and popular opposition. “One of
the great uncertainties,” warns a Peking-
based Western diplomat, “is whether the
Chinese will be able to bite the bullet.”
That question will be the focus of an
important plenary session of the Commu-
nist Party’s Central Committee scheduled
for this month. The Chinese leadership is
expected to announce its urban reforms at
the meeting. But just how far Deng will go in
loosening state controls remains unclear.
China’s paramount leader has stressed that
he hopes to continue the momentum of his
five-year-old rural reforms, which freed
most agricultural products from state con-
trols, dismantled communes and encour-
aged peasants to pursue entrepreneurial
ventures. Those early reforms, however,
were initially bankrolled by the state. The
government fueled production by hiking the
prices it paid for farm goods by 20 percent;
to cushion consumers from the higher
prices, Peking also granted urban workers
a $3-a-month living subsidy.
Since the onset of the rural re-
forms, state subsidies have
swelled more than sixfold.
Distortion: Now Deng wants
to reduce those subsidies —and
the cornerstone of his proposed
program will be an overhaul of
the country’s price structure.
“The Chinese leadership
knows that without price re-
form, none of the other reforms
can work,” says a Western dip-
lomat in Peking. “The irra-
tional pricing system gives
them a distorted picture of how
to run their enterprises.” In ad-
dition, the reforms will curb
the influence of the state
plan—the standard monolith
of any socialist economy. Last
week’s announcement about
lifting quotas suggests that pro-
ducers of such items as textiles,
fruits and light consumer
goods will soon be able to tailor
their output according to the
law of supply and demand.
“The Chinese are looking to
expand the role of the market in the econ-
omy and to reduce the role of the plan,” said
the diplomat. “Today they look at the plan
as little more than a guidance document.”
Deng’s flirtation with capitalist-style
management has already suffered a few
false starts. When Peking granted provin-
cial enterprises freer rein several years ago,
a rush on housing and capital construction
ensued, while production of consumer
goods continued to lag far behind popular
demand. Soon, massive stockpiles of un-

popular, defective or untransportable goods
were languishing in state warehouses, in-
cluding $6O billion worth of electronic and
machine-building equipment in the last
year alone. More disappointing, an urban
bonus scheme designed to encourage
greater worker productivity fell flat. After
the government set an annual bonus ceiling
of roughly 2 Vi months’ pay, plant managers
proceeded to reward almost every worker
with the bonus. “The bonuses became a sort
of fixed wage rise and lost their function as
incentives,” Peking’s state council conclud-
ed earlier this year.
Resistance: Some urban workers are not
likely to greet the new reforms with much
enthusiasm- Deng’s efforts to trim state sub-
sidies from 25 to 15 percent of state revenue
will inevitably trigger widespread price
hikes. And there are doubts about the “re-
sponsibility system” concept that was intro-
duced under the agricultural program and is
expected to expand under the urban re-
forms. In place of Maoist guarantees of jobs
and uniform wages, Deng promotes a form
of contract labor that rewards hard work
with higher pay and penalizes absenteeism.
Many urban managers have already en-
countered resistance to such reforms. In
1979 Bu Xinsheng, the manager of an urban
shirt factory in Zhejiang Province, initiated
a “no work, no pay” policy; he also demand-
ed that workers pay 30 percent of their
medical bills and fired seven employees.
Production soon soared to six times its 1978
level, and attendance stabilized at 98 per-
cent. But Bu paid a steep price: he had to hire
bodyguards after receiving death threats,
and his wife suffered a nervous breakdown.
Deng can also expect resistance from the
hordes of middle-level bureaucrats and
local party secretaries who rose to office
during the Cultural Revolu-
tion. Their power has been di-
minished in favor of younger,
technically more proficient
managers. Many aging cadres
are resentful of the changes,
and the government is aware of
their feelings. Earlier this
month Communist Party chief
Hu Yaobang admitted that the
reforms had met with some
“incomprehension” due to
ideological laziness. Although
“real opposition” was limited,
said Hu, “we must not underes-
timate old ways of thought.”
Deng himself is hardly obliv-
ious to the risks ahead. “Rural
reforms .. . have proved effec-
tive and peasants are getting
better off —but urban reforms
need greater courage,” he said
last week. The challenge will
be to coax China’s economic
revolution forward without
setting off a social revolution
in the process.

CAMPAIGN'84
Reagan and the Age Issue
The president’s wobbly debate performance helps Mondale make points.
Still smarting from his lackluster show-
ing during the first presidential debate,
Ronald Reagan returned to the White
House last week to sign the Older Ameri-
cans Act of 1984, a bill to continue food and
nutrition assistance for senior citizens. The
ceremony went well, and Reagan prefaced
it with a familiar ploy: defusing his political
liabilities by making light of them. There are
three stages of life, the president observed
with a grin: “youth, middle age, and ‘you’re
looking wonderful!’ ” At 73, candidate Rea-
gan is clearly in the third stage. But last

week, in the aftermath of his shaky perform-
ance against Walter Mondale, the obvious
question was whether he will still look won-
derful to the voters on Nov. 6.
Suddenly “the age issue” had become the
No.l topic of Campaign’B4. First, an esti-
mated 80 million viewers had witnessed the
Great Communicator’s stumbling and hesi-
tation on the air—a performance that took
both the president’s men and even Fritz
Mondale by surprise. And it was not some
mean-spirited zinger by his opponent that
made the connection with Reagan’s age: it
was a bastion of editorial conservatism, The
Wall Street Journal. In a front-page head-
line last week, the Journal bluntly asked,
is [the] oldest u.s. president now
showing his age? reagan debate per-
formance invites open speculation
onhis ability to serve. Journal reporter
James M. Perry said the story had been in
the works for weeks and that its devastating
timing was coincidence. .
That could hardly have consoled Rea-
gan’s agonized aides, as other newspapers
and broadcasters picked up the theme,
Within days White House polls detected a
3-point drop in Reagan’s 16- to 18-point
lead nationwide; Mondale aides said sur-
veys done for the Mondale campaign by
polltaker Pat Caddell showed a 6-point
shift. Hoping to limit the damage, the White
House hastily reissued a statement on Rea-
gan’s last medical exam with a doctor’s
conclusion that Reagan was “mentally
alert” (box). But that move further focused
attention on the first real chink in what had
seemed an impregnable campaign. All at
once, Walter Mondale’s long, uphill strug-
gle had a jolt of new energy—and the second
presidential debate on Oct. 21 took on new
significance. A second faltering perform-
ance, virtually all the experts agreed,
would do much worse damage to the presi-
dent’s cause.
George Bush’s solid showing against
Geraldine Ferraro later in the week (follow-
ing story) blocked the Democrats’hope for
a one-two punch. And in truth, the odds on
Reagan’s re-election were still huge: his
electoral base in the South and West re-
mained secure, and two core issues of the
campaign—the economy and U.S. prestige
abroad —still seemed to be working in his
favor. But as Mondale’s people saw it, the
president’s weak performance during the
debate —coupled with Mondale’s crisp self-
assurance —had hit the Reagan campaign
where it hurt most: right in the leadership
factor. Reagan’s apparent uncertainty on
the facts conveyed the impression that he
was not fully familiar with his own record —
and by extension, perhaps not ful-
ly in command of his own admin-
istration as well. “It is potentially
the issue,” said Democratic poll-
taker William Hamilton. “It goes
right to the heart.”
Overcoached: The sudden reve-
lation of presidential fallibility left
Reagan’s inner circle severely
shaken. The president himself
seemed uncharacteristically self-
critical, and Nancy Reagan was
said to be “goddamned angry” at
the age issue’s emergence in the
campaign. Loyalists looked for
scapegoats on the White House
staff. They argued that the presi-
dent’s age had nothing to do with
his showing in the debate. Instead,
they said, Reagan had been over-
confident and overcoached by his
staff, particularly budget director
David Stockman and presidential
assistant Richard Darman. Stock-
man played Mondale in four mock
debates with Reagan, just as he
played Jimmy Carter in 1980. This
time, however, Stockman may
have overplayed his role. “We as-
sumed Mondale would come in
whining and strident,” said one aide. “In-
stead, he was warm and knowledgeable. He
out-Reaganed Reagan.”
Other aides said Reagan had been
“crammed with briefing material and criti-
cized too many times” by staffers who
“have a condescending attitude toward
him” —and Sen. Paul Laxalt publicly com-
plained that Reagan had been “smothered”
with statistics and “brutalized” by the brief-
ing process. It was Reagan himself who
finally put a halt to the recriminations. Con-
ceding that he had “kind of flattened out”
during the debate, he allowed that he had
done “a lot of homework, probably too
much of it, without sitting back and relax-
ing” and that he had succumbed to the
temptation to try to defend his record in

detail. “I never realized how easy it is to
be on the other side,” he said. “What you
saw was what you see in the cabinet room
and the leadership meetings,” observed
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
after the debate. “If the point of this is to get
a real inside view, you got more of that
tonight than I’ve ever seen in public with
Ronald Reagan.”
In the aftermath, Reagan supporters
scrambled to comprehend the impact of the
debacle. At the worst, they said, Mondale’s
success could give wavering Democrats a
reason to return to the fold and shrink Rea-
gan’s coattails in House and Senate elec-
tions; a senior aide said he no longer thought
Reagan could achieve a 50-state sweep in
the electoral college. And at a minimum,
the stakes on the next presidential debate
had risen sharply. There was no doubt that
major changes were necessary in their plans
to prep Reagan for his second meeting with
Mondale. Although all hands agreed that
Reagan must enunciate the overriding
themes of his foreign policy
forcefully and clearly, he would also be
required to demonstrate his mastery of the
details—never his strongest suit. To some,
the shaken mood of the White House was
the biggest danger. “The main objective
now must be to stay calm,” said one old
hand. “They’re betraying a sense of panic.”
The Democrats scarcely believed their
good fortune. Mondale staffers predicted
that Fightin’ Fritz would close the gap to 10
points by the second debate. “When people
go back to write the history of this race and
when Mondale turned it around,” said the
campaign chairman James A. Johnson,
“there’s absolutely no doubt that the story
will start with [the first debate].”
Some aides were quietly jubilant that the
age issue had finally surfaced. Their glee,
however, was carefully restrained: Mondale
strategists have believed all along that Rea-
Bush and Ferraro shake hands: No one-two punch
WALLY McNAMEE —NEWSWEEK
gan is vulnerable on the question of his
grasp and command of the job, but they
have been equally certain that Mondale
cannot raise the issue directly without ap-
pearing disrespectful and inviting voter
backlash. Instead, they say, Mondale must
approach it obliquely, by challenging Rea-
gan’s command of the facts and by arguing
that Reagan is isolated and out of touch.
And some of them cringed last week when
House Speaker Tip O’Neill pointedly
observed that “people in the White
House tend to get old mighty quick-
ly” and that Reagan “cannot even
remember”his promises on social se-
curity. “We feel age is probably in the
mix here, but. . . not because of any-
thing we did,” a Mondale adviser
said. “The problem is, if our sup-
porters keep hammering on it, voters
won’t believe that. The focus will shift
to us, and we could get hurt.”
‘Grave Robbing 9 : As a result, Mon-
dale stuck to his game plan last week.
He jabbed at Reagan on policy issues,
ridiculed him as “a cheerleader”
rather than a “quarterback” and
warned against the influence of right-
wing fundamentalists like Jerry Fal-
well on Reagan’s future Supreme
Court nominations. He bore down on
social security and on Reagan’s
promise, during the first debate, that
he would not reduce benefits for cur-
rent recipients: in short order, the


White House issued a new and broader
statement that Reagan would protect future
social-security recipients as well. “We
smoked him out,” Mondale told reporters.
When Nancy Reagan presided over a White
House luncheon honoring Eleanor Roose-
velt and Reagan retraced the route of Harry
Truman’s 1948 whistle-stop tour through
Ohio, Mondale scoffed at the other side’s
“grave-robbing.” “These Republicans have
a lot to learn. You don’t honor Harry Tru-
man by passing the buck in Lebanon. . . and
you don’t honor Eleanor Roosevelt by cozy-
ing up to racists in South Africa.”
It all seemed to work: buoyed by the
debate and the changing chemistry of the
campaign, Mondale campaigned strenu-
ously through the Northeast and the Mid-
west, drawing larger and more enthusiastic
crowds by the day. When Reagan grumbled
that Mondale had looked younger during
the debate because he wore so much make-
up, Mondale scoffed “that’s the same thing
Nixon said after his debate with Kennedy.
The real problem wasn’t makeup on the
face, it was the makeup of his answers.”
And in Columbus, Ohio, he twitted Reagan
for his slips of the tongue on defense policy.
“Mr. President, you may think you can
recall nuclear weapons after they’ve been
fired, but it just ain’t so. You may think that
submarines and bombers don’t have nu-

clear weapons, but it just ain’t so . . . you
may think that two-thirds of our defense
budget goes for pay and pensions, but it just
ain’t so.” The crowd, following his litany,
joined in, chanting “it just ain’t so” on cue.
Reagan was sticking to his game plan as
well. Traveling through Ohio aboard the
same railroad car Truman used in his 1948
campaign, he did his best to tie Mondale to
the Carter administration and the Demo-
crats’ tax-and-spend tradition. The crowds
were large and friendly, and the debate
seemed long ago; Reagan was once more his
amiable, confident self. The Democrats of-
fered “a future of pessimism, fear and lim-
its —compared to ours, of hope, confidence
and growth. ... In four years they took the
strongest economy in the world and they
pushed it to the brink of collapse,” he told
his audiences. He chided Mondale for his
“Fritz-flop” on tax-indexing and com-
plained about “all those times [Mondale]
distorted my record” during the debate. “I
was about to say to him very sternly, ‘Mr.
Mondale, you are taxing my patience,’ ”
Reagan joked. “And then I caught myself.
Why should I give him another idea? That’s
the only tax he hasn’t thought about.”
Rhymes With Rich: Elsewhere, however,
the campaign was heating up —and by the
weekend, both Democratic candidates were
taking direct aim at Bush. Part of the reason
was that Barbara Bush and Peter Teeley,
Bush’s press secretary, had both let slip ad
feminem remarks about Ferraro. Barbara
Bush had remarked that Ferraro was “a $4
million —I can’t say it, but it rhymes with
‘rich’ later, Teeley had filled in the blank
by calling Ferraro “bitchy.” Then, during
the vice presidential debate, Bush claimed
the Democrats had said that the U.S. Ma-
rines killed in Lebanon had died “in
shame.” Ferraro demanded an apology,
The Doctors Examine Age
By MATT CLARK
Medicine Editor
“Mr. Reagan is a mentally alert, robust
man who appears younger than his stated
age.” This notation from the president’s
routine physical examination last spring
was made public by the White House last
week to turn aside the suspicion that Rea-
gan was showing his age during his wobbly
debate performance. But what does the
phrase “mentally alert” really mean?
As was noted in the formal
report last May, the president is
in normal physical health for a
man of 73, with the exception of
his worsening hearing problem. *
“He really passes with flying col-
ors,” says Dr. Jerry Earll, an in-
ternist at the Georgetown Uni-
versity medical school. But
many physicians agree that
no solid conclusion should be
drawn from the term “mentally
alert.” “In and of itself, it means
very little, except that in normal
conversation, the patient seems
to be ‘with it’,” says New York internist Dr.
Robert S. Ascheim. In the course of a
routine physical, he notes, a doctor em-
ploys simple powers of observation during
discussion with a patient to size up his
general mental state —and that’s about all.
Nor, doctors emphasize, can serious
conclusions be made about the president’s
occasional verbal fumbling during the de-
bate. Such behavior could easily be the
result of anything from fatigue to an empty

stomach. “There’s no way for someone to
jump to conclusions on the basis of seeing
one performance,” says Marilyn Albert of
the geriatric-psychiatry clinic at Boston’s
Massachusetts General Hospital. “What
concerns people most is a perception —and
it’s not based on objective data —that the
president did much more poorly than he
did in the [debates against Jimmy Carter],”
adds Steven Ferris, geriatric specialist at
New York University Medical Center.
The essential question in their view is
whether Reagan has exhibited other signs
of trouble over recent months. In that con-
nection, the recent incident in
which Nancy Reagan apparently
had to prompt her husband dur-
ing a session with the press comes
to mind. If such lapses result
from true mental deterioration,
and not the “where did I leave my
glasses” sort of memory loss typ-
ical of aging, more specialized
tests than a routine physical
would have to be done. “All can-
didates for the presidency should
have an examination for age-re-
lated brain changes,” declares
Dr. Leslie Libow of New York’s
Mount Sinai Medical Center.
One such test would be a ver-
bal IQ. In normal people, IQ

and the campaign issued a press release
insisting that “neither member of the Dem-
ocratic ticket has said or implied anything
of the sort.” Questioned by reporters, Bush
stood by his statement “100 percent”—and
Mondale, in Minneapolis, was clearly in-
censed. “He’s repeating the charge?” Mon-
dale said incredulously, launching into a
lengthy tirade about Bush’s “appalling and
atrocious” misstatement. “He should be
ashamed of himself,” Mondale said, “and if
he thinks this is the end of it, he hasn’t seen
anything yet.”
Campaign ’84 —“the clearest choice in 50
years,” as Reagan put it —was heating up,
and the stage was set for what may yet be a
dramatic finale. With only three weeks until
election day, Mondale needed a seismic
shift in the electorate to get back into con-
tention; last week his polling showed only
the beginning of a favorable trend. The sec-
ond debate is probably his only chance to
make the earthquake happen. In less than
90 minutes, Mondale must persuade the
voters that his issues matter and that he is
the better leader. But this debate will be
critical for the president as well, and his
handlers know it. Reagan, they say confi-
dently, will be ready to reclaim his title as
the Great Communicator—and put to rest
any lingering doubts about his competence.

scores don’t decrease until well into the
80s, Albert points out. A significant drop in
the score of a younger person would be a
warning sign. Another standard procedure
is the “mini-mental test,’’ which is especial-
ly useful in diagnosing the onset of Alz-
heimer’s disease. The patient is asked, for
example, to name the year, season, month,
date or day, or to count backward from 100
by sevens. To assess interpretive ability, he
might also be asked to explain an old prov-
erb like “a rolling stone gathers no moss.”
Heredity: In some cases, Alzheimer’s
runs in families. And the president himself
has speculated that his mother, who be-
came senile a few years before her death at
77, may have had the disease. But experts
doubt that Reagan is genetically predis-
posed. “Familial” Alzheimer’s, they point
out, usually strikes in the 40s or 50s.
Doctors see no reason why a man Rea-
gan’s age shouldn’t be president. They cite
Winston Churchill, among others, as an
impressive precedent. And, they point out,
decision makers often suffer less stress than
the younger people who execute their
edicts. “There’s no reason a priori why
someone in his 70s may not be just the
person we need,” says Albert. “Sometimes,
those very people have the accumulated
wisdom, knowledge and expertise to deal
wisely with complex situations.”
Shoot-Outat Gender Gap
Bush won the polls, but Ferraro held her ground.
George Bush: ‘But let me help you with
the difference, Ms. Ferraro, between Iran
and the embassy [ bombing\ in Lebanon. ”
Geraldine Ferraro: ‘Let me just say, first
of all, that I almost resent, Vice President
Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have
to teach me about foreign policy. ”
Call it the shoot-out at gender gap:
the first direct confrontation
between a man and a woman seek-
ing a truly national office. Both
Bush and Ferraro not only sur-
vived last week’s historic 85-min-
ute face-off in Philadelphia, but
probably also enhanced their
reputations. But the ragged—and
sometimes emotionally charged—
debate remained a political Ror-
schach test: its meaning kept shift-
ing and depended heavily on the
preconceptions of the 50 million
TV viewers.
The quick overnight polls—
even those conducted by Walter
Mondale’s campaign—all judged
Bush the winner of the closely
fought debate. An ABC survey
gave the nod to the vice president
by a margin of 42 to 33 percent,
though, significantly, women nar-
rowly went for Ferraro. However, there was
scant evidence that the veepstakes sweep-
stakes profoundly altered the dynamics of
the presidential race. A CBS/New York
Times poll found that the debate verdicts
closely correlated with the presidential pref-
erences of those surveyed.
But instant polls are just a Polaroid snap-
shot; the lasting afterimages of a debate take
Bush: An overheated start, but a strong close
days to develop. Ferraro’s don’t-patronize-
me riposte was made-to-order for TV news-
casts. So, too, was an embarrassing Bush
double-entendre that he made, flush with
victory, on the morning after. Campaigning
in Elizabeth, N. J., Bush was at first unaware
that a TV-boom microphone was recording
him as he boasted that “we tried to kick a
little ass last night.’’ Then, in clas-
sic caught-in-the-act style, Bush cried,
PHOTOS BY WALLY McNAMEE— NEWSWEEK
Ferraro: ‘Swift, concise and certain retaliation’
“Whoops, oh God, he heard me. Turn that
thing off.” The vice president later dis-
missed the remark as just “an old Texas
football expression.”
The flap took some of the edge off Bush’s
debate performance. After Ronald Rea-
gan’s listlessness in Louisville, Republicans
had reason to be buoyed by Bush’s perki-
ness—especially his command of adminis-
tration foreign policy. And on domes-
tic issues he presented the Reagan
case far more clearly than had the
president himself. Still, Republicans
worried that negative TV-sound bites
might overshadow Bush’s efforts to
win one for The Gipper. “We don’t
need to cross-pressure women,” said
one GOP strategist. “We can’t give
them an excuse to side with Ferraro.”
Credible: By most reckonings, Fer-
raro more than achieved her mini-
mum debate goals. While she did not
dominate the debate as Democrats
had hoped, Ferraro did nothing to
jeopardize Mondale’s momentum.
Moreover, her credible performance
quieted critics who had doubted
whether Ferraro—or any woman —
had the experience, depth and tem-
perament to hold high office. Ferraro
took pains to defuse the nervous Nel-
lie factor: the prejudice that a woman
would not be tough enough to handle
foreign policy. Bluntly questioned


about her ability to stand up to the Russians,
Ferraro sternly declared that any Soviet
nuclear threat “would be met with swift,
concise and certain retaliation.”
Stylistically, both candidates played
against type —often to their own detriment.
The turnabouts were so extreme —especial-
ly in the first half of the debate —that parti-
sans from both sides jokingly used drug
analogies to explain the performance of the
candidates. “She looked like she was on
Sominex,” sniffed Bush speechwriter Vic
Gold about Ferraro. “Bush was okay after
the drugs wore off,” cracked Democratic
media consultant Robert Squier.
The usually mild-mannered vice presi-
‘Well, George, it certainly looked to me as if she was
wearing makeup’: Rorschach test for 50 million viewers
HERBLOCK— THE WASHINGTON POST
dent took off like the caffeine-crazed busi-
nessman in a Federal Express ad. Bush’s
frenetic sentences were punctuated by a
bewildering array of gestures. “You know,”
he said shaking his head sadly, “it’s funny [a
chuckle] Mr. Mondale talks about [a step
back from the podium] real interest rates.
The real interest rate is what you [wagging
his right hand] pay when you [waving his left
hand]... try to buy aTV set. .. ”
Lawyerly: Ferraro underwent a startling
reversal herself —and Bush later said that
her demeanor left him “amazed.” Trying to
become what aides called a “stateswoman,”
Ferraro lowered her voice, slowed down her
speech rhythms and kept a tight rein on her
natural feistiness. Although her handlers
had stressed the importance of eye contact
with the camera, Ferraro—reverting to her
courtroom manner —kept peering down at
the notes she scribbled during Bush’s argu-
ments. Democrats could not help being
slightly disappointed by Ferraro’s subdued
style. “There were lots of openings she
didn’t take,” said a leading Democratic poll-
taker. “She was trying too hard not to be
brassy and ended up just plain dull.”
Still, the debate had its moments of high
drama. Bush created a new campaign issue
with his controversial charge that both Fer-
raro and Mondale believed that the Marines
in Lebanon had “died in shame.” Staring
straight into the camera for once, Ferraro
launched a passionate counterattack, de-
claring, “No one who has a child who is 19 or
20 years old, a son, would ever say that about
the loss of anyone else’s child.”
Abortion also flared up, as it
had in Louisville. Ferraro, the
first national candidate ever to
discuss the issue in first-person
terms, explained that although
she was a “devout Catholic,” she
could not impose her church’s
anti-abortion views on others.
“If there comes a time where I
cannot practice my religion
and do my job properly,” she
pledged, “I will resign my job.”
Bush cleaved to the Reagan anti-
abortion line, though he conced-
ed —despite prior denials —that
there has been “an evolution in
my position.”
Hyperbole: Bush made per-
haps the most embarrassing fac-
tual gaffe of the debate when he
claimed that “spending for food
stamps is way, way up.” In truth,
there has been virtually no in-
crease in overall funding for
the program since Jimmy
Carter’s last budget. Bush’s sta-
tistical hyperbole might have
passed unnoticed, except that he
loudly announced, “I am not go-
ing to be found wrong on that. I
am sure of my facts.”
In addition to attending funer-
als, vice presidents are required
to gush shamelessly about the
greatness of their boss. Here Ferraro was
overmatched by Bush’s on-the-job training.
But once during the debate, the vice presi-
dent may have outdone himself. Describing
the president’s meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, Bush burbled
about how Reagan was “right on top of that
subject matter” and impressed the Russians
that “this president is calling the shots.”
After Louisville, it was the kind of defensive,
almost desperate, praise that revives talk of a
disengaged president. In fact, Bush’s con-
stant effusiveness may have helped raise the
stakes even higher for next week’s debate
when Reagan, not his designated cheer-
leader, has to make his own case.

The Mysterious Curse
Of Friendly Hills
The kitchen wall at Rebecca Parr’s house
suddenly snapped with a sound like a sonic
boom. The east side of Nick Robinson’s
place has levitated nine inches higher than
the west. Worse still, Friendly Hills —a
prim subdivision near Denver —seems to be
plagued with more than its share of health
problems. According to Parr, a local activ-
ist who is keeping count, 12 children have
died of meningitis, cancer and heart disease
since 1978. In four blocks she found 30 cases
of adult tumors and, elsewhere in the area,
high reports of miscarriages, arthritis and
other afflictions.
Inhabitants of the subdivision are angry
and frightened. They know what is causing
the poltergeist problem: bentonite, a clayey
soil that expands when wet, lifting and
twisting the houses above it. Residents say
Pulte Home Corp., the major developer in
Friendly Hills and one of the nation’s larg-
est home builders, at first assured them that
their new houses were just settling. But after
foundations began to crumble, suspicions
began to rise. Now 62 homeowners are su-
ing Pulte, claiming the company built
houses too weak for bentonite in an area
that perhaps should never have been devel-
oped in the first place. Negotiations on a
settlement are in progress.
But bentonite does not explain the health
curse. The Colorado cancer registry shows
that the area has reported 2!4 times the
normal rate of childhood cancer. But state
health officials say inexplicable “cancer
clusters” are not uncommon. They dismiss
the rest of the ailments as the normal run of
ill health and have refused to make a door-
to-door survey. Two weeks ago Parr and her
friends started their own survey to prove
that something is wrong. “There’s just too
much going on here to be comfortable,”
says Yvonne Peterson, whose three-year-
old son died of a rare brain cancer.
Toxics: The gnawing fear is that the neigh-
borhood sits not only on bentonite but on
some sort of hidden chemical dump. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
says there are no known hazardous-waste
sites nearby, but it is testing for toxics;
results should be known in late November.
Parents like Michael and Barbara Dunlap,
who lost a son to meningitis and whose
daughter has a brain tumor, don’t want to
wait: she is pregnant and they’d like to move
well before the child is born.
Between the bentonite and the cancer
scare, the real-estate market has dried up—
and that has residents with undamaged
houses and healthy children furious at the
complainers. With the EPA dubious of ever
finding a chemical cause and the court case
against Pulte dragging on, it may be a long
while before Friendly Hills is exorcised of
the demons, real or imagined, that stalk it.

HOW THE AGUSTA GROUP MAKES
The A 129 Mongoose pictured below is the l most advanced
helicopter in its class in the world today. It is also the first
specialised defence helicopter produced in Europe. And it
was conceived, designed and built by Agusta Group tech-
nology.
Producing a helicopter like the A 129 demands immense
technological know-how. But the Agusta Group has some
impressive resources to call on. A vast organisation of scien-
tists and technicians devoted exclusively to research and
development And a massive fund of expertise that covers
the whole field of aeronautics. From Agusta’s Helicopter
Division, through its Airplanes Division to its Systems Divi-

the first helicopter to use an Integrated Multiplexing
System. This monitors and controls the Al29’s mechanical,
electrical, electronic and warfare systems, managing auto-
matically all flight and mission functions.
In terms of new materials: the Al 2 9 makes extensive use of
advanced composites, developed and produced by the
Agusta Group at its own new plant in Anagni.
In terms of survivability: because this factor is so vital for a
dedicated helicopter, advanced technology has been
applied to this end in key areas (rotors, transmission, fusel-
age, flight controls).
In terms of day/night capability: the A 129 incorporates ad-
vanced infra-red systems allowing round-the-clock combat
readiness even in bad weather or low visibility.
These are just a few examples of the advanced technology
that went into the making of the A 129. There are many
more. And the kind of technological breakthroughs that
make the Al 2 9 the formidable defence helicopter it is find,
thanks to the Agusta Group structure, applications in many
other sectors, both military and civil.

Duarte Offers to Negotiate
ROLAND NEVEU—GAMMA-LIAISON
Duarte with Pickering (left) and Shultz, guerrillas at the site of the talks: 'I am putting my life on the line to talk peace in the presence of the world press, representatives of the church and the population of La Palma’
El Salvador’s president invites the guerrilla leaders to a peace conference.
Sometime around 10 a.m., the president
of El Salvador climbs out of a sedan marked
with a white flag. He hikes into the village of
La Palma—and into the hands of guerrillas.
Except for his defense minister and two other
aides, Jose Napoleon Duarte walks alone,
leaving behind troops and bodyguards and
every last one of his anxious U.S. advisers. No
one knows for sure what will happen in La
Palma. But after more than four years of
civil war and bloody repression, after more
than 40,000 civilians have been killed, the
two sides are now prepared to talk to each
other. It's a beginning.
That, at least, was the plan.
Last week Duarte startled
his friends as much as his ene-
mies by proposing in a speech
at the United Nations that
guerrilla leaders meet him this
Monday for peace talks in La
Palma, a contested area about
45 miles north of San Salvador.
Duarte said he would come un-
armed —“putting my life on
the line”—to talk peace “in the
presence of the world press,
representatives of the church,
and the population of La Pal-
ma.” The rebels complained
about the vague logistics, fret-
ted about the security arrange-
ments and questioned Duarte’s sincerity,
But his offer would be hard to refuse,
In one bold stroke, Duarte hoped to shift
the focus in El Salvador from military ac-
tion to political negotiation. His attempt to
talk peace may yet be rejected by the left or
may provoke a disastrous backlash from the
far right. Then again, it just might succeed,
“That is why I’ve proposed this encounter,
where Salvadorans will search for solutions
to Salvadoran problems,” he said. While the
Reagan administration was still trying to
hold the line against international commu-

nism, Duarte had begun to maneuver for a
separate peace.
A search for political solutions was going
on elsewhere in Central America. Hondu-
ras, site of an ambitious buildup by the
Pentagon, announced that it wants to re-
negotiate its relationship with Washington,
seeking more economic aid and fewer mili-
tary ties. Honduras and other U.S. friends
in the area also cautiously supported a
regional peace treaty drafted by the Conta-
dora nations (Colombia, Mexico, Panama
and Venezuela). Although they follow-
ed Washington in demanding
that loopholes in the draft be
closed, the Central Americans
made it clear that they wanted
peaceful solutions to regional
disputes. Another step was
taken by Congress, which cut
off funds, at least temporarily,
for the U.S.-backed guerrillas
who are fighting the Nicara-
guan regime.
Duarte did not seek U.S. per-
mission for his initiative. But
the Reagan administration
quickly scrambled onto his
bandwagon, perhaps because
there was nowhere else to go.
“If only the comandantes in
Nicaragua would make the
same offer to resistance forces

there,” said Ronald Reagan, “we would all
be much closer to true peace in Central
America.” Some U.S. officials were dubious
about Duarte’s gamble. U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering learned of the Salva-
doran leader’s intentions a few days in ad-
vance. Aides to Duarte said that Pickering
wrote a letter to the Salvadoran president,
urging him to approach the rebels through
more traditional diplomatic channels, for
which he promised U.S. support. Picker-
ing’s advice was ignored. “Our analysis is
that we had nothing to lose and everything
to gain,” said a senior Duarte aide.
Two members of the rebel delegation in
La Palma will be politicians: Guillermo
Ungo, head of the Democratic Revolution-
ary Front (FDR), the political arm of the
antigovernment coalition, and Ruben Za-
mora, a member of the “political-diplomat-
ic commission,” which handles all negotia-
tions. Two others will be commanders from
the Marxist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front (FMLN), which consists
of five separate guerrilla armies. The two
sides are far apart on the issues. The rebels
want a share of power in the government
without having to win it through elections;
they claim that right-wing “death squads”
would slaughter them if they laid down
their arms. Last February they proposed a
“government of broad participation,” in
which, among other things, the guerrilla
forces would be incorporated into the Salva-
doran Army. Duarte demands that the reb-
els join “the democratic process,” and he
insists that he will not yield on power-shar-
ing. “Power is not at stake,” he said after a
meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, “because power can only be given
through the popular vote.” But Zamora
hinted that the rebels might be flexible
about their demand for a coalition govern-
ment. “Negotiation,” he said “implies a
flexibility on the part of both sides.”
Duarte understands the power of sym-
bols. His own aides point out that the San-
dinistas scored a diplomatic coup last
month by announcing they would sign the
Contadora treaty. Duarte’s opening to the
rebels pre-empts the Contadora process and
makes him look like a leader who is firmly in
charge of his government. Only five months
into his fragile presidency, Duarte also is
attempting to fulfill a key campaign prom-
ise: to get a dialogue going in a search for
peace. “Duarte has always intended to
make contact with the G’s,” says an Ameri-
can diplomat, referring to leftist guerrillas.
“In his first few months, Duarte has been
conducting an informal dialogue with the
right. Now there is an uneasy truce between
them. He had to accomplish that first.”
How long the truce with the right will last
is another matter. Conservative Army offi-
cers have opposed negotiations with the
guerrillas in the past. This time, they appar-
ently have decided not to resist Duarte, at
least for the time being. But the war now is
being prosecuted by vigorous young officers
who might not stand idly by if Duarte seems
to be thwarting a military victory. The
Army commander in the region that in-
cludes La Palma is Col. Sigifredo Ochoa
Perez, a hard-liner who rebelled against his
own defense minister last year.
Duarte also has to be concerned about
right-wingers outside the Army, including
Roberto D’Aubuisson, leader of the Na-
tionalist Republican Alliance (ARENA),
who finished second in the presidential
election last spring. Last week D’Aubuis-
son warned that Duarte was “playing with
fire.” But most right-wing reaction was
muted. “To touch bases [with the rebels] is
positive,” said a moderate businessman.
“Even my friends in ARENA don’t seem
so upset.”
One reason for the relative calm on the
right is that the war has not been going well
for the guerrillas lately, partly because the
Army is becoming more effective. Last
summer the rebels managed to penetrate the
security at Cerron Grande, the massive dam
that provides 25 percent of the country’s
electricity. Then helicopter-borne govern-
ment troops counterattacked, catching the
guerrillas by surprise and stopping them
from destroying the dam’s con-
trol room. Since the Reagan
administration took office, the
Army and the other security
forces have tripled in size to
about 40,000 men, and the heli-
copter fleet has grown from
fewer than 20 aircraft to
around 60. Increasingly, the
6,000 to 8,000 guerrilla fighters
have been hard pressed to cope
with the government forces.
Duarte’s election was another setback for
the rebels, in part because the new president
has won the support of the U.S. Congress.
The leftist strategy of working for a cutoff
of U.S. aid has failed, and in view
of Reagan’s likely re-election, guerrilla
leaders expect increasing military pressure.
Putting the best face on things, rebel spokes-
men argue that the war is a stalemate —“like
a baseball game in its 20th inning with no
winner,” says FDR official Hector Oqueli.
And Ungo warns that the talks will be a
long process, requiring “continuity and se-

riousness” if the war is to be ended.
After years of military buildup and esca-
lating conflict, other forces in the region
were equally interested in negotiation. “The
Honduran government is opposed to a mili-
tary solution to the Central American con-
flict,” the foreign minister of Honduras,
Edgardo Paz Barnica, told Newsweek in
New York. “I believe that we are reaching
the moment of truth and that each country
has to say, clearly, that it wants a peaceful
solution, or not. Time is running short.”
In little La Palma, time was almost stand-
ing still. The 2,000 villagers were consumed
with anticipation as they prepared for their
expected visitors. Mayor Guadalupe Sosa, a
Christian Democrat like Duarte, spoke
enthusiastically about peace and about
whitewashing the walls. At a roadblock
outside town, a guerrilla responsable called
Polin declared: “We guarantee the life of
Duarte and the lives of our leaders.” At the
Divine Providence Cafe, the owner, a born-
again Christian named Francisco Dubon
Rodriguez, swung in a hammock above the
dirt floor and told a group of visitors:
“There’s been enough bloodshed.’’ Then he
asked: “Do you think the big boss in the
United States is in favor of peace, El Presi-
dents Reagan?” Peace was not yet at hand in
La Palma or anywhere else in El Salvador.
But for once it seemed to be possible. The
thought was poignant and tantalizing.

‘A Move for Peace’
Preparing for truce talks, Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and rebel leader Ruben Zamora talked to Newsweek.
■Duarte on the Negotiations: I have always believed and still
believe that the country’s problems cannot be solved violently,
that the people seek a solution based on justice, on liberty and
the participation of all groups, and that is called democracy.
That is why all of my efforts are and will be aimed at convincing
armed groups to adopt this concept. . .Our position is based on
good faith, and not on whatever tactics happen to be conven-
ient. This is a sincere and truthful [move] for peace.
Duarte: ‘Confront reality’
NEVEU—GAMMA-LIAISON
■On the Rebels: I hope that
they tell me that they are in
favor of incorporating
themselves into the demo-
cratic process and that they
are willing to study the
concepts.
■On Good-Faith Bargain-
ing: [Opposition leaders]
say that what happens in
this country should happen
in front of the people. We
will be facing the people.
Nothing will be hidden. The
people will be there to ex-
press their desire for peace.
■On Negotiation Strategy:
We don’t propose to debate
ideologies or doctrinal be-
liefs. Our proposal is that we
confront the country’s reality, and agree upon what that reality
is so we can then make changes and improve conditions. This is
not the same country it was in 1979. In 1984 the reality is
different. Therefore, any strategy of [the opposition] that is
based on the realities of 1979 is historically off base.
■On El Salvador’s Right Wing: I believe the right has been
undergoing a lot of change. Their view of the country and my
style of government has changed since we took office. And now
we are receiving the support of the economic right, and the
political right—even the military right. [Roberto D’Aubuis-
son, a right-wing leader] is all alone at this moment in time. I
suppose he is playing an old card to see if in the future he can
turn this to some kind of advantage.
■On International Relations: We can’t deny that international
factors exist, but to use my professional trade as an example, in
constructing a building you don’t start on the foundation and
the roof at the same time. You establish a process, and solve
each problem as you come to it, each in its own time and place.
That way the foundation is built; later the roof is begun. What
we are doing now is proposing solutions to structural prob-
lems. The external factors are also important, and that is why
we recently traveled to Europe, the United States and South
America—to make our case at the international level.
■Zamora on the Negotiations: For three years, we have been
talking of the necessity for talks and negotiations. It has not
been possible to hold them because the Salvadoran government
has always refused to enter into them. The difference is that
now the Salvadoran government has agreed to initiate the
dialogue that we have been proposing for three years.
■On die Government: I would like to think that the decision of
President Duarte stems from a dose of political realism in the
sense of understanding that the means for resolving the Salva-
doran conflict is by recognizing that in El Salvador there are
two political, military and territorial powers. It is only by
means of a political solution that it will be possible to bring
back a true social and political unity to El Salvador.
■On Good Faith Bargaining: Our worry is that Jose Napoleon
Duarte may be more interested in a “show” than in building a
genuine, serious dialogue between the two sides.
■On Democracy: We reject the notion that a democratic
process exists in El Salvador. We believe that [one] must be
intitiated in El Salvador without the death squads, without
abuses by the security forces, without the massacres of citizens,
and with true liberty and participation by all Salvadorans. And
in order to begin the building of that democracy, we submit the
need for talks and negotiation in El Salvador.
■On Negotiation Strategy: In order to make a success of this
meeting, it is necessary to come to an agreement on very
concrete proceedings. My fear is that if the Salvadoran govern-
ment does not make a contribution toward preparing the
preliminary logistical aspects, the meeting will not yield all the
positive fruits that we could expect. It is, then, a problem of
trying to obtain the best results from this opportunity.
■On El Salvador’s Right Wing: I believe there will always be a
segment of the Salvadoran extreme right that will oppose any
democratic solution arrived
at through the path of a po-
litical settlement, because
democracy goes against the
interests of these factions.
■On the United States: On
the subject of U.S. support
of initiatives that emerge in
this region, I am extremely
skeptical. They say they
support Contadora, but in
reality they have tried to
torpedo it and impede its
progress. In that sense, giv-
en the policies of President
Reagan and the “support”
he has given in the past, I am
inclined to doubt that kind
of support.

FASHION
Here Come ‘Revealing' Fashions
GEORGE SMITH—VISUALIZING
GEORGE SMITH—VISUALIZING
UPI
Armani's leggy look (leftandfar right), dress by Versace, miniskirt by
Franco Moschino: Excitement —and more than a little controversy
Androgyny is out; femininity is in. Or
will be, if the new creations unveiled by
Italy’s top designers at last week’s Milano
Collezioni take off. In an abrupt turnabout
from last season’s menswear look, the de-
signers’ 1985 spring and summer ready-to-
wear collections displayed a new admira-
tion for the feminine figure. Skirt lengths
were well above the knee, shoulders were
softer and more rounded and waists and
hips were emphasized with wide sashes,
belts or bows. The new fashions are certain-
ly not for everyone. But the designers are
convinced that the worldwide fitness craze
means that women will be ready for clothes
that reveal more than they conceal.
Last week’s collections stirred a lot of
excitement —and more than a little contro-
versy. Some of the scantiest garments were
seen at Giorgio Armani’s show, where the
renowned designer displayed classically tai-
lored men’s jackets over skin-tight mini-
skirts, hot pants and Bermuda shorts. “It’s
time to see legs again,” said Armani. Re-
action ranged from wild enthusiasm
to shocked disbelief. “Beautiful, coura-
geous—his youngest collection ever,” said
one onlooker, while another sniped: “Sur-
prisingly vulgar and unwearable.” The re-
views of the buyers were also mixed. “The
change is too quick: not every woman can
change her wardrobe every summer,” said
Maja Schulze-Lackner, a West German

fashion consultant. Aniko Gaal, a fashion-
merchandising director at a Washington
department store, disagreed. “If the short
skirt is well proportioned with a long jacket
over it,” she said, “it will sell.”
Gianni Versace also favored a short and
sensual look. To music that ranged from a
Bach cantata to Tina Turner’s “What’s
Love Got to Do With It?” his mostly Ameri-
can models came down the runway in nar-
row short skirts and slinky dresses in black
and white, often accented by brighter tones
of green, orange or yellow. Mariuccia Man-
GEORGE SMITH—VISUALIZING
delli, whose Krizia label has just celebrated
its 30th year, won a rousing ovation from the
audience; like Armani, she mixed short
skirts or Bermuda shorts with double-
breasted white and navy blue blazers.
Among the biggest crowd pleasers were
Karl Lagerfeld’s collection for the Fendi
sisters and Gianfranco Ferre’s stunningly
produced show. Lagerfeld’s multicolored
paisley dress, narrow at the hips and with a
solid-color underskirt, was one of the favor-
ites. His eye-catching swimwear drew cries
of “bravo, bravissimo” from the audience.
Ferre’s collection included moderately
short skirts, slim jackets cut longer in front
than in back and baggy pants of silk taffeta
or silk poplin. Making dramatic use of lights
and mirrors, Ferre’s dazzling show won
him the only standing ovation of the week.
The big question is whether the new short
look will catch on. Some buyers think not.
“Women have become used to the comfort
of longer skirts,” said Schulze-Lackner.
“I’ll be buying Bermudas and longer skirts
instead.” But fashion is volatile. It just may
be that the increasing numbers of women
who put in long hours pumping iron and
sweating through aerobics classes will jump
at the chance to show off their svelte figures.
Even if the new designs do fall flat with
customers, last week’s show will probably
leave its mark —at least for the exhilaration
it provided. Said Beppe Modenese, the sec-
retary general of Milano Collezioni: “May-
be the collection is not better than last
year’s, but it is certainly more exciting.”

WORLD BUSINESS
Walter Mondale
Learns a Lesson
Goldman, Sachs's Rubin (left) with the candidate at a fund-raiser: New, ‘practical'views
LARRY DOWNING— NEWSWEEK
Unorthodox executives offer an economic re-education.
It was 1965 when Herbert Allen of the
New York investment-banking firm Al-
len & Co. got a call from a young politician
named Walter Mondale. The Minnesotan
was raising money for his first campaign for
the U.S. Senate and wondered if Allen, a
rare species of Wall Street Democrat, might
be willing to help. Allen offered to meet him
at 6:30 a.m. at a greasy spoon in Mafthat-
tan’s financial district—“figuring,” he re-
calls, “that was a good way to shake him.”
But the candidate showed up, the two got
along famously—and Allen signed on as a
financial backer and friend. “The eggs were
very expensive that morning,” the well-
heeled investment banker says.
Allen has been bringing home the bacon
for Mondale ever since. Now he is just one
of the unorthodox band of businessmen
backing the Democrat for president, even
as most of the staunchly Republican busi-
ness community rallies around President
Reagan. Mondale’s capitalist support
group includes such kingpins as Irving
Shapiro, the former Du Pont chairman,
and Salomon Brothers Inc. chairman John
Gutfreund —but the candidate leans espe-
cially hard on a group of “second tier”
businessmen and entrepreneurs. They have
influenced Mondale’s thinking on the need
to reduce budget deficits and the perils
of high interest rates —even as the candi-
date’s own views were shifting to the right.
His advisers have a phrase for it: the eco-
nomic “re-education” of Walter Mondale.
Sophisticated: The candidate
has a long way to go to re-educate
American business. Along the
campaign trail Mondale still vows
to fight for “the heart and soul of
America” rather than “the bo-
nuses of the Fortune 500.” But
corporate critics say his efforts to
woo organized labor and other lib-
eral interest groups have turned
him into a shameless Monty Hall
of American politics. He proposes
a minimum corporate tax that
would increase rates for compa-
nies in many industries—and
hefty new taxes on the upper-mid-
dle class and the wealthy. But be-
neath it all, according to friends
and aides, is a sophisticated
thinker who as president would be
more moderate on business and
economic issues than his record
and rhetoric would suggest. “He’s
bright, thoughtful and has developed a
good, practical view of economics which I
suspect he may not have had in the past,”
says Robert E. Rubin, Mondale’s New
York finance committee chairman and
management committee member at Gold-
man, Sachs & Co.
The transformation began in earnest
after the Carter administration’s humiliat-
ing defeat in 1980, when the vice president
found himself out of government for the
first time in 20 years. Even then, of course,
Mondale planned to run for president and
started laying the groundwork almost im-
mediately. “He recognized that he hadn’t
worked the business community very well
when he was in the Senate —that he had a
reputation as antibusiness,” says Sha-
piro, a Democrat. Mondale began asking
friends for introductions to “key players” in
business —soliciting not just campaign con-
tributions but knowledge as well. “He said,
‘Teach me about energy’, ” recalls Demo-
crat Dorman Commons, then chairman of
Natomas, an oil and gas company that is
now part of Diamond Shamrock Inc.
Commons invited him to a two-day seminar
for Natomas executives; Mondale, he
says, proved to be “as fine a student as I’ve
ever seen.”
Making Money: Mondale soon had a
chance to put his new learning to use. As a
Washington-based lawyer for Winston &
Strawn, a large Chicago-based law firm, he
played a minor role when a group of oil and
gas companies pushed for a plan to bill
consumers to help pay for a gas pipeline
from Alaska. In 1981 Herbert Allen put
Mondale on the board of Columbia Pic-
tures, which Allen & Co. then controlled;
another Minnesotan, Control Data Corp.
chairman William Norris, made Mondale a
director of the Minneapolis-based comput-
er supplier. Significantly, the man who once
joked that he sought political office because
he “needed the money” was also suddenly
earning more than $400,000 a year. “He got
involved with businessmen for the first time

when he started making money for the first
time,” says one longtime Mondale adviser.
When it came time to draw up his cam-
paign platform, Mondale drew on many of
his new contacts for advice. For the most
part, he has not called on prominent Demo-
crats such as investment banker Felix Ro-
hatyn, or the former treasury secretary and
Burroughs Corp. chairman, Michael Blu-
menthal—a man for whom Mondale is said
to have little regard. In-
stead, he listens to a lower-
brass brain trust of Demo-
cratic businessmen. Some
are part of a Minnesota
mafia of liberal corporate
executives, including old
friends such as Bruce Day-
ton, former chairman of
Dayton Hudson Corp. Oth-
ers are among those consid-
ered the future leadership
of the party: Goldman,
Sachs’s Rubin and Roger
Altman, a former Treasury
Department official in the
Carter administration and
now a senior executive at
Shearson Lehman/Ameri-
can Express. (The two men
were among those invited to
Mondale’s Minnesota home
last July to discuss his plan to reduce the
deficit.) Still others are friends or fund
raisers such as California venture capitalist
Stuart Moldaw. And Mondale, say his
aides, doesn’t hesitate to ring up friends
like An Wang, founder of Wang Laborato-
ries Inc., to discuss a provocative newspa-
per article.
Some of these supporters say they back
Mondale for reasons going well beyond eco-
nomics. A paramount issue, says Altman, is
Allen: Reagan is the radical
JOOK LEUNG
the arms race. “Reagan is a catastrophe in
my view. I have a young daughter,” says
Altman. But others say they back the
Democrat because he is the true proponent
of private enterprise —while Reagan is
merely a pawn of big business. “Reagan
doesn’t seem to understand the impact of
high interest rates” on the dollar and trade,
contends one entrepreneur, William Ar-
manino, who runs an herb and condiment
company based in San
Francisco. Others say only
Mondale will really act to
cut the deficit; Richard
Jenrette, chairman of Don-
aldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Inc., thinks it is Reagan who
has been “acting more like a
traditional Democrat, run-
ning a big deficit and push-
ing growth.” Allen agrees:
given Reagan’s reluctance
to raise taxes and hope that
growth will close the defi-
cit, he says, “Reagan is
the radical. Mondale’s the
conservative.”
If they have a criticism of
Mondale, it is that he hasn’t
done enough to get his real
message across to business.
Walter Shorenstein, a real-
estate developer and Mondale fund raiser in
San Francisco, thinks the Democrat erred
in not stressing that his proposed tax in-
creases would be “temporary,” to be lifted
once the deficits were closed and not to be
used to finance new spending programs.
And one businessman active in Mondale’s
campaign worries that he hasn’t brought
more business people into his closest cir-
cle —choosing instead to work with liberal
economists such as Walter Heller and
George Perry of the Brookings In-
stitution, as well as aides from
Washington. Not even the influ-
ential Shapiro enjoys an intimate
relationship with the candidate;
the 68-year-old former executive
concedes that he wasn’t consulted
before Mondale announced his
plan to raise taxes. But Mondale
apparently “doesn’t see the busi-
ness community as crucial to the
election,” Shapiro adds, “and he’s
probably right.”
Mondale’s toughest task may be
convincing American business
that the reputed big-spending
liberal would in fact curb govern-
ment’s share of the economy. He
would slice that share by more
than half, to about 2 percent of
gross national product; still, even
some Democrats acknowledge
that the Mondale plan is predi-
cated on overly brisk assumptions
of economic growth. But his loyal
supporters insist that Mondale
understands that another Great
Society program would be impos-
sible in today’s world. Now he has three
weeks to persuade voters that having break-
fast with the likes of Herb Allen really has
convinced him that there’s no such thing as
a free lunch.

Settling With the IRS
For $200 Million
The U.S. government has finally won its
biggest corporate tax-evasion case. Two
companies owned by reclusive Swiss oil
trader Marc Rich pleaded guilty last week to
charges that they had illegally concealed at
least $lOO million of taxable income from
domestic crude-oil transactions in 1980 and
1981. In an out-of-court settlement, Marc
Rich & Co. and its U.S. subsidiary, Claren-
don Ltd., paid the government a record $2OO
million in back taxes, interest and fines.
The settlement freed Rich to once again
operate in America —and triggered bonuses
for some U.S. companies. The government
had seized the assets of Rich’s American
unit; once those funds were released, the
parent company repaid a $l3O million debt
to 14 banks. Rich also sold his half of Twen-
tieth Century-Fox Film Corp. (for a report-
ed $ll6 million) to oilman Marvin Davis.
Still, it wasn’t the end of the Marc Rich
affair. Rich and his partner Pincus Green
are wanted on federal charges of tax evasion,
fraud and racketeering. So far, both are safe
from prosecution; they are living in Switzer-
land, which has refused to extradite them.
The government’s only hope now is that the
peripatetic pair will return voluntarily. But
that isn’t likely to happen; a conviction for
racketeering could cost them their business.


The Saudi Petrochemical Push
Refinery in France: The Middle East export drive could spark a ‘bloodbath ’ in Western Europe's petroleum industry
C.F.P.—JERRICAN
A decade ago, the coastline of Saudi
Arabia was a wasteland of salt flats
and sand dunes. Now it hosts two gleaming
industrial cities —one at Yanbu on the Red
Sea, the other 750 miles west at the Gulf
port of Jubail. Pipelines crisscross the
sands, refinery towers punctuate the skyline
and the desert winds carry the voices of tens
of thousands of workers. By next spring, the
Arab kingdom famous for its oil wealth will
have become one of the world’s leading
exporters of petrochemicals, the raw mate-
rials used to make everything from plastics
and artificial fibers to fertilizer, paint and
bicycle tires.
That prospect has shaken Western oil
companies. It has sparked loose talk of a
trade war, and it promises to force sweeping
changes in the global refining industry.
Saudi Arabia’s export blitz will fall particu-
larly heavily on Western Europe, which the
Saudis have targeted as a highly promising
market. The onslaught could not have come
at a worse time. British and Continental
producers are reeling under the effects of
the oil glut. Demand for their products has
plummeted, and many are operating at
roughly half of their capacity. For Europe’s
least efficient refiners, the question is not
how to cope, but whether to remain in busi-
ness. “It’s going to be a blood bath,” says
Rien Waale, the retiring chemical coordina-
tor of Shell International Chemical Co.,
Ltd. “The arrival of exports from the Mid-
dle East will be a shock, and I don’t see any
organized way to absorb it.”
Message: The danger that Saudi Arabia
would use some of its oil and natural gas to
launch an export drive in petrochemicals
has long been apparent. Riyadh, in fact,
signaled that intention as early as 1975,
when it unveiled an ambitious plan to de-
velop its own industry—at a cost of more
than $3O billion. A surprising number of
American, European and Asian firms have
helped the kingdom along. Mobil Corp.,
Exxon Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
Texas Eastern Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and
to shift their operations away from the
products that Saudi Arabia will be export-
ing. But other countries are bracing for a
bumpier transition. In Italy, one of Eur-
ope’s largest petrochemical producers, four
refineries suspended their operations last
month, and the government is considering a
number of proposals for cutting the coun-
try’s capacity. Naphtachimie S.A. in
France and a Spanish chemical company
have closed major parts of their petrochemi-
cal operations, as have Dow Chemical Co.,
Phillips Petroleum Co. and Union Carbide
Corp. According to industry analysts, this
“streamlining” could significantly reduce
Europe’s production capacity by as much as
a third over the next few years.
Adjustments: The Saudis are fully aware
of Europe’s problems, and they are likely
to tread warily. Their greatest concern is
the looming threat of protectionism. “We
will have very serious problems marketing
our products,” says Saudi oil minister
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani. “We will have
to solve these problems with the Europe-
ans, the Americans and with everybody.”
So far, neither Europe nor the United
States has acted to restrict the anticipated
Saudi exports, or to subsidize their own
industries. Most European governments
seem willing to let the market adjust on its
own before they contemplate any interven-
tion that might anger their Middle East oil
suppliers.
As for the Saudis themselves, they hope
to win more favorable status under the “gen-
eral system of preferences” governing trade
in the United States and Western Europe.
Without that status, Saudi petrochemicals
could face duties of more than 10 percent —
charges that would sharply reduce the king-
dom’s earnings. Both the Americans and
the Europeans are resisting that step, largely
for fear of infuriating domestic producers.
In their view, it is one thing for Western
governments not to erect barriers against
Saudi imports; it would be quite another to
go over to the kingdom’s side.

Celanese Corp. are all joint-venture part-
ners at Yanbu and Jubail, even though they
will soon have to compete against Saudi
exports. Indeed, the companies had little
choice but to enter the ventures. Most of the
agreements were struck during the oil-tight
late 19705, and the Saudis made their mes-
sage clear. If Western firms were to have
access to the kingdom’s oil, they would have
to participate in the new industrial projects.
Other oil-rich countries have tried a simi-
lar path to development, but only Saudi
Arabia seems on the verge of success. Its
huge petrochemical complexes have been
built on schedule and with hardly a hitch.
Jubail will begin large-scale production in
early 1985, and Yanbu will begin churning
out products in the second quarter. When
they reach full capacity next year, Saudi
Arabia expects to grab between 4 and 7
percent of the world market.
That share could grow even larger, de-
pending on how aggressively the Saudis
price their products. In this, the kingdom
has an unbeatable advantage. Because its
petrochemicals are made from natural gas
that used to be “flared,” or burned as a
waste product, Saudi Arabia can make
chemicals for roughly a seventh of the cost
incurred by its U.S. and European rivals.
Dr. Abdul Hady Taher, the governor of
Petromin, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil
company, has done little to allay the fears of
refiners who might be undersold. “Our
prices will be as competitive as you can get,”
he said earlier this year. “We [want] our
refineries to operate at full capacity and
make money.”
That prospect, coming on the heels of the
downturn in the global refining market, has
already caused a shake-up in the industry.
Geographic distance and a captive local
market will insulate American manufac-
turers during the new era, but Europe does
not enjoy those natural protections. British
producers are probably best prepared for
the onslaught; most can rely on cheap
North Sea gas, and they have already begun


A Helping Hand for Manila
Robert Tanzola may shortly be the only
auto executive in the world selling rattan
furniture to keep his business alive. For more
than a year, Tanzola, president of General
Motors Pilipinas, has had to scramble for
exportable items to earn the hard currency
he needs to import car parts while the Philip-
pines remains plagued by a foreign-currency
crisis. But currency isn V his only concern:
demand for cars and trucks in the Philip-
pines has plummeted 75 percent this year
alone—and is still sinking. 'We are in
a state of turmoil, ” says Tanzola.
After a year of political and eco-
nomic upheaval following the
assassination of opposition leader
Benigno Aquino, the signs of hard-
ship in the Philippines are every-
where. More children beg from cars
stopped at traffic lights; fewer im-
ported goods can be found on store
shelves. Nearly 300,000 workers in
Manila have lost their jobs since the
beginning of the year. In the sur-
rounding rural areas, the climbing
cost of fertilizer has cut crop yields—
forcing the country to import rice for
the first time in years.
'With the Philippines’ economic
prospects growing bleaker, the coun-
try’s foreign creditors last week final-
ly offered a promise of relief. After a
year of negotiations, a group of the
country’s primary lenders tentatively
agreed to grant President Ferdinand
Marcos’s government more than $1
billion in new credits, and committed
themselves to reschedule nearly half
of Manila’s $26 billion foreign debt.
The International Monetary Fund
also approved a $630 million loan,
pending Manila’s implementation of
its program for economic recovery.
But bankers in Manila say it is one of
the IMF’s most stringent austerity
programs—and one that will un-
doubtedly create more unrest in the
politically troubled country. “We’re
all concerned about street demon-
strations and strikes, and there will be
more of them because of the austerity
measures,” said Trade and Industry
Minister Roberto Ongpin. “But what
is the alternative?”
Tailspin: For years the Philippine
economy has prospered on borrowed
money. But Manila has not made a
payment on its accumulated debt in
12 months, and the consequences
have thrown the economy into a tail-
spin. Foreign credits have dried up.
Foreign currency needed to pay for
imports has all but evaporated. And
the government has had to enact
strict exchange controls, presenting import-
ers like GM with the choice of cutting pro-
duction or buying dollars on the burgeoning
black market. Those controls were lifted
this week, but the value of the peso has
plummeted by almost 40 percent, while in-
flation rages at 60 percent. At a time when
other Asian economies are booming, the
Philippine economy will shrink this year,
possibly by as much as 6 percent.
The IMF and the country’s 483 commer-
Filipino protesters: Not just a question of economics
PHOTOS BY HERNANDEZ—GAMMA-LIAISON
cial creditors are wondering whether Mar-
cos has the political will required to impose
the austerity program. His record has not
been encouraging. Marcos has been accused
of financing a legislative-election campaign
last May simply by printing money—while
continuing to promise that he would tighten
the money supply. And some bankers won-
der whether the president’s acceptance of
the IMF loan conditions was not itself po-
litically motivated: an effort to blunt the
impact of the imminent Agrava Commis-
sion report on Aquino’s assassination.
Marcos has already implemented some
austerity measures, including a 25 percent
cut in government spending. But last week
the pace of reform seemed to click into high
gear. The government announced a
number of tax reforms and decon-
trolled prices on some food items.
Officials warn that prices of essential
imports such as gasoline could soon
jump by more than 10 percent. “We
had better prepare ourselves for some
difficulty,” Marcos warned his New
Society Movement.
Threat: But Manila’s creditors are
pressing for more far-reaching re-
form? that could pose a threat to the
Marcos regime. They want to see
greater accountability in government
policies and genuine efforts to elimi-
nate widespread bureaucratic cor-
ruption. Two prominent targets of
reform are the country’s largest mo-
nopolies, which control the sugar and
coconut industries.
Though Marcos has already begun
to introduce new taxes on the mo-
nopolies and has even taken some
tentative steps toward dismantling
them, progress is slow. Increasingly,
demands from local business leaders
center on a repeal of the president’s
decree-making powers, embodied in
an amendment to the Constitution.
Businessmen and foreign lenders say
that confidence among investors —to
say nothing of the billions of dollars
that have left the country over the
past year—will not return until the
amendment is repealed.
Filipinos view the new IMF agree-
ment as the first step in what will
undoubtedly be an arduous recovery
process. Most Filipinos do not expect
to see an appreciable improvement in
the economy even in the next year.
But increasingly, they have come to
see that politics and the economy are
not two separate issues. That message
was brought to Marcos’s doorstep re-
cently when hundreds of business ex-
ecutives joined 20,000 demonstra-
tors in Manila’s “Parliament of the
Streets,” an act of defiance against the
president. And implicit in that mes-
sage is that reform of one ultimately
requires reform of both.

AIDS: The Saliva Scare
Long before the virus that apparently
causes AIDS (acquired immune defi-
ciency syndrome) was isolated by French
and American scientists last spring, re-
searchers recognized that the deadly epi-
demic was being spread from victim to
victim through bodily fluids. The primary
culprits, these researchers believed, were
semen and blood; but last week scientists
revealed that the AIDS virus has also been
identified in human saliva. Though most
experts say with some assurance that
transmission of AIDS through saliva is an
unlikely route for the virus to take, the
epidemic continues to rage, with more
Risky business: Bathhouse warning in San Francisco
RICK BROWNE— PICTURE GROUP
than 6,000 cases reported in the United
States since 1981. In San Francisco, where
13 new cases were reported in the first
week of October alone, the city took a
dramatic step to stem the spread of the
disease: director of public health Dr. Mer-
vyn Silverman ordered the closing of 14
homosexual baths, bookstores and sex
clubs that he charged were “fostering dis-
ease and death.”
In a study to be published next week in
the journal Science, a team of research-
ers —including the National Cancer Insti-
tute’s Dr. Robert Gallo, who led the Unit-
ed States group that isolated the AIDS
virus—found the virus in saliva samples
from 8 out of 18 subjects who were at high
risk for AIDS. Although the subjects did
not have the disease themselves, all of
them had had intimate contact with AIDS
victims or showed some symptoms of the
generalized illness that often precedes
AIDS and is characterized by swollen
glands, weight loss and fatigue. Interest-
ingly, the virus did not show up in saliva
samples from a group of 20 patients who
did have full-fledged AIDS, probably be-
cause the virus seems to disappear in the
later stages of the disease.
Public-health officials emphasize that
there is no documentation that the deadly
disease is, in fact, spread by saliva; indeed,
nearly all cases of AIDS have been linked to
contact with blood or semen. “Most ques-
tions that are going to be asked, like ‘What if
a gay waiter sneezes on your steak?,’ are
simply not relevant,” asserts Harvard Uni-
versity’s Dr. Jerome Groopman, who
coauthored the AIDS-saliva report. Gallo
agrees that AIDS is unlikely to be spread
through saliva droplets emitted in talking,
sneezing or giving someone a
peck on the cheek. But Gallo
cautions that “heavy” kissing
should not be discounted as a
possible route, since the AIDS
virus is thought to enter the
body through broken skin
(which is common inside the
mouth) and through mucous
membranes —possibly includ-
ing those that line the mouth
and throat.
Partners: In San Francisco
city health inspectors were far
less worried about the saliva
controversy than about the
spread of AIDS through direct
sexual contact in the city’s
large homosexual community.
For the past few months, un-
dercover officials have been in-
vestigating the city’s 30 gay
bathhouses, “bookstores” and
sex parlors. The 14 businesses
ordered to close, explains the health depart-
ment’s Silverman, “have continued in the
face of this epidemic to provide an environ-
ment that encourages and facilitates the
multiple sexual contacts that are an impor-
tant factor in the spread of this deadly
disease.”
Among the unhealthful conditions cited
at the condemned spots were dimly lit
“orgy rooms” designed for anonymity and
contraptions to facilitate anal intercourse
and fellatio with a series of partners. The
businesses involved, declares Silverman,
“show no concern over how dangerous the
activities that are occurring can be.” At
the weekend, only 2 of the 14 sex establish-
ments had complied with the order to shut
down, and some gay activists denounced
the closings, insisting that they were moti-
vated more by political than medical con-
cerns. On the contrary, explained Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, “if you see someone
committing suicide, you try to do your
level best to help them.”

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Holography: Coming of Age at Last?
For years, holography—the process
of creating three-dimensional im-
pressions with laser light—has been re-
garded as an esthetic marvel that was
only potentially useful, largely a play-
thing of the high-tech artist. But devel-
opers are now making it easier and
cheaper than ever to create holograms
for a growing variety of commercial
applications.
The widest use of holography is in
interferometry, a form of stress testing.
In 1964 Dr. Karl Stetson, now of the
United Technologies Research Center of
Hartford, Conn., had been trying to du-
plicate high-quality holograms in
his university laboratory but
found that, to his frustration,
some unknown factor was mar-
ring the images. That factor
turned out to be the vibrations
caused by the air conditioner run-
ning in the laboratory next door.
Stetson had discovered that even
minute amounts of force exerted
on an object show up clearly in
holograms, making them good in-
dicators of stress. By making a
hologram of an object, applying
pressure to that object and then
making a second hologram, Stet-
son found that the stress could be seen as
a pattern of fuzzy black and white “inter-
ference” bands.
Testing Artificial Limbs
Researchers at the New York Insti-
tute of Technology in Old Westbury,
N.Y., are using interferometry in the
development of artificial joints. First,
technicians make “interferograms” of
human thigh bones after stressing the
bone with a 300-pound weight. Then
they repeat the process using a metal
alloy prosthesis. A perfect artificial
joint, one that handled stress like a hu-
man joint, would produce an interfer-
ence pattern similar to that of the bone;
comparing the interferograms serves as a
guide to the prosthesis designers. A set of
five interferomic tests costs about $5OO.
Using holography for such testing has
recently been made much easier by the
development of automated holographic
cameras. Laser Technology, Inc., of
Norristown, Pa., will introduce a holo-
graphic camera later this fall that is only
24 inches long and 8 inches high. The
Holomatic 2000 ($ 15,000) is designed to
inspect pipe joints in nuclear reactors. It
displays images on a tiny television
mounted on the camera. The firm’s larg-
est camera is the model 6100, a 114-ton
monster that can produce a high-quality
image in 10 seconds and is used to test
jet-engine parts.
Giving Depth to Drawings
Interferometry is used throughout the
automotive industry to test vehicle parts.
Soon automobile makers will use holog-
raphy to design parts from scratch. Lee
Lacey, president of Holo/Cad Systems,
Interferogram of guitar at work: Looking for stress
Inc., of Southfield, Mich., has developed
a technique that allows car designers to
create three-dimensional images from
flat sketches. In Image Plane Integral
(IPI) holography, dozens of computer-
plotted drawings of, say, a suspension
spring are combined and projected by an
argon laser. The resulting image is run
through a device called an image transla-
tor, which masks those areas of the
drawings that overlap. Finally, the im-
age is recorded on a filmstrip as a black-
and-white hologram—a three-dimen-
sional picture of a car part that does not
yet exist. Such IPI holography can be
faster and cheaper than building plastic
or clay models. An original hologram
costs $2,000 to $5,000; copies can be
made for less than $lOO each.
H.J. Caulfield of Aerodyne Research
Inc.of Billerica, Mass., has developed a
real-time holographic printer for the
U.S. National Science Foundation. The
printer can be connected to almost any
professional computer system and can
produce holographic prints in minutes.
The printer costs about $50,000.
Engineers use holographic prints to
help design solid objects. Other re-
searchers, however, use holograms pre-
cisely because they lack solidity. GEC
Avionics of Rochester, Kent, is one of
several firms that are using holographic
techniques to improve images called
“head-up displays” for pilots. These dis-
plays project images of constantly
changing information, such as pitch an-
gle and horizon, directly in front of a
pilot’s head. The images allow pilots to
keep their eyes on the sky while checking
on the status of their flight paths.
Scientists had developed head-up dis-
plays that relied on mirrors to reflect
flight information. But the displays did
not give a wide enough field of
view. The Avionics displays place
the data in front of the pilot by
using holograms of mirrors—
amazing images that reflect light
even better than real mirrors but
take up no space. Researchers are
developing such holographic opti-
cal elements (HOE’s) to replace
lenses in optical instruments as
well; HOE’s are already in wide-
spread use in the supermarket
scanners that read prices from the
“zebra” stickers placed on many
food products.
Holograms can also be used to
store information. New Holographic
Design of London has developed a sys-
tem that can make holograms of dental
molds. For dentists who are required to
keep bulky plaster casts of their patients’
mouths for years, holograms offer an
attractive alternative. Not only are they
flat until projected, but holograms are so
accurate that a dentist can take measure-
ments directly off them. The British
Dental Estimates Board is considering
whether holographic dental records
ought to be made official.
Presenting Works of Art
In the future, doctors will probably
use holographic systems to develop
three-dimensional images of patients’ in-
ternal organs. Laser images may also
give robots pattern-recognition capabili-
ty, enabling them to “see.” Holograms
are also likely to be used to help locate oil
deposits and to present exhibitions of
fragile and expensive artifacts and works
of art —while the real things remain safe-
ly locked away,

A slight case
of overkill
THE Royal Australian Air
Force will have a new role if
the approach of Common-
wealth quarantine officers is
taken through to the next logi-
cal stage.
Last week, pigeon breeders
throughout the country were
swooped on and their birds
destroyed.
The reason given was that
there were birds believed to
have been imported illegally
or bred from illegal stock.
The aim, the hapless own-
ers were told as they watched
the gassing of their birds, was
to prevent the introduction of
northern hemisphere diseases
which could decimate the
Australian poultry industry.
Not that there was any evi-
dence of disease in the lofts so
ruthlessly cleared. The raids
were an exercise in caution
planned after departmental
sleuths noticed advertise-
ments for exotic types of
pigeons appearing in pigeon
fanciers’ magazines.
Health minister Neal
Blewett and Primary Indus-
try’s John Kerin have backed
the actions of their officers.
But neither has yet explained
what action will be taken to
stop the migration of the mil-
lions of birds which each year
fly to Australia from Europe
and Asia.
If a dozen or so pigeons
are a threat to the local chick-
ens, what danger must be
posed by the shearwaters?
Perhaps next year’s flights by
Mirage fighters over Tas-
mania will have a real “en-
emy,” and the mutton bird
will be blasted from the skies.
Door remains tragically ajar on rail
IN RECENT months, there
has been a spate of accidents
in New South Wales in which
people have been killed or
injured falling out of trains.
This has evoked a grim
memory for Umina resident
Frank Coleman whose father
was killed in 1961 when he fell
through a railway carriage
door and hit his head on a
dogspike. At the inquest, a
representative of NSW rail-
ways told the coroner that the
railways were proceeding with
a program of installing auto-
matically operated doors on
NSW rolling stock.
What they did not say,
however, was how slowly the
work was proceeding.
When Coleman wrote to
the present chief executive of
NSW railways, David Hill, he
was told that the proportion
of the state’s rolling stock
equipped with automatic
doors had risen from 9 per-
cent to 60 percent.
On the grounds that it has
taken 23 years to equip 51 per-
cent of the carriages, this
means we could expect safer
doors on all NSW railway
carriages somewhere around
the year 2002.
Paradise (Air Nuigini’s in-flight
magazine), October
Toecutter joins the colt
Post-Courier, Port Moresby,
September 6
WEST Australian senator,
Reg Withers, has replaced
Tony Eggleton as Andrew
Peacock’s right-hand man on
the campaign trail during the
coming elections.
Eggleton, the Liberal
Party’s federal director, trav-
elled with Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser during each
of his campaigns. This time he
will be based at campaign
headquarters in the Robert
Menzies Centre in Mel-
bourne.
Withers championed the
cause of Andrew Peacock,
whom he named the Colt
from Kooyong, after he was
dropped by Fraser from the
ministry. Withers has had 25
years of political experience.
He regards himself as having
been schooled by Menzies.
“The Toecutter,” as Withers is
called by friends and foes, can
remember the techniques
Menzies used to bring down
the government of Ben
Chifley in 1949.
If Peacock begins talking
about big government, big
business and big unions, some
time during the next seven
weeks, the explanation will be
Withers’ long memory.
QC’s profile
caught at slip
England’s Tatler magazine
carries in its latest issue a run-
down on the leading Queen’s
Counsel of England, their in-
comes, their skills, their ec-
centricities. The silk on whom
most praise is lavished is
Robert Alexander, an occa-
sional visitor to Australia
where he is also “cleared” to
practice.
Pointing out that Alexan-
der is not a 100 percent win-
ner, the article states that
“Alexander was on the losing
side in the two cases for which
he is perhaps best known out-
side the legal world. In 1977,
he represented the cricketing
establishment in their court
battle against Kerry Packer
Wrong. He represented
Packer against the establish-
ment and scored a momen-
tous victory.


A depleted Age
GEOFFREY BARKER is to
join the ranks of those writers
who have recently left the
Melbourne Age. There is a
strong chance that he will join
the Cain government, co-
ordinating the promotion of
the state’s 10-year economic
strategy. The talent at The Age
is now looking decidedly thin.
Over the past six months
Peter Smark has left for The
Sydney Morning Herald,
Robert Haupt for television.
The Age sports desk has been
decimated, Michael Coward
has gone to the SMH, while
cricket writer Peter Mac-
Farlane and sports editor
Neil Mitchell have been
snapped up by the Melbourne
Herald.
The hole left by Barker
probably will be the hardest to
fill, unless that is, The Age be-
comes a facsimile of Sydney’s
Grannie. It’s a far cry from
the 70s, when the roles were
reversed.
Licences go plastic
VICTORIA has led the other
Australian states in a most
sensible and long-overdue in-
troduction that of plastic
driving licences with photo-
graphic identification.
As from November 1, the
licences will be issued by the
Victorian Road Traffic Auth-
ority, thereby bringing the li-
cence system into line with
overseas practices.
The licences will be credit
card size and will carry driver
details and a color photo-
graph of the holder.
The driver will simply go
along to one of the nearly 100
photo points throughout Vic-
toria, pay the fee, sign the data
card in front of the camera
operator and have his or her
photo taken. The whole oper-
ation should take about a
minute.
Considering the brevity
and simplicity of the thing
makes one wonder why any-
one here took so long to do it
at all. If the other states have
any sense, they should follow
immediate suit.

Crackdown
on a ‘biker’
IN THESE days of high crime
rates and allegations of cor-
ruption, it’s nice to know that
police in Sydney still have
their priorities. Two police-
men last week pulled over
Delma Gilmore as she was
pedalling her pushbike along
Johnston Street, Annandale.
After a short but stern lecture,
they let Gilmore continue on
her way to work at the local
kindergarten. Her offence:
speeding.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
IMAGINE a father bizarre race in
which none of the runners knew
how long the event would be. At a
pre-determined time (unknown to
the competitors), a bell would ring
and first over the line after the
bjpll, would be the winner. In such
a situation, sprinting in an attempt
to open up a lead would be fruit-
less. Position would be more im-
portant than speed.
Backgammon is a little like our
bizzare race, yet many exponents
concern themselves with running
and hitting while their opponents
are gaining position. All too often,
the “the bell rings” and an expo-
nent is amazed at how quickly his
apparent lead has vanished.
Consider the illustration: By
any “race” yardstick, White is
streets ahead. He is to roll and
produces a double 4. What’s the
play? Plenty of choices are avail-
able. White could hit another two
Black blots on B 5 and 88. Then
Black would have four men on the
bar. But is that what White really
wants? This set-up has something
for beginners also the White
blot on Bl goes to W 8 and con-
structs a six-point prime. How
often would that go unnoticed?
At this point, however, White
does not need extra men on the
bar or six-point primes; White
needs to stop Black anchoring
points in White’s home board. As
it stands, all Black needs to cap-
ture White’s 2 point is to roll a 2.
With the first 4, White should
hit on W 2 from W 6. He should
then re-inforce his “builders” by
moving another two fours from
812 to W 5. White needs to capture
W 1 and W 2 and all moves should
be geared toward positioning to
be able to effect that. With the
fourth 4, White should hit on B 5
from 81.

THIS deal occurred in the World
Pair Championship played in
Biarritz, France, in 1982. It is a
startling example of how even the
best players have trouble bidding
or not bidding grand slams.
The statistics are unusually re-
vealing. Only 16 of the 168 North-
South pairs who played the hand
arrived where they belonged in
seven hearts and easily made all
the tricks. It is rather odd that
fewer than 10 percent of the field
managed to reach the best con-
tract on the hand. It shows that
even the mightiest bridge warriors
have Achilles’ heels.
Here is how a US pair, Mike
Passell and Fred Hamilton, bid
the grand slam:
South
14
3<?
4 NT
7<?
North
24
4<?
s<?
They were playing Keycard
Blackwood, a method of respond-
ing to four no-trump by which the
king of trumps is treated as an ace.
In effect, North’s five heart re-
sponse indicated the ace of spades
and king of hearts and that was
about all South needed to know.
Irving Litvack and Roy
Hughes of Canada, using more
natural bidding methods, also got
to the grand slam. Their bidding:
South
14
3<?
50
64
North
24
44
5S>
7<?
North’s four-spade bid was not
a slam try; it simply meant he had
a better than average two-spade
bid. Five diamonds showed first-
round diamond control; five
hearts showed the king of hearts;
six clubs was obviously a grand
slam try and indicated first round
club control; seven hearts was an
enthusiastic acceptance of the in-
vitation to bid seven.
Note that seven hearts can eas-
ily be made but that seven
spades goes down one.
