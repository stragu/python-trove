At BMW we have a definite
attitude to motor racing. We would
rather return from the track with an
innovation than with a trophy.
For to us, every race is an
opportunity to test a theory or improve
a component.
Every car we build for the track
is an experiment in automotive
technology.
And every lesson we learn on the
track we apply directly to our
production cars.
We believe it is this philosophy
that distinguishes a car that carries the
BMW symbol from all others.
For while others regard factors
such as peak performance and
superlative manoeuvrability as
desirable, to us they are absolutely
compulsory.

But perhaps even more impor-
tant than our commitment to research
and technological innovation is our
intrinsic certainty that without
individual brilliance and disciplined
creativity, cars such as the 318 i, the
323 i, 520 i, 528 i, and the 735 i would
never have seen the light of day.
Let alone produce the sheer
pleasure experienced by those who
drive them.
These demands on the creative
capacities of our designers are the
most important reasons for our
involvement in motor sport.
When we are asked what
think about sport we reply:
Thinking is our sport.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Batman’s no fun
The Bulletin is my favorite magazine
and I settle to read it every weekend
with the greatest feeling of pleasurable
anticipation.
I always enjoy Batman’s Melbourne
but I feel that in “The problem of the
Woo Factor” (August 21) he isn’t level-
ling with us. He can’t not enjoy the
“woo factor” in hotels far from home.
The posh pub he can’t remember
with the control panel with a switch to
operate the curtains is probably the
Shangri-la in Singapore. Its rooms in
the Garden Wing are really heavy with
the “woo factor.”
It’s great to feel pampered. You can’t
beat the luxury of relaxing in a foam
bath while watching foreign TV and af-
terwards wrapping yourself in a vol-
uminous towelling robe (you can’t
travel with one). I always souvenir the
shower caps. They’re neat.
As for answering the phone while on
the dunny; well, we travel for new ex-
periences and that’s something most of
us can’t do at home.
Those squash court-sized beds are
another indulgence. We would hate to
have to make them.
No, Batman has disillusioned me. He
would be no fun on a naughty holiday.
He’s far too staid and sensible per-
haps a true Melburnian.

Townsville Qld
Type-casting
My 14-year-old God-daughter, Jane,
was sifting my possessions on the
kitchen table and encountered your
issue (B, August 28) featuring Paul
Keating on the cover.
Jane, no fool and knowing my past
interest in amateur theatrical activities,
asked: “Is that the man who played
Dracula?”

More discrimination
Hooray for James Hyde (B, August 14)
and his remarks on discrimination. As a
female I should point out that I, too, am
a victim of discrimination for I am a
wife and mother who enjoys being just
that. I have worked for many years but
have never felt it necessary to compete
with or imitate males and I am sure the
vast majority of women in this country
would agree when I say I resent femin-
ists who purport to speak for me.
Instead of politicians making in-
formed decisions in the best interests of
“Don’t worry, the wife won ’t be back from her macrame, or
origami, or whatever the hell she’s studying these days”

Meet John Evennett of the Hash House Harriers.
He’s not employed by Dunlop - doesn’t owe us anything.
He just runs a lot because he loves it.
Up to 110 kilometres a week, on the roads and in
the bush. This is what he said.
“The new KT Super is a great all-round running
shoe. It gives terrific support on rough trails. Holds the
foot firmly. And the sole doesn’t clog up with mud and
dirt. On the road, where shock absorption, cushioning
and hard-wearing qualities are so important, KT Supers
are very impressive.
“I’m hard on running shoes. But I can honestly say
that after a tough 250 kilometres of all-terrain running in
new KT Supers, neither of us is any the worse for wear.”
Try a pair yourself. Once you get them on,
like John Evennett, you won’t settle for
anything less than the KT Super.
Not at any price.
Unique ‘Contour Control’ lacing

The evolution continues
Leo Burnett 4.5139.2 R


this country as a whole, government
policy seems to be dictated by the min-
ority groups occupying the parkland
opposite Parliament House.
The average worker in this country
(now viewed as one of “the rich”) seems
to have been set the tasks of providing
enough finance to keep the minority
groups in the manner to which they
would like to become accustomed.
Perhaps a slogan for the “Totally
Typical Australian Party” may well be
“Australian majority an endangered
species.”

Poetry debate continues
Presumably the obscure and bizarre po-
etry in The Bulletin’s Literary Sup-
plement was meant to be enjoyable or
titillating or edifying or something.
Then why weren’t we humble proles
warned to respond with suitable “Oohs”
and “Aahs”? After all, this is 1984 and
we accept already partial newspeak,
doublethink, the growth of slogans and
the debasing of language.
Now we learn from your correspon-
dents that poetry must either change or
stagnate (B, July 31); that apparently we
slept through a renaissance which re-
volutionised poetry and led to its free-
dom from definition and rules (B,
August 7); and that rhythm and rhyme
belong to history, are irrelevant or
redundant and are, it seems, conducive
to insensitivity (B, August 14).
What self-defeating pessimism!
It is like rejoicing at being freed from
the tyranny of laughing or singing or
dancing or eating or loving or living. Or,
again, like claiming that, having expert
news commentators, the tedious old
task of thinking for ourselves has be-
come redundant. And, again, that
having drugs to relieve our distress, we
no longer need the consolation of good
(classical) music as ABC radio seems
to think.
The more science plays God with our
lives and ideology plays merry hell with
our institutions, the more we need the
lyricism of art to restore a healthy bal-
ance between fact and imagery, knowl-
edge and insight, sophistication and in-
nocence, progress and nature.
If we must reflect only contemporary
culture, why not adopt the functional
art of oppressive regimes which special-
ise in the here and now? But if art is free
and timeless, as it surely must be, let us
at least recognise that some modern po-
etry is naked and graceless like a skel-
eton without flesh: an emperor with no
clothes, as Mrs Doolan claimed (B, July
31).
Her uncluttered innocence recog-
nised that significant fact. Her candid
perception and honest nature created
the delightful poem Worry.
G.R. STEWART
Kingaroy Qld
Game’s end?
The new Schools Commission guide-
lines will not “end the funding game”
(B, August 28), clear the state aid mine-
field, blunt the state aid weapon or
throw off the state aid albatross.
The welcome four-year detente or
moratorium will make it possible for
Professor Karmel’s Quality of Educa-
tion Review Committee to get down to
such topics as examinations, discipline,
comprehensive and selective schools
and co-education. Not only do parents
and teachers hold contradictory views
about these things; it is doubtful
whether available research supports any
view unambiguously enough to justify
its imposition as national policy.
The committee’s report (due by next
April) therefore will focus attention on
an issue to which finance is ancillary:
the extent to which governments should
be allowed to interfere in the internal
and professional life of a school its
philosophy, its discipline, its curriculum
and its pedagogy. This is the issue which
really divides the community.
The pragmatic solution as well as
the theoretical one seems to be as
much freedom as possible for parents
and students to choose among a wide
range of schools, state and private.

Few volunteers
I hope the comments by Edward Saw-
yer (B, August 21), the 67-year-old ex-
Japanese PoW who survived the
Horoshima holocaust, ring clearly in the
ears of Australians who have thought it
prime time to establish a Nuclear Dis-
armament Party to run in the forth-
coming federal elections.
Sawyer said: “The strong will always
take what they can and the weak give
what they must.” You don’t have to
look too far into a newspaper these days
for that statement to bear truth.
Just by looking at the average anti-
nuke demonstrator, parading up and
down the streets of our country’s capital
cities, I’m sure if the West did destroy
all its stocks of nuclear weapons and
reverted to conventional warfare these
would not be the people volunteering to
join the armed forces of our nation to
ward off a foreign threat. I think their
faces in the lines to join up would be
few and far between.

Bones reply
Your story “Aborigines: now it is bone
rights,” (B, August 21), will only suc-
ceed in adding to the climate of fear
being created in the community about
anything to do with Aborigines and
their rights.
Your correspondent, Tim Duncan,
has whipped up the worst possible scen-
ario about the future of Aboriginal skel-
etal remains and ignored the govern-
ment’s intentions in the recent amend-
ments to the archeological relics legisla-
tion.
You claim that the Victorian Gov-
ernment put “at risk” collections of
archaeological Aboriginal remains. The
legislation was enacted to ensure pro-
tection of this and all other collections,
to stop comjnercial trading in relics and
to ensure that Aborigines were con-
sulted about the future of their heritage.
While it is true that Jim Berg, who is
a warden under the Act and an Aborigi-
nal representative on the government’s
consultative committees, had supported
reburial of remains, no reburial has yet
been ordered. The Victorian Museum
has decided voluntarily to rebury 14
skeletal remains which are only about
40 years old.
The government has decided to al-
low 12 months to evaluate the Murray
Black collection which is many thou-
sands of years older. The government
has not decided to rebury this collection
and the Aboriginal community does not
have a united opinion on this question.
All views, including the university’s, the
museum’s, academics’ and Aborigines’
will be taken into consideration.
Following the agreement of Mel-
bourne University to lodge the Murray
Black collection with the museum for
evaluation, it is intended that consider-
ation will be given to making the collec-
tion available for scientific reference
material. The museum has established
an Aboriginal Advisory Committee to
discuss scientific access. The govern-
ment recognises the importance of this
and other skeletal collections to the Ab-
original people and to the wider Austra-
lian community. It is for precisely this
reason that we have acted to ensure that
appropriate standards are introduced to
protect them for the future.
I believe the legislation will enable
adequate protection and management
of Aboriginal prehistory, relics and
skeletal remains in a manner which is
acceptable to the Aboriginal commu-
nity who must have the prime interest
and the interests of the wider Austra-
lian community.
EVAN WALKER
Minister For Planning and Environment
Melbourne Vic
(Tim Duncan writes: Mr Walker has for-
gotten that his senior officials told me it


“I know it doesn’t make you feel any
better, Mr Pendleton, but it makes my
job infinitely more bearable”
was never the government’s intention to
impound archaeological relics held by
universities. He also ignores that the
Melbourne University “agreement” was
made under the threat of court action.
As well, the minister so far has declined
to comment on the inferior conditions
at the museum, admitted by museum
officials. There is no evidence that the
collection is better protected for having
been impounded and removed to the
museum. All that is obvious is that those
who want the collection reburied are
those who impounded it and had it re-
moved.

In addition to the commemorative
book, a bronze plaque in memory of
these Australians has been erected in the
Cloisters adjacent to the Roll of Honor.
Research has indicated that official
records available for compilation of the
commemorative book are neither com-
plete nor accurate.
Any information with supporting
documentary evidence stating full
name, organisation/unit in which ser-
vice was performed, dates of service,
place of residence and enlistment and
date and place of death would be of
great value.
Australians must have served in the
following conflicts and died as a result
of this service during the following
periods:
Boer War (October 11, 1899 May
31, 1902); 1914-18 War (August 4, 1914
- March 31, 1921); 1939-45 War (Sep-
tember 5, 1939 June 30, 1947);
Korean War (June 27, 1950 July 27,
1953); Malaya (June 16, 1948 July 31,

I realise that the The Bulletin is not re-
sponsible for the blinkered chauvinism
of its Newsweek colleagues but a 10-
page coverage of the Olympic Games
without even a mention of Sebastian
Coe’s feat in winning silver in the 800 m
and gold in the 1500 m in successive
Olympics has to be the ultimate in

Games failure
The XXIII Olympiad is being hailed as
Australia’s most successful with the ex-
ception of the 1956 Melbourne Games.
Australians should be encouraged and
proud not only of our medal winners
but of the complete Olympic squad
which performed admirably in all
events contested.
Sure, we copped a few hard de-
cisions and one can assume other
countries suffered the same fate. We
may have missed a couple of medal op-
portunities. However, this should not
detract from Australia’s overall per-
formance against top level and, in some
cases, professional competition.
It is an unfortunate fact of life that
novice television and media commenta-
tors indulge in raising the nation’s ex-
pectations to an unrealistic level in the
quest for gold. If one were to assess the
television coverage Australia had to en-
dure, it would be lucky to rate a bronze.
We had John Newcombe blurting his
way through cue sheets and other so-
called experts giving poor com-
mentaries and in many instances little
explanation of sports foreign or un-
known to most Australians. I must say
that I felt tinges of nausea when certain
interviewers tried the patronising “good
buddy” routine on many of our female

Toyota 4 Runner. Run smooth

There is now a 4WD that you the realist
can feel comfortable with, and you the escapist
can go nuts about.
It's not a weekender, it's a 7-days-a-week
vehicle, built to run smooth in the City, wild in
the bush.
The new Toyota 4 Runner is all new. Inside,
you'll find it's sedan comfort, with good space
for five adults, front reclining seats, excellent
stereo, power rear window and power steering.
The only clues as to what you do on week-
ends are the two gear-sticks and the dashboard
altimeter and clinometer that read-off your height

and angle of climb. 4 Runner has
the Toyota HiLux pedigree of a
true 4WD, with a Toyota Super

So if you set off to the milk bar and end up
at Marble Bar, it isn't because you're lost.
It's because you've found the only vehicle

The 4 Runner won't let you down in public,
and won't quit on you in the bush.

as well as informative interviews and
news items. I have always understood
that commentaries were to enhance the

abysmal failures.

Migration problems
I should like to take this opportunity to
lay to rest some of the statements made
by David McNicoll (B, August 28) con-
cerning the immigration program.
My department’s instructions PC 39,
PC 2067 and PC 1002 (the latter was, I
believe, intended by the reference to PC
1102) refer to the handling of family mi-
gration applications in extreme circum-
stances which warrant special consider-
ation. The instructions merely suggest
ways of overcoming the problems
involved in the processing of family mi-
grants in situations such as during the
1983 conflict in the Lebanon. Similarly,
in Vietnam, migration operations are
hampered by the fact that some people
have difficulty in proving their identity
and have otherwise been seriously affec-
ted by the turmoil there in complying
with normal requirements.
Similar provisions for speedy emer-
gency processing have always applied
to migrants and refugees from Europe
or anywhere else where circumstances
warranted it. In this respect I point out
that PC 39 was issued in August 1982,
during the term of the previous govern-
ment.
Mr McNicoll has used a number of
figures seeking to make some point. He
suggests that use has been made of the
freedom of information legislation to
obtain 1983-84 data. I would point out
that all figures except 1983-84 are freely
available in my department’s publica-
tion Statistics Monthly. Mr McNicoll’s
figures appear to be derived by doubling
half-year’s preliminary figures.
Even if the figures were correct (and
they obviously are not), arrivals or ap-
provals data showing relative migration
from Asia and UK and Europe does not
make the point that government policy
is favoring Asians.
I reiterate the point that Australia’s
immigration policy does not discrimi-
nate on grounds of race, ethnic back-
ground or nationality. That the numbers
and proportion of settlers from different
parts of the world vary from time to


time is of itself no indication of bias or
favoritism in application of the policy.
It merely means that more people sat-
isfying the critera laid down are inter-
ested in migration from those regions.
As to the cases Mr McNicoll mentions,
without knowing the details it would
seem that the “intending migrant” did
not have the particular skills which were
unavailable in Australia and that he
might have deprived a qualified Austra-
lian of a job. On this basis, the applicant
would have been refused no matter
what his nationality.
It would also appear, without know-
ing the specifics of the second (“extra-
ordinary letter”) case, that Mr Mc-
Nicoll’s correspondent would have
been asked to sign a declaration that
he/she understood migration did not
confer any special rights of entry upon
adult children. However, adult children
of migrants may apply to migrate to
Australia. Approval is subject to meet-
ing requirements, including a job offer,
family sponsorship and a points assess-
ment. Dependent children do not have
to meet these requirements.
I hope this letter has served to clarify
the true position of the Australian gov-
ernment in the minds of your readers.

Reserves that count
I enjoy reading the investment pages of
The Bulletin, especially articles concern-
ing the fluctuating fortunes of the vari-
ous small mining companies. I have
normally found these to be reasonably
conservative assessments and express
opinions and advice which I endorse.
However, I feel obliged to comment on
the unusual lapse by Pierpont in
describing the gold mine he recently
had the honor to open near
Meekatharra (B, August 21) where
he lumps unspecified tonnages of
measured, indicated and inferred ore
reserves together and then proceeds to
predict an annual profit of $6 million.
By coincidence, Speculator’s Diary in
the same issue also refers only to “gross
reserves” exceeding 10 billion tonnes of
steaming coal.
In accordance with codes drawn up
by the geological profession, I would
advise journalists and investors to look
for statements of measured reserves
within specified grade and depth limits.
Additionally, many other factors inclu-
ding location and infrastructure need to
be considered before getting too excited
about possible production rates and
profit returns.

The Gap Qld
Question of support
The issue of the decolonisation of the
Russian empire raised by Dr L.
Havryliv (B, August 21) made me
wonder how many participants at the
recent ALP national conference who
proclaimed their support for self-deter-
mination for East Timor would support
national independence for Latvia, Es-
tonia, Ukraine and the rest of Russia’s
colonial dependencies?

When you buy something
by Pierre Cardin,
you’re not buying his name
Y>u’re buying his eye.
Everything by Pierre Cardin
bears his name.
Either discreetly displayed as
part of the design.
Or even more discreetly tucked
away where no one can see it.
It doesn’t really matter.
Y)u’re not paying for the name
of this great designer; you’re paying
for his eye.
(And yes, as you can see, he does
have two of them.)
It’s apparent in everything he
does.
Yet how can one man’s talent
continually renew and refresh itself
over 40 years?
After all, he has won the world’s
major fashion awards in every decade
since 1950.
As recently as 1983, he carried
off the gold Thimble for Paris’ most
creative collection.
(It was his third.)
Perhaps the answer lies in the
immense span of his interests.
He is so much more than a
fashion designer.
He designs cars and planes.
He owns Maxim’s in Paris, argu-
ably the world’s greatest restaurant.
He brought a Russian rock show
from Moscow to Paris.
And so it goes on.
And because he stays in such
close touch with so many aspects
of life, his designs are always
contemporary while always retaining
that classic Cardin simplicity of eye.
The result is that anything at all
that bears the Cardin name is highly
distinctive.
And that should be obvious even
to someone with almost no eye at all.


THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Bikie massacre
SIX MEN and a 14-year-old
girl were killed in a shoot-out
between two rival bikie gangs
the Bandidos and the Com-
mancheros at the carpark of
the Viking Tavern in the
south-western Sydney suburb
of Milperra. More than 30
other people were injured.
Police questioned about 500
witnesses who attended a Brit-
ish Motorcycle Association
barbecue and motorcycle
parts market which was in
progress at the carpark when
the massacre began on
Sunday.
Tax pledge
PRIME Minister Bob Hawke
pledged that planned reform
of the tax system would not
lead to higher overall tax-
ation. He told the Confeder-
ation of Australian Industry
in Sydney: “Let me put one
issue to rest. ... We do not
believe that taxation reform
will be to Australia’s advan-
tage if it involves increases in
taxation ... the Labor govern-
ment does not believe that
higher overall levels of tax-
ation are necessary for sub-
stantial reductions in the defi-
cit, for improved equity or for
enhanced efficiency of our
economic system.”
Wright’s switch
THE Leader of the Queens-
land Labor opposition, Keith
Wright, 42, resigned to contest
the seat of Capricornia at the
next federal election. At a
subsequent caucus meeting,
the Labor Unity faction of the
ALP in Queensland also
known as the old guard re-
gained control of the parlia-
mentary party. Its candidates
won four top positions, inclu-
ding the leadership which
went to former deputy Neville
Warburton.
Killer weds
CONVICTED killer Peter
Schneidas, 27, and school-
teacher Josene Gras, 32, were

mum security jail in NSW.

Long Bay Jail warder John
Mewburn, bashed to death in
August 1979.
Stone’s blast
THE retiring head of the fed-
eral Treasury, John Stone, de-
livered a highly controversial
1984 Shann Memorial Lecture
in Perth. He sharply criticised
various bodies and institu-
tions including the govern-
ment, trade unions and wage-
fixing tribunals for econ-
omic and social shortcomings
which, Stone predicted, would
lead to greater crises.
Treasurer Paul Keating re-
jected the charges and argued
that Stone had made them be-
cause he had been embar-
rassed by the success of the
Hawke government’s policies.
THE WORLD
Nuclear agreement
THE 13-NATION South Pa-
cific Forum met at Funafuti,
capital of its tiniest member,
Tuvalu. The gathering ac-
cepted Prime Minister Bob
Hawke’s proposal for a treaty
establishing the region as a
nuclear free zone. The treaty
would ban testing, acquisition
and storage of nuclear
weapons and prohibit the
dumping of nuclear waste.
However, it would leave each
member free to decide
whether it would allow nu-
clear powered and/or armed
ships calling at its port.

Poll boycott
FEWER than 20 percent of
South Africa’s 411,000 In-
dians entitled to vote for their
separate 40-seat House of
Delegates in the new three-
house parliament turned up to
vote. Thousands of those who
boycotted the elections
demonstrated against the new
system which gives the Col-
oreds and Indians some influ-
ence in the law-making pro-
cess but excludes Blacks.
There were bloody clashes
between protesters and
police.


Mission perfect
THE American space shuttle
Discovery with a six-member
crew including a woman
has performed “perfectly”
several tasks during its maid-
en voyage. It has deployed
three communications satel-
lites and later unfurled an
electricity generating solar
sail which stretched more than
21 metres above the
spacecraft. “You’re doing a
great job,” President Reagan
told the crew over the space
telephone.
Killer typhoons
“JUNE” and “Ike” the worst
typhoons to hit the Philip-
pines in 14 years killed some
60 people, made at least
150,000 homeless and caused
an estimated damage of $6
million. More than 100 people
perished in widespread floods
and landslides caused by
three days of torrential rains
in South Korea.
New Israeli hitch
THE month-long Israeli gov-
ernment crisis which seemed
to be solved when Labor lead-
er Simon Peres and Likud
chief Yitzak Shamir agreed to
form a national unity admin-
istration in which each of
them would take turns to
serve as prime minister has
been threatened by a hitch.
It has been caused by op-
position from within inside
the two political parties to
certain provisions of the
agreement.
“No” to Pope
SOVIET authorities rejected
a request by the Vatican to al-
low Pope John Paul or his
personal representative to
visit Lithuania for celebra-
tions marking the 500th
anniversary of the death of
the country’s patron saint, St
Casimir.
Swing to Iraq
THE US-LED arms embargo
against Iran and large-scale
arms sales to Iraq by the
Soviet Union and France
have shifted the balance in the
Gulf War in favor of Iraq, ac-
cording to a study by the US
Discovery lifts off for its maiden space flight
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. In a related move
the foreign ministers of seven
Arab states met in Bagdad to
discuss “ways of exerting
pressure on Iran” to end the
47-month-old war. They
failed to agree.
Third hijack
THE THIRD Iranian airliner
hijacked in two months
landed in Iraq after being
refused permission to land in
Kuwait. It was carrying 195
passengers and 11 crew.
BUSINESS
Mixed results
MAJOR miners enjoyed
mixed results. Silver, zinc and
coal giant MIM Holdings
Ltd’s profit fell 39.2 percent to
$27.2 million in the June year
after experiencing poor com-
modity prices and a rail
freight bill from the Queens-
land government of $86.7
million. Large tax credits
helped lift Peko Wallsend
Ltd’s earnings by 46 percent
to $26.8 million.
Output reversal
THE manufacturing industry
already depressed
suffered an unexpected rever-
sal in output in the June quar-
ter. Output fell 0.7 percent fol-
lowing earlier increases of 3.9,
1.3, 2, and 0.1 percent. Al-
though a large part of the de-
cline was caused by stock run-
downs in the chemical, petro-
leum and coal industries,
there were unexpected falls in
the areas of food, beverages
and tobacco.
Coles’ profit up
RETAILER G. J. Coles &
Coy Limited consolidated its
position among the country’s
corporate leaders by increas-
ing profit 27.9 percent to
$107.6 million in the year to
June 30. Sales were up 14.9
percent to $5.4 billion dollars
placing the retailer ahead of
BHP Ltd for the second year
running. Managing director
Brian Quinn said sales of $6
billion were within reach in
the current year.
Transport majors up
SECURITY and transport
group Mayne Nickless Ltd
threw off the effects of its US
malaise by recording a 20 per-
cent improvement in results
there. Operating profit rose
3.6 percent to $43.9 million on
turnover up 21.7 percent to
$705 million. Another trans-
port major, Thomas Nation-
wide Transport Ltd, pleased
shareholders with a l-for-4
rights issue at a par value of
50 cents compared with the
week’s close of $1.90. TNT
predicted the Trans Freight
Lines loss making North At-
lantic shipping business
would make a profit in the
current year.
Prime rate cut
THE Commonwealth Bank
undercut its three major
trading bank rivals by lower-
ing its prime interest rate
charged to creditworthy cus-
tomers for loans of over
$lOO,OOO by 0.5 percent to
13.5 percent.

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
Election 84 - the mud
stingers are warming up
Australia is facing a long and venomous election campaign. RICHARD
FARMER, together with MALCOLM MACKERRAS, TIM DUNCAN and
DENIS REINHARDT, looks at the state of the parties and the public opinion polls,
AUSTRALIA is set for one of its
longest and dirtiest election campaigns
with smears and outright lies bound to
play a major role. There is an element of
desperation in the Liberal and National
parties. They face an election in
December at which the opinion polls
suggest Prime Minister Bob Hawke will
be returned with a handsome majority.
To turn the tide, the opposition will at-
tempt to link the Labor Party to crime
and corruption in New South Wales,
fears of some Australians about colored
immigration will be played on and Ab-
original land rights will be used to cre-
ate resentment in the white community.
Liberal leader Andrew Peacock will
seek to distance himself from this some-
what seedy part of the opposition cam-
paign. His role will be to try to sell to
the electorate what party advisers call
“the ambush syndrome.” Peacock will
argue that people should not be fooled
by the appearance Hawke gives of sen-
sible and stable government: re-elect
Hawke and there will be a return to
Labor’s traditional big-spending, high-
taxing ways.
The first stage of the Peacock mission
began last Sunday with the showing on
national television of four Liberal Party
commercials. The advertising reminded
pensioners of the assets test soon to be
imposed on them. A Liberal govern-
ment would abolish it. The tax of up to
31 per cent on lump sum superannu-
ation payments was declared unfair. It
too would be abolished. Medicare was
described as expensive. Liberals would
change it to cover all medical expenses
and restore the freedom to choose your
own doctor. The average Australian
family should not be taxed at 46 cents in
the dollar. Liberal will encourage you,
Labor will tax you that’s the differ-
ence.
Peacock was cast in the television
commercials in a very statesmanlike
role. He was pictured looking conserva-
tive and grave. His advertising agency,
Masius, are giving him every chance to
convince the electorate that he has the
stuff of leadership.
It is a risky course. The latest
Morgan Gallup poll has only 37 percent
of those surveyed saying that Peacock is
doing a good job as Opposition leader.
Hawke, by contrast, still has an ap-
proval rating of 69 percent. Asked
during the last two weekends of August
which man would make the better Prime
Minister, 72 percent said Hawke and 17
percent said Peacock.
Peacock obviously has a difficult task
to make up the leeway and it is interest-
ing to compare the Liberal approach of
pushing their leader up front with
Labor’s past practice when they found
themselves in similar circumstances. In
1977 when Gough Whitlam’s popularity
was perhaps even lower than Peacock’s
is today, Whitlam was surrounded with
then ACTU President Bob Hawke and
Labor Premiers Neville Wran and Don
Dunstan. In 1980 Bill Hayden as oppo-
sition leader was portrayed as but one
of a triumvirate, along with Hawke and
Wran, at Labor’s helm.
Peacock has spurned any attempt to
project himself as but one member of
the team. For him this is an all-or-

How governments have fared in the Morgan Gallup Poll
ON THE weekends of August 18-19 and
25-26, ALP support was 50 percent,
while 43 percent (up 1 percent) sup-
ported the Liberal-National opposition,
5 percent Australian Democrats and 2
percent other parties.
If the Senate election had been held
the ALP would have obtained 46 per-
cent. The Australian Democrats and in-
dependent candidates would have held
the balance of power.

Malcolm Mac Fie: A high profile for Hawke
KEVIN BROWN
nothing campaign that is bound to see
him replaced by John Howard unless he
proves the opinion polls substantially
wrong. In his favor is an obviously very
full Liberal Party campaign fund. Be-
ginning a television advertising cam-
paign three months before the likely
polling date is an expensive business.
Political parties have thought about
long campaigns before but rejected
them on the grounds of the expense.
Labor are certainly not planning
such an early start. Even with the advent
of public funding, they are not so flush
with funds that they can start spending
yet. The party’s campaign
committee met in Canberra
on Monday to consider the
basis of the government’s
campaign. Its pollster, Rod
Cameron of ANOP, will be in
the field this weekend to
gauge if there have been any
substantial changes in public
feeling since the budget was
brought down a fortnight ago.
Cameron, and his associate
Margie Gibbs, play a major
role in Labor’s campaign
strategy. They use interviews
with small groups of swinging
voters to determine attitudes.
It was Gibbs, for example, in
the last campaign who sensed
the lack of credibility that
Malcolm Fraser had with his
advice for people to put their
money under the bed. She was
the inspiration for Hawke’s
retorts that there was no room
for money because the com-
munists were already there.
The Liberal Party place a
similar reliance on such quali-
tative research. The party has hired sev-
eral organisations to survey for them
but unlike the Labor Party, which relies
on Cameron for interpretation, the Lib-
erals do this work themselves. David
Morrow, a former member of Peacock’s
staff, has the task this year and he has
identified the gap that exists between the
trust of Hawke and of the Labor Party.
As a result, the next stage of the Lib-
eral Party’s above ground campaign will
centre around trying to scare people
into believing that a second Hawke gov-
ernment will introduce a capital gains
tax, a wealth tax, gift and death duties
as well as higher income taxes. The peg
on which this charge will be hung is the
indiscreet suggestion by Science and
Technology Minister Barry Jones that a
budget three months before polling day
was not one in which the party could do
the things it might want to. This state-
ment was like manna from heaven for
Noel Delbridge, the creative director at
Masius who has now worked on some
20 federal and state election campaigns.
Delbridge, who devised the OTC
“memories” advertising campaign
which worked so effectively in 1977 and
the wealth tax campaign which
snatched a last-minute victory for
Malcolm Fraser in 1980, will be looking
for something sensational again this
year. The Liberals need it with the latest
Morgan poll showing Labor’s vote half
a percent higher at 50 percent than it
was at the last election.
What the Liberal advertising agency
will not be working on is the crime and
corruption and immigration parts of the
party campaign. These underground el-
ements will be left to the politicians. The

position of High Court judge Lionel
Murphy and allegations of impropriety
on his part are one way of trying to cre-
ate a climate linking Labor with corrup-
tion. Opposition members also have
high hopes that the tabling of the final
report of the Costigan Royal Commis-
sion later this month will lay Labor
open to charges that it is soft on or-
ganised crime. The Stewart Royal Com-
mission report into drugs and the
Nugan Hand Bank report due this year
is seen as another potential embarrass-
ment for Labor given that some Labor
politicians were interviewed by the
Commission. Hawke himself
is likely to face questioning on
a successful appeal by a
daughter on a conviction for a
minor drug offence.
Publication of a book by
David Combe on his life with
the Labor Party is hoped by
Liberals to provide further de-
tails of a visit by Combe
and Hawke to a restaurant
allegedly owned by a Mafia
figure.
The Labor Party will try
and keep Hawke on the high
ground, talking about the suc-
cess of his economic policies.
Derek Hansen and Malcolm
Macfie from Labor’s adver-
tising agency need have no
hesitation in featuring Hawke
in all their commercials. But
their aim this time will be
different from past cam-
paigns. Rather than having as
their first objective the reten-
tion of Labor voters, they will
be looking for ways to poach
away traditional Liberals. □


THE LIBERALS
Pall of gloom
hangs over
state Liberals
Opposition leader Jeff Kennett: problems in his division
By TIM DUNCAN
THE VICTORIAN division of the Lib-
eral Party is in extremely poor shape. It
faces a federal election in three months
and a state poll inside six months. Those
inside the party who know the nature of
the animal it faces are deeply
disillusioned. They doubt
whether the party as con-
stituted has even the faintest
hope of matching the ALP
and they expect defeat in both
forthcoming elections.
They summarise the bleak
Victorian outlook in wholly
negative terms pointing out
what they see as fatal
deficiencies in local branches,
in policy formation, in candi-
date pre-selection, in research
capacity and in communica-
tion between party organs. As
they see it, any flaws in the
federal parliamentary leader-
ship of the party are entirely
overshadowed by more fun-
damental weaknesses in local
organisation.
The criticism comes from
two groups, now in touch with
each other; one includes for-
mer ministers and support
staff of the Fraser government
and the other includes
younger former student lead-
ers who learned their politics in battles
with the student left over the control of
the Australian Union of Students.
“The branches have no comprehen-
sion at all,” one of the latter told The
Bulletin.
“Ninety-nine percent of them still
live with the view that power is only an
election away. They have no idea about
the labor movement and how well or-
ganised it is. Their branch meetings are
almost wholly apolitical ... there is no
debate. The only conclusion you’ll get
after a meeting is something like, ‘What
a good chairman’.”
John Elliott: a new development
It seems that tea and cakes in the
Victorian Liberal Party has become a
substitute for politics. Wives in the
branches are still asked to bring a plate
and time is allocated to the next fund-
raising wine-bottling and to the formal
detail of correspondence and minutes.
Even at the level of the Victorian
state council, the Liberal Party seems
unable to get a grip on the important
issues of state and federal politics. One
former Fraser government minister told
The Bulletin that the July council meet-
ing was drowned by organisational de-
tails. As a result, he said, nothing was
debated.
Even John Ridley, state director of
the Liberal Party, admits the problems.
“You’ve got branches shooting stuff
straight into council when it should
have been canvassed maybe at an area
conference and probably at a policy as-
sembly. You’ve got an agenda which
we’re not controlling. That’s not just a
view from me as state director. The
branches are saying that as well. People
at July council were saying, ‘Hey, we’re
wasting our time’.”
Ridley is not one of the behind-the-
scenes critics. He thinks that the
Victorian division is well poised to win
back ground at both elections. But
Ridley has held his job for only six
months, after a six-month gap last year
when the division had no director at all.
In effect, the division secretariat is still
trying to organise itself. It is still unable
to reinforce the state parliamentary
party with research staff.
Organisational gaps in the state par-
liamentary Liberal Party match those
evident elsewhere. During the whole of
the long winter recess the state
Liberals were bereft of a re-
search economist. When con-
tacted by The Bulletin recent-
ly, Opposition Leader Jeff
Kennett’s staff said that they
had just hired one, he would
be turning up soon but they
did not know his name.
One of the most telling
flaws, according to the critics,
is the inability of the Liberal
Party to match the training
that the Labor machine gives
its newly recruited activists.
The branches, critics say, are
simply not able to debate poli-
tics along ideological lines
and Young Liberals are even
worse, functioning as mar-
riage bureaus for late
teenagers; “a giant singles
bar,” according to one source
who says he was driven out of
the group because he tried to
organise within it campus-
style anti-socialist cells.
“The Young Liberals are
completely naive politically;


POLITICS
The litmus
test on new
boundaries
THE NEW Victorian seat of
Dunkley, taking in Frankston,
Mount Eliza, Mornington,
will be the litmus seat at the
forthcoming federal election
if, as is highly probable, the
initial recommendations of
the Electoral Commission are
upheld following appeals.
The accompanying pendu-
lum shows the position with
the proposed maps in which
only three seats are un-
changed in boundaries.
Dunkley needs a swing of
3.2 percent to fall to the Lib-
erals, so we can say that it
needs an overall swing of 3.2
percent to put Labor out. On
the old boundaries it required
a swing of 2.3 percent.
On the pendulum, Labor
notionally has 88 seats, a ma-
jority of 28 seats, compared
with 25 in the present House.
There are a huge number
of marginal seats. So if, for
example, there was a swing of
only 1 percent to Labor, the
majority held by the Hawke
Government would rise to 40.
Deakin, Petrie, Tangney,
Fadden and Calare are
marked with asterisks. The
explanation is that seats bear-
ing those names have Labor
members in the present house.
It seems likely that only one
of those members will re-con-
test his old seat. Deane Wells,
Labor member for Petrie, will
again run in that seat. He
needs a 0.5 percent swing to
Labor to hold the seat.
Labor members for the
other seats with asterisks are
looking for seats with a better
Labor vote.
A number of safe con-
servative seats will see con-
tests between the Liberal and
National parties. The fact that
certain seats are marked Lib-
eral is a reflection of the 1983
vote. I do not deny that those
seats might go to the National
Party. □

they are not interested in policy, do not
know how to organise numbers and do
not see the virtues of factionalising.”
The Young Liberals, however, have
great influence within the division.
Whenever the Liberal Party appears
to be in trouble, the call usually goes out
that the party needs to recruit
businessmen for parliament. One new
development in the party is the 500
Club, organised by Elders-IXL chief
executive John Elliott. But the hard
heads among the critics are not sure that
business necessarily provides a better
training for politics than does the social
agenda of the Young Liberals. This,
they say, is apparent in the way
businessmen handled the economic
summit last year: Unskilled in political
organisation, the corporate czars were
“outfooted” into accepting the terms of
their ideological opponents.
In any case, even if the business com-
munity were able to put forward a
couple of candidates, there is no guar-
antee that pre-selection in safe seats
could be found for them. The Liberals,
unlike the Victorian ALP, are unable to
get good candidates into parliament
quickly. The core of the Cain govern-
ment front bench all came into parlia-
ment having established themselves out-
side as professionals. People such as this
would not get into the Liberal benches
first because the party is reluctant to
dump sitting members and second be-
cause there are no longer any obvious
power brokers within the Victorian div-
ision who can protect good candidates
from the capricious decisions of the lo-
cal branches.
The activities of the branches have
become a major drag on the Victorian
division. One source suggested that the
drag would remain until the incentive
system in the party changed. The argu-
ment is that branches can only offer am-
bitious recruits the position of state
council delegate. But because a branch
can send only one man and one woman
to council, an incentive for established
members is to keep the branch small.
The number of branches in the div-
ision is stable while the number of mem-
bers has been falling. Another result has
been to mitigate against any branch
developing as a major centre of political
activity. This may also help explain why
the party in Victoria has not been at-
tracting community leaders and why
Melbourne’s enormous migrant popula-
tion has stayed away.
There seems to be a dawning aware-
ness in some circles that the Liberal
Party in Victoria is in deep trouble but it
has taken a term in opposition at the
state level for the reality to trickle
through. And, during that time, no or-
ganisational changes have taken place
beyond some decorative pre-selection
innovations. □
QUEENSLAND
Hawke seeks
Mr Wright to
hold the line
Prime Minister’s choice: Keith Wright, packing last week
By DENIS REINHARDT
PRIME MINISTER Bob Hawke is
gambling that former state parliamen-
tary leader Keith Wright will swing the
balance in Queensland against a federal
seats redistribution there which is gener-
ally unfavorable to the Australian
Labor Party.
Labor holds 10 of the present 19
seats but the charges will take the total
up for grabs to 24 and “we could go as
low as 10” of them, a party official con-
fided to The Bulletin.
The first approach from Hawke to
Wright to join federal politics came at
the party’s national conference, says the
man who stepped down last week after
22 months as state Opposition leader. It
was a passing comment but followed up
on August 21 by Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden.
Hayden was calling from Hawke’s
office.
After a few civilities, Hayden passed
the phone to Hawke who pressed home
the invitation.
According to the Hawke strategy,
Wright should not only hold the seat of
Capricornia centred on Rockhamp-
ton, an area which Wright has repre-
sented at state level for 15 years but
also help secure the marginal new, adja-
cent, seat of. Hinkler which is centred on
Bundaberg.
Wright’s personal popularity also
will be deployed in a bid to wrench
Dawson, further north, from the Na-
tional Party and his media skills may
see him performing on a broader stage.
Hawke did not bother to tell party
officials in Brisbane of his summons to
Wright. They learned about it almost a
week later, some from daily papers.
Dr Doug Everingham, a former fed-
eral minister and the member for
Gapricornia for all but two years since
1969, had announced his retirement
three days after that second Hawke offer
to Wright. But he says that Hawke did
not “lean” on Everingham.
“As soon as it became known that
Everingham wouldn’t be standing
again, my phone ran hot with people
wanting me to stand,” said Wright who
declared that he would be happy
enough “as a backbencher under Bob
Hawke.”
The changeover also should give
Hawke a slightly more comfortable ride
in caucus. Wright is a tentative Centre
Left faction adherent whereas
Everingham is Socialist Left.
Although Hayden acted as an inter-
mediary, he chose not to brief fellow
Centre Left leaders in his own state -
arguing later that it was up to Hawke to
do so.
But Hayden’s faction was the prime


casualty. While theoretically in control
of the state branch, its principals stood
by helplessly last week as Labor Unity
a direct descendant of the old guard
grouping of Trades Hall figures filled
the party’s key parliamentary positions.
It ensured that Wright’s deputy, Neville
Warburton, was elected unopposed as
the seventh Labor opposition leader in
Queensland since the party lost office in
1957.
Warburton tried to play down fac-
tional rivalries.
“I’m a person who’ll respond to reas-
onable requests,” he told his first press
conference when asked whether he
might allocate some of the more import-
ant shadow portfolios to members of
the losing faction who are generally
younger, more articulate and better-
educated men.
Warburton (52) sponsored the return
of one of his predecessors, Tom Burns,
as deputy.
Wright, 42, denied any suggestion
that he was another loser in the fray
with Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen
(who could be prompted by any insta-
bility in his opponents’ ranks to call a
premature state election).
“I hold Hawke in the highest esteem.
It’s vitally important that we hold all
our Queensland seats,” Wright told The
Bulletin.
He had already confronted his state
caucus about the embarrassing loss of
the Stafford by-election.
That result, on August 4, saw
Queensland’s Liberals clamber out of
the grave and recapture a seat Labor
won at last year’s general poll. One
Labor frontbencher wryly observed that
the Canberra move was “like sticking
your thumb out and a Rolls-Royce pull-
ing up.” □
THE LAW
Stopping inquiries by kangaroo court
By MALCOLM TURNBULL
ANY INQUIRY into allegations con-
cerning High Court judge, Justice
Lionel Murphy, should proceed in ac-
cordance with the principles of natural
justice.
The great many inquiries which have
besieged our political life in recent
times have not always proceeded in ac-
cordance with these principles and it
would be well to consider at this stage
what those principles of natural justice
are.
In 1966 England’s Lord Justice
Salmon wrote a royal commission re-
port on tribunals of inquiry. It was an
investigation of the way in which tri-
bunals of inquiry had been used in Brit-
ain and how they should be used. The
report, a very slim one, is extremely
valuable in the principles it sets out.
Salmon is very conscious of the damage
to reputations and privacy that public
inquiries can involve and therefore rec-
ommended strict compliance with what
he describes as “cardinal principles of
justice.”
The six cardinal principles of justice
which must be “strictly observed” by
any inquiry are:
1. Before any person becomes involved in
an inquiry, the tribunal must be satis-
fied that there are circumstances
which affect him and which the tri-
bunal proposes to investigate.
This requires the tribunal to make a
preliminary private investigation of the
facts recognising that any public investi-
gation into a person or any public cross-
examination of a person is likely to do
his reputation considerable harm and it
is only in circumstances where there is a
real likelihood that his evidence is going
to be of assistance to the inquiry that he
(or she) should be examined publicly.
There appears to be a school of thought
among some members of parliament
that whenever an allegation is made
against a government minister, no mat-
ter how reliable or unreliable the nature
of the allegation, there should immedi-
ately be a full public inquiry. In accord-
ance with Salmon’s suggestions, there
should be a private investigation first to
consider whether sufficient evidence
exists to involve that person with the
alleged wrongdoing and justify a public
hearing.
The second cardinal principle is:
2. Before any person who is involved in
any inquiry is called as a witness, he
should be informed of any allegations
which are made against him and the
substance of the evidence in support of
them.
This is a fundamental prin-
ciple of justice and it is sadly
one that was almost invari-
ably ignored by Costigan and
his royal commission. Indeed,
Costigan went to court to as-
sert his legal right not to give
persons summonsed before
him particulars either of any
allegations that may be made
against them or even of any
questions that would be asked
of them. Once again, there are
two schools of thought on this
point. My view and, I
would think, that of most law-
yers is that it is quite unfair
to put people in the public
witness box without giving
them proper notice of the
matters on which they are go-
ing to be questioned. The
whole common law system
has for centuries operated on
the basis of giving parties to
litigation adequate notice of
the matters at issue. An accused is pre-
sented with the entirety of the prosecu-
tion case at the committal hearing. In
civil litigation, a system of pleadings
discloses before the hearing the matters
that are at issue.
On the other hand there are those
who take the view that the best means of
ascertaining the truth in any of these in-
quiries is to bring people, preferably
without any legal representation, into
the witness box and to ask them a series
of surprising questions the idea being,
no doubt, that they will break down and
confess to something. This is wholly
unrealistic. The villains know what they
are likely to be questioned about: It is
the innocent who are likely to be sur-
prised and whose faltering, uncertain


and inadequate answers will be inter-
preted as indicating some sort of guilt.
The surprise technique is certain to en-
sure that a second trip to the witness
box will be required.
The third cardinal principle is:
3. (a) He should be given an adequate
opportunity of preparing his case and
of being assisted by legal advisers.
(b) His legal expenses should normally
be met out of public funds.
There has been a practice with some
recent inquiries to summons people to
give evidence at short notice and not to
give particulars of the matters on which
they are likely to be questioned. It there-
fore becomes quite impossible to pre-
pare the case properly and equally im-
possible for the legal advisers to give
sensible advice, as they are not apprised
of the matters on which the witness is
likely to be questioned. Further, it is
very unusual for the legal expenses of
parties to royal commissions or inquir-
ies in Australia to be met out of public
funds.
The fourth cardinal principle is:
4. He should have the opportunity of be-
ing examined by his own solicitor or
counsel and of stating his case in pub-
lic at the inquiry.
This is very rarely available to par-
ties to inquiries in Australia.
The fifth cardinal principle is:
5. Any material witnesses he wishes
called at the inquiry should, if reason-
ably practicable, be heard.
This is generally available in Austra-
lia and many parties have called
witnesses to give evidence in support of
a particular position or other.
The sixth cardinal principle is:
6. He should have the opportunity of tes-
ting, by cross-examination conducted
by his own solicitor or counsel, any
evidence which may affect him.
This is possibly the most important
of the six cardinal principles. It is sad
that it is rarely followed in Australia.
The Senate committee which examined
the conduct of Justice Murphy has not
granted him the opportunity of cross-
examining any persons giving evidence
against him. Therefore, Murphy is un-
able through his legal advisers to test the
evidence.
Royal commissions deny this right in
a slightly different way.
In the Costigan royal commission a
great deal of evidence was
given in private session.
Often the evidence was
given concerning persons
who were not permitted to
be present during the pri-
vate hearing and were not
given access to the tran-
scripts of that confidential
evidence. Accordingly,
parties to the Costigan
Royal Commission faced
the situation where they
had reason to believe con-
fidential evidence was be-
ing given on matters which
touched them but they
were nonetheless unable to
ascertain what that confi-
dential evidence was and
were unable to be present
so that they might test the
veracity of that confiden-
tial evidence.
The practice in Britain
since 1966 has been to fol-
low the Salmon recom-
mendations with respect to
all inquiries. It is extraordi-
nary that in Australia, a
country which owes so much to the
English legal tradition, we have consist-
ently failed to comply with all but one
of those six principles.
Apropos of Murphy’s problems, it is
worth noting that ever since a share-
trading and tender scandal in 1912, par-
liamentary committees have not been
used in the United Kingdom to investi-
gate allegations of wrongdoing on the
part of public figures.
Salmon concluded that to go back to
using select parliamentary committees
of inquiry “would in our view be a
retrograde step.” Salmon continued:
“We of course recognise that there are
many purposes for which select parlia-
mentary committees are most useful
and indeed indispensable but the in-
vestigation of allegations of public mis-
conduct is not one of them. Such mat-
ters should be entirely removed from
political influences.” □
CONSERVATION
Daintree dispute
triggers search for
rainforest policy
Protesting, Daintree style
By ANTHONY HILL
WHILE IT IS now virtually certain that
the Federal Government won’t, or can’t,
intervene in the dispute over the
Daintree rainforest in north Queens-
land, the first tentative steps have been
made towards developing a national
rainforest policy.
Last month, a dozen people repre-
senting a range of interests, from con-
servationists to the Queensland Govern-
ment, sat round a table in Brisbane to
look at some of the issues. It was the
first meeting of the working group on
rainforest conservation, established by
Home Affairs and Environment Minis-
ter Barry Cohen to prepare a series of
recommendations to the Federal Gov-
ernment.
It took Cohen some six months to get
that far he first floated the idea last
March. The next meeting is due late in
October, by which time the working
group will have some idea of how it will
proceed.
At this stage, it seems likely that it
will break up into a series of smaller
working parties to consider some of the
specific uses of the remaining
rainforests ... such as tourism, conser-
vation and the timber industry. But it
will not involve itself in the battle be-
tween the conservation movement, the

The Nation.
British made “Oberon” class submarines in
service with the Royal Australian Navy have
demonstrated that there is no real substitute for
a first-rate submarine:
□ one that is very, very silent, that can get in
close, undetected, to fight when called upon
□ one that’s in the water, working, with a
confident and professional crew, backed
up by guaranteed “through-life support”-
no ifs or buts
□ one that has unquestioned access to the
very best weapons systems in the world-
now, and for update in 10 or 20 years.
For the future, British ShipbuildersA/SEL are
building a new generation of submarines-the
2400-in the same tradition of excellence.

under construction at Barrow

The blockade on the Bloomfield Track in the Daintree national park
THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY
Queensland Government and the
Douglas Shire Council over the road be-
ing built to Cape Tribulation through
the Daintree rainforest.
Despite moves within the ALP cau-
cus to stop the road being built through
Bkm of the Daintree rainforest, Cohen
has been advised that his power to do so
is limited.
While there are powers to declare an
area of unique and natural beauty, he’s
been told they’d be unlikely to with-
stand a High Court challenge from the
Queensland government.
Unlike the Franklin River case,
when an extensive area of the Tas-
manian wilderness would have been
flooded, it would be difficult for the
Commonwealth to prove “irreparable
damage” with the Daintree road.
While the Wilderness Society, for
example, says that the federal govern-
ment has the power to stop the road
under its World Heritage power, in fact
Cohen’s advisers say that it does not. A
World Heritage area can only be
declared by UNESCO and the world
heritage committee of that body will not
meet until November next year.
According to Cohen’s staff, it will be
some time before the government is
ready to forward a recommendation to
UNESCO about the Daintree rainforest
by which time, of course, it will be too
late to stop the road.
Cohen sees more significance in the
fact that he has at last been able to get
the many interests involved in rtie
rainforest issue to start talking to each
other.
The working group originally was set
up to look at policy for the tropical
rainforests of northern New South
Wales and Queensland but following
moves from Victoria and Tasmania, the
temperate rainforests of those states will
apparently also be involved. □
FASHION
New Qantas
uniform still
on the runway
By GLENDA THOMPSON
NONE OF Australia’s dress designers
has come up with a look that Qantas
wants for its new uniforms. However,
the airline’s board has chosen Trent
Nathan to work with it to develop a
suitable design.
The multi-million-dollar contract
will change the image of 3500 cabin and
counter staff initially and be extended in
some form to 7000 ground and technical
crew.
Nathan was selected from a short list
of eight design teams gleaned from a
national competition, on the advice of a
specialist judging panel.
Nathan was in Italy when the news
reached him. What his designs are is not
known, although he told The Bulletin
last March that he favored a return to
1940 s elegance.
The unsuccessful submission by
Erich Saikovski and Ken Done featured
a tiny kangaroo print on shirts and big
Done prints on dresses.
Another joint effort, by George
Gross, Robert Burton, Jenny Kee and
Covers’ Marilyn Said and Barry Taffs
cheekily called Qantas
Fashion Team offered
“high-class and sophisticated,
vivid blatant prints.”
Sportscraft’s national sales
manager, Mike Hayes, said
his firm’s design had used
royal blue with red. Country
Road’s spokesman was out of
reach.
Peter Weiss would say only
that he hoped Qantas had
chosen “something strong
enough to do justice to our na-
tional flagship.”
Linda Jackson designed
fine wool knits with stylised
red triangles up the middle on
grounds of turquoise, magen-
ta or indigo, a lightweight
Drizabone in red or black and
matching Akubra hats.
Carla Zampatti, the other
finalist, was impressed with
the calibre of the judges
headed by “evergreen” Emilio
Pucci. Pucci’s dresses, de-
signed 10 years ago, are still the female
flight attendants’ uniforms. This time,
Qantas is aiming for something to last
five to seven years.
Australian-born John Truscott, who
designed sets and costumes for the film
Camelot and for Paint Your Wagon, was
another judge. He is the new Victorian
Arts Centre interior design consultant.
The rest of the panel was Tony Lunn,
whose firm is responsible for the new
Qantas “corporate identity,” Norman
Ellsworth of the American industrial
designer Walter Dorwin Teague Associ-
ates which develops cabin interiors for
new aircraft, and June McCallum and
Nancy Pilcher of Vogue Australia.
Forty-three designers showed initial
interest in the prestigious job and the
eight finalists were selected from 27 who
submitted working ideas. □

ABORIGINES
The embattled
Clyde Holding
continues fight
Minister Clyde Holding and department head Charles Perkins: problems to surmount
NEWS LTD
By FIA CUMMING
ABORIGINAL Affairs minister Clyde
Holding finds his hands are tied against
growing fears and misconceptions in
the community about Aboriginal land
rights. Despite his wish, there will be no
public awareness campaign on the issue
until at least next year.
Holding applied three months ago
for funds for an advertising campaign
outlining the principles of the proposed
uniform land rights legislation. The
cabinet sub-committee on government
advertising, chaired by Special Minister
of State Mick Young, said Holding
would have to provide detailed research
on community attitudes to land rights
and the sort of campaign that was
needed before it could give the go-
ahead.
The committee did not want to ex-
pose the government to charges of ex-
travagant spending or government
propaganda, especially in an election
year. As a result, Holding’s department
is working on a research project but it
will not be completed in time to mount
the campaign before the election.
For Holding, the setback is a frustra-
ting one that leaves him vulnerable to
further attacks from both sides of the
land rights debate. The National Abor-
iginal Conference has lashed him pub-
licly for failing to defend Aborigines
against racist anti-land-rights propa-
ganda and last week the National Farm-
ers’ Federation accused the government
of encouraging irrational public dis-
cussions through “indecision and fence-
sitting” and failing to make a clear
statement of its position.
At the same time, the question of
public awareness has caused a serious
rift between Holding and his depart-
ment. Holding blamed the department
for failing to stop the growing backlash
against land rights while officers in the
department blamed Holding for failing
to act on their advice that more infor-
mation was needed. Holding also has
accused some officers of being in-
sufficiently committed to land rights
while they believe Holding is trying to
politicise the public service.
With antagonism and mistrust on
every side, Holding must wish at times
that he had stayed in Victoria as leader
of the Opposition. He might have been
premier instead of grappling with a
portfolio that is proving far more diffi-
cult than he imagined.
Holding went to Aboriginal Affairs
with enthusiasm and dedic-
ation. Ironically, it was his
belief in self-determination
for Aboriginal people that
produced the current di-
lemma.
After years of stagnation,
the department saw the arrival
of the new minister as a
chance to do bigger and better
things.
Holding was given a series
of proposals to keep the pub-
lic informed and calm in the
run-up to the uniform land
rights legislation Labor had
promised. But, except for
some basic projects on an in-
formal basis, the proposals
were not developed.
The main problem was that
Aboriginal groups brought
into the consultation process
could not make up their
minds as to what they wanted.
The indecision and uncertain-
ty has affected both the draft-
ing of the land rights bill and
the public awareness cam-
paign to pave its way.
The National Aboriginal
Conference last year asked
Holding for funds to conduct
its own public awareness cam-
paign. Nearly $250,000 of the
department’s information budget of
$340,000 was earmarked for the confer-
ence. But the first suggestions from it
were so wild as to be rejected out of
hand and it failed to produce any more.
As the end of the financial year
loomed, the money was diverted into
stand-by projects within the depart-
ment. The conference then accused the
department of underspending on public
information.
The department’s advice to Holding
from the start was to keep interested
groups such as miners and farmers
aware of his thinking on the land rights
bill. Intead, Holding consulted fully
with the Aborigines but not with white
interest groups. The department’s direc-
tor of information, who told the minis-
ter that he should communicate more
with such groups, was moved out of the
job.
If the legislation had been passed last
year, as was intended originally, Hold-
ing’s approach may have succeeded.
But the steering committee on the bill
which Holding set up consisting
mainly of conference members, with
some land council representatives
could not produce a draft. Holding then
planned to introduce the bill this session
but again the steering committee failed
to meet its deadline and asked for more
time, which Holding granted.
Although there were other reasons to
postpone the legislation notably the

forthcoming election, Holding was
surprised and hurt when the conference
accused him of delaying the Bill be-
cause of pressure from right-wing influ-
ences.
At the beginning of this year, the de-
partment detected a backlash against
land rights and outlined various options
to the minister. These ranged from a
basic information campaign of pam-
phlets and other printed material tar-
geted at affected groups such as pas-
toralists, the Country Women’s Associa-
tion and local government to a gener-
al advertising campaign.
The department wanted to publicise
the extent of the proposed bill, to re-
move such fears as private property be-
ing taken over and to point out the ad-
vantages of giving Aborigines an econ-
omic base. But the minister and his de-
partment’s heritage division argued that
nothing could be done until they knew
exactly what was going to be in the bill.
While the department has waited for
the exact legislation to emerge, a new
problem has erupted.
In March, frightened by the outburst
against land rights, Holding agreed that
the department could conduct a low-key
information campaign of booklets on
Aboriginal needs and the history of
land rights. But, impeded by lack of
staff and funds, the department has cir-
culated only a few thousand leaflets.
And some of the new pamphlets are still
waiting their turn at the government
printer.
While the conference has been unfair
in attacking Holding and his depart-
ment, Holding has aroused additional
bitterness in the equally-frustrated de-
partment. Holding queried the role of
his regional officers, suggesting they
should have been able to stop the back-
lash. He also has indicated that they
should write public letters in support of
the government’s policies, which they
have refused to do.
The situation may be easing slightly
as Holding admits the constraints under
which the department is operating and
lowers his demands.
There also is hope that the confer-
ence’s relations with the department
may improve now that Charles Perkins
is the department head. But another
problem has arisen with the current
hearings by the parliamentary expendi-
ture committee into the Aboriginal De-
velopment Commission, which almost
certainly will not leave Perkins un-
touched.
For the first time, Holding admitted
recently that he could have handled the
whole land rights debate better, al-
though he did not admit that his depart-
ment had warned him of what might
happen.
“I think we failed in not picking up
earlier the intensive organisation of
some of the frankly racist organisations
and the way in which anti-Aboriginal
propaganda was being mounted in the
community,” he said on the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation’s Pressure
Point television program.
“I think, if I could be living my min-
istry over again, we should have moved
on that far more quickly than we did. I
think none of us perceived the damage
that was being done in some areas and I
think we have to make up for that.”
Repairing the damage will be diffi-
cult, especially given the continuing de-
lays forced on the department. Funds
for the public awareness projects have
been increased to $600,000 in last
month’s federal budget as much as the
department asked for but the depart-
ment estimates that a thorough cam-
paign to improve public attitudes to
Aborigines and land rights in the long
term would require $2 million.
Officers in the department are
amused that their counterparts in the
Immigration department asked for ad-
vice on how to handle an information
campaign against racism in the immi-
gration debate.
“We gave them a lot of advice. We
told them what we had done wrong,”
one officer told The Bulletin.
Holding’s appointment of journalist
Ken Gott, a long-standing acquaintance
and expert on the League of Rights, to
combat racism has full support from the
department.
The belief there is that the more that
is done the better and they need all
the help they can get. □

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Metals unions
seek a pact
to boost jobs
By DEBORAH HOPE
A RAPPROCHEMENT with federal
Industry and Commerce Minister John
Button is one of the results which the
Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and
Shipwrights Union and other metals
unions are hoping to achieve with their
new Policy for Industry Development
and More Jobs. The policy, undertaken
with the assistance of the National Insti-
tute of Economic and Industry Re-
search and launched last week, sets out
a five- to seven-year plan for revitalising
the Australian metal industry and
stimulating a 250,000 growth in jobs na-
tionally. According to the plan, this
could be achieved through expanding
the industry’s domestic and export mar-
kets and without any major increases in
protection.
A key element in the plan for ex-
panding the domestic market is estab-
lishment of industrial supply offices at
federal and state level to monitor the
buying patterns of Australian industry
and government.
The union says that the policy docu-
ment provides clear indications of areas
of substantial agreement with the minis-
ter for instance, on the potential to
boost exports.
Differences between the union and
Button over industry policy have been
simmering for the past year and focus
on what the union describes as the fed-
eral government’s failure to establish
planning structures for industry, such as
the secretariat for the Australian Manu-
facturing Council, which it believes are
an essential component of the prices
and incomes accord. These differences
of opinion came to a head last
December over Button’s adoption of
plans to rationalise the motor vehicle in-
dustry.
The union’s report comes just weeks
after government rejection of a $5OO
million emergency assistance proposal
for the heavy engineering industry
which has provoked concern from the
Australian Council of Trade Unions as
well as from industry.
If the proposals outlined in the docu-
ment to be presented to Prime Minister
Bob Hawke this week aim to be concili-
atory, the tone of its contents is not.
In its foreword, the union’s assistant
national secretary Laurie Carmichael
quotes a resolution of the Metal Unions
Negotiation and Campaign Committee
dated June 1984 which calls on the fed-
eral government “to change the direc-
tion of its industry policies in the form
of an unequivocal commitment to the
manufacturing industry whilst there is
still time to do so ...
“We call on the federal government
to provide real tripartite management of
industrial development with proper re-
sponsible regard to the principal part-
ners in industry ... In the meantime,
even in expanding economic circum-
stances, major vital metal industry com-
panies are closing at the rate of one a
Industry and Commerce Minister Button: metals unions are seeking a rapprochement
week.
.. We express strong criticism of
the delay in getting the full tripartite in-
dustry development apparatus into op-
eration and at the inadequacy of infor-
mation relating to industry policy de-
cisions before they are finally deter-
mined.”
Along with taxation reform, industry
policy is considered to be one of the
most sensitive areas for the mainten-
ance of the accord. This is clearly
pointed out by Nixon Apple, of the
union’s national research unit, in the in-
troduction to the policy document:
“These and other issues have left
workers and their unions with little con-
fidence that the de-industrialisation of
Australia is a central concern of govern-
ment. This, in turn, has led the union
movement to question the commitment
of the government to the accord’s indus-
try policy prescriptions. Without such a
commitment, union acceptance and
support for other areas of the accord
could be diminished at a critical stage in
the economic upturn.”
That the government’s entire econ-
omic strategy for 1984-85 depends on
the accord holding together serves to
underline the importance of this threat.
The report forecasts that, with a con-
tinuation of present government policy,
unemployment will be more than 10.5
percent by 1989 more than 825,000
people. It says that only by the adoption
of an industry plan such as the one it is
offering will the government be able to
overcome constraints on an expansion
of the economy fast enough to soak up
these unemployed. The report says it is
essential to develop a serious industry
policy to be able to take advantage of an
expected resources boom this decade.
According to the plan, a 5 percent
cut in metal engineering imports (with
little or no increase in protection) or a
corresponding increase in metal engin-
eering exports would have a major im-
pact on the economy and especially on
employment and technological change.
“Such an import cut or export in-
crease allows the government to expand
the economy much more rapidly than it
otherwise could. The plan does this
without overheating the economy and
running into balance of payments prob-
lems, problems with existing plant ca-
pacity or problems with borrowing and
repaying debt,” it says.
The three major components of the
plan are:
■ An import replacement strategy in
the metals engineering industry de-
signed to give domestic producers a
larger share of the local market;
■ Expansion of Australian industries
into the export markets of the western
Pacific; and
■ A broadly-based program to mod-
ernise industry. □


SPORT
New frontier
looms for
women’s rights
Professor Lois Bryson: “Sport has been defined in male terms ... ”
By RICHARD L’ESTRANGE
SPORT MAY BE the new frontier of
feminist activism in the pursuit of equal
opportunity.
Professor Lois Bryson has provided
a rallying point with publication of a
research paper, Sport and the Op-
pression of Women, which asserts that
women are excluded and disadvantaged
in the world of sport. Bryson, of the
School of Sociology at the University of
New South Wales and on secondment
at the Department of Community Wei-
fare Services in Victoria, declares her-
self hopeful that oppression will be
broken down and that the Olympics
eventually will have open competition
with men and women competing in the
marathon.
The link between maleness and sport
is not, she says, explicit or stated but
sports such as football and cricket have
been constantly on television whereas a
nationwide study in 1980 showed that
only five minutes of 200 hours’coverage
a week were devoted to women’s sport,
Men were seen doing something im-
portant and skilful while women were
not seen to be as strong, as skilful and as
aggressive as men.
Yet, Bryson says in her paper, pub-
lished by the Australian and New Zea-
land Journal of Sociology, the record
showed that women are extremely good
at events needing stamina. They held
the greater number of the best 10 times
across the English Channel; had held
for years the open world record for 12-
hour cycling and also had held world
rollerskating distance records.
“There have been enormous gains by
women in sport,” Bryson concedes.
“At the turn of the century, women
were allowed to play a little tennis and a
little golf and today we have women
running in Olympic marathons we
have come a long way.
“But women do not get the benefit of
the banding together effect of men in
sport.”
Bryson argues that such activity had
been so “organised by men” as to cause
resistance to open competition.
Women’s sport had been made a dim-
inutive of men’s; women played five
minutes less each half in hockey, played
fewer sets in tennis and did not have to
ski as far.
“Women even had trouble getting
women’s events into the Olympic
Games and still do not compete in a
whole lot of areas that males do,” says
Bryson.
“Even in archery they have sep-
arated men’s and women’s competi-
tions, which seems a bit strange
though they don’t in shooting and horse
riding, which seems very sensible.
“By and large, sport has been defined
in male terms, organised by males, with
the interests of males being taken into
account.
“Now, if we are going to get equality
right through sport, we have to get
women into the administration of
sport.”
Bryson, 46, describes herself as a
“not particularly great sportsperson.”
But she has been a diver, swimmer,
hockey player, skier and scuba diver
“all in a desultory sort of way.” □
PUBLIC OPINION
Tobacco bans
find little favor
with the public
MOST Australians do not support the
idea of government bans on cigarette
advertising or on sponsorship by tobac-
co companies of sporting and cultural
events.
Support for commercial freedom is
stronger than generally in Western Aus-
tralia which has seen two separate at-
tempts since 1982 to introduce bills ban-
ning tobacco advertising, promotion
and sponsorship.
The findings of the Roy Morgan Re-
search Centre, in a survey conducted in
July for the Tobacco Institute of Austra-
lia, come from interviewing an Austra-

Those surveyed were told, “It has
been suggested the government should
ban the sponsorship of sporting events,
the arts and concerts by tobacco com-
panies” and then asked: “Do you feel
sponsorship should be banned or al-
lowed as now?”
People were also asked about cigar-
ette advertising. They were told: “Cigar-
ettes are a legal product on general sale
and can be advertised in newspapers,
magazines and on posters but not on TV
or radio. As you may know, some or-
ganisations have approached the gov-
ernment to ban all cigarette adver-
tising.” People then were asked whether
they believed that “all advertising re-
strictions should be lifted on cigarette
advertising”, “the restrictions on cigar-
ette advertising should remain as now”
or “all cigarette advertising should be
banned.”

SCIENCE
Blackberry rust
introduction
worries scientists
By GRAEME O’NEILL*
BLACKBERRIES are rusting away in
eastern Victoria and in northern New
South Wales. Their leaves turn purple,
then black as the disease advances.
Landholders will be silently ap-
plauding the unknown person who il-
legally imported a virulent strain of
blackberry rust and released it earlier
this year near the small Gippsland town
of Hiawatha.
While landholders rejoice, the clan-
* Graeme O’Neill is a science writer with the
CSIRO.
Causing both rejoicing and consternation: blackberry rust in an advanced stage
destine release has caused consternation
among the state and federal authorities
responsible for biological control. It
poses massive risks to agriculture and
could undermine the science of biologi-
cal control in Australia. Emboldened by
the incident, anonymous graziers have
threatened to release insects to control
nodding thistle, a major weed of grazing
land.
Effective agents to control nodding
thistle are already used elsewhere in the
world but the risks of their introduction
are daunting. Non-specific agents could
move on from the thistles to wreak
havoc among thistle relatives in Austra-
lia’s native flora and attack the commer-
cial oilseed crop, safflower. Alternat-
ively, an inefficient agent might hamper
efforts to establish a more effective
species.
The basic problem is that many land-
owners are fed up with what they see as
interminable delays in releasing biologi-
cal control agents to control weeds. It
only needed something like blackberry
rust to demonstrate that an amateur
could cut through the delays, yet appar-
ently do it as effectively as the scientists.
The spectre of do-it-yourself biologi-
cal control haunts the CSIRO and the
state agriculture departments.
To find and test biological control
agents can take years. Effective organ-
isms must be found and then
painstakingly screened to ensure they
will attack only a particular weed or, at
worst, a small group of closely-related
plants with no economic importance.
Scores of other plant species must be
exposed to a candidate insect or disease
to see if it attacks or infects non-target
species.
Many introduced weeds in
Australia have relatives
among crop species, or in the
Australian native flora. An in-
adequately tested biological
control agent could well at-
tack crop species or, like the
cane toad, become an en-
vironmental catastrophe.
Fireweed, an African
species of Senecio, exemplifies
the potential risk of releasing
non-specific agents. There are
dozens of native species of
Senecio and sunflowers be-
long to the same family.
Blackberries are grown
commercially in Tasmania
and New Zealand. The
species is closely related to
boysenberries, raspberries
and youngberries which could
also be affected. Wind could
easily carry spores long dis-
tances to commercial plant-
ings even across Bass Strait
or the Tasman.

troduced blackberry rust. Evidence sug-
gests that last year somebody visited
Europe probably France and
picked some leaves from rust-affected
blackberries, returned with them (in the
process becoming liable to a $lOO,OOO
fine or five years’ jail under the Quaran-
tine Act) and dusted the fungal spores
onto the leaves of blackberries at
Hiawatha.
Victorian Department of Agriculture
officers actually located that first plant
and noted the regular spacing between
the other plants infected by the initial
outbreak.
“If the rust was an act of God, then
one of his angels quickly recognised the
opportunity and spread it,” Dr Max
Whitten, chief of the CSIRO’s Division
of Entomology, said at a recent seminar
on biological control in Canberra. “It’s
worrying because it has promoted the
cavalier attitude that you can get away
with these illegal introductions.”
Whitten’s division arranged the sem-
inar to inform parliamentarians and the
media about trends in biological control
and the potential impact of the new Bio-
logical Control Bill. The Bill, in-
troduced into the House of Representa-
tives on June 6, is scheduled for debate
in the spring session.
The Bill will establish community
benefit as a basis for positively author-
ising a biological control program and
establish a formal mechanism for de-
termining whether a program is likely to
bring net benefit to the community.
Any conflict over whether an organ-
ism is harmful or not once “community
benefit” has been established is neatly
circumscribed by a major principle es-
tablished by the Bill: If biological con-
trol of an organism is for the commu-
nity benefit then, by definition, that or-
ganism is causing harm.
The Bill proposes the creation of a
one-man Commonwealth biological
control authority a position which
would be held initially by the federal
Primary Industry Minister but which
later could also rotate between him and
his state counterparts. It would nomi-
nate all target weeds and pests and
would seek objections by advertising
throughout Australia.
In the event of objections, it could
determine whether they were sufficient
to halt a program that was in the public
interest.
If individuals or groups lodge sub-
stantial objections, the minister would
have the alternative of establishing a
public inquiry to weigh “community
benefit” against any disadvantage to
minority groups. The legislation also
specifies that any inquiry into a target
pest would be able to consider compen-
sating people disadvantaged by the re-
lease of biological control agents.

injunction granted to a coalition of gra-
ziers and beekeepers to prevent the or-
ganisation from releasing insects to con-
trol Paterson’s Curse. The injunction re-
vealed a loophole in the legislation
covering the actual release of biological
control agents. In fact there is no legis-
lation that positively authorises the re-
lease of biological control agents. Re-
leases were made under the approval of
the quarantine authorities.
The Bill as it stands only allows for
the release of biological control agents
in the Australian Capital Territory and
exempts the Commonwealth from lia-
bility for damages if the control agents
spread beyond the ACT.
Insects and fungal spores do not re-
spect political boundaries, so the states
are already drafting complementary
legislation. □

POLITICS
Socialism at the crossroads
Socialism in Australia has been seeking new directions as it has faltered
organisationally, losing members and support. The result is likely to be the most
extensive shakeout of the left in 20 years, DEBORAH HOPE reports.
WHITHER socialism in Australia?
That is the question bedevilling the Aus-
tralian left in 1984.
The soul-searching extends from the
various Australian Labor Party left-
wing factions through the
non-aligned Communist
Party of Australia (CPA) to
the ultra-left Trotskyist parties
such as the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP). The central
issues are why the left has
failed to attract support at a
time of economic instability,
high unemployment and
shakiness over the disarma-
ment question and whether
there is room in Australia for
a parliamentary party to the
left of the ALP.
The dilemma was high-
lighted at the recent ALP
national conference where the
left was beaten on nearly
every major issue in spite of
its considerable representa-
tion. In the face of the smooth
Hawke machine, the left ap-
peared inarticulate and dis-
organised.
The Communist Party of
Australia regards the situation
as so vital that it has opened
its Prospects For Socialism
debate for public scrutiny in
the pages of its weekly tab-
loid, Tribune, with headlines
such as: “Socialism, has it any future?”
The result is likely to be the most ex-
tensive shakeout of the left in 20 years,
with the extinction of the 64-year-old
Communist Party of Australia and its

replacement with a broader-based so-
cialist party that has more to do with
Australia in 1984 than Europe in 1917.
But before that occurs we are sure to
witness a curious succession of splits
and alliances. The first of the
splits occurred in April when
23 members of the CPA’s
Victorian committee resigned.
About 40 of their communist
colleagues in Victoria and
Queensland followed suit.
The blow was all the more de-
moralising for the CPA be-
cause it came after the Pros-
pects debate was under way
and when membership was at
a record low of about 1400.
The most curious flirtation
in the search for a broader
base is that between the SWP
and the Moscow-aligned So-
cialist Party of Australia
(SPA), both strongly sectarian
groups and formerly fierce
combatants over the one true
path. The dalliance has devel-
oped following the demise of
the former SPA leadership, in-
cluding veteran unionist Pat
Clancy who has set up a new
organisation: the Association
for Communist Unity.
The two most significant
moves on the left have been
initiated by the CPA on the
one hand and by those who

resigned from its ranks on the other.
The irony for the left is that the moves
are developing in competition rather
than in tandem.
The Prospects debate has its roots in
the CPA’s 1982 congress where del-
egates discussed a proposal to drop the
communist name tag. The acrimonious
debate united people who believed that
the CPA’s independent position had
never been understood. Rather, in the
public mind the CPA had had to bear
the albatross of associations with the
worst events in the Soviet Union and
Poland.
Now, at a special congress to be held
in November, the CPA will take its first
official step toward abolishing itself to
aid a socialist renewal. This will be a
motion calling for the long process of
negotiation and discussion aimed at set-
ting up a new party. Its target would go
beyond existing CPA members and
unions to the environmentalists, femin-
ists, land rights, disarmament and
homosexual activists who have never
found a party that could accommodate
The battle of Exploration Lane
A DISPUTE over the ownership of
the Communist Party of Australia’s
Victorian headquarters in Exploration
Lane, Melbourne, has added a degree of
acrimony to the debate over which di-
rection the socialist movement should
turn.
The two-storey building is just one of
the CPA assets under question follow-
ing the resignations of 23 members of
the Victorian state committee in April.
The dispute first came to light in late
June when Tribune, the CPA’s weekly
newspaper, ran a report under the head-
ing: “CPA asked to buy its own prop-
erty.” The report said: “Steps have been
taken to protect the Communist Party of
Australia’s headquarters at 12 Explora-
tion Lane.”
The fight over the property
has arisen because the five di-
rectors and shareholders of
the company which owns the
building, Taxa Elinel Nomi-
nees Pty Ltd, are among those
who resigned their party
membership. Because it is an
unincorporated association,
the CPA must set up compan-
ies to hold its assets. Faithful
party members are appointed
to directorships of these com-
panies.
According to Eric Aarons,
CPA national executive com-
mittee member, the directors
of Taxa Elinel gave confirma-
tion at the time of their ap-
pointment that they were act-
ing as representatives of the
CPA rather than as individ-
uals.
Now, says Aarons, the di-
rectors have offered to sell the
building to the party for “a
sum of money to be
negotiated indicating that,
if the CPA did not purchase at
a satisfactory price, they
would seek other buyers.”
How does the CPA feel
about this uncomradely devel-
opment? According to
Aarons, the party regards as “unprin-
cipled indeed ludicrous the de-
mand that it should buy its own proper-
ty, property originally purchased and
renovated out of party funds, subscrip-
tions and contributions in money and
labor from its members and support-
ers.”
Two directors of Taxa Elinel Nomi-
nees, Mark Taft and Philip Herington,
wrote to Tribune claiming the report
was “inaccurate and misleading.”
In a sharp response Brian Aarons,
for the CPA national executive, claimed
that at a meeting between Taft,
Herington, their legal representatives,
Eric Aarons and Victorian CPA execu-
tive member Julius Roe, the CPA had
In dispute: CPA headquarters in Melbourne
DON McPHEDRAN
been offered the building for half its
market value.
The CPA bought the building in 1979
for about $60,000. A further $20,000 has
been spent on renovations. Its value is
estimated at around $200,000.
Also under dispute is the will of a
CPA supporter naming Herington and
Taft as beneficiaries. CPA sources, how-
ever, say the two were made benefici-
aries in their capacity as nominees on
behalf of the party.
It is understood the will concerns
property worth around $40,000.
Both sides to the dispute say they are
trying to avoid the courts, preferring a
private agreement. In the meantime, a
paper war is developing.
A letter now enjoying wide
circulation among the left in
Victoria, addressed to “dear
friends,” claims that those
who resigned from the CPA
had “no plan or threat to sell
(12 Exploration Lane) over
the heads of the CPA or to
evict them as tenants.”
Rather, the letter says,
“those who left the CPA as a
group have raised for dis-
cussion their moral right to
share in the assets they were
instrumental in building.
They did not leave as individ-
uals ...” Two of the three who
signed the letter, Harry
Karslake and Roger Wilson,
were among those who resign-
ed from the party’s Victorian
committee on April 17.
Another letter, signed
“comradely greetings,” says:
“A significant section of the
Victorian membership have
now resigned.
“What is wrong with them
proposing discussions about
sharing the assets and, indeed,
receiving such a share?”
Taft last week was unwill-
ing to discuss the matter, say-
ing he believed it should be
settled privately. □


their views, as well as disaffected ALP
members and socialists who have never
been attracted by any party.
Joyce Stevens, CPA national
women’s organiser and party member
for nearly 40 years, said: “Marxism
doesn’t have a very well developed the-
ory on racism or the position of
women.”
Stevens, along with other prominent
members of the CPA’s Sydney branch
such as Brian and Eric Aarons and Jack
Mundey of green bans fame, is firmly
behind the view that change is needed.
But the figures speak for themselves.
Communist Party of Australia mem-
bership has fallen from a record 20,000
in 1945 to about 1400 in 1984. Sales of
Tribune continue to decline (4400 in
1983 compared to 7800 in 1976), along
with the party’s industrial influence.
Laurie Carmichael, of the metal
workers union, remains the only promi-
nent communist union official in Aus-
tralia.
Socialists with careers to nurture and
parliamentary aspirations head for the
ALP rather than the CPA. Communist
Party members are still regarded with
deep suspicion in Australia, although
they have discarded any fancies of in-
surrection.
The Gang of 23 in Victoria left the
CPA after reaching the conclusion that
there was no room in Australia for a
parliamentary party with mass aspira-
tions outside the ALP, particularly
when Prime Minister Bob Hawke had
caught the public imagination.
Among the 23 are the two figures
who had dominated the CPA in Victoria
Bernie and Mark Taft. Instead of a
new party, this group has established
Socialist Forum, tagged as “an organ-
isation of socialist activists” seeking to
“contribute to the process of socialist
development in Australia” and to im-
prove the quality of debate, analysis
and strategy on the left.
The forum has attracted a member-
ship of about 150 in Victoria since it was
set up last month. It also has attracted
the ire of some of the stalwarts of the
ALP’s socialist left, such as Bill Hartley,
for whom this development poses a po-
tential political threat.
While the forum clearly has no aspir-
ations to develop as a separate political
party, one scenario sees some of its
members forming a new faction in the
ALP between the moderates of the
centre left and the excesses of the social-
ist left, thus threatening some of the
ground now held by the old-guard left
in Victoria. The leaders of this faction
would, the scenario goes, come from the
23 former CPA members. It is certain
that some of the 23 will apply for ALP
membership but, to become eligible,
they must first fulfil the two-year
waiting period set down in the rules of
the Victorian branch.
Mark Taft is optimistic that the for-
um will succeed in its aim of providing
an alternative analysis of social and
economic questions in Australia, such
as the ALP’s prices and incomes accord
and taxation reform. According to Taft,
the stronger intellectual tradition in Vic-
toria will assist the new organisation’s
development.
He says the mass resignations from
the CPA were a result of frustrations
with the rigidity of the party. He quoted
the fundamental belief of many mem-
bers that the CPA would replace the
ALP as the mass party in Australia and
their adherence to dogma. “I was frus-
trated by the time we spent juggling
ghosts in the party, such as whether
Christians should be able to join the
CPA.”
Curiously, this would appear to be
the crux of the Prospects debate
underway in the CPA. Some party
sources allege that the split is more to do
with a long-standing power struggle be-

Jack Mundey: “bringing environmentalists together is the only hope”
DAVID WALLACE
tween the NSW branch of the
party, dominated ideologic-
ally by the Aarons family, and
the Victorian branch until
April, dominated by the Taft
family rather than a genu-
ine disaffection with the CPA.
(Sam Aarons was a founda-
tion member of the party in
the 19205. His sons, Laurie
and Eric Aarons, and grand-
son Brian remain prominent
in 1984. Bernie Taft was a
member of the CPA in Vic-
toria for about 40 years before
his resignation in April.
Bernie and his son Mark were
the leading figures in the party
in Victoria.)
There are, however, some
sharp differences of opinion
on policy matters. For in-
stance, while those who re-
signed from the CPA view the
social contract side of the
ALP’s accord with the ACTU
as its most important element,
those still in the CPA believe
workers’ confidence must first
be reinforced with a wages
catch-up.
And, more important, the Taft group
does not believe a new party is the
answer, because of the high level of dis-
affection among Australians with politi-
cal parties. “The present political insti-
tutions were formed 60 years ago. We
have to question whether they are rel-
evant now,” says Mark Taft.
The forum has so far attracted the at-
tention and support of a mix of union-
ists, ALP members (including some
from the socialist left), former CPA
members, unaligned socialists and a
gaggle of activists from various causes.
Some who stuck with the CPA in Vic-
Mark Taft: an intellectual tradition in Victoria should help
DON McPHEDRAN
toria say they have been barred
effectively from participation.
David Bunn, Victorian secretary of
the Administrative and Clerical Offi-
cers’ Association and a non-
factionalised member of the ALP left
wing, is a firm supporter of the forum
concept. Like Mark Taft, Bunn does not
believe there is room in Australia for a
mass party on the left outside the ALP.
However, he says the time consumed
within the Labor Party on factional
manoeuvring means that debate and
critical analysis of issues is inadequate.
“Nowhere is this clearer than in the de-
bate within the party about economic
issues. A whole set of Treasury preju-
dices have now become more or less re-
spectable,” he said.
Although at this stage it is unclear
how the forum will fund its activities, it
has advertised for a $20,000-a-year or-
ganiser based in Melbourne. Pre-
dictably, members of the CPA in Syd-
ney and Melbourne favor the establish-
ment of a new party over the forum con-
cept. CPA members such as Brian
Aarons, Stevens and Mundey are not
daunted by the nightmare of trying to
organise people from a variety of causes
under one umbrella.
Stevens does not believe a new party
is the ideal alternative but she would
support the present CPA disappearing
in favor of a new party if discussion
proved there were enough support. She
has two main criticisms of the party:
political theory is still too steeped in tra-
ditional Marxist icons, such as the su-
premacy of the class struggle,
and the party does not attract
enough people from feminist,
environmentalist and other
activist movements to develop
party theory in these areas.
Mundey, independent
alderman on the Sydney City
Council, CPA member and
hero of the green bans move-
ment, believes the present de-
bate is due to a realisation on
the left that socialism needs a
new dimension to remain as a
popular force. Perhaps rather
more than his colleagues,
Mundey believes “bringing
environmentalists together is
the only hope.” According to
Mundey, any new party that
evolves will have to give much
more emphasis to the future
rather than the present. “Un-
less we give more thought to
questions about the environ-
ment, we won’t have a future
of humanity to consider,” he
said.
Mundey is not deterred by
the apparent political apathy
in this country, pointing to the
150,000 who marched in a
Sydney disarmament rally on Palm
Sunday. However, he does not believe
Australia is ready for an equivalent of
West Germany’s successful Greens
Party.
Joe Owens, Mundey’s colleague
from the BLF and also a communist,
takes a slightly different perspective. He
says any new party must have an inde-
pendent Marxist outlook with a
stronger base in the trade unions.
These differences of opinion within
CPA ranks reflect the daunting task of
achieving even a small degree of social-
ist unity. □

The car above is the latest
Jaguar.
In our opinion, this Jaguar is
the best Jaguar ever made.
And also represents the best
value ever offered in luxury cars.
With due regard to the
memorable Jaguars of the past,
these are not statements we make
lightly.
Life with a new Jaguar begins
at around $48,450*.
To put this price into
perspective, try to think of any
other automobile which offers
Jaguar’s level of luxury,
refinement and equipment and
doesn’t cost at least ten thousand
dollars more.
You can delete the Mercedes
280 SE which, in our opinion, is
the nearest comparable
Mercedes.
That comes in at around
$61,525**.
You can also disregard the
BMW 735 i at around $59,500**.
In fact, whatever you look at,
you’ll still find the Jaguar XJ6 is
streets ahead.
The question is, how is it
possible for the best to be made
for less?
Involvement builds better cars,
more efficiently.
Three years ago, when John
Egan took over as Chairman and
Chief Executive of Jaguar cars,
the automobile industry thought
that technology was the sole
solution to all its problems.
John Egan disagreed.
“The best, most sophisticated
machines in the world will not
make memorable cars,” he argued,
“ if the men who operate them do
not have pride in what they do.”
Then, while Jaguar invested
millions in re-tooling, John Egan
began asking the people who
actually build the cars for their
thoughts on ways of making
better Jaguars.
His office was flooded with
ideas and proposals, many of
which were acted upon
immediately.
Ever since then, once a month
the staff meet with management
and continue to find better ways
of doing things.
The result, again, is best
summed up by John Egan himself.
“Productivity has doubled with
no increase - in fact a decrease -
in workforce.”
“Naturally, the
unit cost is less.”
The best Jaguar ever
made gives you the best
of everything.
While the Jaguar
XJ6 embodies
excellence of con-
struction and superb
value, its traditional
virtues should not
be overlooked
It gives you a
unique combination
of looks, perform-
ance, comfort and
peace-of-mind that
is not equalled by
other cars.
It is the only
current model to be included
among the ten most beautiful cars
of all time in a survey conducted
by “Car and Driver” magazine.
It is also considered to have
the best ride in the world.
And, in Mastercare, the best
warranty and maintenance
programme.
The Jaguar XJ6 carries a
warranty valid for two years or
40,000 km, whichever comes first.
Furthermore, Jaguar
undertakes to pay the labour and
genuine Jaguar replacement part
costs of regular maintenance as
set out in the owner’s handbook
for three years or 40,000 km.
whichever comes first.
Whether you buy a Jaguar at
$48,450,* or opt for the more luxu-
rious Jaguar Sovereign,Vanden
Plas, or XJS-HE, the value for
money is no less apparent.
Call your nearest Jaguar
Rover dealer and arrange to test
drive the best Jaguar ever made.
It could be the best decision
you ever made.

CRIME
THE
MINDER
WHO
BECAME
AN
UNDERWORLD
AGENT
Photography by LUIS MARTIN
ERNIE MCQUILLAN
Greg Jones lives
with the fear
of death. To
his mind the
assassin could
be from either
side of the law:
he is as afraid
of police as he
is of criminals.
In telling
David Armstrong
how it came
to this, Jones
gives chilling
insights behind
the scenes of
crime and its
investigation
in Australia
GREG JONES has worked on both
sides of the law and has seen corruption
obliterate the distinction between en-
forcer and offender. He is in danger be-
cause he has talked. .
For five months Jones played a dual
role, being “minder” of a mobster and
an informant (or, as he prefers to style
it, undercover agent) for the New South
Wales police and the now-disbanded -
and discredited — federal Narcotics Bu-
reau.
He reported on drug deals, race-rig-
ging, fraud, illegal gambling, police and
political corruption and a murder plot.
His information, officially recognised as
having amounted to a considerable
flow, sparked intensive activity within
the bureau.
While infiltrating criminal groups,
Jones committed four armed robberies.
The money involved was comparatively
paltry: he turned to robbery to convince
his underworld associates that he was
one of them. Such proof was needed be-
cause, he believes, he was betrayed by
NSW policemen who were in league
with criminals. He also believes, with
some justice, that the robberies were
committed with the approval of former
Narcotics Bureau agents. And he be-
lieves that when he found the pressure
of his double life intolerable — and
when he began forming some distress-
ing conclusions about corruption — he
was betrayed again. He was arrested for
the robberies, left defenceless at his trial
and sentenced to 16 years’ jail.
That was in October 1978. Jones
since has talked to federal, Victorian
and — very reluctantly — NSW police
and to NSW and federal officials, inclu-
ding senior people in the ombudsman’s
office in Canberra. Jones told his story




A supermarket which was robbed by Greg Jones and (right) Sydney’s Whitehall Hotel at which members of the gang drank
in an attempt to win justice recogni-
tion that, during his trial, the court
heard something less than the truth.
Jones has been released on parole.
Since his release he has lived very cau-
tiously. “I’m very good at what I do,” he
says and what he has been doing is stay-
ing alive. Only a trusted few know
where he is living at any particular time
and he makes sure that these people
know his movements. He is not para-
noid. His police contacts do not neces-
sarily endorse his fear of other police
but a senior Victorian officer told The
Bulletin that Jones was right to fear for
his life. A high-ranking federal police
officer said: “I wouldn’t like to walk on
the same side of the street as him.”
Much of Jones’ story cannot be
checked. But much of it can and police
and government officials with whom he
dealt found him honest and his version
of events credible. His story provides a
rare insight into the criminal world.
FOR A MAN who once was offered
SSOOO to kill a young woman, Gregory
Robin Jones is surprisingly pleasant. He
is a tall, trimly-built man with baggy
eyes which are capable of an impish
twinkle when he grins. His appearance
invites comparison with Dennis Water-
man’s Minder. That is the only compari-
son: Jones was no mere factotum for
and occasional pugilistic protector of a
vaguely endearing rogue; he was the
armed bodyguard of a young tough who
was an upwardly mobile heroin dealer
and who may have been a murderer. In
the world Jones penetrated, friendly
persuasion meant waving a loaded gun
in front of the victim’s face.
Greg Jones’ face is lined from ten-
sion and he finds sitting still difficult un-
less he is assured that he is in a safe
place. He has to create times and op-
portunities for relaxation. After a long
and earnest discussion about the crimi-
nal world, he might say: “Now, let’s just
have a beer and relax.” Then he is on
the move again.
Jones is adamant that he infiltrated
the underworld in the late 1970 s to op-
pose crime and corruption. “I never
worked for those guys only against
them,” he says. He is, however, no
cleanskin. He had a conviction for a
string of armed robberies and he once
worked a credit card racket for a New
York Mafia mob. But he has long had a
hatred of heroin and the human devas-
tation it engenders.
FOR DECADES, the semi-circle of in-
ner suburbs on the southern side of Syd-
ney Harbor has been home for the prac-
titioners of unorganised crime more
or less freelance armed hold-up men,
enforcers, starting price betting oper-
ators, small-time drug dealers, prosti-
tute and pimps. On February 5, 1940,
Greg Jones was born into a family of
seven at Five Dock on the western
fringes of that arc.
His family moved to Deniliquin,
near the NSW-Victoria border, where
Jones went to school. Leaving at the age
of 14, he worked at a succession of
laboring jobs in South Australia, West-
ern Australia, Victoria and NSW before
moving to Sydney in about 1970 to go
into the home renovation business with
a brother.
Jones had been married in 1960 and
was to have five children, whom he de-
scribes as extremely honest.
An injury to his right eye and a long
illness put him out of the renovation
trade and he took on a job which even-
tually led him to crime. He became a
security guard at a suburban shopping
complex.
At first, he was unarmed. “I had a
beautiful friend with me,” he says, “a
big german shepherd who loved me.” It
was not long, however, before he
acquired a private investigator’s licence
and a gun. Soon after that, he became a
criminal: he committed seven armed
robberies, hitting four banks, two super-
markets and a TAB office.
Jones says that he cannot explain the
change. “Who really knows the truth?”
he says. “It’s just something that hap-
pened. There is no answer to some
things.” His new life was not lucrative.
“Security’s too good now there’s
never much money,” he says.
He fled to the United States in June
1974 and while there tried to sell some
350,000 back copies of Australian
magazines which, at that time, were re-
garded as pornographic. He stayed in
New York, dealing with one mob
which he calls the Galileo mob on the
sale of the magazines and working for
another, which he calls the Colombo
mob, on the credit card fraud.
That racket was simple. A member of
the mob would pick up a young woman,
take her to dinner and appear to be-
come very drunk. After leaving the
nightspot, he would hand his credit card
wallet to Jones who had practised the
mobster’s signature. Jones would go out
early the next morning to high-class
jewellery shops and buy expensive dia-
mond rings which he would take to jew-
ellers on 47th street. “They ask no ques-
tions,” he says. “They know the game: if
the diamond is worth SIO,OOO, they give
you S3OOO. They give you a third. It’s a
racket.” He would then telephone the
mobster who would report that his cards
had gone missing and who easily could


tell a convincing story that they had
been stolen while he was drunk.
Jones had to bolt from New York
after he was seen talking innocently,
he says to police who specialise in the
fight against organised crime. He was
warned by one mobster that he was to
be “knocked” murdered. He did not
even return to his hotel. He arranged for
a black man working there to dispatch
his bags and his girlfriend to John F.
Kennedy Airport, where they caught the
first plane available, a Qantas flight to
London. The black man’s name was
Richard Oliver. That name was to be-
come Jones’ alias, the name he would
use often when reporting to narcotics
agents.
On returning to Sydney, Jones was
arrested for the armed robberies. He
was to serve three years in jail. At the
same time, he was divorced.
Jones says his wife thought
that his absences from home
meant he was having an affair.
Until his arrest, neither she
nor his children knew he was
a criminal. “It came as a tre-
mendous shock to them,” he
says.
WHILE IN jail, Jones had
two fateful meetings which
led him to his dangerous
double life. The first was from
a suburban detective sergeant
in the NSW police who
wanted to meet him during
one of his weekend leaves.
They had a drink at the Ryde
Eastwood Leagues Club, in
Sydney’s western suburbs.
“He told me that he’d kept an eye on
me,” Jones says. “He said: ‘The way
you’re going, you’ll either do life for
murder or end up being killed.’ He
asked me to work undercover for them.
He agreed there was a lot of corruption.
He said: ‘We want to know who helps
organise it.’
“I said: ‘Cops and politicians, mate.
I hear about it from the cons.’ He said:
‘Get us names, get us facts we can work
on.’ I said I’d think about it.” Before
leaving, the sergeant warned him not to
use prison phones if he wanted to make
contact. All of them were bugged, he
said.
The second visit was from the crimi-
nal who was to become, in the East Lon-
don parlance, Jones’ “Guv’nor.” This
man was a middle-ranking distributor
in a heroin empire controlled by a New
Zealand woman, a “godmother” of the
Australian drug scene. But the Guv’nor,
then in his mid-20s, was very ambitious:
He wanted to establish his own heroin
importation and distribution network,
as Terrence John Clark had set up the
Mr Asia syndicate.
The Guv’nor, who has used the alias
“Miller,” was prepared to live danger-
ously. He wanted to abduct Karl
Bonnette whom crime investigator Bob
Bottom named at a parliamentary com-
mittee hearing in 1978 as one of the
three men at the top of organised crime
in Sydney. Bonnette was known in
criminal circles as The Godfather.
Miller believed that, by kidnapping
Bonnette, he could gain information
about the workings of drug syndicates
knowledge Miller would apply in run-
ning his network.
As part of his plan, Miller wanted
Jones to go to Malaysia to collect and
then import heroin valued at more than
$2 million. Miller also talked about a
young woman, Dale Payne, whom he
said would have to be killed.
Says Jones: “I said it all sounded
pretty far-fetched and heavy and we
The Erskineville TAB which was robbed by Jones
KEVIN BROWN
could finish up in jail in no time. He
said: ‘No, mate, we’re very well pro-
tected by police. You won’t be going to
jail. You’ve got nothing to worry
about’.”
Jones was released from jail on
December 10, 1977, soon after that
meeting, and began working as Miller’s
minder. After about two weeks, Jones
reported back to the sergeant. He said
Miller was distributing heroin received
from a man called “Spaghetti,” also
known as “the man of many wigs,” but
that Miller planned to begin importing
the drug.
Jones also reported that “Spaghetti”
had ordered the death of Marie Anne
Hisshion in January 1976. Hisshion’s
body had been found in Sydney harbor:
she had been shot in the head and had a
rock tied to one leg. Her death is re-
garded as the first of the Mr Asia kill-
ings.
Jones named to the sergeant a man
who later was listed in an October 1982
report of the Commonwealth-NSW
joint task force on drug trafficking as a
drug trafficker and, along with
Bonnette, as an associate of drug im-
porter Murray Stewart Riley as having
been involved in the murder. (This sug-
gestion was investigated by the Wood-
ward royal commission on the drug
trade in NSW but, in his 1979 report,
Justice Woodward said there was not
enough evidence to prove it.)
Miller boasted to Jones about how
he bribed police to stay in business.
Names of corrupt police were passed on
to the sergeant. Jones was surprised that
the payment of protection money was
so blatant.
Miller gave Jones a Beretta, which
Miller had bought from a man who
might be called the Trainer a racing
figure who dabbled in race rigging and
fraud, among other things, and who,
Jones says, had strong police and politi-
cal connections.
The sergeant told Jones to put the
gun in the safe of the
Whitehall Hotel, a pub in
Rushcutters Bay, near Kings
Cross, which members of the
gang used as a drinking and
meeting place. Jones was not
to take the gun without telling
the sergeant.
Miller also offered Jones
$5OOO to murder Payne who
had become the Guv’nor’s
girlfriend. He told Jones that
other members of the organ-
isation had ordered him to
have her killed because she
wanted to leave the gang. She
could not be allowed to with-
draw, however, because she
knew too much about the her-
oin operations. Miller said he
had been told: “If you don’t
kill her, we’ll kill the pair of you.” He
added: “When it comes to the vote, it’s
her not me.” By this time, Jones says,
the sergeant was well aware that Payne
had been “targetted.”
Miller had decided that, before mur-
dering Payne, he would bleed her for
information about the operations of the
drug syndicate. Payne had been very
close to people higher in the organisa-
tion than Miller - including “Spaghet-
ti” who had been her lover. Miller beat
her and dangled her over The Gap (a
very high cliff near Sydney’s South
Head) to intimidate her. He also locked
her in the boot of his car for a day, let-
ting her suffer in the stifling summer
heat.
Eventually, he asked Jones to ar-
range for the use of a flat where he could
question Payne. Before taking her to the
flat, he dressed her in a big straw hat
and a scarf covering most of her face
including her eyes so that she would
not know where she was. He then ques-
tioned her all night.
Jones says that Miller “got his rocks
off” by humiliating women. He certain-
ly had bizarre sexual habits. One was to


hide and masturbate while watching
schoolgirls playing basketball. He once
gave a girl junkie a big dose of heroin,
raped her, urinated on her, photo-
graphed her and left a sunlamp 45cm
from her eyes. On another occasion,
Miller asked Jones if he would have sex
in a motel room and let Miller hide in
the cupboard so that he could watch.
In interviews with federal police,
Jones has said he told the sergeant that
plans were proceeding for him to go to
Asia to import the heroin. The sergeant
rang “Canberra” which approved of the
importation, presumably as a way of
tracking the heroin through the distribu-
tion network and getting information
on the syndicate.
But Miller cancelled his plans after a
very close brush with Narcotics Bureau
agents. Miller finally decided in
February to murder Payne himself and
went to a North Sydney motel where
she was staying. But Payne’s room was
raided by narcotics agents who said
later they had been tipped off by the
janitor who found a small amount of
heroin and a syringe behind a garbage
bin. Payne was arrested but Miller was
allowed to leave. Jones told the Federal
police, in an interview in Bathurst jail in
1982: “It’s amazing. They could have
grabbed (Miller) any day from then on
because I always knew where to find
(him) and they weren’t interested in
picking (him) up.”
Nevertheless, the encounter un-
settled Miller who feared that Payne
would talk. He went into hiding, with
Jones “minding” him. Jones kept the
sergeant informed of their movements.
After a few days, Miller said he knew
the police had an informant in the gang.
On Friday, February 24, 1978, Miller
said his solicitor was getting the name of
the “plant” from police and would pass
it on. As Jones told the federal police:
“So, I split.”
That night, Jones tried to book in at
the Whitehall but was told that Miller
and two armed junkies had been there
looking for him. He phoned a police
contact who arranged for him to be
taken to a north shore motel where he
registered in the name of Richard Oli-
ver. Jones decided that the NSW police
were fumblers at best and corrupt at
worst, so that weekend he telephoned
the Narcotics Bureau. That same morn-
ing, two agents arrived to interview him.
“They asked me to continue to co-oper-
ate,” Jones told the federal police. “I
had a lot of respect at that time for the
Narcotics Bureau. They virtually con-
vinced me that I was sold out by the
state police that they could not be
trusted. I agreed then to work with
them.”
At the same time, police took pos-
session of a briefcase Miller owned,
Jones says it contained either $40,000 or
$60,000 and some drugs. He says the
precise fate of the contents is unknown:
police accused narcotics agents of
taking them; the agents said it was the
police.
The agents told Jones that they
wanted him to concentrate on the
Trainer because of his corrupt political
connections. “But this time, I was virtu-
ally walking into my own trap,” he says,
“(Miller) had got himself a ‘bulldog
gun’ a British army revolver to use
on me. We were just one big happy fam-
ily.”
Jones tried to avoid Miller and
worked more closely with the Trainer,
For a few weeks, Jones continued to
provide the sergeant with information
including a tip about a $lOO,OOO hashish
sale. After receiving Jones’ information
police arrested three men who had been
under surveillance. Within a few weeks,
Stan “The Man” Smith another man
named by Bottom as one of the trio at
the top was looking for Jones at the
Whitehall. Smith allegedly told a bar-
man either that Jones was going to get
“a shock” or be “shot.”
On Monday, March 20, Jones met
the Trainer and one of his partners in
crime a northern suburbs business-

man in an eastern suburbs wine bar.
They told him a policeman had tipped
them off that he was a plant although
rumors about Jones clearly were spread-
ing through the underworld. The Busi-
nessman (who also had political links
he was said to get information on politi-
cians by sleeping with a state MP’s wife)
proposed putting Jones to the test by
getting him to commit an armed rob-
bery for them. “He said that, if I was
innocent, I wouldn’t mind,” Jones says.
“He said to me: ‘lf you did this for us,
you couldn’t give us up because we’d
have you by the balls’.”
Next morning, Jones met one of the
narcotics officers and said he was pre-
pared to commit a robbery if it were
sanctioned officially, if his parole officer
were informed and as long as no mem-
ber of the public would be harmed. The
agent consulted superior officers and,
according to Jones, two agents the
ones with whom he dealt most often
later called on him and said they
wanted him to go ahead with the rob-
bery. “I would be covered, everything
would be watched and photographed,”
Jones says.
At 8.35 pm on Wednesday, March 22,
just before Easter, Jones, armed with a
sawn-off .22 rifle, robbed a supermarket
in the northern suburb of Frenchs For-
est. The target had been selected by the
Businessman. The take was $1540.
Jones handed the money to the Trainer
at a wine bar called Jack’s Cellars.
Jones says that, before entering the
supermarket, he saw parked nearby two
men he has since identified as narcotics
agents. After the handover of the
money, one of the agents to whom he
reported had been able to give him clear
descriptions of all those present.
Jones committed three more armed
robberies a little over a month later, hit-
ting two TAB agencies and a bank. He
says there was virtually no money at the
TABs. According to police, he stole
$6470 from the bank.
Jones says the narcotics agents as-
sured him that he would not be ar-
rested; one of them said a senior officer
in the Armed Hold-up Squad was a
close friend.
Jones kept up his reports to the
agents. From information he received
from an associate who was involved
heavily in illegal gambling, Jones was
able to predict the political to-ing and
fro-ing about legalisation of casinos
over the following 12 months. He told
of how corrupt local councillors would
give casino and SP shop operators ad-
vance warning of planned action
against them, so they could clear out
and set up elsewhere. He also provided
some information on activities of the
Nugan Hand bank.
The Businessman was close to the
late Frank Nugan but his friendship did

not stop him extorting money from the
bank. According to Jones, the plan was
to give police information about the
bank’s drug activities and then get the
Trainer to use his political connections
to have the subsequent pressure “taken
off.” Jones does not know how much the
bank paid for this protection but says
that a federal politician received a pay-
off of $50,000. Jones has told federal
police that the “bagman” was a police-
man.
But relations between the Trainer
and the Businessman were not always
so warm. The Trainer “ripped off’ the
Businessman in a drug deal and later
told Jones he might have to kill the
Businessman to stop him retaliating.
Jones says the plotting was called off
when it was learned that George Free-
man, the third of Bottom’s top three,
and Leonard McPherson (Murray)
both of whom have been named in offi-
cial inquiries as major crime figures
would have disapproved.
But the Trainer had been anxious to
impress Freeman and, in April,
arranged the rigging of a horse race in
Brisbane for this purpose. Jones, who
by this time was the Trainer’s minder,
says the boast beforehand was that the
horse would win by six lengths and pay
25-1. The winning margin and the odds
were a little shorter than those pre-
dicted.
Jones also reported on a used car
racket run by an associate of the
Trainer, the owner of a car yard in the
inner suburbs. The car yard owner
would inflate the price of a car by $lOOO
or so, then arrange fake employment
and financial references for a “buyer”
who would borrow the money from a
finance company.
The Salesman and the Trainer had
people waiting next to phones to answer
questions from the finance company.
The “buyer” received the car and made
only one payment and would then use
the car for the length of time it took for
the finance company to go through the
business of repossession. The Salesman
would earn a normal profit plus $lOOO
out of this operation.
BY APRIL, Jones was becoming in-
creasingly nervous. He says that his life
was threatened once and that he
escaped a planned murder. Ironically,
Jones alleges that the threat was made
by a narcotics officer. It came, Jones
says, on about April 5 when he reported
on a political figure and gambling.
Jones told a narcotics agent: “It’s no
good me getting this political informa-
tion; it’s too big for me. Why don’t you
go and do something?” The agent re-
plied that the politician could not be
touched.
The bureau, he said, had information
about the involvement in drugs of a
Sydney crime figures Stan (The Man) Smith and Lennie McPherson (Murray)
member of the MP’s family. But the
politician had friends in the bureau. No
one could move against him until the
information against him was “big
enough.”
“I said: ‘What the hell’s the good of
the whole operation?’ ” Jones says.
“What’s the good of giving you infor-
mation if nothing can be done ... unless
you’re using it for blackmail? This is
how your corruption operates, you bas-
tards. You’re getting information on
politicians and you’re bloody well
blackmailing them’.”
The agent became very angry.
“Look, you arse, if you breathe a word
of what you’ve just found out and what
we’ve told you in this room, by the time
we’re finished with you we’ll make the
underworld look like amateurs,” he
said.
That threat coincided with the under-
world plot. Jones was asked to meet at a
hotel a criminal who was trying to break
into the heroin trade. On the way there,
Jones stopped at the car yard where he
received a phone call from a friend who
warned him not to go to the hotel be-
cause three armed men were waiting to
kill him. An SP bookmaker operating at
the hotel had been told that Jones
planned to murder and rob him, so he
had prepared for the expected attack.
Jones later committed the three extra
armed robberies as evidence of his
“criminality.” When he handed over the
money, the car salesman rang a police
officer to find out if Jones was a suspect.
The policeman said Jones should stop
wearing sunglasses as they were like a
trademark (he wears the glasses because
of his eye injury). But the policeman
said Jones would be safe. Two days
later, Miller Jones’ original Guv’nor
caught up with him at the car yard.
They frisked each other for guns, then
went to a nearby hotel. Miller told Jones
he knew he was an informant for the
bureau. Miller also gave the date on
which Jones was next to report to his
parole officer confidential informa-
tion which Jones believed could have
come only from police or bureau
sources. Miller then informed Jones that
he would be killed.
The following weekend the week-
end of May 6-7 Jones tried to contact
the agents with whom he dealt. He rang
the bureau and gave his code-name,
Richard Oliver. The man who answered
said he did not know the name; nor did
he know where the other agents were.
On the next day, Jones contacted one
of the agents by telephone at a Sydney
court and said he wanted to get out.
They arranged to meet in a coffee shop
at 11 am on Tuesday May 9. Jones left
his home at 9.57. He had driven only
about 200 metres before he was arrested
by NSW police. Jones was convinced he
was going to be killed.
One policeman ordered him to get
out of the car. Jones refused to move.
He kept his hands above the steering
wheel and sat still. The car was an auto-
matic and still in gear: if he had moved,
it could have lurched forward, perhaps
giving the impression he was trying to
escape. “So they turned the motor off
and I got out,” he says. “Had I made
any fast movement, I would have been
shot.” He says that, as he climbed out,
one policeman remarked that he had
surrendered easily. The police had been
warned, he said, to expect a shoot out.
Bureau agents visited Jones in Long
Bay jail and promised to “look after”
him at his trial. But no one came for-
ward when Jones appeared in court.
Even his solicitor withdrew at the last


moment having received death
threats, Jones says.
While in jail, Jones met Miller whose
luck and/or influence had evaporated.
They discussed Payne, whose luck also
had run out. She was found dead in a
locked eastern suburbs private hotel
room on May 15, 10 days after being
released from prison on bail. She had
died of a heroin overdose: a syringe was
stuck in one arm. The coroner’s verdict
was accidental death but Jones remains
convinced that she had been murdered.
Justice Donald Stewart, of the Stew-
art royal commission, would seem to
agree that Payne’s death was not an ac-
cident. He recommended last year that a
further royal commission
be held into the death of a
young woman. Stewart
gave no details of the case
but the recommendation
was believed to refer to
Payne.
The royal commission
has not been held but
Jones told the Payne story
on a recent 60 Minutes pro-
gram (which showed how
easily a smallish person
could slip through the bars
on the window of the hotel
room). After the program,
Jones repeated the story to
two officers from the state
police internal affairs unit
a “pearly white” group
hand-picked by former
commissioner Cec Abbott.
Miller told Jones that he
had not killed Payne.
Miller said that her former
lover “Spaghetti” was the
murderer. Jones did not believe this;
after all, Miller once had said that he
was a perfect liar.
FOR ALMOST six years, Jones
struggled to have his case reconsidered.
One of those to whom he appealed for
help was federal ombudsman Professor
Jack Richardson. He arranged for the
case to be investigated by federal police
and the Industry and Commerce de-
partment which controls the Australian
Customs Service, of which the Narcot-
ics Bureau had been part.
They conducted long interviews with
Jones, who allowed them to receive a
report on him by a prison psychologist.
The report said that Jones had been ad-
mitted to psychiatric hospitals three
times in 1964 and in the early 19705.
“These admissions seem to be the result
of stress and feelings of depression,” the
report said. “These symptoms are not
evident at present.”
The psychologist said that Jones was
a person who sought excitement and in-
trigue and who sometimes was inclined
to act impulsively. The psychologist
added: “Apart from his stories about
the Narcotics Bureau, which he repeats
with unwavering conviction, there is
nothing unusual about his behaviour or
conversation.
“There are no apparent delusions,
hallucinations, feelings of persecution
or other bizarre thought patterns ... Mr
Jones presents with no evidence of psy-
chological disorder regarding his in-
volvement with the Narcotics Bureau.”
A former narcotics agent interviewed
by the ombudsman’s team admitted that
Jones had worked for them but denied
that Jones had committed the armed
robberies with as much as their prior
knowledge, let alone consent or sugges-

tion. He said that, when agents learned
of the robberies, they reported Jones to
the police. The investigators turned up
no hard evidence to prove or disprove
either version. But, in the end, they
found in favor of Jones.
Perhaps one factor in support of his
belief that some kind of immunity had
been conferred upon him was that he
had used his car in the robberies and
had not worn a disguise unlikely be-
haviour for an experienced armed thief.
A report by Richardson said, “We
concluded that:
“■ The investigation had established Mr
Jones’ probity.
“■ Although conclusive proof of the
complicity of the two Narcotics Bureau
members is missing, the investigation
provided positive support for many de-
tails of Mr Jones’ allegations;
“■ The only substantive source of evi-
dence rebutting his allegations was that
of one of the former members named
... and we are satisfied that Mr Jones’
version is to be preferred ...
“■ Moreover, on the basis of the investi-
gation and other information we ob-
tained, we concluded that we could
have no confidence whatsoever in that
former member’s evidence;
“■ The investigation clearly established
that the relationship between Mr Jones
and the two members was more than a
fleeting, incidental or circumstantial ar-
rangement and was one involving sub-
stantial danger to Mr Jones. It was de-
liberately acceded to by the Narcotics
Bureau, it led to a payment of $lOO to
Mr Jones within three months of its
commencement, it persisted for a num-
ber of months, it generated a consider-
able flow of information reports and it
provoked within the Narcotics Bureau
various periods of intense activity by its
agents;
“■ The investigation re-
vealed several factors in-
dicating that Mr Jones was
a valuable informant; and
“■ The Narcotics Bureau
had a policy of giving evi-
dence in court on behalf of
certain informants, ad-
vising the court of the in-
formant’s association with
the Bureau. The reasons
given to the investigators
for not doing so in Mr
Jones’ case did not stand
up to scrutiny ...
“In all the circum-
stances and also bearing in
mind Mr Jones’ contribu-
tion to law enforcement, I
am satisfied that there is a
substantial risk that the ac-
tions of the two members
and the inaction of the
Narcotics Bureau may
have contributed to a
serious injustice in the sentencing of Mr
Jones.”
On October 4 last year, Deputy
Prime Minister Lionel Bowen wrote to
Premier Wran asking for early consider-
ation to be given to Jones being released
on licence. The wheels of the state bu-
reaucracy turned slowly but Jones
finally was released on parole in April.
He wants to turn his back on “the
whole scene” and go somewhere it is
possible to have nothing to do with
crime and law enforcement ... a place
where he can relax and survive.
But he will always ask if his five
months under cover were worthwhile.
His information led to no major ar-
rests, no busting of any syndicates. If
the sergeant, whom Jones believes was
honest, wanted to act, he would have
been stymied by the weight of corrupt
police between him and the frontline of
crime. And, although his reports
sparked activity in the bureau, the out-
come was the same. The politicians and
police Jones learned about those he
came to believe were corrupt - are still
in business. □

easily take on new features
when new technology comes
along. Without disturbing the
architecture of the system.
Which is why the pro-

In an open competition,
System 12 was Norway’s
choice over international com-
panies like L.M. Ericsson,
CIT Alcatel, Northern Telecom
and NEC.
Because System 12 is the
one fully digital switching network with the flexibility—in its capacity
and operation—to help Norway’s telecommunications grow well into the
next century.
How?
With fully distributed control, a patented feature of System 12.
It controls voice and data traffic, simultaneously, with many individual
microprocessors, instead of a central computer. And handles both with
equal ease.
So the system expands simply and economically For more lines or
more services.
System 12’s unique digital switch is a product of $7OO million in
research and development by ITT engineers worldwide.
This contract makes Norway one of 18 countries that has ordered
System 12.
When you consider all that System 12 will do for Norway’s telecommu-
nications today, imagine what it will do years from now.

THE ARTS
Rigby: the cartoonist
who would be Monet
“Just ask Ron if he’s got the F train in one of his tunnels.”
Globe-trotting cartoonist Paul Rigby, sports lover and jazz aficionado, is turning
his attention to painting and the prospect of returning to Australia. In New York,
JOHN EDWARDS spoke to the most illustrious member of the Murdoch mafia.
ON MOST Friday afternoons in Man-
hattan, Australian cartoonist Paul
Rigby will be leaning on a restaurant
table, fingers pressed gracefully around
his second vodka something, listening
to an amateur jazz band formed by
bank executives and advertising
salespeople. On other weekdays those
fingers will be smudged with his draw-
ing ink but on Friday, he says “I don’t
do too much work.”
Rigby is a big, avuncular man who
dresses carefully down to the hand-
kerchief in his breast pocket. He is well
built, with a broad face, a squashy nose
and slightly askew eyes. He has been a
cartoonist for 36 years now, from his
beginnings on the Perth Daily News
after World War II to the New York Post
today. He also has become, in that time,
an interesting and open man; a conviv-
ial and observant person to talk to
about cartooning, painting, Rupert
Murdoch, jazz, New York, Americans,
Australians and the pattern of his career
all subjects on which he has a lot to
say.
Characters, says Rigby, are formed
by people and places and he has trav-
elled widely and met a lot of people. He
has lived in London as well as New
York, travelled all over the world car-
tooning and he has lived for long
periods in Perth, the city in the world
most distant from any other city. Rigby
believes that New York is so interesting
its residents sleep only four or five hours
a night; in Perth, says one former resi-
dent, you can spend your entire life re-
laxing.
Rigby bridges the two worlds. He
likes sailing, tennis, eating, drinking,
talking, reading Proust and Dickens,
listening to jazz, walking through art
galleries and painting particularly
painting. After 36 years, cartooning is
less interesting to him than his exten-
sion into caricature drawing.
Rigby is serious about his cartooning
craft and more serious about the draw-
ing than the gag. “The line is every-
thing,” he says, and he wants to draw
more and cartoon less in future.
His cartoons these days are about
New York problems such as subways
and crime, with which his readers sym-
pathise readily, or they are about foot-
ball, sailing and sex. His social attitudes
generally are conservative. Women
usually appear with big breasts or stand-
ing behind ironing boards with hair in
curlers. In one cartoon he appears to
depict blacks with fat lips as criminals
and prostitutes. He says he is a cartoon-
ist so he should not be expected to have
socially balanced or representative
drawings. They are cartoons which are
enjoyed by the audience at which the
Post aims, though Rigby insists he
draws only for himself.
Only a few cartoons are about na-
tional politics and many of those are not
very good. Rigby doesn’t like the
Reagan Administration but otherwise
doesn’t seem to have much passion
about politics and it comes through. He
says: “I don’t like politicians.”
Many of his non-political cartoons
are stock situations, with well-used lines
and familiar jokes. But all of them are
drawn carefully and skilfully, often with
20 or 30 different figures, a lot of action
and complicated embellishments (such
as his boy and a dog, secreted in each


Paul Rigby at work: “I've always regarded myself first of all as an artist”
cartoon). This is the reward, he says, of
going to art school in Melbourne, then
learning technical drawing at high
school and as a fitter-armorer in the
Royal Australian Air Force.
“I probably have a fixation with try-
ing to be accurate,” he says. As a result
his drawings, spread over the width of
the tabloid Post, are usually much better
than his gags.
The best of his cartoons and they
are very good are caricatures where
the effect lies in the heightened drawing
of an absurdity. In his current book col-
lection, for example, there is a drawing
of a police car shot full of holes and
while other bullets whistle overhead one
policeman is telling another to stop
shooting back. “Drop that,” the cop is
saying, “do you wanna get busted for
brutality?”
Another has a John McEnroe
character hammering his tennis racquet
into a crushed net on a completely dev-
astated court while one umpire says to
another: “It could’ve been worse, he
could’ve lost.” Rigby’s gags about sport
are usually funnier than his gags about
politics or New York, perhaps because
sport is something that has interested
him intensely all his life.
There is also a strong streak of the
most shameless kind of sentimentality
in Rigby, which works in New York.
His prize-winning cartoon the day after
the mass bombing of American Marines
in Beirut showed one Marine hunched
crying next to a dead comrade, with the
line reading: “I’m so damned sick of
peacekeeping.”
Rigby says: “I’ve always regarded
myself first of all as an artist and now
I’ve gone back to painting. I suppose
every comedian wants to play Hamlet
and every cartoonist wants to paint. In
New York I am painting more than
ever.”
Now 59, Rigby grew up in the Mel-
bourne suburbs of Sandringham, where
his father was manager of the telephone
exchange. “The old man was very wild,”
he recalls, “A great cricketer, a good
runner. Used to go to the races quite a
bit. Left nothing except his body to the
hospital.”
In the 30s Smith’s Weekly would
have 20 or 30 cartoons in it. I can’t re-
member all the guys people such as
Phil May and Norman Lindsay but
they all came out of Sydney and Mel-
bourne art schools and they could all
draw like crazy. That’s where the Aus-
tralian tradition of cartooning came
from; what the Australians later took to
England and America.
“When I was 10 or 11 they used to
put the originals of the cartoons that
were published in Smith’s Weekly on
display in their Melbourne window. I
used to go and look reverently at that
window every week.
“In 1938 I plucked up the courage to
tell my old man I wanted to go to art
school. He asked me if I really wanted
to do it. I said I did and he said he’d try
to find the money somewhere
pounds and 15 shillings for a year. That
was the great turning point of my life.’’
But the war intervened. In Italy as a
RAAF corporal, Rigby visited the Uffizi
and the galleries of Rome and Venice.
Back in Melbourne after the war he
thought about Europe and painting and
planning to return to Italy. He also was


“No, no! RIGHT at Flatbush Avenue and LEFT at the Queensboro Bridge!”
playing a lot of tennis so he combined
both interests by going to Perth in 1948,
where he proposed to play in the West
Australian championships and get him-
self a little closer to Europe.
In Perth he was offered a job illustra-
ting for the Daily News and he was soon
drawing cartoons for it. “For about a
year the worst cartoons in the world
were published in the Daily News."
With writer Kirwan Ward, Rigby
soon had the back page of the News and
a roving assignment. “The chairman
told us to go were we liked, do what we
liked but to send stuff back every day.
Can you imagine such magnificent
treatment these days from the media
overlords? The News was going barely
100,000 copies a day. In London the
Sun was going 4 million and it would
never volunteer the same treatment to
any journalist or cartoonist.
“First we went right around Austra-
lia, then we went to America for six
months, we got into China in 1958 when
very few other journalists could get in
and subsequently we did books on
China and America.”
By 1969 Rigby was a nationally-
known cartoonist for the News Limited
papers in the East and also cartoonist
for the Daily News in Perth, where he
continued to live. He was married to
Perth reporter Marlene Cockburn and
the couple had five children.
When Murdoch bought the London
Sun and the weekly News of the World,
he asked Rigby to move to London. “It
was the Australian mafia, like in New
York today,” he says. “I was drawing
six days a week for the Sun and one day
a week for the News of the World, which
was pretty heavy going because I had to
supplement my income by drawing for
the Germans as well. It was fun but
“It could’ve been worse, he could’ve LOST. ”
there wasn’t a lot of money around at
the time. With a big family News Limit-
ed never paid quite enough to do it
right. I suppose it’s my fault for having
such a large family.”
Rigby drew for English readers for
five years from November 1969 to
November 1974 and then he returned
to Perth. “I sent the family home be-
cause I wanted them to grow up more
like Australians than like public school
kids in England. I went back to Perth
thinking I would do a bit of lotus eating
for a while and then get whatever con-
tacts in England and America I could.”
So for a couple of years Rigby was in
Perth, commuting frequently to Sydney.
He recalls that he was drinking a bit too
much in those days and one of the
causes was a sense of despondency
about Australia. The cartoonist who
loves to draw Australian ockers, who
uses the vernacular in his gags, who
even now in New York can talk in a
rhyming slang unintelligible to Ameri-
cans, returned from England to find
Australia less attractive than when he
had left.
“I was a bit depressed about it,” he
remembers, “because it was so much
more confused than it had been in 1969.
I thought it had lost its track. All this

bonzer beauty business over
Australianism. I think Australia should
be tied more closely to Asian and other
older cultures. We can’t beat the world
on our own.”
In Perth, Rigby had resumed a
lifestyle of tennis, golf, swimming and
weekends on Rottnest Island. It was a
good life but when Murdoch bought the
New York Post he called Rigby to ask
him to come across. Rigby wanted to
stay for six months; Murdoch suggested
a year. So far Rigby has stayed seven
and half years and only now is thinking
of returning to Perth, perhaps in time
for the America’s Cup in 1986-87.
One of the principal members of the
mafia Murdoch took to London and
then New York, Rigby today has only a
distant relationship with the media
owner. “We used to be friends,” he says,
“but he’s too busy for everyone at the
moment. I’ve known the days when he
used to play two-up and rush around
and get a blonde and that sort of stuff
but it doesn’t happen now. He’s far too
busy.
“My arrangement with Rupert now
is that I don’t buy newspapers and he
doesn’t draw cartoons. I don’t see a lot
of him. He came down to be photo-
graphed by Newsweek standing near my
desk and I was asking him about his
boys and he wasn’t really listening to
me. He wasn’t thinking about what I
was saying. It’s pretty sad, that.
“I think there is still an underlying
friendship there, otherwise I would not
still be around the place. I’d rather be
fishing or something. I’ve always had
the feeling and I’m talking about my-
self and three or four other Aussies who
travelled with him over the years that
in a pinch the solid basis of it is still
there. But at other times you feel he has
forgotten we travelled with him in the
hard early days.”
Rigby’s taste in painting is conserva-
tive. He paints in an impressionist man-
ner, often water subjects in the style of
Monet. He likes plenty of color and a
fairly literal rendering of his subject. He
once told Murdoch that a Fred Williams
painting in his lobby was “A bunch of
crap” and he still wonders why anyone
went for Sid Nolan’s early Ned Kelly
series: “The constable standing on his
head and so on.”
He says: “It’s hard to tell me there
are better painters than Arthur Streeton
or Bill Dobell. If anyone tries to tell me
there is a better painter than Tommy
Roberts .. . When abstractionists
started out in Australia in the 20s and
30s everyone jumped on the bandwagon
because it is an easy way out. Then it
takes another couple of generations to
get them back to painting.
“Maybe I’m just a traditionalist who
appreciates academic painting. I don’t
know. My problem is that when you
have to draw meticulously and intensely
every day you can’t move easily to a
more fluid line. So what should I do?
Throw away the meticulous line and go
with impressionism? It’s hard to do
both but I try.
“I’m getting to the stage economi-
cally where I could stop cartooning. I’m
looking forward to the day when I can
do exactly what I like. I think I can be
something approaching a line man in
drawing and also an impressionist
painter. It’s not a bad double if you can
do it.”
Rigby says he’s like a fox among the
rabbits in New York. He doesn’t know
where to turn. “This is a village,” he
says, “where everyone adopts different
channels. One day I’ll be up the Frick
Collection and the next I’ll be down as
far as you can be in Chinatown or Little
Italy. There’s no other town in the world
where you can change character so
quickly.
“You can do whatever you like here.
I’m pretty gregarious. I don’t mind hit-
ting the town with a bunch of guys; I
don’t look for it but I don’t mind doing
it occasionally. But I also like my an-
onymity. Fridays I like to hear some
jazz. I like to do it on my own, unless
there is some nice lady who wants to
come and enjoy it with me.
“I can’t remember when I was last
bored or sat around doing nothing.” □


THEATRE
When a role
becomes
the dole
By SHELLEY NELLER
DOWN and Out in Sydney and Mel-
bourne (and the other capitals, for that
matter) is not an antipodean adaptation
of George Orwell’s classic work. It’s a
condition prevalent among the nation’s
6800 actors at least 85 percent of
whom are out of work at any given time.
Those most committed to the stage
are the hardest hit. Their opportunities
are diminishing rapidly as the Austra-
lian theatre struggles to survive financi-
ally. With the average weekly wage in
theatre running at approximately $3OO,
even an established actor might be
lucky to earn much more than $lO,OOO a
year from intermittent work.
How actors survive, financially and
emotionally, during their unemployed
stints is an unglamorous and little-re-
ported aspect of their profession.
It is one of particular interest and
concern to Mark Minchington, 28, of
Melbourne. He has formed a workshop
group with other actors because, as he
says: “Most actors are out of work for a
lot of the time and can easily lose touch
and lose confidence. There aren’t
enough opportunities for actors to get
together and simply work and share
ideas and skills.”
Minchington has been acting since
1977 when he first trod the boards in
student productions at Monash Univer-
sity. For the past six years he has acted
professionally; for one-third of that
time he was unemployed.
In the good times he appeared in
some acclaimed plays at Melbourne’s
Pram Factory, spent some time as direc-
tor-in-residence at Monash University,
taught acting at the West Australian In-
stitute of Technology and played in The
Sullivans and the Australian film, The
Clinic.
During the tough times he struggled
on the dole because he prefers to be
poor than to work at something other
than acting. Currently he is the Duke of
Albany in the Nimrod’s new super-pro-
duction of King Lear at Sydney’s Sey-
mour Centre.
It was Minchington’s experience
since moving to Sydney earlier this year
which prompted him to form the actors’
workshop. “In Sydney, I’ve felt very
isolated as an actor; lost in an urban
environment. I think there’s a greater
tradition of actors coming together in
Melbourne. It’s easier physically to
travel around and the nature of theatre
there always has been more radical.”
John Howard (left) and Mark Minchington: actors need a place to exercise their talents
Fellow actor John Howard, who tri-
umphed recently in the Sydney Theatre
Company’s production of Nicholas
Nickleby and who plays the Duke of
Kent in King Lear, agrees: “The sup-
portive attitude among actors has not
been ratified in Sydney, where there’s a
prevailing employee mentality and less
individual motivation.”
If he is out of work for any length of
time, Howard busks. But before he
started to get regular acting work he
performed as a laborer, factory as-
sembler, dishwasher, waiter, cleaner
and dirt shoveller in Sydney’s Botanic
Gardens.
The out-of-work experience erodes
an actor’s confidence. “By the third
week,” Howard said, “I’ve lost my self-
esteem and I’m asking myself if I still
have the talents I had a month ago.”
Most actors have an enormous
amount of spare time on their hands,
according to Howard and Minchington.
Minchington said: “Unless you have
a non-acting job or you are self-
motivated enough to have some person-
al work to do such as writing, you spend
most of the time moping. It’s vital for
actors to come together to assert their
own power. It’s the small groups who
often develop the most innovative ideas
on a shoestring. We need more self-
starters such as Circus Oz.”
Some training institutions were more
adept at teaching artists how to organise
themselves and their own projects,
Minchington said. The Victorian Col-
lege of the Arts was brilliant at it, where-
as NIDA prepared students in a more
formal way.
Howard cited the example of the
Griffin Theatre Company, which was
started by unemployed actors. It had
grown in size and stature and now
received government funding.
Minchington said: “There is a huge
need for a positive place for actors to go
to work and exercise their talents, albeit
without income. They need to feel in
touch with what’s happening in theatre.
But usually they are so preoccupied
with survival there is little energy left
over to devote to technique.”
In Sydney, Minchington and his
workshop group meet once or twice a
week. They aim to expand their areas of
theatrical expertise. “We want to do
more exploratory work the nature of
performance, the actor-audience rela-
tionship.”
Apart from film and television roles,
actors’ wages are pitifully low in pro-
portion to their skill. They adopt a re-
signed attitude to this long-standing sit-
uation, acknowledging the tired “for
love, not money” aphorism.
But in the lean times, they insist, an
actors’ workshop is vital, providing
commodities which are as important as
income hope and inspiration. □

FILMS
Institute
faces new
confusion
By SANDRA HALL
THREE YEARS AGO, when the Aus-
tralian Film Institute hired Kathleen
Norris as its executive director largely
on her reputation as a fund-raiser the
hope was that she would settle some
long-standing disagreements about how
the organisation should be run, while
whittling down its $40,000 deficit.
But things didn’t turn out that way.
As the administrative staff grew larger
and the AFl’s annual awards nights be-
came more elaborate, the deficit in-
creased until the recent announcement
by the new director, Frank Maloney,
that the organisation was closing its
three theatres and retrenching 24 mem-
bers of its staff in an effort to wipe out a
deficit of $240,000.
Even before Norris’s arrival, book-
keeping was not one of the AFl’s
strengths and to her credit, say members
of her staff, she did put an accountant
on staff. However, the effect of this
appointment, they add, was diluted
slightly by a certain vagueness about
budgeting.
For the past two years, the AFI had
failed to meet its projected income fig-
ures and the Australian Film Commis-
sion, which supplies 30 percent of the
institute’s funds, had been pressing it to
tackle its deficit.
If the AFl’s financial confusions are
severe, its cultural confusions are worse.
In 1979, when it merged with the Na-
tional Film Theatre, the idea was that it
should take over the NFT’s role (the in-
telligent programming of new and com-
mercially risky films which otherwise
would not be seen here), while helping
to promote cinema as an art form and
Australian cinema in particular, with a
bias towards low-budget independent
film-making.
But that delicate balance was never
achieved. Ninety percent of AFI mem-
bers, it is estimated, join only so they
can go along to the screenings of new
Australian feature films held as part of
the AFI awards each year; and many
NFT members (there were 10,000 of
them in 1978 shortly before the merger)
have lost interest. They began to drift
away when the terms of the merger gave
AFI members a better deal than NFT
members received. Membership of the
organisation now stands at 3500.
Not that Norris hasn’t been energetic
in the programming area, mounting a
series of extensively-advertised Nation-
al Film Events seasons highlighting
the work of particular directors (Rainer
Werner Fassbinder and Japanese direc-
tor Shohei Imamura were two) but
these have been criticised for the cost-
liness of their promotions and for the
fact that they haven’t been enough to
give AFI programming a distinctive
character.
The AFI has failed to convince
specialist audiences that it’s offering any
more than they can see on the in-
creasingly vigorous commercial art
house circuit.
As well, audiences outside Sydney
and Melbourne, where small specialist
cinemas are rare, have been complain-
ing that they are not getting enough AFI
films. It is felt generally that, in the old
days of the National Film Theatre, more
films were screened in more places more
cheaply and with greater attention to
setting each season in context.
The announcement that the AFI had
decided to close its three theatres the
Chauvel in Sydney, the Longford in
Melbourne and the State in Hobart
couldn’t have come at a worse time for
the Australian Film Commission.
(Hence discussions last week between
the AFC and independent film-makers
over the possibility of averting closures.
And more talks this week between the
AFC and the full board of the AFI.)
The AFC has been mulling over all
these questions for some time and is
about to deliver the result as part of its
Cultural Activities Review which has
been prepared by its Creative Develop-
ment Branch.
It is expected that the review will rec-
ommend a course more in line with the
old NFT policies but it will be difficult
to carry through if the AFI has no
theatres, since rental costs would triple
screening overheads.
The sale of Hobart’s State theatre
alone probably would wipe out a large
part of the AFl’s deficit but it also
would mean the loss of a considerable
asset, since the State has been drawing
consistently large houses as one of the
only theatres in Tasmania where foreign
language films are screened. □

OPERA
‘Fly’ might
not get off
the ground
Val Mills, Margaret Haggart, Anthony Roden and Christine Ferraro in Fly: far too little drama
By JOHN CARGHER
CAN A failure be a success? An Austra-
lian composer, Barry Conyngham, has
been given the chance to write a full-
length opera, Fly, and to have it staged
in the largest and most modern opera
theatre in this country. The Victoria
State Opera must be congratulated on
its boldness and on the fact that no ex-
pense was spared on what was, at best, a
speculative venture.
Contemporary operas (of any na-
tionality) which have achieved any kind
of success and there have been quite a
few, in spite of the public’s aversion to
the genre invariably have had brilli-
ant libretti, often with startling subjects
backed by revolutionary staging tech-
niques. None, as far as I know, survives
solely on the merits of its music, as do
most of the 19th century works which
fill opera houses week after week.
Conyngham and his librettist/
producer Murray Copeland have
chosen to reverse this pattern. Time will
tell whether Conyngham’s music, which
is Fly 5 strength, is good enough to over-
come his chosen subject, which is fail-
ure.
Lawrence Hargrave has been im-
mortalised on the back of our $2O note
as a pioneer in the development of avi-
ation even before the Wright brothers.
According to Copeland, who seems to
have done his homework with some
thoroughness, he was not worthy of the
honor. The opera shows us a weak man
obsessed with an unattainable ideal,
who does not reach this or any other
goal in life.
It is not the sort of thing to stir the
blood or even our desperate attempts at
national pride. You cannot make a hero
out of an inventor who in a 1984 opera
“asserts his conviction that (the power-
ed aeroplane) is only the first step
toward flying machines with bird-like
flapping wings.”
We are not offered even a share of
the frustrated idealist, no part of his
work, no model of anything on which
he is working. Most of the action re-
volves around the domestic life of this
deadly dull man. A flashback to an ex-
pedition up the Fly River in New
Guinea 30 years earlier adds so little
that it seems no more than an excuse to
make the dreadful pun of the opera’s
title.
Much is made of a quote from
Milton’s Lycidas “Fame is the spur
...” yet Hargrave to the end refuses
that fame, if it was ever in his grasp. His
psychological motivation may be clear
to Copeland but I defy any member of
the audience to understand it.
Accompanying the two hours of
non-action is something totally different
from the music Conyngham usually
serves up. He has, in fact, written a good
old-fashioned opera, complete with mo-
tifs, tunes and continuity. If echoes
abound, they are not the usual echoes of
atonality, percussion and Sprechgesang
which haunt the modern opera scene.
They do not echo Puccini or Verdi,
of course unless you count an un-
necessary rendering of La donna e mo-
bile but Debussy or, if we want to be
patriotic, Alfred Hill. If Hill had not
stood still musically throughout his long
life, his work might well have developed
into what Conyngham has done here.
The VSO has served Conyngham
well in casting and production.
Copeland must blame himself for the
minor blemishes, which are easily re-
moved. Hargrave’s voice-overs blast
like God proclaiming the last trump and
two explorers in the rain forests of New
Guinea beating the “primeval, feverous,
devious, dawdling river” do so in spot-
less white attire on the straight-from-
Harrods steamship.
The ship and the Hargrave family
mansion are beautifully designed and
executed by Shaun Gurton, giving the
production in the brand new theatre a
tremendous lift. Anthony Roden acts
and sings Hargrave with almost too
much realism; the man is such a wimp
that it is hard to feel sorry for him, let
alone to admire him.
Margaret Haggart (Mrs Hargrave),
Val Mills and Christine Ferraro (their
children) sing cleanly and clearly the
mundane words put into their mouths
and John Wood’s usual professionalism
is negated only because, as the Italian
leader of the Fly River expedition, he
speaks excellent English after Hargrave
has made extensive fun of his “zees”
and “zat” market-garden accent.
The übiquitous John Hopkins was a
tower of strength in the pit and not a
single scratch was heard from the
scratch VSO Orchestra. Hopkins rather
than Hargrave was the hero of the even-
ing.
One must welcome the appearance
of any opera constructed so well musi-
cally which follows the current trend
away from dissonance. Yet opera is
drama with music, not music with
drama and there is far too little of the
latter. It is the subject, not the music,
which keeps Fly grounded. □

BOOKS
A personal
view of our
literature
By GERARD WINDSOR
Snow on the Saltbush: the Austra-
lian Literary Experience, by
Geoffrey Dutton. The Viking Press,
$24.95.
NATIONALISM is a dicey animal with
which to play. Like an after-hours
guard-dog in a butcher’s shop; useful,
probably even necessary, but likely to
get out of hand.
Australia’s sporting nationalism gets
embarrassingly out of hand but cultural
nationalism is often a cringing, pretty
anaemic pup. Geoffrey Dutton’s Snow
on the Saltbush focuses primarily on
what’s been wrong with the beast and
how and why it now seems to be rather
healthier. As a poet, novelist, publisher,
editor and essayist, Dutton has been a
great initiator of literature in this
country and this book has the character
of being the fruits of the experience.
Its concern is with those abiding and
complex questions: how far should na-
tionalism go in Australian writing; what
form should it take; and will Austra-
lians believe in, buy and read their own
literature as readily as they will the
overseas product?
Snow on the Saltbush does not at-
tempt a methodical answer to these
questions. In some ways this is a pity.
The book shows too many signs of
haste, of arguments only half-started, of
stock responses rolled out too uncritic-
ally and of individual impressions and
encounters being substituted for solid
research.
The positive side of this failing is that
Dutton has determined to write a per-
sonal book on Australian literature as
opposed to what he would regard as an
academic work. Three years ago he ex-
pressed, with marginally more fire than
nearly everyone else, his horror at The
Oxford History of Australian Literature.
Snow on the Saltbush is his longer-
term riposte. In contrast to Oxford’s
book, written by a committee, Dutton
has produced a highly idiosyncratic col-
lection of essays. And the best parts of it
are the most personal.
Throughout much of the book
Dutton is trail-blazing. He has lots of
good quirky ideas for literary investiga-
tion. He has essays on the nurture given
to Australian writing by both school
and university magazines. His con-
clusion is that “the genuinely Australian
content in school magazines is almost
solely represented by The Bush, with an
occasional foray into The Surf or a re-
spectful nod to Anzac. The Australian
vernacular idiom scarcely appears at all
... for all those children literature, and
the life that could be expressed in litera-
ture, existed far away, in England’s
green and pleasant land.”
But he has much fun on the way to
this summary. In Adelaide, St Peter’s
College Magazine for 1926 prescribe for
its literateurs: “Literary achievement
does not consist of railings at authority
... There are countless other subjects
worthy of our attention dawn or
death or something.”
Catholic pupils seemed to have a
good knowledge of Australian ballads
but the Xavier magazine was “devoid of
Geoffrey Dutton: idiosyncratic collection of essays
literary merit ... indeed of any literary
attempts at all.” In 1926 it had one
poem, The Golden Rain, by Anon,
“touting for subscriptions to build a gi-
gantic memorial chapel.”
Plans conceived by fertile brain
Fit for Italy or Spain:
Work that pleadeth yet again
“Send along the Golden Rain. ”
The school that stands head and hips
above all others is Sydney’s Fort Street
Boys High School, nursery of almost as
many men of letters as jurists. The
Fortian was edited and with sophisti-
cated literary awareness by such
lights as George Mackaness, H. V.
Evatt, Guy Howarth, Harold Stewart,
James McAuley and Eric Rolls.
“Australian university magazines,”
Dutton judges, “are mostly monuments
to the profound conservatism of the
teachers and the intellectual timidity of
the students and to the distrust of litera-
ture and poetry in particular
among the student body.”
The exceptions provide interesting
views into the literary apprenticeships
of the great. Hermes, at Sydney Univer-
sity, was rescued by James McAuley
and then Dorothy Auchterlonie (Green)
but became very dull under the next edi-
tor, E. Gough Whitlam, who tried to in-
volve “the technical and sociological
faculties.”
Elsewhere Dutton quotes an “aston-
ishingly rare example of irreverent com-
ment.” Two poems, signed by “Scum,”
appeared in Black Swan, at the Univer-
sity of WA in October 1920, just before
the Prince of Wales arrived. Loyal Ode
began:
We are the people of the
great White Australian
continent
At least, we wish it was
white, but only the
Chows do the washing
properly
At any rate the workers are
white white to the core
bled white by the profi-
teers
Anzac:
We didn’t go ourselves but
someone had to stay be-
hind in order to send
them ...
One chapter, “Snowstorms
and Duststorms,” is an ex-
cerpt from a possible Dutton
autobiography. It is also the
most absorbing and valuable
section in the book. It re-
counts the establishment of
Australian Penguins in the
early 19605. The chapter is
drawn largely from Dutton’s
correspondence and illus-
trates richly the vagaries of
Anglo-Australian relations,
indigenous versus foreign
publishing and the mechanics of getting
books off the ground.
Norman Lindsay, a man of 82, was
opposed fiercely to paperbacks as un-
dignified and also to Allen Lane “I’d
see the bastard in hell before I’d have
any further contact with him” and his
father “the original John Lane, who I
had dealings with in London in the year
1910, was a crook of the first magnatude
[sic].”
This dire warning did not stop Pen-
guin Australia in their tracks and they
went on to great things. Probably their
greatest success was The Lucky Country.
Max Harris suggested the idea of the
book to Donald Horne, Dutton himself
suggested Horne’s own phrase “the


lucky country” be used as the title and
Penguin UK more than suggested they
didn’t want to know about it. Dutton
claims its sales have been 250,000.
Personal though Snow on the
Saltbush is, it shows only the modest tip
of one man’s generous dedication to
Australian culture. □
Class will
tell - and
brightly
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Caste Marks: Style And Status In
The USA, by Paul Fussell.
Heinemann, $16.95.
THE FIRST difficulty that people have
with the idea of class distinction, ac-
cording to the author of this entertain-
ing book, is to admit that it exists. The
second is to take it too seriously. We
have recently seen where it can lead, in
the case of Ronald Merrick the villain
in The Jewel In The Crown, the tele-
vision version of Paul Scott’s Raj Quar-
tet. Merrick’s life was flawed, in his
opinion, by his not having gone to a
first-rate public school. Ron let class get
him down.
But for these occasional dire conse-
quences, caste or class distinction is
mostly funny, a subject for entertain-
ment, which Paul Fussell a man with
an inquiring mind and a satirical way of
putting things has discovered.
Fussell is a quirky man, an English
academic, professor of English at the
University of Pennsylvania in the US,
specialising in 18th century writing. He
is the author of scholarly books and a
couple of others which fall into the
category of pop sociology, a description
he might not like. These are Abroad:
British Travelling Between The Wars and
The Boy Scout Handbook And Other
Observations, a collection of essays.
There is also his serious and very mov-
ing The Great War And Modern Mem-
ory.
Writers before Fussell have punc-
tured the illusion that America is a
classless society beginning with
French historian Alexis de Tocqueville
who visited the US and reported that
“in egalitarian atmospheres man’s
hopes and desires are oftener blasted,
the soul is more stricken and per-
turbed ...”
The fascinating thing is that the Aus-
tralian class structure so much re-
sembles, though in a modified way, the
American class structure.
Some people would settle for there
being only two classes in all societies
‘Australia feels
as if it had never
been 10ved...”

D. H. Lawrence wrote that, 62 years ago, during
his short visit to Australia. Today, a few years from our
Bicentenary, has anything changed?
A Different Light is a timely and refreshingly
candid book which offers a unique perspective on the
relationship between Australians and their land.
With his stunning photographs and evocative
essays, the result of an epic solo journey round Australia,
British'born photojournalist John Peel makes a remarkable
plea for the country he has grown to love.
A Different Light challenges all Australians to
reappraise their own love and understanding of this
extraordinary continent.
It is indeed a book for all Australians.

the rich and the poor. But this would
not suit Fussell who goes for nine:
Top out-of-sight
Upper
Upper middle
Middle
High proletarian
Mid-proletarian
Low proletarian
Destitute
Bottom out-of-sight
TOP out-of-sight and Bottom out-of-
sight share a quality: invisibility to the
other classes. Top out-of-sight people
live behind high walls; they are in a
state of siege. Bottom out-of-sight have
fallen below even the destitute; they
stay in their welfare rooms all day.
Before launching himself on seven
chapters of analysis of class, Fussell
strikes a cautionary note. “The force of
sheer class envy,” he writes, “behind
vile and even criminal behaviour in this
country (the US), the result in part of
disillusion over the official myth of
classlessness, should never be
underestimated. The person who, par-
king his attractive car in a large city, has
returned to find his windows smashed
and his radio aerial snapped off will
understand what I mean.”
Fussell is not intent on doing a
Nancy Mitford. Nor does he show pref-
erence for any of his classes, nor even
sympathy for the Bottom out-of-sight. If
he writes more about the Upper and
Middles it is because they
offer the richest material, as it
is in their interest as climbers
and status-seekers to have an
elaborate proliferation of
rules, an accretion of myths
and hastily assembled tra-
ditions all boosting their self-
importance and fending off
the lesser breeds.
A characteristic of Uppers
and Middles is euphemism
such as toilet for lavatory and
hand-crafted for handmade
and drink problem for drunk-
enness and embellishment,
such as glassware for wine
glasses and cookware for
saucepans and so on.
The book is not trivial. The
USA is one of the two most
powerful nations in the world
and shares control of our des-
tinies, so everything we can
know about its citizens is
worth knowing especially if
it helps us to know about our-
selves.
The book has an appendix
with a Mail Bag and Exercises
in which the reader can score
points indicating to which
class he or she may aspire. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Carmen as seen by Lionel Lindsay
by Patricia Rolfe
THE UNSINKABLE Irishman Richard
Griffin has just published Prosper Mer-
imee’s Carmen with the illustrations
done in Spain in 1902 by Lionel
Lindsay. This is a limited edition of 250
copies, signed by Peter Lindsay, at $225,
with some reserved for The Australian
Opera. A simpler, trade edition will be
published in October at $25.
At the age of 27 Lionel Lindsay saw
Agnes Jenson in Bizet’s Carmen at the
Melbourne Theatre and decided at once
to go to Spain to illustrate the Merimee
story. An edition of Carmen with
Lindsay’s illustrations was planned in
1902 but never came to anything.
Griffin did his own fairly free trans-
lation for this edition and is not sure
how this will be received by a direct de-
scendant of Merimee at present with the
French embassy in Canberra. Griffin
designed the limited edition in the style
of the Rackham and Dulac books of the
period, with tinted borders and two
hand-tipped color plates.
Griffin, who says he has just “fled”
Melbourne for Sydney, will publish
Brief Encounters, pieces by Sydney jour-
nalist Ron Saw and illustrated by
Donald Friend, in November.
Lionel Lindsay’s cover illustration from Carmen
WHEN BRITISH doctor David Hol-
lands was thinking of buying a practice
in south-eastern Victoria, he was driven
up toward the Snowy and, behold, a
single swamp harrier rose into the sky.
Hollands was sold and settled in
Orbost.
Now, 20 years, nine cameras and two
four-wheel-drive vehicles later and 40
years after he took his first bird photo-
graph, Hollands has finished his first
bird book.
The Birds of Prey of Australia will be
published by Nelson next month. With
60 color plates, it covers all Australia’s
24 birds of prey and Hollands has writ-
ten the text.
Hollands found many of his birds in
the Gippsland but covered much of in-
land Australia in quest of others. On
one occasion he made a non-stop
1800 km trip to Innaminka on the
chance of a sighting. The search for the
red goshawk took him almost to the top
of Cape York.
Many of these birds are nomadic
rather than migratory and Hollands had
to follow them as they followed rain
and other favorable conditions.
MURIEL SPARK has said
that savage ridicule is “the
only honorable weapon we
have left” and no one wields it
more adroitly than she. Her
new novel, The Only Problem,
will come from Cape in
October.
In it, the leading character
is writing a monograph on the
Book of Job while his wife
graduates from stealing choc-
olate bars in supermarkets to
becoming a full-blown revol-
utionary.
Living in Italy, Spark has
been interested in the Red
Brigade and related modern
anarchies. In some ways,
however, she is still an old-
fashioned Scot. Asked by an
interviewer if she were not
writing her novels on a word
processor, she had her answer
ready: “No, I still write with a
pen, in notebooks that I order
from James Thin, the station-
er, in Chambers Street in
Edinburgh, my home town.
Each notebook has 72 pages. I
write on every other line, on
one side of the page. It adds
up.” □

The similarities between Hawke and Stone
DAVID M c NICOLL
THERE ARE many similarities be-
tween Prime Minister Hawke and re-
tiring Treasury Secretary John Stone.
They were both born in 1929, both
went to Perth Modern School, both
went to Perth University, both became
Rhodes scholars and went to Oxford.
And, if you happened to watch the tele-
vision snippets of Stone delivering his
recipe for survival, you may have noted
his tight-lipped manner of speaking,
very similar to the Prime Minister’s.
On the subject of politics and tele-
vision, I thought Paul Keating delivered
his budget in admirable fashion and was
not fazed by the occasional shrill female
cries from the public gallery and the un-
mannerly interjections from some of the
members. But one swallow doesn’t
make a summer, nor does one good par-
liamentary performance mean that
televised parliament will be worth
while. Most of the time it will be
stiflingly boring. But if it comes about,
there will be one bonus: members will
spend more time in the chamber where
they should be; there will be less som-
nolence; and there will be fewer in-
stances of members behaving like re-
tarded yahoos.
PEOPLE WITH private or “hobby”
oyster leases have always seemed to me
to approximate “Pitt Street farmers.”
But the days of the amateur oyster lessee
may be numbered, as I found out when
I was approached for help by a small
deputation of growers down at
Narooma.
The NSW Government, ostensibly to
“clean up waterways,” is now examin-
ing all oyster leases in the state to pin-
point what they regard as non-produc-
tive or non-commercial holdings. These
leases will be cancelled (without com-
pensation) and the areas “cleared of
cultivation equipment and returned to
the public.”
The hobby and part-time oyster
lessees are hopping mad, because they
suspect the move follows pressure from
the big commercial producers who
don’t like amateurs producing oysters
and cutting into the professional mar-
ket.
It is a complex question and the De-
partment of Agriculture and the
Fisheries people to whom I spoke have
very persuasive arguments to support
their actions. It was pointed out that
many leases are in a disgraceful condi-
tion (with which one must agree) and
that anyone affected is at liberty to ap-
Stone: a Hawkish, tight-lipped manner of speaking
peal. The spokesmen gave a categorical
assurance that the leases would not be
transferred to other people.
It seems a bit rough on people who
have had leases for years and have
grown oysters for family and friends.
But the ever-growing movement of re-
tired people and holiday-makers to the
coast means that every inch of foreshore
becomes more precious daily.
FORMER NSW premier Tom Lewis,
back from travels, brings news of Bruce
Beresford’s latest film, King David,
filmed in Italy and starring Richard
Gere and Edward Woodward.
Beresford’s King David, according to
American journalists who have been on
the set, is different from the usual con-
cept of David. He is a womaniser who
kills indiscriminately (including the
husband of the woman he wants,
Bathsheba), conquers vast territories but
endures a tragic family life. Despite the
unsympathetic depiction of David, Is-
rael wanted to have the film made with-
in its borders but Beresford opted for
Italy, where he and his Australian cam-
eraman Don McAlpine found the ideal
locations but were bugged by foul
weather and even snow not the best
background for desert scenes.
The religious adviser to the film,
Rabbi Jonathon Magonet, of the Leo
Baeck College, London, remarked that
the only Old Testament
character absent from the film
was God.
EVERYONE knew that
Japan had kicked the stuffing
out of the Swiss watchmakers
in recent years but I hadn’t
realised that 600 Swiss watch-
makers have gone broke in 10
years and the Swiss share of
the watch business declined
from 70 percent to 20 percent.
Dr Jacques Irniger, who
paid us a flying visit last week,
told how the Swiss had de-
cided to fight back against the
Japanese domination. The
watchmakers got together,
persuaded the gnomes of Zur-
ich to put up about $5OO mil-
lion and went to work devis-
ing a watch which didn’t need
winding, worked under water,
looked good and didn’t cost
too much. The product they
came up with has the rather
corny name of Swatch and
more than a million have been sold
since March of last year. It will give the
Japanese a real run for their money.
NOW THAT wine is hit with tax, the
struggle among Australian winemakers
to survive and prosper will be keener
than ever. From my experience in the
past couple of weeks the Hunter and the
Barossa are going to be up against in-
creasingly tough competition.
First of all, Western Australia. Last
week Peter Thompson, boss of Sydney’s
Sheraton-Wentworth, put on a great
lunch to let us taste the award-winning
wines from Western Australia. Some of
the gold medal winners were outstand-
ing a young Plantagenet Bindoon
Chenin Blanc and a 1983 Houghton
Auslese Rhine Riesling getting my pat.
In Melbourne, I was privileged to set
forth from Frank Christie’s snug Hilton
hostelry and proceed to the Yarra Val-
ley with four of Australia’s top wine ex-
perts. Listening to them, it was apparent
that Yarra Valley wines now rank with,
or even outrank, most other Australian
wines. We visited Mount Mary and
Yarra Yering at these vineyards the
entire production of some lines is sold
before it is even bottled.
We all know that cheaper ranges of
imported wines are flooding into Aus-
tralia. I think it is up to us to drink Aus-
tralian wine whenever we can. □

In Australia where the language has
been affronting the Brits for nigh on 200
years, strange things are happening to
the Sino-Japanese culture. Two home-

named Laurie Smith and Peter Barker, a
Melbourne teacher became the first
foreigners selected to undergo a United
Nations interpreter course run in China.
And a 38-year-old American named
Jane Lindner who now lives in Australia
began planning to teach her Dynamic
(speed) Reading to people in Japan.
The Bulletin’s big sister, The Australian
Women’s Weekly, is treading new
ground (yet again) in magazine publish-

at $3.60. Says Weekly editor Dawn
Swain: “It’s terrific to be successful
enough to be able to give your readers
something extra.”


If something is said or written wrongly
often enough, eventually it becomes

wife of Sir Warwick, is so determined to
have it understood that she sends out

nothing to the more obtuse newspapers

Peter Abeles (the new chairman of the
Opera Foundation of Australia), at the
Fairfax cottage at Double Bay, wrote
about not only “Lady Mary Fairfax”
but also about Sir Peter’s wife, “Mrs
Abeles.”

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
A lament for the All Australian Car
I HAVE been wondering whether we
should have a funeral or perhaps erect a
beautiful bronze statue at Fisherman’s
Bend. The statue would be in loving
memory of the Australian automobile.
The statue would be something in the
style of the Queen Victoria monument.
We would have a beautiful Corinthian
column with a sparkling FJ Holden sit-
ting on the top. Trailed around the col-
umn we would have sprigs of wattle and
bottle brush.
Then down at the bottom
there would be a kangaroo, a
koala, an emu and some busty
virgins in their nighties gazing
adoringly upwards.
Not many of you in the
audience can remember that
beautiful period of optimism
when the Holden was born.
There had been talk about it
for a full year. I remember the
Herald had photographers
planted and they got a picture
of the new mystery car on the
road at Upper Beaconsfield a
year before it was released.
IS THIS AUSTRALIA’S
NEW CAR? was the head-
line. In those days it was a
better scoop even than finding
out the name of the next
governor-general or the date
of the next royal tour. A car sensibly
free of all ornament, they said, a cross
between a small Buick and a Pontiac.
The launching took place at GM-H
Fisherman’s Bend on November 28,
1948, in the presence of Prime Minister
Ben Chifley and Tom Hollway, Premier
of Victoria. The curtains went up, there
were the lovely strains of Brahms’ Waltz
in A Flat and 10, there it was: gleaming,
beautiful, triumphant.
There were all the appropriate
speeches. Chifley told what this would
do for Australia, what this would do for
our defence. Never again would we be
in a position where we wouldn’t be
making our own motor vehicles.
Of course, like everything else in
1948, it was in desperate short supply.
My father, by some miracle which
maybe he understood, got one in
February 1949. Until then I had driven
only my brother’s tiny drophead Mor-
ris. This was like moving from a DH
Dragon Rapide to a Douglas DC3.
It gleamed and had extraordinary re-
sponse when you put your foot down. It
had nothing fancy like heating, or even
comfortable seats; just bench seats front
and back. It cost 760 pounds on the
road and the ads were claiming that it
would do 39 miles to the gallon. An ec-
static Melbourne Sun reporter did drive
one from the city to San Remo and back
and reported that his new Holden did
indeed perform at 37.5 mpg.
Motoring writers gave glowing re-
ports. Some said it was a little light, one
reported that the steering wasn’t very re-
sponsive. However, it was all right when
you got used to it. My father let me
Prime Minister Ben Chifley launches the first Holden
drive the new Holden. The effect of
driving the Holden, down Toorak
Road, in automobile-starved Mel-
bourne was like a royal progress.
Every head turned. And when one
parked, a mob crowded all around to
inspect, the sort of impression one
might get parking a Ford Thunderbird
in downtown Beijing.
I think it was the third week of own-
ership. I was driving home from a wed-
ding with the young lady who was to be
my wife. At an intersection in Haw-
thorn, I didn’t quite manage to avoid a
car on my right. He caught my rear
bumper, we went into a spin and came
to rest against a lamp post.
We were unhurt but the exquisite
new Holden was hideously bent. I can’t
tell you the agony of that next hour.
How was I going to face my father and
tell him his new Holden, 104th off the
production line, was mangled. I con-
fronted him in the living-room at lam.
He listened carefully, looked terribly
sad, asked about our health before the
car and never again did he say another
word. I’ll never forget his kindly hu-
manity on that night.
By the time our poor Holden was un-
bent everybody had one and for us it
was just the first in a long dynasty of
Holdens. Now can we really call it the
all Australian car?
We have been searching round for an
appropriate new name for our beloved
organisation at Fisherman’s Bend.
Should we call it Yaka-Moto or should
it be Niss-Olden? Our own home-de-
signed, home-produced car isn’t there
any more. Last month your pioneer was
in Denmark and he was de-
lighted to observe that the
streets were filled with Holden
Commodores. On closer in-
spection they proved to be
German Opels.
So as an old Holden man
you can imagine my grief and
shock when I read that GM-H
is phasing out its famous six-
cylinder engine at the end of
the year. In its place GM-H
will use Japanese-designed
Nissan engines. The paltry ex-
cuse was that the six-cylinder
engine was too difficult to
convert to the unleaded petrol
which was to be introduced in
1985.
We have unhappy fore-
bodings about the unleaded
petrol anyway. Already our
motoring writers are calling it ULP! ...
ULP! is the new cry of pain. Now we
don’t really know where we are. GM-H
has released the Astra, which apparent-
ly is identical to the Nissan Pulsar. You
can feel for the poor car dealers, say a
character in Manangatang West who
may have the agency for both compan-
ies. He is obliged to sell his Astra in one
showroom and his Pulsar in another.
So do we really understand anything
any more? GM-H and Nissan are in bed
together and I understand that Nissan is
also doing a lot of sleeping around with
Alfa Romeo. Ford is holding hands
with Mazda. Is there really any differ-
ence between a Ford Telstar and a
Mazda 626? Leyland is practically the
de facto of Honda and Chrysler in the
US is exchanging kisses with
Mitsubishi. Goodness me, it has even
been suggested that GM-H has more
than one lover and that come 1985 it
will start marketing the Suzuki 1.3 litre
under its own badge.
Oh yes, we are moving towards the
world car but aren’t you getting the feel-
ing that it will be just one world and that
world will be owned by Japan. □

Let’s ban all these filthy animals
PHILLIP ADAMS
A FEW WEEKS back I appeared on
Tonight With Bert Newton with Mary
Whitehouse and Fred Nile, leading
lights in the Kristian Kleanup
Kommittee. While admitting to concern
about the more vicious and violent
“video nasties” I expressed doubts
about the motives of Mary and Fred,
suggesting they were trundling a Trojan
horse into Australia; that their long-
term plan was nothing less than a
fullscale attack on liberal values.
I reminded viewers that Fred’s as-
sociates in the United States were busy
banning J. D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut,
Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and
James Baldwin; that in one state the en-
tire works of Shakespeare had been
banned from both school libraries and
classrooms. In short, the Festival of
Light’s cure might be far, far worse than
the disease. J
(I should point out that I’ve been
campaigning against violence in the me-
dia for more than 20 years. I coined the
phrase “the pornography of death” and
urged the television and film industries
to weigh their social responsibilities be-
fore filling our screens with escalating
horrors. My attacks on the Mad Max
films and, more recently, on that
smorgasbord of sadism Turkey Shoot
made me a target for any number of
derisive attacks. Indeed, the first film
made by the Mad Max team of
Kennedy-Miller was a gruesome parody
of a speech I gave to an international
psychiatric conference, expressing
growing concern about media violence.
During those years I received absolutely
no support from Nile and Co who did
not seem to mind violence: It was sex
that turned them on.)
The debate on the Newton show trig-
gered a vociferous Get Adams cam-
paign. I was accused of having mugged
a dear little grey-haired nanny from
London when, in fact, Whitehouse is as
tough as old boots and could beat Dean
Lukin at arm wrestling. Each day
brought another mailbag full of dia-
tribes and death threats.
The only thing that saved me was the
ABC’s announcement regarding homo-
sexual allowances. Suddenly, Ken Myer
became the prime target.
In the debate that’s been raging
about porn in video and sodomy in
broadcasting, the word “unnatural” has
been used obsessively just as the word
“natural” is used in health food stores.
Apply “natural” to the most spurious
foodstuff or chemical compound and
shoppers will fall upon it with cries of
delight.
Well, “unnatural” has the same mys-
tical power. A wide variety of human
behaviour can be damned with this
powerful adjective. It’s like God’s Good
Housekeeping Seal of Disapproval. Yet
nature embraces an extraordinarily
wide variety of procreative techniques.
The sexual goings-on in an oyster
bed make the most imaginative and per-
verse performances in a human’s bed
seem prim and puritanical. It’s not un-
natural for an oyster to change sex, be-
come an hermaphrodite and make love
to itself. Yet the oyster remains, without
doubt, man’s most admired mollusc.
Quite clearly, the producers of so-
called snuff movies ought to be jailed.
But their macabre productions fall short
of what goes on between praying man-
tises. The female devours her chap after
loin-chafing, which takes oral sex a little
too far.
Which brings us to the well-named
cockroach which has, according to
scientists, no fewer than 35,000 mating
techniques. As for the grouse, it has 100
Our porn picture of the week: Two giant
leopard slugs (Limax maximus) aerially do-
ing what comes naturally

sexual encounters a night which
makes it such an easy target for aristo-
cratic shooters in the morning.
And what of the common-or-garden
snail? Each has a complete set of male
and female genitalia so that two snails
can impregnate each other at the same
time. One species of snail can impreg-
nate itself, safely ensconced in its shell.
This brings us to Roman snails, the
ones you get in restaurants. They glue
themselves together, foot to foot, while
one of them releases its spiculum amoras
which pierces the other’s skin. The
wounded snail reacts with pain and
with a renewed surge of passion. Where-
upon it reciprocates with its own spicu-
lum amoras. What sado-masochistic
fantasy can compare with that?
We won’t even discuss the species of
snail that has sex in groups of six, linked
together like circus elephants. The first
snail takes the female role, the last takes
the male role and the four in the middle
have the best of both worlds.
As a famous naturalist once
observed: “Whether it’s because of our
large brains, superior intelligence, ten-
acious memory, spiritual nature or ever-
present conscience with its concomitant
offshoots of fear, guilt and anxiety, or
some combination of these human
qualities, we humans are the only
species having problems with sex.”
He went on to list any number of
species that practise rape, incest, homo-
sexuality, bisexuality, orgies, urolagnia
or matricide in the course of couplings.
For example, frogs are rapists. The
male frog uses its familiar cries to at-
tract a female and then leaps upon her
without so much as an introduction, let
alone an invitation. And if he fails to
find a female he’ll try intercourse with
any helpless creature in the neighbor-
hood or even a small rock.
I won’t embarrass you by describing
the nymphomaniacal behaviour of the
porcupine or the masturbatory habits of
the male deer or the dirty-minded dol-
phin. And the octopus? Quite unspeak-
able.
So enough of this nonsense about
natural and unnatural. In the seething
hotbed of God’s creation, there’s every
variation on the venereal theme.
To meet with the approval of Fred
and Mary, human beings would prob-
ably have to reproduce like amoeba,
without a hint of eroticism.
Sex. Call it unpleasant, call it un-
necessary but don’t call it unnatural. Be-
cause it isn’t. □


The Coast has plenty to boast about
RON SAW
WHEN I first met Frances Stafford
about 10 years ago, I think she was
running a fashionable dress shop
named Frangipani, in Woollahra, Syd-
ney. It would be fair, even temperate, to
say that the rag trade didn’t suit her.
A gilded and groaning customer
from some eastern suburb would
waddle into Frangipani and make
strenuous efforts to squeeze herself into
about $l5OO-worth of silken wisps de-
signed for somebody half her size and
floridity, expecting to be told, as any
good saleswoman would tell her, that
she looked heavenly. Francie would tell
her, honestly, that she looked like hell.
“I wouldn’t let you wear
that to a meat pie fight,” she
would say. “It makes you look
like about a hundredweight of
chewed liver. Here, try this
one: your size, simple, gentle
and yours for $17.50.” The results did
not encourage her backers; and, any-
way, Francie got sick and tired of the
rag trade. She sold out and moved back
to the Gold Coast where she was born
and bred and where her mother, Paula
Stafford, has been big in the bikini busi-
ness since the days when they were not
bikinis but “French swimsuits.”
Francie’s still there, selling real es-
tate: selling apartments in huge towers,
mostly of repellent aspect, with good
old Queensland names such as Aloha,
Anacapri, Apollo, Bahia, Biarritz (or
Bayer-itz), Chateau, Copacabana,
Hawaiian Village, Key West, Monte
Carlo, Olympus, Sahara Court, Shangri
La, St Moritz, St Tropez, Teneriffe and
Tiki Village.
Indeed, the high-risers that gave and
still give her her living also gave her yet
another commercial idea. The same
thoughtful planners who allowed those
towers to black out the beach from mid-
afternoon failed, and still fail, to realise
that all modern apartment blocks need
porters. Seeing elderly tourists strug-
gling from tourist buses to their holiday
flats, laden like mules, she suggested to
various bodies corporate that the na-
tion’s deep pool of unemployed stu-
dents might be shallowed a bit if kids
were put to work as part-time porters.
The idea fell on deaf ears so Francie
herself set about organising porters.
Hillbilly thinking is still endemic
from Southport to Coolangatta but
there is so much more to the Gold Coast
than the ant-hill buildings that one won-
ders why on earth Sir Joh doesn’t ar-
range to have it publicised by decree.
There is, or there will be soon, the
casino at Broadbeach. It will make
those at Hobart, Launceston, Darwin
and Alice Springs, together, seem like a
backyard swy-school. In front of a 622-
room hotel will be four floors of not just
gambling 120 tables of roulette,
blackjack, craps, baccarat, swy, keno
and big six, whatever that is but enter-
tainment, grand and small, bars, res-
taurants, shops and a staff of 500.
It is scheduled to open in October
next year and it will have cost $137 mil-
lion: and the blackest fear, which few
like even to think about, is that Sydney
will watch every move, learn every trick,
then trap the cream by opening some-
thing bigger and better. The
Broadbeach view is that if the building
is to be anything like that at the Sydney
Entertainment Centre it will be 10 years
before anyone need worry.
There is the Gold Coast Hinterland
the initial capital because the Gold
Coasters tend to think, with some justifi-
cation, that their hinterland is unique. It
is an astonishing mixture of farmland,
far-flung suburbs, rain-forest and
mountains. The higher you go the clean-
er and sweeter the air becomes, the
more exciting the views. And high up, at
Springbrook, there are boarding camps
and lodges, tea rooms, potteries and,
best of all, The Settlement 3 ha of
Australian Victoriana called fancifully a
“pioneer village.”
The Settlement is not a re-
production like Old Sydney
Town. The buildings the
family home, the smithy, the
general store, the railway
station, the dunny are all
the real thing. The Settle-
ment’s owner, Bill Short, and
his family took 11 years to
gather their village: not just
buildings from Southport
1911-12 and the original
Nerang railway station but
also Victorian clothes, china,
settees made from old kero-
sene cans, clothing, butter
churn, ice-cream maker ...
everything to suggest that
pioneering was, of necessity,
ready but didn’t have to be
rough. What you must pay to see this re-
markable village I don’t know be-
cause I, goaded by Francie in no more
than 400,000 words, was a freeloader
but whatever it costs is worth it.
So is the $l2 they ask at Sea World,
back in Surfers. The natural reaction is:
“Gawd! Twelve bucks to see a few dol-
phins turn somersaults!” But Sea World
is the best $l2-worth you’ll find in Aus-
tralia.
As a water-ski show it was the foun-
dation of Keith Williams’ millions
not only Williams but, almost inevi-
tably, Francie was in the show and if
Williams has indeed made millions, he
deserves them; because the attractions
just seem to multiply. There are water-
slides, a water borne roller coaster, dol-
phins, sea-lions, bumper boats, a repro-
duction of the Endeavour, helicopters, a
roller-coaster that corkscrews three
times and an oceanarium that is much
too big and has too many fish that are
much too big to be associated with the
word aquarium.
The whole thing is 20ha of Dis-
neyland with gills and blowholes and if
Sea World is the biggest thing in Surfers
and Surfers is the biggest thing on the
Gold Coast and the Gold Coast is the
biggest thing in Queensland, which is
the biggest thing in Australia, then I, for
one, wouldn’t be at all surprised.
None of it’s for me, mind you. If I’m
at the Gold Coast I want nothing more
than a penthouse at Budd’s Beach and
my meals at Oskar’s and Grumpy’s and
Danny’s and maybe Cavill’s, which are
the biggest and best restaurants in all
the world, don’t y’know ...?
But there: Francie’s at it again.
The thing is, she could be right. □

Pickets, Politics and Protest
PHOTOS BY MARTIN SHAKESHAFT— IFL
Strikers at the main gate at the port of Tilbury, a demonstration in support of the coal miners, wives taking to the streets to back their husbands:
British unions are now battling each other as well as the Thatcher government
Medlock Bibby, a dockworker at Brit-
ain’s sprawling Tilbury port, has
been a union member for 25 years. He gives
full credit to the union for providing him
with a steady job, reasonable pay and decent
working conditions. But when leaders of the
Transport and General Workers’ Union
(TGWU) ordered a walkout two weeks ago
in support of Britain’s striking coal miners,
Bibby refused to go along. He printed more
than 2,000 leaflets urging fellow dockers
not to risk their jobs by becoming embroiled
in the dispute. “I am proud to belong to the
union, proud to be a docker,”
Bibby said, “but not proud to
be used.”
Not long ago, such defiance
would have been inconceivable
in Britain. (Militant workers,
banded together, have toppled
two governments in the past 10
years.) But today unionists of-
ten find themselves pitted
against each other rather than
against management or the
government. Much of the cur-
rent discord has stemmed from
the increasingly violent 25-
week miners’ walkout. Moder-
ate union members such as
Bibby contend that the miners’ real goal is
not to improve working conditions or block
cutbacks in coal production, but to bring
down the government of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher by creating economic
chaos. An estimated one-third of the coun-
try’s dockworkers ignored the strike call
and stayed on the job last week. “We
have helped the miners in the past with
money, but we draw the line at this,” says
Peter Gardner, secretary of the Great Yar-
mouth branch of the TGWU. “This is a
political strike.”
The dockers’ strike could have severe and
far-ranging consequences. By splitting the
labor movement, it could erode union mem-
bership, which has already sunk to its low-
est level in 15 years. That could strengthen
Thatcher’s hand in her hard-line efforts to
rein in the unions. The issue of labor solidar-
ity is likely to come to a head this week when
the 10.1 million-member Trades Union
Congress (TUC), the labor movement’s
umbrella organization, holds its annual
conference in Brighton. Late last week, over
the objections of power-station engineers

and steelworkers, the TUC’s
general council endorsed a pro-
posal to ban the movement of
all coal and coke across the
miners’ picket lines. If the plan
is adopted by the full TUC
membership, it would sharply
aggravate intraunion tensions
and increase the possibility of a
confrontation with the govern-
ment. “This is probably the
biggest postwar crisis that the
unions have had to face,” says
Andrew Gottschalk, a lecturer
in industrial relations at the
London Business School. “For
the first time the movement has

to ask itself whether it accurately reflects
the wishes of working people.”
To many dockworkers, there was no need
for a strike. As a show of support for the
miners, the dockers had agreed to handle
only enough foreign coal to prevent perma-
nent damage to blast furnaces. (Furnaces
can crack if they are allowed to cool down
too much.) But British Steel Corp. officials,
along with the steelworkers’ union, argued
that the dockers’ limit on the coal that they
would handle wasn’t high enough. When a
ship carrying Polish coking coal for the
Ravenscraig steel mill in Scotland arrived
two weeks ago, British Steel used steelwork-
ers to unload the cargo because it exceeded
the dockworkers’ limit.
Walkout: Charging that the company had
used “scab labor,” the TGWU leadership
called the strike. The steelworkers main-
tained that they merely performed a task
that they had often done in the past —with
the dockers’ full approval. The TGWU
leadership ran into immediate problems in
mustering support for the walkout. At the
ports of Immingham and Grimsby, workers
voted to stay on the job for the time being.
At Tilbury, Britain’s largest port, the situa-
tion was less clear. Union officials declared
that the 3,500 rank-and-file members had
voted by a show of hands to support the
strike. But moderates, led by Medlock
Bibby, claimed that the vote had actually
gone in their favor. Late in the week the
National Association of Port Employers
estimated that only 40 percent of nonfuel
freight traffic had been stopped. “I’m
shocked, absolutely shocked,” said Frank
Drew, the TGWU steward at Great Yar-
mouth, where dockers voted overwhelm-
ingly to defy the strike. “The men are going
to cross picket lines.”
For the moment, the strike seems un-
likely to cause any great damage to the
British economy. Even so, striking dock-
workers managed to snarl trade last week.
The work stoppages also threatened to
disrupt Operation Lionheart, Britain’s
largest-ever peacetime military exercises,
which are scheduled to begin this week.
Thatcher, who had been reluctant to get
involved in the dispute, startled her cabinet
last week when she scrubbed plans to visit
the Far East this month.
The union turmoil has emboldened the
Thatcher government in its efforts to under-
mine the influence of the country’s labor
organizations. Backed by opinion polls
showing that Thatcher’s antiunionism is
shared by a large portion of the public, the
Tory government has pushed through
tough legislation to tame the unions. One
law makes it illegal for unions to picket
employers who are not directly involved in a
dispute; another, scheduled to go into effect
in October, requires that union members
cast secret ballots before a strike can be
called. In addition, Thatcher has aban-
doned the longstanding “beer and sand-
wiches” custom of inviting labor leaders to
10 Downing Street.
As the labor troubles escalate, the strik-
ing miners have resorted to more extreme
measures. Last week 87 strikers were arrest-
ed in the Scottish town of New Cummock
when they surrounded the house of a work-
ing miner and chanted abusive slogans.
To the anger of other labor leaders, Ar-
thur Scargill, the fiery president of the mine
workers’ union, has refused to condemn
such activities.
Voice: The likelihood is that the 1,000
TUC delegates in Brighton this week will
approve the plan of “total support” for the
miners. The moderate head of the TUC,
Len Murray, argued that the proposal was
better than the more militant plans original-
ly demanded by the miners. Just to make
sure that its voice is heard, the miners’ union
plans to send at least 20,000 picketers to
Brighton. Fearing that violence could break
out between moderate and militant union-
ists, the police have advised shopkeepers at
the seaside resort to shut down.
But even with an agreement in hand, the
British labor movement will still face formi-
dable problems. The risk is that the current
friction will further polarize unionists, per-
haps spurring militants to increasingly radi-
cal —and violent—tactics. That could en-
courage the Thatcher government to take
even harsher measures against labor. “The
unions have got to come to grips with the
realities of the economy and realize that a
Conservative government will be in power
for a long time,” says Ben Roberts, a profes-
sor of industrial relations at the London
School of Economics. If they don’t, their
role as a powerful force in Britain could be
in jeopardy.

THE NORTH SEA
Tracking a Nuclear Near Miss
The Mont Louis goes down: Troubling questions—and an ominous warning of the potential dangers of nuclear transport
PRESS ASSOCIATION
The sight was enough to spread fears of
nuclear contamination across West-
ern Europe. The Mont Louis, a French
freighter loaded with 225 tons of uranium
hexafluoride, lay on the bottom of the
North Sea 12 miles off the coast of Bel-
gium. Divers were working frantically to
retrieve 30 steel drums of nuclear fuel
submerged in its hold. Speculation about a
European Three Mile Island eventually
subsided last week when the French gov-
ernment pointed out that the uranimum
hexafluoride had only a low level of
radioactivity and had not leaked out of
its containers. But the incident still
raised troubling questions about whether
the Mont Louis was safely equipped to
carry its nuclear cargo—and about what
could happen to other ships carrying more
dangerous radioactive materials on the
open seas.
When the accident happened, the Mont
Louis had left the French port of Le Havre
on its way to Riga, in Soviet Latvia. The
English Channel was foggy, and visibility
was less than a mile. Madame Labatut, a
guest on board the Mont Louis, had just
finished eating lunch with the ship’s officers
when a West German pas-
senger ferry plowed into the
freighter’s stern. “The offi-
cers’ mess was totally torn
apart by the collision,” La-
batut recalled. “The shock
was terrible.” After rescue
tugs pulled the two ships
apart, the Mont Louis listed
on its side, then sank in
46 feet of water. All 24 peo-
ple on board escaped with-
out injury.
For a day, it looked like another routine
mishap in the world’s busiest sea lane. But
then the environmental group Greenpeace
announced that the sunken ship might be
carrying nuclear materials. Normally, the
Mont Louis transports cars and wood
products between France and Scandinavia,
while its sister ship, the Borodine, hauls
nuclear fuels to the Soviet Union and back.
But the Borodine was dry-docked in Le
Havre for repairs, leading Greenpeace offi-
cials to speculate that the Mont Louis had
taken its place. Hours later, the French
government confirmed the Greenpeace
charges, stirring fears that the government
was covering up an impending disaster.
Leakage: By midweek, however, French
officials had calmed the worst anxieties.
They explained the tardy disclosure by
saying they did not want to provide errone-
ous or incomplete information about the
nuclear cargo. They also pointed out that
uranium hexafluoride has a low level of
radioactivity until it is converted into en-
riched uranium for use in nuclear reactors.
Ships carrying more radioactive materials
have such safety devices as double hulls
and radiation screens. But officials insisted
DEBRA FREEMAN—NEWSWEEK
the Mont Louis cargo was
adequately protected by
the 30 sealed containers,
which are made of double-
layered steel and designed
to withstand pressures at
depths of up to 656 feet for
one year. The ship’s owners
issued a statement saying
that none of the containers
had been damaged in the
collision—and adding that
even if they had, any leak-
age would be diluted by seawater “with
negligible or no consequences for man and
the environment.”
That still left the question of why
the collision had happened in the first
place. Crewmen from the Mont Louis
blamed undermanning. They said the sea-
man on watch was pulled off the bridge for
other duties just before the crash. “Fifteen
years ago there were 50 men on ships of
this type,” said Gilbert Brodel, a spokes-
man for the crewmen’s union. “Today
there are only about 20, and this adds to
the risk.” French union sources also
claimed that the crew had been asked by
the ship’s owners, Compagnie Generate
Maritime, to remain silent about the nucle-
ar cargo after the Mont Louis sank. Com-
pany officials denied the charges and said
After the crash: The greatest risk turned out to be an old-fashioned oil spill


they were conducting an investigation into
the collision.
The incident also raised the issue of why
the Mont Louis was transporting uranium
hexafluoride, which can be used to make
weapons-grade uranium, to the Soviet
Union. France began shipping uranium hex-
afluoride to the Soviets in 1973, when West-
ern Europe did not have its own capacity to
produce enriched uranium to fuel its nuclear
power plants. Since then, some 2,500 Euro-
pean containers have been sent to Riga for
enrichment, then returned. Now France has
its own enrichment facility, called Eurodif;
it has renegotiated its contract with the Sovi-
ets to reduce the uranium hexafluoride ship-
ments, and hopes to phase them out entirely
by the end of the century. In any event, it is
unlikely that the Soviets would try to divert
the French material for military use, since
Moscow already has ample supplies of ura-
nium for weapons production.
Oil Slick: Although the fallout from the
Mont Louis appeared minimal, maritime
trade unions and environmental groups
still hoped to use it as a warning of what
could happen to ships carrying more dan-
gerous nuclear cargoes in the future.
Britain’s National Union of Seamen called
for an immediate end to all nuclear ship-
ments until international safety standards
are improved. And Greenpeace planned to
follow up on its success in fingering the
Mont Louis cargo by trying to stop a
scheduled shipment of 550 pounds of plu-
tonium from France to Japan later this
month. Meantime, the most immediate en-
vironmental risk from the Mont Louis was
a growing oil slick from a leak in the
freighter’s 1,500-ton fuel tank. Compared
with the threat of a nuclear-age disaster,
the danger of an old-fashioned oil spill
came almost as a relief.

Yanks Down Home in Comiso
The graffiti reading “Out With the Mis-
siles” and “Yanks Must Go” has faded.
Now there are American-flag decals and
snack shops offering hot dogs, hamburgers
and pizza. Protesters still stage an occasion-
al demonstration, but the live-in pacifists
have largely disappeared—replaced by
nearly 900 U.S. Air Force personnel. The
27,000 inhabitants of Comiso, a small town
in Sicily that was chosen as a base for 112 new
U.S. cruise missiles, are learning to live, and
live happily, with the Y anks and themissiles.
So far the adjustment has been much less
traumatic than was predicted.
When the first cruise missiles were de-
ployed last March, there were widespread
fears about the impact on this defiantly
proud, ancient town. Beyond thrusting Co-
miso into the middle of the
Euromissile debate, the new
base —which will eventual-
ly house 4,000 U.S. service-
men and dependents—was
seen as a possible magnet for
modern social ills the town
has largely avoided: drugs,
prostitution and Mafia in-
fluence. Even those people
who were initially dubious
about the Americans have
come around. “They have
behaved with great discre-
tion,” says local writer Ge-
sualdo Bufalino, who once
described the planned de-
ployment as an “invasion.”
“Their presence hasn’t
weighed upon us.”
Dress Code: That is no ac-
cident. The airmen received
special instructions to be on
their best behavior, down to
a dress code that bans T shirts, sandals and
bare feet except on base or for beach excur-
sions. Not a single drug case has been re-
ported, and police have yet to arrest any
U.S. servicemen. Worries about prostitu-
tion have evaporated, and while critics
claim that the base is attracting the Mafia,
there is no evidence to back up that charge.
The honeymoon has been helped by the
massive infusion of funds to build the base.
By 1987 it will feature a school, a post ex-
change, theaters and other recreational fa-
cilities. Lucrative contracts have given local
companies a major boost and have provided
hundreds of temporary jobs. For now, many
airmen live off base in hotels or apartments.
“All our rooms are full of Americans and I
hope they will always stay in our hotels,”
says Gino Mazza, the owner of two hotels in
the nearby seaside town of Scoglitti. “The
Americans are welcomed by everyone. ” The
one complaint of Comiso merchants is that
the airmen either stay on base or pick livelier
towns to visit. “In the beginning we saw a
lot of Americans, but now we see very few,”
says Giuseppe Ferrisi, the owner of the Man-
hattan Bar, which opened with great expec-
tations a year ago.
The peace movement has not given up
entirely. At the Women’s Peace Camp near
the entrance to the base, five resolute pro-
testers remain, all of them British. A dozen
others still live at the Verde Vigna (Green
Vine) camp, but they concede that the days
of big demonstrations are over. “We are
changing tactics,” says one young Italian.
“We are now cultivating the earth by organ-
ic means and thus refuting the militaristic
life-style.”
One local center of opposition remains
steadfast, however: the neighboring town of
Vittoria. Comiso’s acceptance of the
A U.S. airman with a friend: Living with the missiles
BATTAGLIA AND ZECCHIN
Americans has exacerbated a longstanding
rivalry. “We cannot leave the struggle for
peace only to punks and foreigners,” says
Vittoria’s Communist Mayor Paolo Mon-
ello. In 1982 Vittoria proclaimed itself a
nuclear-free zone. Today the U.S. airmen
steer clear.
Comiso’s own Communists, the town’s
largest political party, with about 40 per-
cent of the vote, distance themselves from
their neighbors. “If I become mayor, I could
not resolve the problems of the missiles in
Comiso,” says local party leader Salvatore
Zago. “That is a national and international
problem.” But the new U.S. presence will
undoubtedly continue to have local ramifi-
cations. “We have been catapulted from the
1800 s to the 21 st century,” says writer Bufa-
lino. “This process of the dying of the old
culture might have lasted 30 to 40 years yet,
but now it won’t last more than 30 or 40
months.” By then, the Americans and their
missiles should be firmly entrenched.

A New Image for Marseilles
On the street: A city once plagued by crime starts to shed its tawdry reputation
PHOTOS BY PIERRE MATRAT—COLLECTIF
About 200 yards from the sea, on
Marseilles’s man-made Prado Beach,
droves of teen-agers from the city’s slums
gather daily around a small, prefab shack.
They are trying out the latest craze: micro-
computers. Across town in the city’s down-
trodden north quarter, a fleet of buses
arrives each morning to pick up other girls
and boys. Some are driven to special beach-
es to wind-surf and sail; others are taken to
community sports facilities to work out, or
to visit a local racetrack to ride and learn
about motorcycles. All the activity is part of
an attempt by the city to combat a long-
troubling problem: juvenile delinquency.
“The main cause of this problem is idle-
ness,” says Jean-Max Trouillet, 34, director
of Marseilles’s Y outh and Leisure Adminis-
tration. “It’s working.” And for the thou-
sands of youths involved, it’s free.
Fighting Crime: Eleven years after law-
enforcement officials closed down the last
of Marseilles’s infamous “French Connec-
tion” drug operations, the Mediterranean
seaport is finally beginning to shed its taw-
dry reputation. Armed with a $2 million
budget for 1984 alone, the local government
has launched a drive to cut the city’s alarm-
ing crime rate —the second highest in
France, behind Paris —by providing a more
stimulating environment for Marseilles’s
disadvantaged youths. City officials esti-
mate that their programs have helped
20,000 young people this year. The results
are impressive: petty crime has dropped by
30 percent since 1982, when the antidelin-
quency drive got under way. “It can’t be
denied. The city’s prevention programs
work,” says Police Commissioner Jean-
Pierre Ghenassia, head of Marseilles’s ju-
venile-delinquency brigade. “Before they
existed, the crime rate just went up.”
The youth program, the largest of its kind
in France, is unique both for its year-round
operations and its emphasis on high-tech
activities. “When I saw the success of
the initial programs, I decided to expand
them,” says Gaston Defferre, 73, the mayor
of Marseilles and President Franqois Mit-
terrand’s minister of state for planning. “Of
course, there is soccer and sail-
ing and other sports, but we
also try to give the kids a notion
of a profession—to open up
perspectives for them of what
they can do with their lives.”
The computer-training divi-
sions of the program have
proved as popular as the sports
programs. And they fit handily
into Defferre’s larger plans
to “make Marseilles one of
France’s leading high-technology centers.”
Indeed, this year Marseilles, in coopera-
tion with the government-sponsored World
Computer Center, launched a vast program
to computerize the city, distributing 1,000
terminals to schools and high-tech centers
free of charge.
The program’s success owes much to
DefFerre’s tenacity. “At first all the govern-
ment ministries concerned were not for the
idea,” Defferre recalls. “They said, ‘Old
Gaston’s nice, but he’s a bit of a dreamer’.”
With the help of Gilbert Trigano, head of
the Club Mediterranee S.A., Defferre was
able to launch his experiment. Most of the
program’s estimated 200 counselors were
recruited from the ranks of the city’s unem-
ployed, trained in some cases at a Club Med
facility and then returned to Marseilles as
salaried city employees. At present the city
pays for about 80 percent of the program,
with the national government absorbing the
remaining costs.
While the computers ostensibly stimu-
late the youths’ minds, other activities cater
to the need for some old-fashioned fun. At
the Paul Ricard racetrack outside Mar-
seille, state troopers and local policemen
offer groups of 40 teen-agers a weeklong
course in motorcycle riding, mechanics and
road safety. “In the places where these kids
come from, motorcycles are gods, they
equal freedom,” says a sympathetic gen-
darme. “What we’re trying to do is give
them a more professional insight into what a
motorcycle is and to give them a notion of
responsibility.” The kids are thrilled with
the course and seem to have only one com-
plaint. “It only lasts a week,” sighed 17-
G. MERILLON— COLLECTIF
year-old Karim Milou.
Whether Marseilles’s suc-
cessful crime-prevention pro-
gram will serve as a model for
other French towns remains to
be seen. Marseilles itself seems
sold on continuing, if not ex-
panding, all the existing activi-
ties. “The programs teach the
kids what society is all about
and give them a sense that they
can do things themselves,” says
Trouillet. “And that’s what
this whole thing is all about.”

WORLD AFFAIRS
ISRAEL
Trading Places—Maybe
It appeared that Israeli politics had finally
achieved a state of perfect gridlock. For a
solid month the Labor Party had tried to
form a government on the strength of a
narrow plurality in the latest national elec-
tions. And for a month the ruling Likud
bloc had maneuvered in the shadows to foil
Labor’s plans. Smaller parties darted back
and forth between the leaders, scavenging
for cabinet seats and other political scraps.
The result was a stalemate, and last week
Labor’s Shimon Peres and Likud’s Yitzhak
Shamir came to the logical conclusion: if
you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. The two party
chiefs said they were close to agreement on
forming a “national-unity government,” a
broad coalition in which Peres and Shamir
would take turns being prime minister.
Sooner or later, the whole thing will al-
most certainly come unstuck. The only
question was whether the falling-out would
occur before the coalition had a chance to
take office —or sometime thereafter. The
parties agreed that Peres and Shamir would
each head the government for 25 months
and that Labor and Likud would each have
12 cabinet seats to dispense to their support-
ers. But by late last week they still hadn’t
announced who would be prime minister
first —a vital issue, considering that the co-
alition might well collapse before the time
comes for trading places. Other specific
cabinet positions also were up in the air, and
party negotiators hadn’t even begun to dis-
cuss how a government divided
down the middle would actual-
ly manage to function. But La-
bor and Likud seemed to be
convinced, for the moment at
least, that they were stuck with
each other, and that the only
alternative to a broad coalition
was another election, which
neither party wants.
Price: Two weeks ago Peres
seemed to be within reach of
forming a government on his
own when he signed up former
Likud Defense Minister Ezer
Weizman, whose Yahad party
holds three seats in the Knes-
set. Then the Likud struck
back. Last week Shamir, who
still serves as caretaker prime
minister, enticed the ultrareli-
gious Agudat Israel into an alli-
ance. In exchange for shunning
Labor, Agudat was promised a
deputy ministership and more
government money for reli-
gious schools —a steep price to
pay for two votes in the Knes-
set. “There was no choice,’’
said Likud’s Ariel Sharon, the
bellicose hero of the far right.
“A narrow Labor-led govern-
ment presents a threat to the
State of Israel.” The Likud
made similar deals with three
other small parties, and Peres’s
drive was stalled at 54 seats,
7 short of a parliamentary
majority.
That made Peres more ame-
nable to a broad coalition.
He agreed to share the prime
minister’s job with Shamir, al-
though he insisted that he him-
self should have the first turn.
Peres may have to pay a painful
price for any deal with the Li-
kud. The Mapam party, a left-
wing Labor ally of long standing, said it
would not join a coalition with the Likud,
which it described as “government by in-
sanity.” Mapam’s defection would cost
Peres six votes in the Knesset and some
important leverage within the coalition. But
Shamir stood to lose support on his own
right flank. The Tehiya party, which holds
five seats, said it would boycott the pro-
posed government because of an under-
standing between Labor and the Likud that
new Jewish settlements in the occupied
West Bank would have to be approved by a
majority of the cabinet. Right-wingers also
were unhappy about another agreement
that would permit the coalition to pursue

peace talks with Jordan’s King Hussein.
There was less dissent over prospective
Israeli policy in Lebanon. Last week that
country was coming to the boil again. Rival
Muslim militia groups traded artillery fire in
Tripoli (map). Sectarian sniping broke out in
Beirut for the first time since a government
security plan went into effect on July 4.
Pierre Gemayel, 78, the powerful leader of
the Christian Phalangist Party and father of
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, died of
a heart attack, which seemed likely to set off
a deadly power struggle in the Christian
ranks. Israeli forces occupying southern
Lebanon were being sniped at by Shiite
Muslims; the Israelis continued to prohibit
northern Lebanese vehicles from crossing
into the south. And in the Bekaa Valley,
Israeli warplanes bombed a camp purport-
edly occupied by a faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization—the second such
attack in two weeks.
Austerity: Leaders of both Labor and the
Likud have concluded that the time has
come to withdraw Israeli troops from south-
ern Lebanon as quickly as possible. Bringing
the boys home won’t be easy. With the PLO,
the Shiites and Syrian occupation troops all
poised for action, the retreating Israelis may
not be able to assure the security of their own
northern frontier. And withdrawal from
Lebanon is only one of the painful operations
that will have to be carried out by whatever
government ultimately succeeds Shamir’s
caretaker regime. To patch up Israel’s shat-
tered economy, Labor and the Likud report-
edly have agreed on an austerity program
that includes up to 51.5 billion in budget
cuts. That won’t be at all popular with the
voters. If the two major parties and some of
the smaller ones can manage to pull together
a broad coalition, there will at least be plenty
of politicians on hand to share the
recriminations.

CAMPAIGN' 84
Fritz: Back on Track?
LARRY DOWNING —NEWSWEEK
An underdog ticket rebounds from its August malaise: Mondale and Jesse Jackson display new —and hard-won — unity, while Ferraro, again
After a slow start, the Democrats are off and running.
The snack of fried chicken wings had
been cleared away, but Walter Mon-
dalestill twisted slowly on the rotisserie as 50
black leaders challenged his refusal to sup-
port a multibillion-dollar jobs program.
Again and again Mondale was told that
black voters would not accept his explana-
tion that his hands were tied by the budget
deficit. It was all slipping away: Mondale’s
dream of winning the group’s enthusiastic
endorsement and healing rifts that date back
to Jesse Jackson’s presidential candidacy.
Suddenly, protocol and formality gave
way to emotion. One participant compared
the scene to a revival meeting as Brother
Fritz was called upon to give testimony. Like
a grand inquisitor, former Atlanta Mayor
Maynard Jackson interrogated Mondale.
Jackson was the perfect bridge between fac-
tions: he had backed Jesse Jackson in the
primaries, but now was a Mondale ally. The
Democratic nominee held his ground as he
discussed his lifelong commitment to civil
rights and his anguish over the skepticism of
the black community. But it took an elo-
quent summation by Maynard Jackson to
turn the tide. His words resonated with the
deep antipathy of black leaders to Ronald
Reagan—and, just before midnight, they
unanimously voted to endorse Mondale.
Afterward, as his former interrogators
chanted, “We want Fritz,” Mondale al-
lowed his relief and his elation to show. He
prodded Detroit Mayor Coleman Young to
pin a Mondale-Ferraro button on a hitherto
diffident Jesse Jackson. The transformation
was immediate: Jackson responded with a
hearty laugh. Moments later, Mondale and
Jackson clasped hands and held them aloft
in the traditional victory salute. The long-
awaited concordat was finally ratified on
what campaign chairman Jim Johnson
dubbed “the last day of the primary cam-
paign between Mondale and Jackson.”
Amnesty: So it went in a week when Mon-
dale finally escaped the malaise that plagued
his campaign all August. John Anderson,
who won nearly 6 million votes as an inde-
pendent candidate in 1980, endorsed Mon-
dale. Running mate Geraldine Ferraro was
again buoyant, attracting enthusiastic
crowds in six states as she enjoyed almost
complete amnesty from questions about her
finances. A negotiating session between
Johnson and senior Reagan aide Jim Baker
produced more good news: a commitment
for at least one of the TV debates Mondale so
desperately craves. True, Mondale’s own
polls still show him lagging by 12 to 15
percentage points. But senior adviser Rich-
ard Leone reflected the brave optimism of
the Mondale camp. “We’re increasingly
convinced,” said Leone, “we’ve got power-
ful issues on our side.”
One, the Democrats think, is religion:
they hope to harness what they see as grow-
ing resentment over recent statements sug-
gesting that God just might be on Ronald
Reagan’s side. Sen. Paul Laxalt, chairman of
the president’s re-election campaign, tried
to enlist 45,000 ministers in the Reagan
crusade with a letter that began, “Dear
Christian leader.” During a prayer break-
fast at the GOP convention, the president
expressed his conviction that “religion and
politics are necessarily related.” Reagan
aides defend the speech, especially since a
speechwriter’s earlier draft had been sani-
tized to remove the far more explosive claim
that the two are “inseparable.”
Mondale stepped into the fray last week
with a few remarks underlining his commit-
ment to maintaining the wall between reli-
gion and government. “In America, our
faith is personal and honest and uncorrupted
by political interference,” he said at a Dallas
fund-raiser. It may have been a prelude to
the tenor of Mondale’s remarks this week,
when both he and Reagan will speak before
the B’nai B’rith. Johnson argues that the
church-state issue will benefit Mondale,
since it raises questions about “whether,
under Ronald Reagan, we will stray from
what the Founding Fathers intended.”
Fritz-Bashing: Nonetheless, the domi-
nant mood at the White House was smug
satisfaction during a week when Reagan
garnered the expected endorsement of the
Teamsters. True, there were minor recrimi-
nations over the tone of the GOP conven-
tion: some aides, in hindsight, wondered
whether there should have been so much
Fritz-bashing in Dallas. Polltaker Richard
Wirthlin was particularly concerned that
Reagan had squandered his free prime-time
platform. His surveys find that Reagan add-
ed only a modest postconvention bounce of 3
to 5 percentage points to his already com-
manding lead. Other polls show no post-
convention pickup at all.
Ferraro, the only candidate to spend most
of last week on the road, repeatedly won
enthusiastic cheers with a spirited attack on
GOP flag-waving. “Mr. Reagan preaches

love of country, and I agree, but let’s love our
countrymen and women too,” she declared
in Cleveland. “Let’s put people back to
work, let’s keep the peace. That’s the way to
honor the American flag. ” Her appearances
were carefully orchestrated, with little of the
off-the-cuff spontaneity that characterized
the early days of her jerry-built campaign.
The only discordant note was the decision of
a Queens judge to remove her husband, John
Zaccaro, as the conservator of an estate from
which he had borrowed $ 175,000.
New Voters: Both parties face what is, in
effect, an Oct. 9 primary: voter registration
will have closed by then in the nine largest
states. The Republicans, awash in campaign
cash, already claim to have registered 1.7
million new voters. The Democrats finally
unveiled plans to raise $27 million for a get-
out-the-vote drive, but there are widespread
doubts whether they can reach their finan-
cial and registration goals. Mondale hopes
to sign up 2.5 million new black voters —and
Jesse Jackson’s active support should help.
A new Gallup poll, conducted for the non-
partisan Joint Center for Political Studies,
found that 56 percent of black voters would
be favorably influenced by a Jackson en-
dorsement. But the survey also suggests that
the Democrats are losing their traditional
base among young voters: new white regis-
trants under 30 prefer Reagan over Mondale
by a lopsided margin of 68 to 26 percent.
Labor Day marks the formal beginning of
the white-water phase of Campaign ’B4.
From here on, strident rhetoric will clog the
airwaves with even religion reduced to a
bumper-sticker issue. Reagan has reason to
be sanguine about the outcome, but Mon-
dale has finally moved beyond the bitter
divisions of the Democratic primaries.

A Shuttle for the Teacher
Picture, if you will, English teacher
Our Miss Brooks, silver-suited and bub-
ble-helmeted, hurtling through the cos-
mic void as the first civilian passenger
aboard the space shuttle. Her contribu-
tion to the space program? Correcting
the grammar of her fellow astronauts:
“Chuck, how many times do I have to tell
you, A-OK is unacceptable slang.”
Okay, that’s a little extreme. But Ron-
ald Reagan launched a heavy payload of
teacher-in-space jokes when he an-
nounced that the first “citizen passen-
ger” aboard the shuttle would be an
elementary- or secondary-school in-
structor. “When that shuttle lifts oflf,”
Reagan declared, “all of America will be
reminded of the crucial role teachers and
education play in the life of our nation.”
Still, jokesters immediately pictured
vengeful students dragging recalcitrant
algebra teachers into the waiting arms of
NASA officials. And would the orbiting
teacher (who may be from a public, pri-
vate or parochial school) be allowed to
pray in space—or does the Supreme
Court’s jurisdiction extend beyond the
stratosphere? Liftoff actually won’t be
untillate 1985orearly 1986,butNASAis
prepared for 80,000 applications from
among the nation’s 2 million teachers.
The White House denied any crass
political motives, but Reagan’s surprise
revelation seemed perfectly space-suited
for an election campaign in which educa-
tion will be a major issue. The president
underlined his sky-high concerns by also
making an appearance at the Goddard
Space Flight Center just hours after
Thursday’s successful launch of the trou-
ble-prone shuttle Discovery. It was all an
illustration of the powers of incumbency:
Walter Mondale may have the endorse-
ment of teachers’ unions, but only Rea-
gan can mandate the selection of the first
astronaut with chalk on his or her coat.
For its own reasons, NASA basked in
the public-relations glow from Reagan’s
announcement: the space agency needs
to muster civilian support for the heavily
subsidized shuttle program that costs
$1.4 billion a year. NASA will begin
taking applications from teachers with a
yen to travel on Nov. 1. There are no age
restrictions, and the formal criteria will
not be overly strict: good health and vi-
sion and hearing correctable to normal
levels. NASA project manager Alan
Ladwig insists that person selected need
not be a science teacher —though he de-
picted the citizen-astronaut performing
Mr. Wizard-style experiments on the
shuttle’s middeck. Both NASA and pan-
els of educators will participate in the
multistage selection process that will cli-
max in May 1985, when the first flying
pedagogue is chosen from among 106
teachers invited to attend a two-month
workshop at the Johnson Space Center.
Hall Monitors: Skeptics might view the
whole process as the lottery principle
writ large across the heavens: instead of
pledging more money for salaries, Rea-
gan has singled out an individual teacher
for an explosive liftoff"into celebrity. Like
as not, the lucky teacher will not mind
being furloughed from hall-monitor du-
ty to serve both as an astronaut and a rov-
ing good-will ambassador for the space
program. If nothing else, the experience
will provide perfect grist for an essay on
“How I Spent My Summer Vacation.”

A B-1 Bomber Goes Down
Prototype over the Mojave: Would the crash affect production of the new B-1B?
The timing could hardly have been
worse —“morbidly coincidental,” one
Air Force spokesman said. Just six days
before this week’s scheduled debut of the
redesigned—but still controversial —B-1
bomber, an earlier test model crashed mys-
teriously near Edwards Air Force Base in
California’s Mojave Desert. One man died
in the crash and two others were injured. In
what might have been a scene from “The
Right Stuff,” patrons of the Frosted Mug
tavern in the nearby mining town of Boron
watched a cloud of gray-black smoke billow
up from the crash site into a windless sky.
“I’ve been seeing ’em so long I don’t pay
that much attention anymore,” said Frost-
ed Mug tavern owner Bruce Collier. “But
... it always kind of amazed me how it
could go so slow and still stay in the air.”
Last week’s fatal B-l A mission was not
a go-for-broke, full-throttle exercise to
“stretch the envelope” of aircraft perform-
ance. Rather it was a tricky
low-speed flight, apparently
including a test to see how
the $2OO million swing-wing
bomber would handle a land-
ing with one of its four engines
out. Whatever emerges as the
precise cause of the crash, how-
ever, the loss of a prototype
built in 1974 probably will not
affect plans to produce 100
new B-1B bombers.* The B-l
was designed to evade enemy
defenses by flying fast and
low before releasing nuclear
bombs or cruise missiles. The
new B-1B includes more modern “stealth”
concepts to minimize its radar “profile”
and frustrate other tracking systems.
Even before experts began poking
through last week’s charred wreckage, or
taking sworn testimony for possible legal
action, they knew that the plane involved
had been worked exceptionally hard over
the years. The second of four B-l A proto-
types, it made 60 test flights before the B-l
program was mothballed by Jimmy Carter
in the late 1970s —including one at Mach
2.22, a record for any B-l—and 67 since the
program was revived in 1983. Before the
recent flights, the plane’s mechanical con-
trol systems were modified extensively to
resemble those of the new B-1B; whether
there was a problem with that new design or
the way the modification was carried out

remains to be seen. Another question for
investigators: why did an escape capsule,
after separating successfully from the fall-
ing craft, fail to protect the three-man crew?
Injured in the crash were the man in the
pilot’s seat, Air Force Maj. Richard V.
Reynolds, 35, and Capt. Otto J. Waniczek,
30, the flight engineer. Neither was a new-
comer to flight testing, but their experience
was far overshadowed by that of the man
who died—Tommie Douglas Benefield, 55,
chief test pilot for Rockwell and a retired
Air Force colonel who was among the
“Right Stuff” Edwards test pilots immor-
talized by Tom Wolfe. “We’re kids who’ve
never stopped dreaming,” Benefield said in
a recent interview. “We’re always looking
at another frontier . . . the edge of human
and technological endurance.”

*For one thing, analysts explained, Rockwell Interna-
tional Corp., the manufacturer of the plane, has shrewdly
subcontracted work on the project to other firms in virtual-
ly every state, making cancellation a painful prospect.
Setback for the
Balanced Budget
So far, 32 state legislatures have passed
resolutions calling for a convention to re-
write the U.S. Constitution so that it requires
a balanced federal budget. That’s just two
shy of the number needed to force a vote in
Congress on whether to call the first consti-
tutional convention in nearly 200 years. But
last week the California Supreme Court
slowed the freight train a bit by striking
down Proposition 35, scheduled for the
Nov. 6 ballot. If approved by voters, Propo-
sition 35 would have forced California state
legislators to join the call for a constitutional
convention —or sacrifice pay. Writing for a
6-1 majority, Justice Allen E. Broussard
declared that the U.S. Constitution allows
only state legislatures—not voters through a
ballot initiative—to apply for a constitution-
al convention. Broussard added: “[TheCon-
stitution] envisions legislators free to vote
their best judgment, responsible to their
constituents . . . not puppet legislators co-
erced or compelled. ”
Battle: Backers of the measure, who gath-
ered 600,000 signatures to put it on the
ballot, were disappointed but not devastat-
ed. “The process of amending the Constitu-
tion is a glacial one [and] you have to be
prepared for setbacks,” says Lewis Uhler,
the Loomis, Calif., lawyer who is leading
both the state and national push for the
convention. They hope to reverse the deci-
sion in time to put Proposition 3 5 back on the
ballot. The plaintiffs in the case, a collection
of civil-rights and religious groups, also are
prepared to resume battle. They fear a con-
stitutional convention would take up issues
besides the balanced-budget amendment.
But balanced-budget resolutions are also
pending in state legislatures in Michigan,
Montana, New York, Ohio and Washing-
ton. “Five years ago we would ask ourselves
if and when,” says Uhler. “Now the only
question is when.”

SUPER RESPONSIVE


FACT - TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
"Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity., but all of mouth-
watering configuration.'' The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning.'' The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact.
SR engines
feature fuel
efficiency in-
novations, ad-
vanced elec-
tronics , new
mechanisms,
and sophisti -
cated engine
analysis tech-
niques.
Special laser holography of the engine block
led to huge weight cuts. New materials cut
&
>
friction and reduced inertia. With design innova-
tions such as pent roof combustion chambers and
swirl control
valves.
In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!

A Worldwide Exercise Craze
Working out in Paris: A healthy blend of calisthenics, stretching and jogging has made aerobics a popular sport on six continents
With a burst of enthusiasm, millions of adults are determined to ‘shape up.’
Five years ago Americans took to jogging
paths and steamy gymnasiums by the
masses —and had the audacity to call their
sweaty excesses fun. These days the whole
world seems to be infected by the fitness bug.
Each morning before the tea has brewed,
some 2.7 million Britons turn on the telly to
exercise with health sirens who are known as
“Green Goddess” and “Mad Lizzie.” In
France le stretching, le jogging and le jazzer-
cise are now the rage. Chinese youths gather
in parks at dawn to practice the new style of
calisthenics. And close to 40,000 joggers
now participate in an annual nine-mile race
through Sydney that Australians call a “fun
run.” What’s going on? Has the whole world
gone bonkers on fitness?
It seems so, and all signs indicate that the
obsession with exercise, fueled ever brighter
by the excitement of the recent Olympics, is
not going to end anytime soon. What was
once an occasional schoolyard pastime is
now a daily endeavor for millions of adults.
Over the past five years American-style
health clubs, aerobics classes and body-
building centers have sprung up from To-
kyo to Rome —and even Moscow. Health
magazines, books, records and videotapes
are selling like Michael Jackson records.
Governments eager to encourage a healthy
population are further boosting the exercise
explosion by investing millions of dollars in
splashy advertising campaigns that encour-
age people to get in shape. Corporations are
also wooing the exercise-resistant employee
by building in-house sports facilities
and offering discount memberships
at nearby health clubs. “People are
coming to realize that if you’re not
well in body, none of the rest mat-
ters,” says Dr. lan Bennett, who runs
Australia’s nationwide fitness pro-
gram, “Life, Be in It.”
Recognizing the importance of
physical fitness is hardly a new idea.
Philosophers from Decimus Junius
Juvenalis to John Locke trumpeted
the call for “a sound mind in a sound
body.” But the peculiarities of 20th-
century life have given the ancient
adage a new meaning. Automation
and high technology have removed
physical exercise from countless daily
routines. Many people feel a greater
need to give dramatic release to the
accumulated stresses and pressures of
office and home life. A sudden surge in the
amount of people’s leisure time has added to
that need, particularly in countries where
the workweek has been shortened to offset
the recessionary drain on local economies.
But the exercise boom is more than a
change in life-styles. It reflects a rising global
CHRIS NIEDENTHAL
In Warsaw: A bit of music, a bit of sweat


LIFE/STYLE
concern with health in general. As cancer
statistics rise and new reports warn almost
daily about the hazards of the food we eat,
the water we drink and the air we breathe,
people are coming to believe they will have to
work harder than ever to maintain good
health. “There’s a growing feeling that if you
make an effort you can really make yourself
fit,” says Dr. Audrey Livingston Booth, who
runs Britain’s Stress Syndrome Foundation
in Kent. “I think people are now hearing that
in the United States people have cut down
heart disease by 30 percent, and they are
beginning to latch onto that. ”
Sweat: Exercise to prevent illness sounds
logical—but not much fun. There are ways,
however, to sweeten bitter medicine. No
sport has proven so alluring as aerobic danc-
ing, the blend of calisthenics, stretching and
jogging that has revolutionized the exercise
game. Aerobics, usually done to upbeat rock
music, is not just a rigorous workout for the
cardio-respiratory system. It is now a social
event as well. “Before, exercise was dull and
boring,” says Eric Simian, the owner of a
chic Parisian health club who helped import
In Hong Kong: Never too old to get in shape
RICHARD TOMPKINS—GAMMA-LIAISON
the aerobics craze from the United States to
France three years ago. “Aerobics is fun.”
Indeed, it’s a party, an explosion of colors,
music—and sweat.
Aerobics is particularly popular among
women between the ages of 25 and 35—an
audience that has often resisted other forms
of exercise. In France, where women have
traditionally assumed a ho-hum attitude
toward physical fitness, the aerobics craze is
so hot that 2 million people now tune in to
the weekly TV program “Gym Tonic” to
work out with the guidance of two svelte
instructors, Veronique and Davina. Even in
Poland where joggers are still viewed with
suspicion, aerobics has become so popular
that one school now has a waiting list of
more than 400 people. “We were brought
up to see physical fitness as inferior to other
things,” says Polish actress Dorota Sta-
linska who last spring brought aerobics to
the masses via television. “Now when I
travel around Poland, men often come up
and thank me for, as they say, ‘finally get-
ting my wife interested in exercising’.”
If aerobics is the medium, the principal
bearer of the message is unquestionably
American actress Jane Fonda. Since the
“Jane Fonda Workout Book” was first pub-
lished in the United States in 1981, it has
been translated into 19 languages—even
Serbo-Croatian and Icelandic. The book hit
the best-seller lists throughout Europe and
has been distributed in 22 countries. Fonda’s
workout video cassette —dubbed into eight
languages and subtitled in four—is now sell-
ing in 23 countries, and is a prized property
on the black market in parts of South Amer-
ica and in Poland where the tapes are labori-
ously copied and passed on from person to
person. “A teacher has to be dynamic, and
Jane Fonda has charisma,” says Femmy
DeLyser, a Dutch nurse who wrote “Jane
Fonda’s Workout Book for Pregnancy,
Birth and Recovery.” Fonda’s pregnan-
cy program has also enjoyed some suc-
cess; the book has 11 foreign editions and
the video cassette is sold in 23 countries.
Weight Machines: While aerobics has
captured women’s imagination, more
conventional body building is rapidly
becoming an athletic cause celebre
among men. In Brazil the fascination
with pumping iron American style has
given birth to musculacao (literally, mus-
cle-izing). Today there are dozens of sa-
lons and gyms equipped with imported or
imitation Nautilus and Universal ma-
chines. In West Germany the number of
health clubs equipped with Nautilus-
type weight machines has grown to
1,000, a 50 percent increase in the last
three years. Even women are getting in-
terested. They accounted for only 5 per-
cent of the readership of the body-build-
ing magazine Sport and Fitness when it
first hit West Germany’s newsstands in
late 1981; today women represent 40 per-
cent of the publication’s 100,000 readers.
The sport that has had the greatest sue-
cess in cutting across age, sex and class lines
is jogging, occasional boredom notwith-
standing. In Japan it has become something
of a national pastime as the jogging popula-
tion has swelled to close to 6 million people.
During the January-to-March marathon
season, Japanese fascination with the live
start-to-finish race coverage on television is
as obsessive as World Cup soccer fever. In
South Africa 8,000 people now enter The
Comrades, a supermarathon that traverses
70 miles. And Australians have become so
enthusiastic about jogging that the list of
annual races keeps growing, and now in-
cludes a demanding 500-mile, Sydney-to-
Melbourne marathon. Small wonder that

Gymnastics for the Masses
In Moscow: Aerobics offers a mixture of exercise, socializing and fun
JOYCE BARNATHAN— NEWSWEEK
To judge by the mellow rock and roll music and the colorful
assortment of leg warmers, Adidas T shirts and leotards, the
exercise class could be American. But halfway through the 45-
minute workout, after the stretching and the sit-ups, and before
the graceful dance steps, the session takes a surprising turn. “Are
you tired?” instructor Liliya Olenyeva asks the cluster of sweat-
ing women. Are they tired? Let’s be frank: how many American
aerobics teachers would ask that question?
This class is in the Soviet Union, where the fast-growing field
of aerobics is somewhat different from its American equivalent.
The Russian emphasis is on grace and flexi-
bility, rather than stimulation of the cardio-
respiratory system. The Soviets call the exer-
cise form “rhythmic gymnastics,” and they
say it was born 25 years ago at the respected
Tartu University in Estonia. That claim is
perhaps open to dispute. Like many East-
West differences these days, the Soviet con-
tention seems more a matter of semantics
than of substance. Dancelike exercise, by
whatever name, is still dancelike exercise—
and some Soviet women prefer to think they
are on the cutting edge of the exciting Ameri-
can aerobics craze. An Estonian import?
“Oh no, dear, I don’t know who told you
that,” said a 35-year-old enthusiast who
takes classes at Moscow’s Lenin Stadium.
“Jane Fonda invented aerobics. ”
Starch:The exercise epidemic is spread-
ing in the Soviet Union. Some 20 institutes in
Moscow now offer regular classes, and the
sport is gaining popularity in cities from
Krasnodar to Sverdlovsk. Most of the par-
ticipants are women in their 20s and 30s who
are determined to shed excess weight put on
by starch-heavy diets. “There is no doubt
that we now think about our health more,”
says one student. “I didn’t do any exercise
before, but now I go three times a week.”
There are good reasons why rhythmic
gynmastics is succeeding where other
trendy exercises have failed. Many Soviet
women find jogging “too boring,” and yoga
“too meditative.” But aerobics classes
seem to offer just the right mix of exercise,
socializing and plain old fun. “It’s rather
like a disco without the cigarette smoke
and beer,” says a 27-year-old devotee.
Most women find the workout invigorat-
ing, but not overly demanding, and say it
improves posture and restores their fig-
ures after childbearing.
The simple calisthenics also satisfy the
fantasies of many young women who
once may have dreamed of joining the
Soviet Union’s highly esteemed gymnas-
tics team. The new craze bears little re-
semblance to the rigors of “artistic gym-
nastics,” where athletes compete on
dangerous equipment and perform grav-
ity-defying tumbling stunts. There is not
even much kinship with another com-
petitive sport that also bears the name
“rhythmic gymnastics. ” It evolved in the
Soviet Union in the 1950 s and made its
debut as an Olympic event at the Games
in Los Angeles, despite the sad absence of
the top-notch Soviet team. This competi-
tive form involves a combination of tumbling and acrobatic
dance, and requires the juggling of ribbons, hoops, batons and
balls, objects seldom used in popular exercise classes.
Soviet authorities are now rigorously promoting the non-
competitive exercise form. The country’s Sports Committee
recently adopted a resolution calling for “the widespread intro-
duction of rhythmic gymnastics.” Moscow has ordered local
sports committees to organize classes at clubs and educational
institutes, and has announced plans to train new teachers and to
improve the quality of instruction. Last spring Soviet television
Stretching: Shaking excess weight
JOYCE BARNATHAN— NEWSWEEK
broadcast a few rhythmic-gymnastics pro-
grams, and the enthusiastic reception of
these classes has persuaded officials to put
together a regular, twice-weekly show.
Moscow’s enthusiasm does not stop
there. Officials have promised the “mass
output of records, video cassettes, booklets
and handbooks” offering instruction —and
the Sports Committee has even directed the
country’s House of Fashion to develop a
“pattern of sports clothes for rhythmic-
gymnastics classes.” The last ploy is clever.
It plays right to the heart of the country’s
fashion-conscious —but often fashion-frus-
trated —women. “Clothes play a certain
role,” instructor Vasilyevna Kramina told
the magazine Sovietskaya Kultura. “Wom-
en are always attracted by what is fashion-
able.” Indeed, women in exercise groups
already compete among themselves to see
who can knit the snazziest leg warmers.
Given the sport’s accent on apparel and
its emphasis on gentle movement, it is hard-
ly surprising that most Soviet men pooh-
pooh rhythmic gymnastics. “I get more ex-
ercise chopping a piece of wood,” sniffs an
unimpressed male. Such sentiments are not
only overstated; they miss the point. Rhyth-
mic gymnastics is coaxing a largely plump
female population to shape up and trim
down. And what’s wrong with that?

At a company gym in West Germany, jogging along in Hong Kong: Physically fit employees tend to have a lower absentee rate
SIEMENS PRESSEBILD
RICHARD TOMPKINS—GAMMA-LIAISON
Australians no longer bat an eye when jog-
ging addicts such as Ross King say, “After a
particularly stressful day, there’s nothing
like a 15-mile run to get you to relax.”
The fitness frenzy takes on a decidedly
local flavor in some countries. In the Soviet
Union, where gymnasts have long held top
rankings in the athletic community, rhyth-
mic gymnastics is rapidly becoming the
most popular form of exercise among wom-
en. Australians have turned to aquarobics,
an entertaining blend of aerobics and swim-
ming. Brazilian successes in international
volleyball, soccer and swimming competi-
tions have given a boost to recreational par-
ticipation in all three sports. In China wu-
shu—the various martial-art forms once
attacked by Red Guards as “feudal rem-
nants” —is enjoying a resurgence. More
than 20 million people are said to practice
some form of the exercise system daily.
Many government-sponsored agencies
are now jumping on the exercise bandwagon
and coaxing reluctant spectators to join the
fun. The West German Sports Federation
has launched an aggressive media campaign
called “Trimming-130.” The program en-
courages people to boost their pulse to a rate
of 130 three times a week for a duration of 10
minutes. In Britain the $1.5 million “Look
After Yourself’ campaign aims to get the
public exercising more, smoking less and
eating more nutritional meals. Brazil’s
“Move It” strategy enjoins people to use
stairs instead of elevators, to walk instead of
drive and to work out instead of snack out.
And while there is no crusade with a catchy
title in China, the release last autumn of a
picture showing leader Deng Xiaoping, then
79 years old, taking a swim probably did
more to promote exercise than any slick
promotional campaign could have done.
Corporations are also doing their share to
promote fitness. Some offer a psychological
boost, such as the Tokyo hotel developer
who extends a retirement deferral to any
elderly employee who passes the firm’s fit-
ness test. Other companies make it possible
to exercise without leaving the work prem-
ises. Fitness For Industry Ltd., a three-year-
old British concern that sets up and staffs on-
site health facilities for companies, had four
centers 20 months ago; today it has 18 —and
includes members of the House of Commons
among its clients. Many Hong Kong compa-
nies provide swimming, squash, tennis and
soccer facilities. In West Germany more
than 1 million people now enjoy in-house
sports facilities. The electronics company
Siemens AG, for instance, spends almost $4
million annually on company sports.
Such gestures are generous, but there is
more at work here than just corporate altru-

ism. Physically fit employees tend to be
absent less often. The West German chemi-
cal concern Bayer Leverkusen, which has
installed in-house sports facilities, boasts of
a sickness rate 2 percent below that of com-
panies that do not have in-house exercise
rooms. A plastics factory in Canton, which
has organized jogging and team sports for
its workers, provides an even more dramat-
ic example of the benefits of exercise. “As a
result, [the workers] have acquired greater
tolerance to stress, cut down absenteeism
and become a more productive force,” says
an article in a January issue of China Sports.
The public fascination with the body
beautiful —and the body healthy—has
made the exercise business a moneymaker.
In Japan it ranks sixth among the country’s
10 most promising industrial sectors. The
most obvious boom is in sports facilities. The
People Co., a subsidiary of the Nichii super-
market chain, Japan’s fifth largest retail
conglomerate, forecasts 1984 sales of $43
million from its chain of aerobics studios,
which it hopes will grow from the current 13
to 250 facilities by 1987. In Brazil there are
4,300 exercise studios in Rio de Janeiro
alone, most of them run by athletes turned
entrepreneurs. And in France some 5 mil-
lion people now spend between $3OO and
$6OO annually on health-club memberships.
‘Doing Cooper’: Products that promote
do-it-yourself health care and exercise are
also proving to be profitable. Magazines
such as California Diet and Exercise and
Fitness News are popular items on Tokyo
newsstands. There is a growing number of
high-selling videotapes in addition to Fon-
da’s “Workout. ” A favorite in many parts of
Europe features American actress Sydne
Rome. South Africa offers a cassette called
“The Body,” and Australia has “An Ency-
clopedia of Exercise.” Scores of books are
styled after Fonda’s aerobics workout and
the jogging-for-the-lay-runner techniques
of Canadian marathoner Ken Cooper
(whose methods are so popular in Bra-
zil that a jog is known as “fazer Coo-
per”—doing Cooper). When it comes
to diet and fitness books, says Tim
Baker, marketing manager for Aus-
tralia’s Collins Publishing Co., “we
can publish virtually anything—and
it will sell.”
Countless other industries are also
cashing in on the exercise mania. Tex-
tile market studies show that British
consumers bought 32 million sports-
wear items last year, an increase of 10
million from 1979, representing $lO7
million more in revenue. The hottest
growth item has been track suits; sales
have jumped 80 percent from 1982 to
1983. In Japan, where the health in-
dustry accounts for $8 billion in annu-
al revenue, several leading companies
have diversified in seemingly unlikely
directions. Cosmetic giant Shiseido,
for instance, now produces vitamin
Morning exercise in Peking: Various martial-art forms are back in fashion
drinks. Repetto, the most popular manufac-
turer of French dance wear, has enlarged
and brightened its clothing and shoe lines to
attract recreational as well as professional
dancers. “We have doubled our sales in three
years,” says Repetto president Rene Gola.
“The market is growing, sometimes by 50
percent or more a year.”
Despite such growth, there are a few
clouds on an otherwise bright horizon. True,
aerobics is now the recreational sport of
choice among women in many countries,
But in some parts of Europe it has gone into a
premature retirement, perhaps because su-
pertrendy activities have a tendency to burn
themselves out through overexposure. In
West Germany half of the 4,000 aerobics
studios that opened last year have now shut
down. “People got allergic to the word aero-
bics,” says Sydne Rome, the high priestess of
European aerobics. But Rome does not be-
lieve aerobics has faded into oblivion. In
hopes of reviving sagging Italian interest in
Slimming down in Poland: Wooing the exercise resistant
CHRIS NIEDENTHAL
aerobics, she is trying to persuade the coun-
try’s Sports Federation to train instructors
to teach aerobics in the schools. Rome says
the federation is “gung-ho” about the idea.
In many places the issue of proper train-
ing continues to stir debate. In South Africa,
which has the world’s highest incidence of
heart disease, doctors are worried by the
increasing number of injuries sustained in
aerobics classes. The South African Associ-
ation of Sports Science has responded by
developing a training program for instruc-
tors. In France physical-education instruc-
tors are irritated that while they must obtain
a government diploma to teach, aerobics
teachers do not require formal qualifica-
tions. Now two rival aerobics federations —
the French Association of Aerobics-
Stretching and the French International
Federation of Dance and Aerobics Methods
(FIFDAM) —are battling for the right to
train future teachers. Says Anne Bedault,
cofounder of FIFDAM: “It’s gotten so that
everybody wants to teach aerobics —
even the concierges.”
Energy: Despite such concerns,
adult exercise is hardly a fly-by-night
fad. Aerobics may go the way of the
Hula Hoop, but there are plenty of
healthy diversions to take its place.
The newest American sensation,
break-dancing, has already reached
as far as Poland and Australia. “The
kind of exercises and the way they are
taught will change, but exercise will
only increase,” says DeLyser. “At
this point, exercise is a necessity.”
Given the unbeatable rewards of rec-
reational sports —better health, firm-
er bodies, more energy—it seems cer-
tain that fitness fever will continue to
rage for generations to come.

ART
Britain’s Art Drain
Foreign buyers are snapping up everything in sight.
Suddenly, it seemed that everything was
for sale —and everyone but the British
were buying. On July 4 the Duke of Dev-
onshire sold 71 drawings by old masters to
pay for repairs on his country house,
Chatsworth. The sale was a record for an
auction, $28.5 million, and many of the
bidders were foreign. The next day the
family of the late art historian Lord Clark
sold a seascape by Britain’s celebrated
19th-century painter J. M. W. Turner for
$lO million. The buyer is still anonymous,
but some fear the painting will not remain
in British hands for very long.
The sales caused a furor in Britain and
fueled fears of an ever-increasing art drain.
As high taxes and crumbling estates have
put more and more art on the
auction block, critics worry
that Britain could lose what is
still the world’s greatest collec-
tion of privately held art. De-
spite government efforts to pre-
vent the loss of national
treasures, paintings and sculp-
tures are being snapped up by
foreign buyers—particularly
Americans. At a time when the
dollar is strong and the pound
is weak, sales have been mount-
ing week by week. The British
government estimates that art
purchases last year hit a record
high: more than a half-billion
dollars, with about a third of
the works of art going overseas.
“Containers loaded with paint-
ings and furnishings are going
to the States every week,” com-
plains Brian Lang, secretary of
the government-endowed Na-
tional Heritage Memorial
Fund. “The stuff is flowing out
of this country.”
To nervous British art pa-
trons, the most sinister villains
are the executives at the J. Paul
Getty Museum, the museum-
that-oil-built in Malibu, Calif.
Unlike most museums, the Get-
ty has lots of money—more
than any other museum in the
world. To maintain its tax-
exempt status, the Getty must
spend between $B5 million and
$9O million a year, with some-
what less than half of the money
going to acquisitions. “The
Getty is moving on the offen-
sive against us,” Lord St. Os-
wald said in the House of Lords
earlier this year. “The Getty’s full weight in
the art market has yet to be felt. And unless
we take steps to prevent it, the ‘Getty factor’
may easily swamp us.”
The Getty, of course, takes a different
view. Since 1981, director John Walsh says,
the museum has purchased only 37 works of
art in Great Britain, including 7 drawings at
the Chatsworth sale. He contends his muse-
um avoids acquiring obvious national treas-
ures and puts a limit on its spending. In fact,
the museum twice lost to others during the
Chatsworth auction because bidding went
above the Getty’s self-imposed ceiling. “It
was private collectors who wreaked the
havoc,” Walsh says, “not the Getty.” The
British government backs him up. “At the
Duccio's ‘The Crucifixion': A David-against-Goliath battle
A. C. COOPER
moment, [the Getty] is treated rather un-
fairly,” says Britain’s Art Minister Lord
Gowrie. “I have to say that so far they have
behaved with exemplary responsibility and
fairness.”
Much of the anti-Getty feeling in Britain
was stirred up by a David-and-Goliath bat-
tle to save a 14th-century Italian master-
piece that the museum purchased from an
anonymous British owner last December.
When the Getty bought “The Crucifixion,”
usually attributed to the Sienese master
Duccio di Buoninsegna, for $2.6 million, it
was as if a line had been drawn. The British
art establishment went all out to keep the
painting in the country. The government’s
Office of Arts and Library assisted by delay-
ing an export license for an unprecedented
seven months. Another government agen-
cy, however, would not help. The National
Heritage Memorial Fund refused to con-
tribute funds on the ground that the paint-
ing was Italian and had been in Great Brit-
ain for only 130 years. “It can’t be said to
have influenced British painting and artistic
life,” fund secretary Lang said.
The Manchester City Art
Gallery, a leader in the battle,
was stunned. “We thought that
was the end,” recalls director
Timothy Clifford. But the me-
dia helped launch a successful
fund-raising campaign—with
help from two unlikely contri-
butions: one from John Paul
Getty 11, the disinherited heir
of the Getty Museum’s
founder, the other from the Na-
tional Heritage Memorial
Fund, which decided to reverse
its decision. “The circum-
stances had changed entirely,”
Lang said. “We could now act
as a true safety net.”
Balance: There is little agree-
ment in Britain over how to
protect art treasures from for-
eign buyers—or whether they
need protecting at all. “We
can’t have everything,” says
Graham Wiffen of the Office of
Arts and Libraries. “Just be-
cause something is purchased
by the Getty doesn’t mean it’s
lost to the world.” Many say
that the current system of re-
viewing export license applica-
tion will keep national treasures
from leaving the country. The
government suspended export
licenses for at least 3 of the 71
drawings in the Chatsworth
auction, including one bought
by the Getty, in the hope of
finding a British buyer. “We are
trying to strike a delicate bal-
ance between the need to pro-
tect our national heritage and
maintaining London and Brit-
ain as a world market,” Wiffen

“When the AMPcontracted me to
specify carpet for Sydney Tower. I chose
the best available fibre: Antmn’lll”
Roy Tuersley, floor covering consultant, talking about the AMP's Sydney Tower.
(No. I in a series of people who know carpets.)
More than a million pairs of eyes have studied Sydney from Sydney
Tower’s observation decks, and an equal number of feet have trodden, tramp-
ed, tortured and scuffed the Tower's carpets in the process.
But every one of those footprints was anticipated by the AMP’s carpet
consultant, Roy Tuersley. Working within strict budgets to find a long-lasting
carpet that could carry heavy traffic and still look good, he specif ed carpet
that contained Du Pont Antron 111 nylon fibre.
“This new generation of nylon fibre has an astounding ability to tolerate
abuse," he says, “and to hold its appearance year after year.”

says. “They might seem to be incompatible,
but we think we have the balance right.”
Many Americans believe the British are
overreacting. “Why are they so worried
about losing a Turner?” asks critic Amei
Wallach of Newsday. “The Tate Gallery in
London is full of them.” More than one
American museum director has noted that
the Chatsworth sale represented only a
handful of more than 2,000 drawings still
owned by the Duke of Devonshire. “I think
they have worked themselves into a Chick-
en Little situation,” says Thomas Hoving,
former head of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York. “My feeling is that it is
all a bunch of hysteria.”
Some Americans believe that the British
attitude smacks of hypocrisy. Many works
by foreign artists were purchased when
Britain was strong and the pound was domi-
nant. As some American buyers see it, Brit-
ain wants to change the rules now that its
power has diminished. “I think some for-
eign art has definite deep roots,” says the
Getty’s Walsh. He cites as an example “In-
terior of St. Bavo’s Church, Haarlem,” a
Dutch painting by Pieter Jansz Saenredam
given to James I in the 17th century and
eventually bought by the National Museum
of Scotland. “It was a part of English life,”
Walsh says. “It would have been a misfor-
tune for it to leave. I had no such feelings
about the Duccio. If the roots are shallow, it
should be allowed to move.”
The British sellers would also like to see
the art “move” —but in what they consider
to be the right direction. The Duke of Dev-
onshire argues that there should be better
tax breaks for sellers so that British muse-
ums can realistically compete on the private
market. He regrets the Chatsworth sale.
“The drawings should have gone to the
British Museum,” he said. “That way they
would have stayed in this country.” But
until Britain’s economic troubles are over,
the art drain is likely only to continue.

Why Cynicism Can Be Fatal
Cynics, Oscar Wilde once said, are those
who know the price of everything and
the value of nothing. Even the savviest cyn-
ic, however, has probably not calculated
that cynicism itself may have a heavy cost:
increased risk of coronary disease. By the
recent reckoning of psychiatrists at Duke
University Medical Center, the untrusting
heart is often unhealthy as well. While ex-
ploring the so-called Type A personality—
supposedly more prone to
heart attacks —the researchers
identified one flaw as fatal.
“We suggest that ‘cynicism,’
better than any other single
word, captures the toxic ele-
ment in the Type A personal-
ity,” says Duke scientist Red-
ford Williams.
Type A was introduced in
the 19505, when cardiologists
Meyer Friedman and Ray Ro-
senman discovered that impa-
tient souls who walked and ate
quickly, interrupted others and
drove themselves relentlessly
were more likely to suffer heart
problems than calmer Type B
brethren. Subsequent studies
supported their findings and
their two classifications drifted
into popular use. But more re-
cent studies failed to make the
link so conclusively. Williams
and his colleagues suspected that one reason
might be that Type A was too broadly de-
fined—and might even include beneficial
traits—so they set out to refine the profile.
“The situation is analogous to the cholester-
ol story,” Williams says. “We once thought
that all cholesterol was bad; now there
is ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol. In the
same way, we are finding that some compo-
nents of Type A behavior are far worse
than others.”
Hostility Scores: Williams suspected that
hostility might be the missing link. He
therefore administered a section of the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven-
tory (MMPI) that measures hostility to
more than 1,500 patients being examined
because of atherosclerotic symptoms.
Those who had high levels of hostility, he
found, were 50 percent more likely to have
clogged arteries than those who scored
low. Since the MMPI had been widely
used since the 19505, scientists were also
able to backtrack and confirm the initial
results. One study of 255 physicians who
took the test during their residencies 25
years ago showed, for example, that those
with high hostility scores had five times
more heart disease than those who scored
below the median.
Then the Duke researchers decided to
refine matters even more, examining just
what kind of “hostility” the tests measured.
Williams and psychologist Paul Costa of
the National Institute on Aging analyzed
the true-false questions—and discovered
that most really were weighing mistrust.
(Samples: “Most people lie to get ahead,”
and “It is safer to trust nobody.”)
People who score high “are not angry,”
DRAWING BY LORENZ; © 1983 THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE, INC.
A distrustful Type A on the job: Tough on the arteries
concludes Costa. “They are just cynical.”
The researchers argue that the link be-
tween cynicism and heart disease also
makes sense physiologically. Laboratory
experiments have shown that mistrustful
people produce more “fight-or-flight” hor-
mones in a variety of situations than do less
cynical folk. Since these hormones are be-
lieved to accelerate plaque buildup on ar-
tery walls —“hardening” of the arteries —
those who expect the worst from the world
around them might find themselves leaving
it sooner.
The Duke findings come on the heels of
other revelations about Type A’s from
their coprogenitor, Meyer Friedman. In
his most recent study, Friedman reports
that hard-driving behavior is sometimes
reversible —and that those who do slow
down significantly lower their risk of suf-
fering heart attacks. Williams hopes that
the dangers of cynicism may also be re-
duced or even prevented. He suggests,
howevef', that drugs to block the offending
hormones may be a better bet than behav-
ior modification. Those who have already
made a career of disbelief, after all, will not
be so easily persuaded to adopt a change of
heart.

WORLD BUSINESS
Hong Kong’s Textile Blues
Blum, Fang: With Washington cracking down on imports, the industry is ‘in a panic’—and local businessmen are crying ‘foul’
RICHARD TOMKINS
PATRICK L. SMITH—Newsweek
As the air thickens with Cantonese chat-
ter and sounds from a blaring radio,
women huddle over whirring machines in
fluorescent-lit rows. Their feet work pedals
that activate the machines, their hands guide
panels under the needles and their eyes
strain, fixed on the work. Daily, the women
“link and loop,” assembling the sweaters
that will carry fashion’s most sought-after
discount and couture labels —also bearing,
with quiet pride, the four little words: Made
in Hong Kong.
But as U.S. textile and apparel imports
soared 44 percent during the first seven
months of this year, those little words have
become a big irritation to Ronald Reagan.
This week a new rule issued by the U.S.
Customs Service threatens to choke the
flow of imported textiles and silence much
of the whirring from abroad. “The industry
is in a panic,” says Kenneth Fang, director
of Hong Kong’s Fang Brothers Textiles.
“We are fighting for our survival.”
Quotas: The new rule will require proof
that “substantial transformation” of a gar-
ment was made within a nation’s borders
before it could carry a label bearing that
country’s name. It is now a common —and
legal—practice for garments to be trans-
shipped from country to country before be-
ing exported to the United States. Yarn may
be spun in one country, dyed in another,
knitted into panels—the back, front and
sleeves of a sweater, for example—in a third
and finally assembled, labeled and shipped
in a fourth. Currently, these last steps deter-
mine a garment’s country of origin for the
purposes of U.S. import quotas.
The U.S. move will shift country-of-ori-
gin status back to initial production sites —
usually nations with lower quotas that are
quickly filled. While many will be hurt by the
rule—one trade official in Taiwan predicts it
will cost that nation $lOO million in annual
sales—Hong Kong and China will undoubt-
edly suffer most. Only a decade ago, knitting
was a cottage industry in the British colony,
with thousands of small shops subcontract-
ing work for the bigger export companies,
But as wages rose, knitters moved inland to
China’s Guangdong Province, where labor
costs are about a third of Hong Kong’s,
About 90 percent ofHong Kong’s knitting is
now done in China, then shipped to Hong
Kong for assembly. Each year more than
800 companies in the colony sell about $250
million worth of knit goods—with a retail
value of $1.2 billion—to American buyers,
The new rule, scheduled to go into effect this
week, could wipe out as much as 15 percent
of those sales.
From Washington’s point of view, that
would hardly be catastrophic, especially
given the current surge in U.S. textile im-
ports from the Far East. During the first five
months of this year, clothing and textile
imports from Thailand were up 97 percent
over the same period last year; Indonesia’s
were up 227 percent. In July a record
1 billion square yards of foreign textiles and
apparel flooded the American market. U.S.
customs officials believe that illegal trading
practices—including false labeling, forged
import licenses and quota-dodging trans-
shipments of finished goods—may have
contributed to the increase. “Customs has
caught $2O million worth of fraudulently
traded goods so far this year,” says Wally
Lenahan, a Commerce Department textile
official in Washington. “God knows how
much more is getting through.”
But overseas businessmen are themselves
crying foul. During his 1980 campaign, Rea-
gan promised Southern textile-producing
states that he would stand tough against
imports. The latest proposal is clearly de-
signed to do just that. But it has also angered
many domestic retailers and trade groups,
who fear higher prices and a possible trade
war with China. “It’s a politically inspired
restriction,” says Jimmy McGregor, direc-
tor of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce. “It’s a shabby trick by the coun-
try we depend on to maintain free trade.”
Appeals: Last week a group of American
retailers and trade organizations filed suit to
block the new rule in the U.S. Court of
International Trade. Hong Kong officials
will make a similar appeal to Geneva-based
administrators of the multifiber agreement
governing textile exports, on the ground that
the U.S. move was made without the re-
quired international consultations. “We
need to get past the elections and put aside
the political demands —and then begin to
negotiate,” says Alex Blum, an American
businessman in Hong Kong who exports $3O
million in up-market apparel annually.
In the meantime, Peking sent a stern
warning to the United States. (American
farmers fear a Chinese embargo on U.S.
grain purchases.); Hong Kong traders are
considering a boycott of American tobacco
imports (manufactured in the same states
seeking protection from textile imports);
exporters are racing against deadlines set up
by the new rules, scrambling for space on
freighters to ship $5OO million worth of
textiles and apparel—already ordered for
the American Christmas season —and some
Hong Kong firms are considering plans to
bring back some of the 100,000 knitting
machines they installed in China. One
Hong Kong exporter has even proposed a
daily import of low-wage Guangdong
workers to the colony, “just to show the
protectionists” that rules can still be bent.

Flights of Imagination
Grumman’s radical new X-29 fighter: Inherent instability but nimble supersonic flight
Technology is changing the shape of planes to come.
As the August sun burned off the morn-
ing fog at Grumman Corp.’s flight-test
center in Calverton, N.Y., last week, a
crowd of more than 1,000 gathered in a
darkened hangar. With fanfare worthy of a
Hollywood variety show, heavy black cur-
tains drew aside to reveal the X-29, a slen-
der, almost fragile-looking plane with wings
swept forward in a radical new aerodynam-
ic design. “The X-29 marks our rededica-
tion to maintaining America’s technologi-
cal edge,” Vice President George Bush, a
former Navy pilot, told the crowd.
The X-29 is the first experimental
X-series aircraft in more than a decade —
and it heralds the beginning of a new era in
aviation technology. Virtually all of today’s
front-line military and civilian aircraft are
based on technologies developed several
decades ago. There have been refinements
since, but no radical innovations. Faced with
new demands for high performance at the
lowest possible cost, aircraft designers are
turning to wild-blue-yonder ideas. “We de-
cided we had to return to the days when we
were willing to take major risks to make
spectacular advances,” says Robert Cooper,
director of DARPA, the Pentagon’s De-
fense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
which funded the $l4O million X-29 pro-
gram along with Grumman.
The X-29 is only one of the technological
advances now under way. A joint engineer-
ing team from Bell Helicopter Textron and
Boeing is designing a military air lifter called
the JVX, a craft that looks —and works —
like a cross between a helicopter and a plane.
Sikorsky Aircraft is working on an X-wing
aircraft that would lift olf like a helicopter,
then freeze the rotor in place, forming what
amounts to an X-shaped wing. The Army is
planning a new lightweight helicopter, the
LHX. And the Air Force
is exploring the concept
of a transatmospheric ve-
hicle (TAV), a 21st-cen-
tury plane that would en-
ter space briefly for
transcontinental flight at
hypersonic speeds. If
successful, the TAV
would cut flying times to
the realm of science fic-
tion: the 17-hour journey
from Los Angeles to Syd-
ney, Australia, would
take under 90 minutes.
For the moment, com-
mercial travelers won’t have to
confront such mind-warping tech-
nology. The jet transports now
flying will dominate commercial
aviation for years to come. But
here, too, dramatic changes are in
store. Later this month Avtek
Corp., a small firm in Camarillo,
Calif., is expected to roll out its
Avtek 400, a plane built not of
aluminum but of high-strength,
lightweight composites. It has ca-
nards —stubby winglike control
surfaces —forward of the wings
and twin turboprop engines
mounted to face backward. Beech
Aircraft is bringing out a similar
plane, and Lear Fan Ltd. is at-
tempting to bring out its Lear Fan,
with a single rear-mounted turbo-
prop, despite past problems with
the composite fuselage which has
failed under pressure. Ironically,
one of the newest ideas for com-
mercial transports, prompted by
dramatic increases in jet-fuel
prices, is the return of the prop.
NASA has developed a swept-
blade prop for high-speed subsonic
flight that is 30 percent more effi-
cient than current jet engines.
Stress: Many designs now on the
drawing boards depend on ad-
vances in materials, electronics
and computer technologies. Com-
posites—basically epoxy resins re-
inforced with carbon-graphite, Kevlar or
glass fit> ers — are likely to be crucial in the
next generation of airframes. The new com-
positesareasmuchas2spercentlighterthan
aluminum and seven timesas strong as steel,
and they are more efficient aerodynamically
because they can be made without rivets and
joints. The X-29, for example, relies on corn-
posites; had it been built of metal, the plane
would be unable to withstand the huge
stresses on the forward-swept wings. Exist-
ing commercial transports already use corn-
posites for some parts, such as wing flaps and
the entire tailfin section of the Boeing 757.
But composites do have drawbacks. They do
not withstand point pressures as well as
high-strength metal alloys, are less heat re-
sistant and do not behave as predictably as
metal—which means that the next genera-

Hughes Helicopter’s LHX concept: A one-man craft with an electronic copilot
tion of commercial transports will probably
continue to use metal for such parts as main
spars, wing-support boxes and landing gear.
Advances in electronics and computer
technologies will bring even more dramatic
changes. Today’s integrated circuits make it
possible to build so-called fly-by-wire con-
trols, which will become even more sophisti-
cated with the next generation of chips and
fiber optics. Ever since the Wright brothers
took off at Kitty Hawk, aircraft controls
have relied on mechanical and hydraulic
systems of cables, pulleys and push rods to
activate the control surfaces. Digital fly-by-
wire systems replace those with electronics.
The design of the X-29 wouldn’t work with-
out digital fly-by-wire controls: the plane,
engineered for nimble supersonic flight, is
inherently unstable and requires computer
adjustment of the control surface 40 times a
second, much faster than any human pilot
could manage. If the triple-redundant com-
puters should fail, the plane would tear itself
apart in less than two-tenths of a second.
Aside from saving weight and eliminat-
ing many mechanical problems, digital fly-
by-wire systems allow airplanes to be flown
in ways conventional controls don’t allow.
In its Advanced Fighter Technology Inte-
gration (AFTI) program, the Air Force has
equipped an experimental F-16 with a com-
puter system that enables reprogramming
of flight rules at the touch of a button. A
pilot engaged in a dogfight could move the
nose, make the plane rise or fall or make a
flat turn —without banking—simply by
changing modes with a cockpit switch.
With sensors built into the computers as
takeoff as a helicopter , XV-15 (right) cruising as a plane
well, the Air Force hopes
to create an airborne
damage-control system
that would assess dam-
age from enemy fire and
adjust the plane’s other
control surfaces to keep
it flying. In a civilian air-
craft such a system
might have prevented
the 272-death crash of a
DC-10 in Chicago five
years ago, when an en-
gine tore off, destroying
control cables in the
wing and causing the
flaps on one side to retract. The pilot, unable
to see what had happened, didn’t retract the
flaps on the other side to compensate, and
the plane barrel-rolled into the ground.
Researchers are also working on comput-
erized controls that will vary the shape of an
airplane’s wings to suit maneuvering re-
quirements. The mission-adaptive wing be-
ing tested on a modified F- 111 fighter-
bomber uses a flexible fiber-glass cover over
movable metal struts in the front and back
part of the wing. On command from the
flight computer, the struts move back and
forth or up and down to give it the flaps-
down shape for takeoff and landing, tear-
drop shape for normal flight or the flatter
shape that is more efficient for high-speed
flight. The seamless surfaces also reduce
drag; overall, the wing increases a plane’s
range by 20 to 30 percent.
Video: Electronics are also simplifying
the cockpit. Instead of dizzying banks of
dials and gauges, the pilot will monitor
video screens and will likely be able to tell
the aircraft what to do using voice com-
mands. In the end, DARPA hopes to create
a “pilot’s assistant”—a computer that
could sort through the deluge of informa-
tion to pick out enemy threats and even take
over flying the plane at critical moments.
When will the new designs actually take
to the skies? Nontechnological consider-
ations are involved here, particularly the
political battles over the Reagan adminis-
tration’s Pentagon buildup. At the moment,
the Advanced Tactical Fighter program,
intended to replace the high-performance
F-15, is in the early design stage. The ATF is
expected to be built with at least 50 percent
composites and coated with radar-absorb-
ing substances. To reduce drag, it will likely
Avtek turboprop: The past as future
carry its weapons internally, unlike current
fighters. That and better engines will enable
the ATF to cruise supersonically for long
distances; today’s fighters, using after-
burners, are limited to short, fuel-squander-
ing bursts of high speed. All this won’t be
cheap: the ATF planes are likely to run 30 to
50 percent more than the F-15, which now
costs the Air Force $4O million each.
The tilt-rotor JVX, being developed for
the Navy and Marine Corps, will likely be
the first truly all-composite military plane,
as much as 90 percent made of fiber and
plastic resins. The design is being scaled up
from the Bell XV-15 tilt-rotor aircraft. Like


the ATF, it will likely use a digital fly-by-
wire or fiber optic fly-by-light computer
system for control. The JVX will lift off and
hover like a helicopter; with its rotors tilted
forward like props, it will also fly at 300
mph, twice the speed of helicopters, and will
be capable of transatlantic flight. If all goes
as planned, the services are expected to buy
more than 900 JVX’s beginning in the early
19905. Commercial versions will probably
be built as well, though the FAA is only
beginning to study the criteria needed to
certify tilt rotors for civilian use.
The tilt-rotor concept may also be used in
the light helicopters the Army wants to
build under the LHX program. Four heli-
copter companies are working on LHX
designs. An unexpected fifth firm—lßM—
is working on a proposal, too: with the
Army’s heavy emphasis on electronics,
IBM could be a competitor even if it had to
subcontract the entire airframe. The LHX
may be a nearly all-composite craft, which
should make it cheaper to build and oper-
ate. The Army also expects to use sophisti-
cated computers to make it a one-pilot
machine.
Stealth: The invisible-to-radar Stealth
bomber, the concept of which former Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter revealed in 1980, re-
mains a supersecret project. The plane is
said to be mostly wing with very little fuse-
lage, and is expected to have magnetic coat-
ings and rounded shapes that make it less
reflective to radar. Specially designed en-
gines will sharply reduce the telltale in-
frared radiation from its exhaust.
The most radical concept, however, is the
transatmospheric vehicle. Manufacturers
have submitted ideas for a TAV to the Air
Force, which has a small team beginning a
“preconceptual investigation” at the re-
search labs at Wright-Patterson AFB in
Dayton, Ohio. The idea for a TAV is to
build an aircraft about the size of a C-5A
transport that could take off horizontally
from any military field, reach altitudes up to
100 miles flying at hypersonic speeds, then
re-enter the atmosphere and land on a mili-
tary airfield. “We’re coming to the point
where space transportation is practical,”
maintains Gene Salvay, TAV program
manager for Lockheed. “There’s no doubt
in my mind that 25 years from now you will
be flying all long-distance flights in space.”
Many technical hurdles must be con-
quered, however, before the dream of build-
ing a TAV becomes anything more than a
designer’s vision. Long before the 21st cen-
tury, a major test for the advanced aviation
technology looms: in November at NASA’s
Dryden Flight Research Facility at Ed-
wards AFB, Grumman’s chief test pilot,
Chuck Sewell, 54, will fly the first test flight
of the X-29. “The most important challenge
still lies ahead,” DARPA’s Col. James All-
burn said bluntly last week, “and that is to
kick this machine into the air.”

RELIGION
Jerusalem in Saudi Arabia?
On that day, God made a covenant with
Abram, saying, “Toyour descendants I have
given this land, from the Egyptian River as
far as the great river, the Euphrates ...”
—Gen. 15:18
For two millenniums, Jews, Christians
and Muslims have assumed that the
land God gave to Abraham and his Israelite
descendants was located in ancient Pales-
tine. Now a Lebanese Christian historian
has looked again at ancient maps and con-
cluded that the early Hebrews’ Promised
Land of “milk and honey” was in fact a
fertile 200-mile strip of Red Sea coastline
—in the country now known as Saudi Ara-
bia. Not only that, says Prof. Kamal Salibi,
chairman of the history and archeology de-
partment at the American University of
MARTA NORMAN—NEWSWEEK
Beirut, but the kingdoms of David and Solo-
mon —including the first temple—were
also on Saudi turf.
In his just completed manuscript, “The
Bible Came From Arabia,” a labor of five
years that is likely to be dismissed by most
scholars and scorned by Israelis and Saudis
alike, Salibi relocates all of Biblical history
from Adam to the end of the Babylonian
exile (about 540 8.C.) in the Saudi region of
Asir (map). As evidence, he points to the
fact that these two provinces contain vil-
lages with names very close to the key place
names mentioned in the Old Testament.
For example, he identifies the Asiri village
of Khirban as the Biblical Hebron, burial
place of Abraham. Similarly, King David’s
Zion is present-day Siyan, a hilltop village
west of Abha. Some 50 miles away, Salibi
believes, excavators would find King Solo-
mon’s ancient capital of Jerusalem under-
neath either Arwa Salam or Ali Shrim. If
Salibi is correct, the Exodus was little more
than a short hike from a town called “Misri-
mah,” meaning “Egypt” in ancient He-
brew. And the Biblical Jordan is actually a
spectacular ridge and watershed running
through the middle of Asir. “Dig Asir,”
Salibi declares, “and you will find the genu-
ine remains of ancient Israel.”
Salibi’s geographical revisionism is based
on an extensive survey of Saudi towns and
villages, comparing them with thousands of
place names found in the Bible. His method
is essentially linguistic. Ancient Hebrew, he
points out, had no vowels. By dropping those
that were added when the modern version of
the Hebrew Bible was edited (between A.D.
600 and 1000, centuries after Hebrew ceased
to be the principal spoken language of the
Jews), Salibi discovered what he considers
striking correspondence. “There are thou-
sands of ancient place names in Palestine,”
he says. “Why are there hardly any Biblical
names among them? By contrast, why do
nearly all the Biblical place names survive in
only one part of the Middle East —the geo-
graphic region of Asir?”
Single Method: The answer, rejoins Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania archeologist James
Sauer, president of the American Schools of
Oriental Research, is that ancient Hebrew
and Arabic come from the same Semitic
family of languages. “By dropping all the
vowels and using only consonants,” Sauer
argues, “I bet you could find the same place
names as far away as Egypt or even Africa,
and then conclude that ancient Jerusalem
was really in Nairobi.” As Sauer sees it,
Salibi has reached sensational conclusions
by a single method —linguistic analysis—
and has ignored the testimony of historians
and archeologists. “Archeologists have
come up with incontrovertible evidence in
the ground that Hebron and Jerusalem are
where the Bible says they are,” Sauer says.
But Salibi has no doubt that Jerusalem
will eventually turn up in Saudi Arabia,
along with Sodom and Gomorrah and King
Solomon’s fabled mines—three Biblical
sites that have so far escaped archeological
sleuths. “In 10 or 20 years, it will be common
knowledge,” he predicts. Until then, Salibi
says, he is “prepared to be a pariah” among
scholars —and even before nations. The
Saudis will hardly welcome archeologists
searchingfor the true Israel on their soil. Nor
will Israelis look with favor on any enter-
prise undermining their claim to the land
they now occupy.

BOOKS
Wives, Witches and Warriors
A 17th-century primer: From sewing to preaching, women proved their worth
The Weaker Vessel. By Antonia Fraser.
544 pages. Knopf. $19.95.
This is the sort of book that we see with
increasing rarity: a substantial contribution
to women’s history that is free of both spe-
cious argument and ideological cant. In the
course of writing her biographies of James I,
Cromwell and Charles 11, Antonia Fraser
came across a great deal of material about
the lives of English women in the 17th
century. This she has now arranged loosely
by subject—women as wives, warriors,
witches, businesswomen, courtesans, mid-
wives, authors, actresses and the like.
Fancies: It would be reasonable to sup-
pose that the century following Elizabeth’s
reign revealed an increased recognition of
women’s interests and abilities. Not so. Men
and women alike continued to adhere to a
variety of fancies and prejudices relating to
“the weaker vessel.” Women were thought
not only physically weaker than men, but
morally inferior, too- —a legacy each woman
inherited from her “Grandmother Eve.” In
an age in which the nature of the female
orgasm was fully understood, woman’s al-
leged sexual insatiability was a matter of
awe. Her appalling talkativeness was axio-
matic, her lack of education cause for con-
tempt. Though rarely offered the opportuni-
ty of learning, the few women who did come
by it were viewed with disapproval and sus-
picion. So, too, did romantic love haveapoor
reputation in the early part of the century;
certainly no woman was expected to marry
for it. Marriage might produce tenderness
and affection, but it was rooted in money and
property. Besides, childbearing was thought
to be a means by which a woman might
redeem her sin: “Most of the leading female
characters of the seventeenth century,” Fra-
ser writes, “were in a state of virtually per-
petual pregnancy.”
For all their dependency and poor repute,
women revealed at this time (as at all times)
idiosyncratic strengths. These strengths are
‘Actoress’ Peg Hughes: Going public
Fraser’s principal concern. If her book has a
theme, it is that women proved “strong
vessels where they had the opportunity: that
is to say, where a particular combination of
character and circumstance enabled them
to be so. In this of course they were exactly
like their male counterparts, no more no
less. ... It was just that women, given the
structure of society at the time, had vastly
fewer public opportunities to demonstrate
their worth and resourcefulness.”
The structure of society was of course
defined by men. The diarist John Evelyn
addresses a woman: “Marriage entitles [the
husband] to your person, and to all you
bring with it of worldly goods, and he can do
with it what he pleases without your con-
sent.” Yet the century provided opportuni-
ties for women to show their mettle. During
the civil war, when their husbands were
away, “Great Heroick” ladies defended
their houses and castles against siege; to
follow their men to war, wives and mistress-
es dressed as men and sometimes fought as
men. In their husbands’ absence, they as-
sumed lawyers’ roles, presenting petitions to
Parliament. As a result of the war, women
(as one of them said) began “to Swagger, to
Swear, to Game, to Drink, to Revell, to
make Factions.” From the 16405, women
began to preach as well. A husband, as one of
these protested, might have “authority over
[his wife] in bodily and civil respects, but not
to be a Lord over her conscience.” The
Quakers endowed women with responsibil-
ities no other English women had, but
subjected them to the suspicion and hostility
that were accorded witches.
Infection: Can woman’s lot be said to have
prospered in this time? Fraser’s gaze is flinty;
her answer: no. One of the lies about histori-
cal progress is that it hunches inexorably
along its way. In fact, progress is cyclical; it
jumps sporadically, only to be set back
again. With the Restoration of 1660, reac-
tion against the disturbances wrought by
women set in. Charles ll’s reign saw the
invention of the “Actoress,” but most of
these were courtesans. As obstetrical knowl-
edge increased, so did childbed mortality—
because the doctors, with their inquiring
hands, were two centuries removed from an
understanding ofbacterial infection.
“The Weaker Vessel” comprises the sto-
ries of a hundred or so women, mostly from
the upper classes, because that’s where rec-
ords were kept. To order so much material
can’t have been easy, but Fraser has done it
with grace and occasional flickers of wit.
Rather than search for examples to prove a
thesis, she assembles data in a way that
discourages facile theorizing. Not the least
of the pleasures her book affords is her
demolition of a daft but currently popular
argument that parents in this time of high
infant mortality were not attached to their
children. The evidence is all against such a
notion, but like many stupid ideas it has
caught on and infected the work of less
scrupulous historians.

If your company
has growing pains,
reading this Ad could
start to cure them.
The kind of growing pains that
hurt successful companies most
are the restrictions on future growth
posed by lack of space in which to
expand, and the frustration of
attempting to introduce up-to-date
production techniques into an
outmoded building design.
Relocation - a painless
answer to future growth.
Hooker Commercial Industrial
Developments have a painless
answer to these problems. First they
will help you to accurately define
the way in which your company will
develop over the next decade or
so, then with an amazingly advan-
tageous pre-leasing scheme they can
re-locate you into a new building
tailor-made for your needs and in
the right location.
A new building -
plus more capital.
Hooker clients like Johnson &
Johnson, Seiko, F.H. Faulding,
Alcoa, and Remington have all been
re-located in this way. You can pre-
lease a new building without the
pain of tying up working capital, plus
you gain an injection of new capital
when you switch from an owner/
occupier situation to leasing your
own premises.
Are your present rentals
far too high?
If you are at present paying excessive
rents in an area where you have no
real need to operate, this Hooker
scheme has big advantages. You
could be paying lower leasing rates
for a more efficient building in a
better area - one where similar or
reciprocal industries already operate,
and where a pool of prospective new
employees might be found.
Put your total operation
under one roof.
Right now, if you’ve pieces of your
company scattered all over town, it’s
probably wasteful in money, time,
efficiency, and ease of communi-
cation. Putting them all under one
roof has obvious advantages, and will
give you a new integrated image.
'Your building - designed
for your efficiency.
Hookers experts in industrial and
commercial design will plan not just
for your immediate needs but also
for your future expansion.
Hooker service is efficiency plus,
generally by direct tender, or
construction management - a cost
saving method - the benefits of

A Champion of the Language
The Essays, Articles and Reviews of
Evelyn Waugh. Edited by Donat Gal-
lagher. 662 pages. Little, Brown. $4O.
Here’s the young Evelyn Waugh review-
ing a novel in 1930: “A few days ago I came
upon an illuminating paragraph in a Sun-
day newspaper. It was in the column where
a lady of fashion dispenses advice to those
who consult her about their private con-
cerns. A correspondent wrote, ‘. . . I am not
outstandingly brilliant at anything. I can’t
leave home as my mother is delicate, but I
want to do something to earn not less than
£3 a week. I’ve tried chicken farming and it
doesn’t pay.’ The answer was, ‘You might
get a job as a reader to a publisher. . .that or
book reviewing.’
“That explains everything about our lit-
erary critics; they are young ladies, not
outstandingly brilliant at anything, who
have failed to make a success
with poultry. It explains, too,
the tepid and negligent recep-
tion accorded to Mr Henry
Green’s Living. ” Can you
imagine a more enticing open-
ing for a book review? I cannot.
That’s why I begin a review of
Waugh’s collected journalism
with this masterly sample.
Sunbathing: The wit, tart-
ness and alacrity of these pieces
are not unexpected, but their
sheer quantity is: Donat Gal-
lagher, Waugh’s editor, repub-
lishes 237 of them, written over
a 48-year period, and lists an
additional 393 “not printed in
this volume.” During his impe-
cunious 20s (his first novel,
“Decline and Fall,” having
sold fewer than 2,000 copies)
Waugh wrote cheeky features
on such topics as sunbathing,
“Was Oxford Worth While?” and “My Fa-
vourite Film Star” (he named two, Elsa
Lanchester and Anna May Wong). Some
have surprisingly kept their freshness. In
the 1930 s he became a traveler, first as a
correspondent covering Haile Selassie’s
coronation, then on an arctic expedition
whose leader commended Waugh’s “admi-
rable endurance and unshakable pessi-
mism.” “Fiasco in the Arctic” (1935) is one
of his least known and most eloquent
dispatches.
In middle age Waugh perfected the pub-
lic persona he ascribed to Gilbert Pinfold
in the best of his later novels: “He offered
the world a front of pomposity mitigated
by indiscretion that was as hard, bright
and antiquated as a cuirass.” He had begun
polishing it much earlier, writing at 27,
“There is an unhappy man in Paris called
M. Cocteau whose whole life is oc-
cupied in trying to be modern.” He is
merciless toward what he finds shoddy—
Stephen Spender’s autobiography, for in-
stance, or postwar English manners: “It is
time we awoke to the danger of finding
ourselves a people of slatterns and louts.”
But he is generous to work we might not
expect him to like: Orwell’s essays and
Hemingway’s “Across the River and into
the Trees.” One of his most intelligent
appreciations is of the Oliviers in Peter
Brook’s famous 1955 production of “Titus
Andronicus.”
Vocation: Gallagher, who has ably anno-
tated this collection, cites Waugh’s sense of
vocation as the most personal element in his
Catholicism. Nothing is more touching
than the way Waugh consistently spoke of
“learning” English even after he had be-
come one of its most accomplished practi-
MARK GERSON
Waugh: Seeking lucidity, elegance and individuality
tioners. “English is incomparably the rich-
est of languages, dead or living,” he wrote in
1955. “One can devote one’s life to learning
it and die without achieving mastery.” He
enumerated and precisely defined the quali-
ties he sought: lucidity, elegance, individ-
uality. “Permanence is the result of the
foregoing. Style is what makes a work mem-
orable and unmistakable. We remember the
falsejudgments of Voltaire and Gibbon and
Lytton Strachey long after they have been
corrected, because of their sharp, polished
form and because of the sensual pleasure of
dwelling on them. They come to one, not
merely as printed words, but as a lively
experience, with the full force of another
human being personally encountered.” One
can open this hefty volume of occasional
writing almost anywhere and feel the force
of that kind of encounter.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Power From the Sun: How Close Are We?
Every day, the sun sends enough energy streaming to earth
to power all the factories, homes and appliances on the
planet. The technological challenge has been to capture all that
solar energy, to store it until it is needed and—most difficult of
all —to do so economically in products suited to everyday use.
The most significant innovations involve photovoltaic cells,
the heart of any solar-powered electrical system. So-called
amorphous cells have often proved to be more cost-effective
than traditional silicon cells at converting sun and other light
rays into electricity. Equally important, the light weight and
flexibility of amorphous cells allow manufacturers to produce
increasingly sophisticated solar-powered devices. Researchers
are aware, however, that it may be years before these systems
can produce energy economically. Therefore, they are also
working to increase the efficiency of products with heavy power
needs, such as heating and cooling systems, to make them more
compatible with low-power solar-energy sources.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to wider use of solar technology
at the moment is lower oil prices. The oil shocks of the last
decade first thrust solar power into the public’s consciousness
and led to many of the early improvements in the technology.
Now, lower oil prices have tended to dim the enthusiasm in the
search for practical applications of solar energy. Still, compa-
nies around the world have a number of projects in the works.
Improved Photovoltaics
Scientists discovered 30 years ago that
silicon, the second most-common ele-
ment on earth —after oxygen—gives off
an electrical charge when exposed to the
sun’s rays. But the cost of refining silicon
and turning it into small, so-called single-
crystal cells was prohibitive. Over time
the cost of the cells dropped and their
productivity increased, but commercial
viability still remained elusive. Recently,
however, researchers have been making
progress on a newer technology that may
offer greater promise.
Amorphous cells consist of a film of
silicon as thin as one micron laid on a
flexible substrate of glass, metal or plas-
tic. Production of such cells is cheap for
two reasons: they use as little as 1/600th
the silicon used in the single-crystal vari-
ety and the atoms are structured random-
ly rather than ordered as they are in the
crystals. As a result, the silicon film can
be applied to the substrate in continuous
rolls, making the manufacturing process
almost as simple as putting ink to paper
on a printing press.
To increase the efficiency of amor-
phous cells, researchers are attempting to
put down several layers of silicon, each
sensitive to a different part of the solar
radiation spectrum. Such “multi-junc-
tion” cells are still in the early stages of
development, but could well prove to be
more powerful than either single-crystal
cells or amorphous cells.
Putting Cells to Good Use
Until recently, the poor conversion
efficiency of amorphous cells limited
their use to low-power items such as
calculators and watches. But with inf-
provements in the technology, other
products will be able to make use of
amorphous cells. Though they are still
relatively few in number, they give a
hint of the wide range of products under
development in the United States and
Japan, including household appliances
that will be able to draw and store ener-
gy from interior lights in order to sup-
plement conventional electrical power.
Japan’s Sanyo Electric Co., a leader in
solar research, recently introduced a
solar-powered portable ra-
dio that is barely the size of
a credit card and only half
an inch thick. On the out-
side of the clip designed to
hold it in a shirt or coat
pocket is a 1-by-1.3-inch
amorphous solar cell. Just
four hours in the sun
charges a small battery
inside the radio, which
can then provide 26 hours
of listening. The main
drawback to the Sanyo
RP-AMTI is that it uses
an earplug rather than
a speaker, which would
draw down the power. The
radio sells for $25.
Another Sanyo solar
product is a battery charg-
er that also makes use
of amorphous cells. The
Amorton Cadnica Charg-
er can recharge up to four pen-
light batteries at a time. In nor-
mal sunlight, it takes about four
hours to recharge two of the bat-
teries; a light-emitting diode sig-
nals when the charge is complete.
The device also has 3- and 6-volt output
terminals that could connect it to small
appliances such as cassette players for use
as a direct power source. Just over 5
inches square and 1 inch thick, the 9.2-
ounce unit sells for $4O.
Changing Temperatures
Sanyo radio:
What’s next?
Solar power’s greatest potential lies in
providing the energy to heat and cool
homes and businesses, and this poten-
tially lucrative market continues to at-
tract attention. United
Technologies Corp. re-
cently patented a solar-
powered system that pro-
vides 100 percent of the
heating and 80 percent
of the cooling needs of
a 7,000-square-foot office
building in Phoenix, Ariz.
The heat pump that is the
heart of the system is
smaller than most com-
mercial models and uses
a turbine-powered com-
pressor to convert heat to
usable energy more effec-
tively. A solar panel con-
centrates the sun’s rays
onto pipes filled with wa-
ter. The hot water is then
either used to heat the
building directly or is con-
verted by the heat pump
into energy to run the
cooling system or into
electricity.
Using a different ap-
proach, researchers at the
University of California have de-
veloped an air-conditioning sys-
tem that they say is 80 percent
more efficient than conventional
models and is ideally suited to
solar power. The research team
found a way to maintain a high tempera-
ture needed to vaporize the refrigerant
fluid inside the unit and vary the pres-
sure in the boiler.

Lakes, rivers and waterways are far from being immortal.
Nature cannot always survive the presence of man. And the
uncontrolled or accidental depositing of refuse is
threatening our lakes and rivers.
Surface water is more precious to Australia than most
countries. Evaporation is high, lakes are generally shallow
and rivers run inconsistently.
Limno gives “the kiss of life” to acidified lakes by
drawing into the system polluted or “dead” water, which has
low oxygen content.
The water is then oxygenated by intense contact with
compressed air and forced out. Treatment by Limno can
take six months minimum, to as much as five years for
severe cases.
The Limno principle is ingeniously simple, yet the

Clouds of war hover
over South Pacific Forum
With the twin spectres of civil war and international terrorism sitting in, the latest
meeting of regional heads of government took place even in sunny Tuvalu in a
completely different atmosphere to the first, 13 years ago. STUART INDER reports.
A DELEGATE at the South
Pacific Forum in Tuvalu last
week predicted that the 14-
member body had no better
hope of heading off civil war
in New Caledonia than the
League of Nations had of pre-
venting World War 11. “Like
the league, the forum has
done too little, too late,” he
said.
Most at that meeting of Pa-
cific heads of government
held in sight of a brilliant, tur-
quoise coral lagoon did not
share his opinion on an inevi-
tability of war in the Pacific or
agree that the forum should be
compared to the unmourned
predecessor of the United
Nations. The forum was not
established as a peacekeeping
body.
Yet, not before in the for-
um’s 13-year life has there
been such general recognition
among its members that the
South Pacific faces in New
Caledonia not only another
diplomatic exercise but also
the possibility of an imminent
outbreak of violence that,
once begun, could be as drawn-out and
as bitter as the violence of former
French colony Algeria.
And they went as close as they could
do to saying so^
Other reports that the forum mem-
bers received from each other also
helped underline that today’s Pacific is
not the one they discussed at their first
meeting, in Wellington, New Zealand,
in 1971.
They were pressed for action in sup-
port of the Solomon Islands which had
arrested an American tuna boat at gun-
point, fined the captain and owners and
confiscated the vessel and gone into
serious dispute with the United States
government.
They heard from Papua New Guinea
Prime Minister Bob Hawke: dressed in style for summit meeting
Prime Minister Michael Somare how
Irian Jaya rebels active along the PNG
border (the only land border in the
South Pacific) had caused problems be-
tween the PNG and Indonesian govern-
ments.
And they were warned by Kiribati
and Nauru of pressures building quick-
ly from outside the region which soon
could overwhelm the Pacific’s fight to
prevent its waters being polluted by
other people’s dumped atomic wastes.
Problems in the early days involved
such matters as the possibilities of get-
ting handicrafts into Australia at
cheaper rates and better inter-island
shipping.
The issues of 1984 were obviously
more complicated and the solutions
more difficult because, more
and more frequently, the
priorities of the small island
states are being set against the
priorities of the bigger powers
with considerably more
muscle.
New Caledonia was the
major political concern at
Tuvalu.
France’s Mitterrand gov-
ernment has been moving to
decolonise the territory, with
a referendum for self-determi-
nation planned for 1989. That
date is too far off for the
Melanesians (or Kanaks) and,
in any case, they have little
hope that the referendum re-
sult would give them control
of their destiny.
Vanuatu Prime Minister
Father Walter Lini told his
forum colleagues that the
Kanak Independence Front
would boycott elections for
the New Caledonia territorial
assembly, not participate in
any French institutions and
had undertaken to set up a
provisional government of its
own.
Although the French government
was genuine in trying to find a statute
which it felt would serve the interests of
all the communities in multi-racial New
Caledonia, it found itself in a dilemma.
Lini stressed an imminent danger of
violence, of “development of a scenario
ideal for intervention by (unfriendly)
foreign powers” and, thus, creation of
regional instability.
“If I have painted a dark picture, I’m
afraid that is my assessment as one who
lives next-door,” said Lini who won his
fight against Paris in 1980 and vowed
publicly then that he would help his
New Caledonian friends to win theirs.
For the forum to do nothing, he
added, would be irresponsible because
the Independence Front “would be


frustrated and would look elsewhere for
support and assistance in its struggle.”
In the discussion of what best could
be done over New Caledonia, the for-
um’s in-built conservatism (conserva-
tism which is the basis of Pacific-style
consensus) was on display again.
The best course to follow was seen as
keeping Paris and the Kanaks talking,
in the hope of finding a peaceful way
round the impasse. Polarisation would
mean the end of hope.
The forum put aside for the time be-
ing but did not rule out Lini’s firm pro-
posal to have New Caledonia put back
on the United Nations’ list of non-self-
governing territories, to ensure keeping
on France the pressure to decolonise.
Paris would oppose such a move
strenuously.
The forum also advised France that
the process of decolonisation would be
advanced by a public statement from its
government that independence was “the
desirable, logical and acknowledged
outcome” of the act of self-determina-
tion planned for 1989 and that that date
should be brought forward.
The forum proposed, too, that
France transfer additional political and
administrative powers to New Cal-
edonia to help Melanesian advance-
ment.
In the international sphere, the for-
um agreed that members were free on
their own initiative to approach the UN
on the New Caledonian question and
that five forum country ministers should
form a group to liaise with the French
government and the Independence
Front about the forum’s views.
Vanuatu might itself seek to re-in-
script New Caledonia on the United
Nations list.
The problem for both the Kanaks
and the forum is that all such initiatives
have yet to bear fruit and that the Inde-
pendence Front will refuse to wait to
put its alternative plans into action. One
possibility for delay is a Paris postpone-
ment of elections until next year, to give
the crisis time to unravel.
Meanwhile, the Independence Front
is bitter at what it sees as the forum’s
failure to support it, and particularly at
Australia’s part in it, and is already
stepping up its efforts to win support in
the United Nations from any country -
in any power bloc willing to give it.
These efforts have been going on for
some time.
An approach to Libya in August (a
member of the Tripoli delegation, Yann
Uregei, was in Tuvalu while the forum
deliberated) failed to gain either prom-
ises or money from Gaddafi’s people.
Political support and money are
what the Independence Front is
seeking, but there is no doubt that, in
some Kanak quarters, clandestine arms
would also be welcome. □

Lange unleashes
Treasury’s sad tale
of Muldoon years
David Lange: facing a grave economic crisis
JOHN SELKIRK
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALANDERS have just ab-
sorbed another massive dose of bad
news about the state of their country’s
economy. Prime Minister David Lange,
as he promised during the election cam-
paign, has displayed the reports and
analysis he received from Treasury and
the Reserve Bank soon after he took
office in July. Those reports present a
dismal tale. According to Treasury:
“The New Zealand economy continues
to display one of the most lacklustre
performances among countries in the
developed world.” That’s the opening
sentence of a 320-page self-flagellating
document.
Lange says unequivocally that this is
the gravest economic crisis New Zea-
land has ever faced. Some might say the
Great Depression was more severe. Yet
if the Treasury diagnosis is correct, New
Zealand is in a kind of permanent re-
cession and unless fundamental
changes are made now it may never
break out of it. Over the 10 years to
1983, New Zealand’s economic growth
rate was less than half the average for all
member countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation
and Development. This poor
performance occurred despite
a dramatic increase in exter-
nal borrowing and it reflected
an unwillingness to adjust to
changing external conditions.
Treasury sees as a failure
of economic management
the concentration by the
Muldoon government on re-
ducing inflation, at the cost of
other objectives.
Treasury is strongly critical
of the heavy reliance by the
Muldoon administration of
government intervention in
the economy. “It is clear that
many of these interventions
are not achieving their objec-
tives and are frustrating their
achievement of higher living
standards. Why has this oc-
curred? The account of recent
history illustrates how the
government has responded to
the consequences of un-
balanced policies by increas-
ing reliance on interventions
designed to suppress the
symptoms rather than address
the underlying causes of the
malaise.”
Given the Treasury diagnosis, it is
not surprising that some drastic econ-
omic medicine is prescribed. More
taxes, less government spending, reduc-
tion in real wages, the sale of state enter-
prises are recommended to cut the fiscal
deficit.
It is the kind of harsh economic
regime that any government might shy
away from. Yet the Lange Government
has accepted much of the advice it has
so far received from Treasury. Finance
Minister Roger Douglas has left no
doubt that he wants to break down the
walls of protection that have surround-
ed New Zealand industry.
Opposition Leader Muldoon dubbed
the exercise of opening the books as no
more than party propaganda and ac-
cused Lange of indulging in his “habit-
ual hyprocisy.”
Muldoon’s cynicism was fuelled by
publication of a memorandum written
by Labor Party publicity director Simon
Walker for Lange before the election.
Setting out a post-election strategy,
Walker said Labor Party ministers
should be projected as being genuinely
shocked by the “deceit” of the Muldoon
administration.
Walker cited the example of the
Hawke Government in successfully ty-
ing that country’s economic problems to
the defeated Fraser government. A simi-
lar “climate of realism” should be
created in New Zealand, with the open-
ing-the-books exercise incorporating
departmental reports and forecasts


showing that spending restraint is essen-
tial.
Even if that leaked memo did not
undermine Treasury’s indictment of
previous economic management, there
was still the unanswered question about
the quality of economic advice given by
government officials over the past dec-
ade. Economists are sceptical that the
failure to supply the appropriate econ-
omic management could be solely pol-
itical.
Lange’s problem is that if he pushed
through the reforms which Treasury ad-
vocates, he would risk a sharp rise in
unemployment as the belt-tightening
measures began to bite. A harsh budget
could choke off the recovery that has
been under way during the past few
months. Reserve Bank projections show
that the economy is growing at a rate in
the range of 3 to 4 percent after similar
growth in the year ending March 31
the most sustained growth for 10 years.
The trick for Lange and his government
is to achieve the fundamental structural
changes which Treasury urges without
knocking the economy off the growth
path. The government is looking to the
planned economic summit to help
achieve this.
Labor’s perception is that New Zea-
land’s poor economic performance is as
much due to the internecine warfare of
powerful interest groups. Lange seeks to
reconcile the conflicting lobbies and
persuade them that painful adjustments
must be made. If he can get that consent
then Labor may be able to introduce the
kind of policies that its predecessor
should have introduced but did not dare
to because of the feared public back-
lash. Even though Muldoon succeeded
largely in protecting living standards
during the eight and a half years he
governed, that was still not good
enough.
Lange knows that the same fate
awaits him if he can do no more. That is
why he is going for broke and intends to
shake New Zealand out of its economic
stagnation. □
SINGAPORE
New press
rationalisation
puzzles, upsets
By NIGEL LILBURN
BITTER REACTION has met the an-
nouncement that Singapore’s press is to
endure its second restructuring within
two years.
The latest move to merge the long-
established morning daily Straits Times
with afternoon tabloid rival the Singa-
pore Monitor appears to throw into
reverse the rationale for the first re-
vamp. Only after that was announced
from the office of Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew, in 1982, was the Monitor
born. The stated intention was that
competition for the Times would prod-
uce a better quality and more vigorous
press.
Each newspaper developed am-
bitious plans. The Times set out to prod-
uce an evening competitor for the Moni-
tor which, in turn, was planning a morn-
ing rival for the Times.
Sceptics questioned whether the re-
public’s population of 2.5 million, not
all of whom can read English, could
sustain four English-language news-
papers.
After doing their sums, the news-
paper houses agreed that the inevitable
circulation war would cost them up to
$16.5 million a year plus about $27.5
million in duplicated plant and ma-
chinery.
Wasteful competition was one of the
main reasons given for the two news-
paper houses needing to merge in what
will become Singapore’s largest indus-
trial company, worth more than $770
million on the stock market.
While executives in the Times organ-
isation were saying that the merger
made good business sense, the common
thought was that the government must
be behind it. Exactly why was not clear.
Culture Minister S. Dhanabalan,
who controls licences for all Singa-
pore’s publications, was reported as
saying that competition alone did not
ensure quality newspapers. The com-
ment came as another apparent reversal
of the 1982 philosophy.
Foremost, he said, a newspaper com-
pany needed to be financially sound.
One member of parliament, mean-
while, said the changes would end up
making Singapore’s newspapers look
like the Soviet Pravda or People’s Daily
of China.
The merger and the accusations
came only a few months before Lee is
expected to call a general election.
Ironically, his People’s Action Party
(PAP) is thinking about allowing an op-
position into parliament even if election
candidates do not receive sufficient
votes to become proper MPs. The idea
is that the opposition would produce the
verbal sparring necessary to keep fit
PAP members who occupy all but one
of the seats in parliament. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The Asian connection
is moving quickly
Since Malaysia’s Lee Ming Tee arrived in Sydney, the business community has
been beating a path to his door. MICHAEL MEAGHER outlines the career of
the mercurial entrepreneur who is building a new commercial empire.
THE LIFTS to the 19th floor of the Na-
tional Mutual building at 44 Market
Street in Sydney have been running hot.
The executives using them have been
heading for the office of the fastest-mov-
ing entrepreneur in town, Lee Ming
Tee.
Lee is the managing director of
Enacon Ltd and architect of a new di-
versified manufacturing, high technol-
ogy and financial services empire being
pieced together under an expansionary
vehicle over which he also presides:
Sunshine Australia Ltd.
Lee, a Malaysian businessman who
decided on a shift of address from
Kuala Lumpur to Sydney late last year,
has been besieged by merchant bankers
and stockbrokers since he took a pos-
ition in car-parking and engineering
group Enacon in May.
As shown in the tables The Bulletin
has prepared, Lee has established a web
of companies in a short time. The hold-
ing company is Sunshine Australia for
whom life until late last year involved
manufacturing flags, bunting and other
advertising materials, blinds and com-
mercial and industrial fans, among
other things.
Sunshine attracted computer services
group Idaps Australia Ltd which built a
stake of just under 90 percent in the
company up to April this year. Lee then
made his entry. With Sunshine share-
holder approval, he acquired a 60 per-
cent controlling interest in the com-
pany’s 5.6 million ordinary shares.
Idaps bought the assets and liabilities of
the company for $4.6 million and Lee
was left with his starting point a $4.6
million cash shell.
Each ordinary share had a cash
backing of 80 cents. A recent placement
of 4.4 million shares at 85 cents has
reduced Lee’s Sunshine stake (through
his associated private company Tymora
Pty Ltd) to 33.5 percent. Those lucky
enough to get some of the placed shares
which raised $3.8 million for the com-
pany now see their shares at $1.35.
Sunshine’s chief investments to date
include:
ROBERT DORAN
Lee Ming Tee - and an Enacon car-park in Kent Street, Sydney
■ The 19.95 percent interest in
Enacon at a cost of $2.6 million.
Enacon’s chief assets are leases on car
parks at the domestic and international
air terminals.
■ A 15.75 percent stake in the small
merchant bank Heathley Ltd for
$224,000. Lee also has a personal stake
of around 5 percent in the bank.
■ The $8.4 million purchase of
Hastings Deering (NSW) Pty Ltd, which
gives Lee control of the Hastings
Deering group. (The Hastings Deering
purchase was through a special vehicle,
Gratecept Pty Ltd, owned 47 percent by
Enacon, 47 percent by Sunshine and 6
percent by Lee through Tymora. The
cost to both Enacon and Sunshine was
$3.95 million.)
Hastings Deering, as shown in the
present structure table, is a complex or-
ganisation with voting and non-voting
shares. Although Hastings Deering
(NSW) has shareholders’ funds of only
$489,000, it controls a group of compan-
ies the largest of which is Hastings
Diesels Ltd which had shareholders
funds of $50.6 million on August 31 last
year.
Hastings Diesels is the Caterpillar
franchisee for Queensland, the North-
ern Territory, Papua New Guinea and
the Solomon Islands. On the bottom of
the ladder is Hastings Deering Finance
and Investment Co Ltd, a publicly-listed
company now owned 30 percent by
Gratecept.
Lee also has engineered a 28.6 per-
cent interest in NSW civil engineering
contractors Abignano Ltd by exchang-
ing all of Enacon’s assets (bar the car-
parking lots and other selected invest-
ments) for three million Abignano
shares and $2.4 million cash. One asset


Lee did not shed in the $7.3 million
swap was 2 million second preference
shares in Rover Holdings Ltd which con-
vert to a 17 percent interest in Rover’s
high technology arm, Apptech Ltd,
specialising in mechanical engineering
contracting in air pollution control and
paint finishing technology, including
the Vapocure technology.
Lee’s ultimate objective is to set up
an organisation that can couple the
stability, financial expertise and tech-
nology of Australia with the drive and
entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese in
Asia.
Lee has strong contacts in Asian
banking and finance circles. He was
born in Kuala Lumpur but educated in
Australia, matriculating from Sydney
Technical College and graduating from
Sydney University with an honors de-
gree in mechanical engineering. After
spending time with Shell and ICI in
Malaysia, he became chief executive of
the Chinese property, commodities and
manufacturing conglomerate Lee Yan
Lan.
Lee opted for a change of jobs in
1977, buying into three Singapore pub-
licly-listed companies as diverse as a
palm oil plantation and refinery and a
metal extruder and fabricator. All com-
panies were “very sick.”
After a doctoring operation Lee sold
them off in 1981, together with a Hong
Kong property company. The sale
brought him more than $5O million.
With other Asian investments thrown
in, he is believed to have a net worth ap-
proaching $lOO million.
Lee says that the building of his Aus-
tralian empire has been largely an acci-
dent: He retired, intent on an academic
career, after the liquidation of the Sin-
gapore and Hong Kong companies. For
two and a half years of “interim retire-
ment,” he ski-ed throughout the world,
climbed the Andes and bought an art
gallery in Taiwan “just for fun.”
The decision last year to move to
Australia with his wife and three chil-
dren was made for the children’s
schooling. Soon after his arrival, Lee
found that Enacon in which one of
his Singapore companies, Sigma
Metals, had been a minor shareholder
was under threat of takeover by Syd
Fischer’s ADC Ltd. After 18 years of
profitable operations, Enacon lost $5
million in 1982-83 and losses have con-
tinued.
In the role of the white knight, Lee
bought more than 15 percent of Enacon
taking out ADC’s holding and, with
institutional support, accounting for
more than 50 percent of Enacon’s capi-
tal. This shut the gate to another suitor,
Abignano Ltd.
Lee said: “Before I knew it, I was in
the competitive scene again. With this
sort of thing, you either do it or you
don’t there is no half-baked busi-
ness.” He is now managing director of
the company and has enlisted the ser-
vices of a close colleague, Tan Pee Cee,
the chairman of the Industrial Commer-
cial Bank of Singapore, as chairman of
Enacon.
Lee sees great potential for the mar-
keting of Australian brainpower in Asia
particularly in mainland China, as it
becomes involved in commercial ven-
tures.
He enthuses about a project in which
an Australian firm, Printronics Pty Ltd,
is involved in a turnkey project in
China. Printronics, a division of
Abignano Ltd, will provide the technol-
ogy for printed circuit board plants.
Lee says he has talked to other Aus-
tralian manufacturers about participat-
ing in similar ventures in China.
Lee’s proposed structure for Sun-
shine which, given the speed at which
he moves, is liable to change will see
Enacon established as an owner-oper-
ator of car-parks, a property developer
and a manager of the stakes in Apptech
and Abignano.
On the property development side,
Enacon is involved in an $8 million
commercial property development at
Chatswood in Sydney and has another
planned for Epping in Sydney.
The other vital arm of the new Sun-
shine will be a financing and merchant
bank service which will be provided by
Hastings Deering Finance and Invest-
ment. Eventually, Sunshine would like


to take a direct interest in the financier
which would incorporate Heathley Ltd,
the merchant bank.
Hastings Deering F&I is looking to
double its issued capital to 10 million
shares through a 1-for-l rights issue at
$l, raising $5 million. Also on the finan-
cial side, Lee wants Sunshine to take a
direct shareholding in a Hong Kong se-
curities and commodities trading com-
pany through 100-percent subsidiary
Euon Holdings Co.
The other important arm will be
Timps Enterprises, the link that will
make exercises such as Printronics’
possible.
Timps is the “Asian connection” and
may work for Australians venturing
overseas or Asians wishing to do busi-
ness in Australia.
Sunshine’s income from such opera-
tions will be derived mainly through
fees.
A further Sunshine subsidiary is like-
ly to be Engineering Computer Sales,
with operations in Australia and Singa-
pore.
ECS is a company launched in 1979
by machine tool benders John Hart Pty
Ltd, a private company. The company’s
product is computer-aided drafting
technology, involving the supply of
computer hardware and software to ar-
chitects and engineers. □
THE PUBLIC SERVICE
Shake-up planned
for Super Fund
Investment Trust
By ANTHONY HILL
A MAJOR restructuring of the federal
government’s troubled Superannuation
Fund Investment Trust has been recom-
mended by a joint working party in a
report to Finance minister John
Dawkins.
The report, due to be tabled in par-
liament, is the latest in a series of moves
to overcome what have been described
as rifts, disarray and management
breakdown in the trust. It also looked at
the trust’s objectives, investment
strategies, accounting policies and re-
porting procedures.
Key recommendations include;
■ Expanding the trust from three
members to five, including two con-
tributor members to be nominated by
the public service unions;
■ The full-time chairman to have
public service permanent head powers,
and a new statutory position of chief
executive officer whose appointment
can be terminated by the vote of at least
three other trust members.
■ A government statement giving the
trust power to conduct its affairs with
“ample flexibility” and avoiding “re-
straints that inhibit rapid response and
adaptation to market conditions.”
■ The trust to have a general borrow-
ing power of up to 10 percent of the
total assets of the fund.
■ Unrestricted power to invest
money, provided the 30/20 rule is
observed (under which 30 percent of
funds have to be invested in govern-
ment securities, of which 20 percent
must be commonwealth);
■ While it is expected that the trust
will try to accommodate “the letter and
spirit of any publicly stated government
policy,” the government should recog-
nise “circumstances can arise where it
may not be possible to observe in full all
elements of relevant public policy.”
The last point is seen as a response to
criticism by two official reports that the
trust was involved in schemes that had
the effect of giving tax minimisation or
avoidance benefits to partners es-
pecially the multi-million-dollar Gros-
venor Place project in Sydney.
The working party was unable to
agree on some recommendations, no-
tably the location of the trust offices (the

members favored Sydney or Mel-
bourne), some accounting proposals
and whether trust staff should be em-
ployed under the Public Service Act.
Dawkins has said that he will not
bring down a comprehensive plan onthe
trust’s future until “mature judgment
has been exercised” on the several re-
ports commissioned into the trust con-
troversy. He says that the trust’s opera-
tions are proceeding normally and that
there is no substance to suggestions that
funds are at risk.
Acting chairman Bill Smith told The
Bulletin that the earning rate last finan-
cial year was 13 percent up from the
11.78 percent in the seven years to June
1983. He said, “It’s quite good and quite
a big ray of sunshine for us. The chal-
lenge will be to keep that up.”
It is unlikely that Dawkins will wait
for the final report from the Senate
Finance and Government Operations
Committee, before announcing future
arrangements for the trust. The commit-
tee is examining reports by Auditor-
General Keith Brigden who has accused
the trust of “recklessness,” and another
by Brigden’s designated successor John
Monaghan.
But the committee, which has yet to
hear from former trust chairman Bob
Hammond, will not be taking further
evidence until October 12. This has
been widely tipped as the date parlia-
ment will rise for the election campaign.
On this basis, the Senate committee re-
port would not be completed until next
year and Dawkins is not likely to be
prepared to wait that long.
Hammond has stood aside as chair-
man although he will be employed as a
temporary consultant, particularly in
the management of the Grosvenor Place
project. There are now only two active
members of the trust Smith and part-
time member Robert Davey. Their
terms expire on March 31.
Dawkins has cleared Hammond of
any “improper or reckless conduct” in
the operations of the trust and of allega-
tions that he accepted gifts of a gold
watch and a gold coin. Dawkins says
that Hammond followed the correct
procedure with the gifts and paid the
valuations into consolidated revenue.
Nevertheless, both the Brigden and
Monaghan reports pointed to serious
weaknesses in the trust’s internal ad-
ministration.
Monaghan, in particular, spoke of an
escalating rift between the chairman
and the former chief investment man-
ager which led to dissension and fac-
tionalism among the staff.
The working party, chaired by Colin
Orr of the finance department, included
seven ACTU members, representatives
of the Public Service Board, the trust’s
acting chairman and chartered account-
ants Ernst and Whinney. □
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The salvation of Offshore Oil
THE STOCK market well remembers
when Offshore Oil NL almost sank
without trace two years ago after incur-
ring vast cost over-runs in drilling the
West Barrow No lA well off the West-
ern Australian coast.
Two wells scheduled to cost around
$l3 million were planned for the block
west of Barrow Island (WA-64P) and
Offshore retained more than 50 percent
of the action. But Murphy’s Law pre-
vailed and everything that could go
wrong did so. Costs ballooned to $29
million on the first well and the second
was never undertaken. Worse, drilling
tools became stuck in the first well and
it had to be abandoned before testing a
104-metre interval below 3376 metres
where logs indicated the presence of
“moveable liquid hydrocarbons.”
Whether the hydrocarbons indicated
were gas/condensate or oil remains un-
known.
Several of Offshore’s smaller part-
ners in the block failed to meet their
commitments and, at the same time, Off-
shore Oil was stretched in paying for its
drill ship, Energy Searcher, launched in
Hong Kong in September 1982.
To the rescue came Larry Adler’s
FAI Insurance group which injected
more money into Offsore and
underwrote an issue which takes the
FAI equity in Offshore to around 30
percent.
Throughout 1983, Offshore’s finances
were reconstructed, areas were farmed
out and rationalised and a new team
moved in led by former Bridge Oil man-
aging director Bert Harris who joined
Offshore as chief executive and mana-
ging director a year ago.
Last week, Offshore announced the
conclusion of long-running negotia-
tions with BHP to farm-in on WA-64P.
BHP Petroleum Pty Ltd will become op-
erator to drill West Barrow No 2 on the
same structure as the tantalising No 1A
well.
It is hoped the new well may begin in
a month. BHP will earn 41.86 percent in
the block, Offshore will retain 25.9 per-
cent and Diamond Shamrock Oil Co
(Aust) Pty Ltd 16.265 percent. Other
minor Australian participants will re-
duce their equities in favor of BHP,
leaving Charterhall Oil Australia with
3.915 percent, Sovereign Oil (3.012 per-
cent) and the Magnet Metals, Monarch
Petroleum, Stirling Petroleum and
Lennard Oil group each with 1.167 per-
cent. Other participants are either non-
listed or hold less than 1 percent.
With the approach of the drilling
date for West Barrow No 2, market
interest will quicken in Offshore’s
569,655,305 shares, selling at 14c just
above their year’s low of 13c and well
down from the 1984 high of 20c.
At their current price the company
has a market capitalisation of $79 mil-
lion, with around $7 million retained in
liquid assets and a spread of desirable
oil and gas properties and exploration
targets including the Surat LPG project.
During the past year, Offshore has
participated in wide-ranging seismic
survey programs over properties in the
Surat, Eromanga, Bowen, Canning,
Carnarvon and South Pacific Basins
and before the end of 1984 Offshore
should be participating in half-a-dozen
wells apart from the up-coming West
Barrow No 2.
To finance the Offshore purchase, I
took profits on gold prospector Elec-
trum NL and quit my tiny holding
in Epoch Minerals now that it has sold
its most prospective areas on the
Coolgardie goldfield to Cord Holdings.

THE MODEST FARMER
Dreams up in smoke
by Bert Kelly
I THINK Fred must be going through
some queer change of life or something.
I have told how he went to Queensland
recently to buy a sugar farm and how he
returned with his tail between his legs,
without a farm and disillusioned about
the myth that Sir Joh’s government is
the last bastion against socialism. Fred’s
latest craze is to buy a tobacco farm. He
has found out that the average tobacco
farmer gets an annual subsidy from the
government of about $25,000 and he
wants to get his trotters into that trough.
How he blundered across this infor-
mation I do not know. It is true that I
wrote about tobacco in my book Econ-
omics Made Easy but I didn’t think that
Fred would ever bother to read it; at
least, that is the impression he has al-
ways given me.
I thought I would throw cold water
on the idea by telling him that a lot of
the tobacco was grown in Queensland
and he is sad about Queensland at the
moment. But he knew that there was a
lot of tobacco grown near Myrtleford,
in Victoria. This is where we went.
We took Eccles with us this time.
Fred agreed to this because he knew
that there were a lot of hidden lurks in
tobacco that are hard to dig out. Usually
I dislike travelling with Fred and Eccles
together; they niggle at each other a lot
and this makes life rather a strain. And
if they are not doing this, they are com-
bining to keep me in my place. “You are
having too much to say, Bert,” one of
them says. “You seem to think you are
back in parliament. You keep quiet and
you might learn something.”
So the three of us headed for
Myrtleford: Eccles with his briefcase
full of reports, Fred full of the hope of
getting his sticky fingers on this $25,000
subsidy money and I with my head full
of foreboding. It is a lovely area, one
that you would think could grow almost
anything. Still, if the government were
paying you $4OOO a hectare to grow
tobacco, I suppose there would be little
temptation to grow something else.
When we got there, Fred went into a
land agent’s office to see about buying a
tobacco farm but he soon came out
again with a long face to tell us that, as
with sugar, you have to have a quota
before you can start. They do not insist
your being of superior morality, as they
do in Queensland; in Victoria all they
want is your money.
It seems that the market price for a
tobacco quota is about $4 for the right
to supply a kilogram of leaf and, as the
average production a farm is about
14,000 kg, this makes the average quota
worth $56,000. This is before you buy
the land.
Fred felt even worse when Eccles
told him that one of the reasons why the
US refused to remove its damaging du-
ties against our wool about which we
complain so often and so rightly is
because of the barriers we place against
the importation of their tobacco. I know
that Eccles is right about this because I
have heard an official of the US em-
bassy say so on a TV program.
I know that some people think that
Eccles and I are hard men, devoid of the
milk of human kindness. Eccles indeed
is like this but I have a nicer side to my
nature, deeply hidden though it may be.
To demonstrate this, I am launching a
campaign to persuade the government
to pay each tobacco farmer $2OOO a hec-
tare not to grow tobacco.
According to Eccles’ figuring, this
would make the Treasurer happy be-
cause now he has to pay out in various
devious ways about $4OOO for each hec-
tare of tobacco and, as there are about
6600 hectares of tobacco, it must be
costing him more than $l3 million a
year. I know it is hard to make
treasurers happy and that is why they
nearly all have long faces but surely
saving half of this $l3 million would
make them smile.
Certainly my idea would make the
growers happy. Just fancy being paid
$2OOO for not growing a hectare of
tobacco. You could sit in the shade and
scratch yourself or use the land to grow
something else. So the tobacco growers
would love the government and gov-
ernments love being loved.
The woolgrowers would love the
government, too, if this action induced
the US to remove its duties against our
wool. We are always moaning about the
wicked way other countries, particularly
those in the EEC, place barriers in the
way of our exports and we wonder why
no one takes much notice of us. Here is
a chance to demonstrate our sincerity.
If my scheme were adopted, there
would be about 1000 tobacco growers,
90,000 woolgrowers and all the tax-
payers on the same side for once, all
determined to love the government. So
it should not be hard to get my idea
adopted.
They really ought to make me an am-
bassador or something. I understand
that the post in Outer Mongolia is still
vacant. □

WILDCAT
The growing Fraser-Hawke mortgage on tomorrow
THERE’S A price of $5OOO on the heads
of every man, woman and child in Aus-
tralia as a result of successive govern-
ments mortaging tomorrow by borrow-
ing more money than they collect in
revenue.
That figure is the share of public debt
hanging over the head of every person
in Australia a fact underlined by
economist Ray Block in the latest week-
ly newsletter from investment bankers
Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu Ltd.
Total public debt to June 1984 stood
at $76 million an astounding rise of
55 percent over two years earlier.
The cost of servicing this mountain
of debt means that for every $lOO the
public sector borrows, $67 is required to
do no more than meet the interest bill.
(Last year, it was $47.)
Public sector debt is made up of the
borrowings of the commonwealth gov-
ernment, state and local authorities. To
put the cost of those total borrowings
into perspective, the interest bill (es-
timated at $9.65 billion) this year will
amount to more than twice what the
Commonwealth is to spend on educa-
tion ($4.5 billion) or equal more than
half the $lB billion vote for social se-
curity and welfare.
Block makes no understatement
when he observes that the public sector
debt is becoming a major fiscal burden,
not only at the commonwealth budget
level but also in terms of the public sec-
tor as a whole.
Within the commonwealth budget,
the expected 29.4 percent increase in
public debt interest will be 2.3 times the
rate of increase in outlays as a whole (13
percent). The size of the interest bill
($5.6 billion in 1984-85) will absorb 15.4
percent of forecast income tax receipts
or 9.8 percent of forecast total budget
receipts.
But, as large as the commonwealth
interest bill is, it still represents only 58
percent of the total cost of public sector
interest.
Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu’s
concern over the public debt echoes the
words of retiring Treasury Secretary
John Stone who astounded his audience
at the Shann Memorial Lecture at the
University of Western Australia last
week with a withering attack on govern-
ment policies of the past decade. Stone
said, in part: “Growing public debt
could defer if not fundamentally im-
pair the chances of lasting recovery in
the longer run.”
Improved register
THE ANNUAL Register of Australian
Mining 84/85 is a greatly expanded
book on previous editions. It contains
readily accessible information on more
than 2800 mineral, oil and gas deposits
and companies in Australia. A new and
most useful feature is a comprehensive
alphabetical listing of company direc-
tors in the resources industry— a feature
that will enhance the Register as the pre-
eminent directory in this field.
The directory contains in its 488
pages (up from 376 last year) detailed
chapters on more than 20 commodities
with maps and a resume of all known
deposits.
A new chapter on cobalt has been
introduced and the section on gold has
been expanded to include more than
150 known deposits.
The directory of listed and non-listed
companies has been expanded to in-
clude 80 new entries and charts sup-
plied on many listed companies from
Computer Investor Services will be use-
ful to share traders.
For a book that has gone up nearly a
third in size, the necessary price rise has
been held to a modest 20 percent at $llO
in Australia ($l3O overseas).

solidated Press Ltd, GPO Box 5252,

Land rights flaws
MINING promoter and engineer Ken
McMahon has added his thoughts to the
debate on Aboriginal land rights and
he sees a cause for “very real concern”
for the mining industry.
In a speech to the Building Owners’
and Managers’ Association of Australia
in which he said he was at pains to offer
facts and not emotion, he stated that he
had become “very alarmed.”
He said development of the mining
industry which contributes 40 percent
of Australia’s export income could be
gravely jeopardised by proposals to give
Aborigines ownership and control over
mineral rights on their lands.
The mining industry considered that
ownership and administration of
minerals should stay as they had for

nearly a century with the crown, rep-
resenting all Australians.
McMahon pointed out that Mr
Justice Woodward had recommended
firmly in his land rights inquiry in the
Northern Territory nearly a decade ago
that minerals within Aboriginal lands in
the NT should remain the property of
the government. Not acting on that rec-
ommendation had brought a complete
breakdown in mineral exploration and
development over 45 percent of the Ter-
ritory.
“No title for exploration has been
grated on Aboriginal land since 1972,”
he said. “Although some 165 explora-
tion licences involving some 42 com-
panies have been offered in the Terri-
tory since June 1981, no agreement to
undertake exploration has been com-
pleted.”
Despite initiatives undertaken in
NSW, Victoria, South Australia and
Western Australia toward land rights
legislation, the commonwealth govern-
ment still plans to introduce within a
year its own national Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Heritage Bill, from which
McMahon draws attention to:
■ Retrospectivity which would per-
mit the minister to make a declaration
over existing mining facilities “or for
that matter farms, buildings and tourist
resorts.”
■ The bill not being limited to crown
land, so other land owners could be de-
prived of property without compensa-
tion.
■ No limit to specific significant sites
any area which the minister believes
has particular significance to Aborigi-
nes could be put under restrictions and
conditions.
■ Ordinary citizens engaged in ac-
tivities such as bush-walking or camp-
ing who inadvertently enter Aboriginal
lands may be jailed for up to five years.
■ Compensation payable only on
“acquisition of property” whereas a
declaration imposing restrictions and
conditions may not amount to that. □
THE CHARTIST
Stockmarket a matter for debate
by Russell hander
MANY fund managers admit openly to
being confused as to stockmarket pros-
pects. According to long-term momen-
tum indicators for our leading indexes
and for the Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage, we are going through a strong
rally phase in an overall primary bear
market not scheduled to bottom until
the first half of 1985.
Against this is evidence that, in the
case of each of the previous presidential
elections in the United States the US
stockmarket has been firm up to the poll
only to stall and fall ultimately into a
bear trend. This is borne out by Bill Ed-
wards’ chart published in The Bulletin
four issues back. It should not surprise,
then, if the Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage makes it into new high ground be-
fore the presidential election in
November.
Another factor which looms large in
the minds of fund managers is the
strength of the bond market in the US
and in Australia. Lower inflationary ex-
pectations, it is being argued, will allow
the long-term bond rate in Australia to
fall below 10 percent lowering all
yields and thus lifting share prices. The
bulls are saying, in effect: Don’t listen to
all the doubters; just keep your eyes on
interest rates which are in an inexorable
downtrend.
The accompanying Bridge Data
charts on Santos illustrate the solid rally
in progress for the past six weeks. By no
means, however, do they resolve the
question of whether this stock is in a
new primary uptrend or simply in a
strong rally in a downtrend. The month-
ly chart bears out that in the primary
downtrend of 1981 and 1982 Santos had
a strong rally of even greater intensity to
the current one, only to give up all
ground re-taken and more before touch-
ing bedrock.
The debate on the market outlook
will be given further coverage as fresh
arguments are advanced. For the re-
cord, the writer prefers bull markets be-
cause his friends in the securities indus-
try tend to be better company when
prices are going up. □

PIERPONT
Black law has areas of grey
WHATEVER they were smoking down
at the stock exchange last week, it must
have been pretty powerful.
First, your correspondent received a
telephone call from a very excited mer-
chant banker. “Have you heard the
story?” he gasped, without so much as
“what ho!” to begin with. “Fairfax is up
for sale.”
“Wocker?” queried Pierpont. “He’s
not a bad old chap but I sup-
pose he clashes with some of
Lady Fairfax’s furnishings.”
“No, you ass,” said the
merchant banker. “I mean the
Fairfax company. The story is
that the Fairfax family are
selling out.”
“Good heavens,” said
Pierpont. He had barely hung
up the telephone when it rang
again.
This time it was one of our
nation’s best-known barris-
ters. “Don’t speak,” begged
Pierpont, terrified that he
would be charged a briefing
fee. “It would be cheaper for
me to finance a moon shot.”
“I’m not charging for this
call,” the barrister said. “I’m
just ringing to let you know
the Fairfaxes are selling out.”
The surest way to ruin a
good story, of course, is to
check the facts, which is precisely what
Pierpont did. He rang the chaps at
Fairfax and was told there was absolute-
ly no truth in the rumor.
Your correspondent had no sooner
returned to uncorking the Bollinger
than the telephone rang again. This time
it was a broker with a hot tip that AWA
was proposing to sell station QTQ-9 in
Brisbane. “Alan Bond will be the buy-
er,” the broker said conspiratorially.
“Nobody else knows this.”
The last sentence was right, anyway,
because when Pierpont checked this one
it turned out that the people who did
not know the story included the chaps at
AWA. Actually, the AWA lads are in-
terested in buying further into the elec-
tronic media.
All this frantic and quite purposeless
activity was eating into Pierpont’s aperi-
tif hour. Your correspondent had no
sooner poured himself the morning’s
first bracer when the blasted telephone
went again.
Muttering imprecations at the shade
of Alexander Graham Bell, Pierpont
answered the telephone and found him-
self talking to yet another barrister. This
one was from a leading law firm which
your correspondent had better keep
anonymous, so he will refer to it only as
Dawson Waldron.
This chap had yet another hot tip on
what was happening in the media, Aus-
tralian Consolidated Press (which,
among other things, publishes this liter-
ary journal) was going to sell all its pub-
fishing and television interests. Need-
less to say, this rumor was also quite
unfounded.
As he calmly threw the telephone out
of his study window, Pierpont could not
help reflecting that either it had been a
quiet week in the courts or else they had
been putting something in the air-condi-
tioning down there.
In the hope of giving the legal frater-
nity something to do, therefore,
Pierpont recommends that they might
devote their attention to the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Heritage (In-
terim Protection) Act.
It is a subject Pierpont broaches with
some trepidation because he has written
a little about Aborigines and mining re-
cently and does not wish to be accused
of undue hostility towards our blacks.
However, the legislation has consider-
able importance for our pastoral and
mining industries and thereby justifies
attention.
As an interim Act it is inherently a
stop-gap measure, which may excuse
some sloppiness in its drafting. But in
some back office in Canberra, a perma-
nent Act doubtless is being put together
and this might be a good time to ensure
that it does not contain some of the un-
fortunate features of the interim Act.
Your correspondent’s attention was
drawn to this on reading an address
given by Victorian QC David Bennett to
a meeting of the Commercial Law As-
sociation last month.
Bennett pointed out a number of de-
fects in the Act, the most fun-
damental being Section 4,
which sets out the purposes of
the Act. This says: “The pur-
poses of this Act are the pres-
ervation and protection from
injury or desecration of areas
and objects in Australia and
in Australian waters, being
areas and objects that are of
particular significance to Ab-
originals [sic] in accordance
with Aborigine tradition.”
This provision is important
because it is in an Act in
which a great deal is left to the
discretion of the minister.
Bennett points out that the
stated purpose of the Act is
unequivocal. The minister has
no obligation to balance any
other interests against those of
the Aborigines.
Once the minister is satis-
fied that a significant Aborigi-
nal area or object is under threat of in-
jury or desecration, the minister would
seem to have no choice under the pur-
poses of the Act but to prevent that
injury occurring, regardless of compe-
ting interests.
Another defect referred to by Ben-
nett, which Pierpont had noted already,
is the unsatisfactory definition of Abor-
iginal: “‘A member of the Aboriginal
race of Australia, and includes a de-
scendant of the indigenous inhabitants
of the Torres Strait Islanders.”
Pierpont at first suspected this defini-
tion might have been framed by Miss
Gertrude Stein because it has the same
circular quality as “A rose is a rose is a
rose.” There is no legal definition of “a
member of the Aboriginal race of Aus-
tralia” and Bennett is not even sure
whether there is an anthropological
definition.
The reference to descendants would
include Aborigines as well as Torres
Strait Islanders and does not appear to
be restricted to full-blood descendants.
Anyone claiming descent from an
Aborigine could argue that he or she


was an Aborigine for the purposes of
the Act.
Section 3 of the Act, defining when
an area shall be considered under
threat, makes frequent reference to the
need for the minister to pay attention to
“Aboriginal tradition. ”
Section 3(1) defines Aboriginal tra-
dition as “The body of traditions, ob-
servances, customs and beliefs of Abor-
iginals generally or of a particular com-
munity of Aboriginals, and includes any
such traditions, observances, customs or
beliefs relating to particular persons,
areas, objects or relationships.”
The definition (which manifestly
caused acute problems for some poor,
benighted draftsman) does not require
that the motivating force of the tradition
or belief must have any religious or
mystical basis. Any belief held by any
group of Aborigines would seem
capable of forming part of “Aboriginal
tradition” for the purposes of the Act.
If Collingwood Football Club has
three Aboriginal supporters, they could
claim Victoria Park as a sacred site and
bar Ranald Macdonald from entering.
A tradition does not have to be
something ancient. Traditions are being
formed all the time. From the foregoing,
Pierpont concludes the Act is defective
in defining (a) its aims (b) the persons it
is trying to protect and (c) the grounds
upon which they are to be protected.
If these faults are not tackled, the
vagueness of the drafting and the width
of the legislation’s scope will allow great
potential for mischief. The mining and
pastoral industries will never know
when some outrageous claim will not
only be made but also upheld.
And redrafting the Act will at least
keep our best legal brains out of the
stock market for a few days.
THIS will be the last Pierpont column
for a few weeks. Your correspondent is
heading for Tokyo to buy a few steel
mills. He will return around Caulfield
Cup time. □
CHESS
Immortalising your blunders
by Terrey Shaw
IF YOU ARE one of those people who
feels that chess notation borders on the
occult, you are not alone. Even the nor-
mally rational Australian Department
of Defence banned chess by mail during
World War II because it felt that the
arcane code employed could be used for
subversive messages.
Not that unfamiliarity with the nota-
tion has been holding people back from
submitting problem answers. A solution
which begins “White’s first move is to
advance his pawn, which is on the white
square one square above the black
square in the bottom left hand corner;
two squares forward” has just as much
chance of winning as one which begins
“1. P-QR 4.” But I feel that five minutes
spent learning the symbols would save
such would-be solvers a good deal of
ink and help to prevent my turning grey
prematurely.
The diagram illustrates descriptive
notation, the system used in this col-
umn.
BLACK
WHITE
The position arises after the moves
1. P-Q4 P-Q4. Each side numbers the
rank from his side of the board for
example, White’s K 5 square is Black’s
K 4. Each piece is designated by its first
letter, except “N” for Knight. “QR”
means Queen’s Rook. A capture is
shown by “x,” moves to is ” and
check is “ch.” The mysterious “0-0” and
“0-0-0” stand for castles K-side and Q-
side respectively.
The ability to record your chess
games gives you the chance to preserve
your blunders for posterity. It also al-
lows us to admire the exploits of the
great masters of chess history. The fol-
lowing snappy little game, perpetrated
by Ruy Lopez (after whom the opening
is named) in Madrid in 1575, still
sparkles more than 400 years later.

INTELLIGENCER
Costly work
a fake,
says expert
born in 1399 and died in 1464
in Brussels. Experts believe
that the painting in the Na-
tional Gallery probably de-
picts St Ivo, a 13th-century
saint from Brittany known as
“The Lawyer of the Poor.”
Christopher Wright a
controversial expert in art
A FLEMISH painting valued
at $6.5 million in Britain’s Na-
tional Gallery is a modern
fake, according to an art his-
torian.
He claims that the 15th-
century work, Rogier van der
Weyden’s St Ivo, was forged
by French copyist Emile
Delobre.
The work is one of the few
great Flemish paintings dis-
covered in recent years. In
1968 it was spotted hanging in
a Berkshire cottage by a
Christie’s expert.
Little is known about
Rogier van der Weyden, who
did not sign his works. He was
forgeries argues that the
National Gallery’s St Ivo was
painted not in 1450 but is a
20th-century work. This claim
comes in his book, The Art of
the Forger, to be published
this month.
Two areas of the painting
caused Wright particular con-
The Australian, August 29
cern: the face of the saint and
the letter he is reading.
“The face of St Ivo has a
modern look, with almost
photographic detail visible on
the picture, including a small
scar near the mouth and a
slightly unshaven chin,” he
said. Wright argues that,
among other things, a saint
would have been painted in a
more idealised fashion.
Sir Martin Davies, director
of the National Gallery in
1971, was determined to ac-
quire the work. More than
$650,000 was paid for it,
making it one of the gallery’s
most expensive purchases. Be-
cause of death-duty arrange-
ments, the total cost of the
printing was more than $1.3
million.
Reduction
in manning
in trains
RAIL authorities around Aus-
tralia were watching with
keen interest the outcome of
New South Wales’ protracted
rail strike over manning levels
and union award coverage on
the state’s freight trains.
With the exception of
Western Australia, where this
issue has been resolved, every
other rail authority is negoti-
ating cautiously towards an
identical objective a reduc-
tion of train crews from three
to two and the removal of the
brake (or guard) van from the
rear of the train.
After a lengthly battle be-
fore the Western Australia In-
dustrial Commission, freight
trains in that state have been
operating with two-man crews
and minus the rear van since
June. In this case tradition
won out, with union coverage
for the second man in the
locomotive remaining with
the Australian Federation of
Locomotive Enginemen
(AFULE).
Further north in the state,
two-man crews operating the
privately-owned rail system
serving the iron ore fields are
covered by the Federated En-
gine Drivers and Fireman’s
Association and the Austra-
lian Workers Union.
The cause for a strike by
members of the Australian
Railways Union employed by
National Railways in South
Australia was related to this
problem. Trials discarding the
rear brake van the leaving the
train in the hands of two
AFULE members were due to
begin on September 24.
Queensland and Victoria
government railways also
have initiated negotiations
leading to a reduction in train
crews but are taking a softer
approach than NSW’s State
Rail Authority.
Demonstrating the deli-
cacy of the issue, one rail line
in Queensland, the Goonyella
line servicing the state’s cen-
tral coal fields, has operated
for about 12 years with a
three-man crew in the loco-
motive.
Pas for the
course
IN CASE you (or even they)
haven’t realised it, the citizens
just south of Tweed Heads, in
northern NSW, have a pretty
wit: they have named a local
recreation reserve Faux Park.
Two for the
price of one
IRISH TIMES joke: “Water
restrictions have been
imposed in some parts of the
country because of drought.
We cannot confirm the story,
however, that a notice has
been displayed in a swimming
pool somewhere in the south-
west saying: ‘Because of water
shortages, lanes one, two,
seven and eight have been
closed’.”
And a Polish joke (in the
Financial Times.): Kowalski is
told by his department chief
to carry a portrait of Soviet
leader Konstantin Chernenko
at a Communist Party rally.
“Come on, boss,” he pro-
tests, “I carried Andropov’s
last year and Brezhnev’s the
year before and look what
happened to them.”
“Kowalski,” says the boss,
“that’s exactly why I’ve
chosen you again.”


A taxing
problem
AT SA2O a head, Australia
would appear to have the
highest airport departure tax
in the world.
Going by the latest avail-
able list, Hong Kong runs a
distant second at SHKIOO for
each adult leaving, which
works out at close to SAIS.
But at least in Hong Kong
they charge half tax for chil-
dren.
Third in the running is
Papua New Guinea but
only for residents, who pay 10
kina ($A 12.75) each. Visitors
to PNG pay a mere two kina.
The standard charge,
among those countries which
impose one, is between $5 and
$lO. Many major nations do
not impose a departure tax.
These include the United
States, Britain and nearly all
of Europe apart from West
Germany and Portugal.
Indeed the list of countries
which do impose departure
taxes has a very Third World
look about it, with names such
as Belize, Afghanistan, Gam-
bia and Tuvalu.
And, of course, Australia.

The solidarity of the

goes without saying. But the

an analysis based on class dis-

BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
OFTEN there seems to be a great-
er need to shore up a weakness in
your home board than to strength-
en an outpost. But often the em-
phasis is purely psychological, the
result of spurious reasoning. The
illustration shows a good example.
White has just rolled a 6-4. What’s
the play?
The solid arrows show what
may be, to many exponents, an in-
stinctive move keeping every-
thing safe. It is a weak move at
best and a game-losing one at
worst.
To examine the move objec-
tively, let’s look at the situation if
it is made. Black will have only
one option. On his roll, he will at-
tack 85.
With a double 2, Black will
capture 85. With a double 4 he
will take 85. With any 8 he will hit
B 5 from the mid-point (Wl2). The
same goes for any 3 or 2 from B 8
or 87.
It becomes clear that the White
blot on B 5 is not going to survive.
In all probability it will be placed
on the bar with a Black blot re-
maining in its place.
So White’s next roll will be
from the bar, from where he will
be looking for any 5 (to hit on B 5).
At this point he will be 5 to 4
against doing so.
Suppose, instead of covering
now (the solid line play), White
captures B 5 (the dotted line) and
moves the same 6 as before. Of
course, with any 3 Black will hit
on W 4 but that should not worry
White unduly as he owns 85.
Furthermore, what else will
Black roll besides a 3? Whatever it
is, he’s going to have blots all over
the outer boards and with his 5
point in the hands of his opponent
no strength in his home board.

Opening lead jack of

ALMOST everyone harbors a de-
sire to be able to perform feats of
magic. This accounts for some of
bridge’s great popularity because,
sooner or later, we all get the op-
portunity to make a loser disap-
pear or to create a winner out of
thin air.
Consider this deal where West
led a diamond against six hearts.
Declarer could see two possible
losers the ace of spades and
king of clubs. A club finesse was
available but West’s spade bid
made it likely that he, rather than
East, held the king.
Declarer also noted that a
spade or a club could be discarded
on one of dummy’s high dia-
monds but that taking an early
discard would not alter his situa-
tion materially. Nevertheless,
South conjured up a way to cause
one of his losers to vanish.
He won the diamond lead with
the king and drew trumps with the
A-K. Then, at trick four, he led a
low spade toward dummy’s queen,
creating a trap from which even
Houdini could not have escaped.
West had no way to judge
exactly what was transpiring but it
did not matter whether he played
high or low on the spade lead.
He could not stop the slam.
Actually, West played low on
the spade. Declarer won with
dummy’s queen, cashed the ace of
diamonds and discarded the
spade king and thus lost only a
club trick. Had West taken the
spade three with the ace, declarer
would later have discarded the Q-
J of clubs on the spade queen and
diamond ace.
Skilful planning had much
more to do with South’s feat than
did magic. But any good magician
could tell you that.


Few cars have
new Crown's set
of standards.
Take a close look at the standards offered
in Australia's luxury car market.
The fact is for all their high price tags, a lot
of so-called luxury cars offer you relatively few
standard features.
Toyota Crown is one of the very few cars
offering a complete set of standards.
Crown's engineering standards include
an advanced 2.8 Super Responsive engine
with electronic fuel injection,
4 wheel disc brakes, full-frame
chassis, vehicle speed sensitised
power steering and fully independent rear sus-
pension with trailing arms.
Inside Crown pampers you with power
windows, air conditioning, moquette cloth
seating, telescopic steering column, even a
small refrigerator to keep drinks cool.
SUPER RESPONSIVE
They're all, along with many other fea-
tures far too numerous to describe here, stan-
dard on the new Toyota Crown.
Yet on some "luxury cars" such basic
standards as air conditioning and power win-
dows are add-on options at extra cost.
No matter how much you're prepared to
pay for a luxury car, you'll usually find Crown
offers a comparable list of standard luxury.
So consider Toyota Crown alongside any
luxury car you can think of. When it comes to
standard luxury, we're sure Crown will
compare very comfortably indeed.

Oh what a feeling!
