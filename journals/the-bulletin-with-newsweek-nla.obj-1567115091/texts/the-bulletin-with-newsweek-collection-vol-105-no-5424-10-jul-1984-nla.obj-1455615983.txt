At BMW, the search for ultimate
quality is neverending.
For example, several times a day
a satellite in outer space links a precision
computer in Rochester, USA, to
computerised machine tools in the BMW
factory. The single aim being, to achieve
absolute precision in the machining
of parts for engines, transmissions and
final drive assemblies.
In a few minutes, overthe satellite
link, we can discover the exact profile
corrections needed for a set of gears
so that it matches our quality requirements
exactly.
The BMWS2Oi isa product of this
multi-million dollar investment. No other
car in its class is built to the same exacting
standards.
The engine combines all the power
and turbine-like smoothness of BMW’s
superior six-cylinder inline concept with
the economy of a 2-litre power plant.
It is, in fact, one of the very few 2-litre six-
cylinder engines in the world.
The L-Jetronic engine of the 520 i
incorporates an energy saving fuel cut-off.
The fuel supply is stopped when you lift off
the accelerator at over 1200 rpm. So now
you could travel at lOOkmh without using
a drop of petrol. An accurate fuel
consumption meter shows how much
fuel, in Itr/lOOkm, the car is currently
using.
Nowthes2oi is available with a
revolutionary four-speed automatic
transmission. It achieves the economy
you would only expect from a 5-speed
manual gearbox.
The overdrive gear actually reduces
engine revolutions and so the amount of
fuel needed. In fact, a 17% improvement
over the previous automatic transmission.
The 520 i. A combination of
outstanding engineering and meticulous
attention to detail to bring you the
ultimate in performance, economy
and safety.

Welcome to a
bigger, better magazine
THROUGHOUT its 104-year-plus his-
tory The Bulletin has been renowned
for its radicalism in various forms.
This issue marks another radical
change to the publication, which we
hope will be received as enthusiasti-
cally by our readers as it has been by
our staff and our advertisers.
Newsweek always has been a friend
of The Bulletin. At various times over
the past 20 years we have taken an in-
ternational news service from its col-
umns and its peripatetic staff of foreign
correspondents always have been wel-
come where Bulletin journalists gather
to report, research, write and eat and
drink.
What you see between the covers of this week’s
Bulletin is a fairly natural piece of evolution. It’s
been discussed between us, on and off, for more than
10 years. Those who see it as a defensive move are
wrong.
In the print medium in Australia, the news infor-
mation market is a very mature one. To a fairly large
extent readers have become settled in their ways as
they choose each week by which means they will get
their dose of information on the subjects of most in-
terest to them.
In this scheme of things, The Bulletin was pre-
eminent.
One thing, however, continued to elude us an
exclusive, comprehensive and up-to-date internation-
al news service. Like all other Australian newspapers
and magazines we do not have the financial muscle to
maintain our own correspondents on the ground at all
of the world’s major news centres. It is unlikely we
ever would be able to manage that perfect solution.
But the original genius of the concept of the news
magazine was and continues to be its com-
prehensiveness, its utilitarian nature as an informa-
tion source.
The international news magazines could never sat-
isfy this goal. Neither could we. Hence the radical
nature of the solution you have before you.
It is two magazines in one. It is not homogeneous,
it is not sanitised. We have made a couple of technical
changes (for the aficionados, we have lightened the
typeface of the main headings from upper case Futura
Editor-in-Chief Trevor Kennedy
Bold to lower case Holsatia Medium)
and have tried to improve certain sec-
tions of the magazine. But essentially
we’re still The Bulletin and probably
we will continue to be the most idio-
syncratic of Australian publications.
We were once called a “virile
shambles” and we rather like that
but we will try to be more virile and
less of a shambles.
The Bulletin and Newsweek have
arrived at the news magazine format by
rather different routes The Bulletin as
the nursery of Australia’s early great
writers, balladists and storytellers;
Newsweek as competition for Time in
1933. We are both fiercely proud of our
history, traditions and independence. We both intend
to safeguard them within the covers of this publica-
tion.
The Newsweek section of the magazine, separately
edited and carrying its own internal cover, begins on
page 101 of this issue and runs to page 140. Each week
it will contain 24 pages of editorial, plus advertise-
ments.
Apart from the technical changes to The Bulletin,
mentioned earlier, some editorial changes also have
been made. The World in Focus section has been
dropped but we have re-introduced the Neighbor-
hood section to cover stories of particular interest to
Australia from areas such as New Zealand, the Pacific
and South-East Asia.
We will continue to buy into the major internation-
al stories where they require some special interpreta-
tion from an Australian point of view. John Edwards
is still in Washington and will report the US election,
the economy there and other major events as they
affect Australia. Robert Darroch will do the same
from Europe, as will the many other correspondents
who write for us around the globe.
All the regular Bulletin features have been retained.
No doubt there will be some glitches along the way.
There always will be with something as new and rad-
ical as this. If you bear with us, we will do our
darndest to make it well worth your while.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Pierpont inflammatory ...
I - J
Pierpont’s “Mining Right” (B, June 19)
is to be deplored as yet another example
of inflammatory racism. Indeed, the
article borders on group defamation
and, were class actions possible, would
surely be brought before the courts.
Many in the community may find
Pierpont clever, even witty, and in the
finest tradition of satire upon which
much genuine home-grown Australian
humor is based. But no smile crossed
my face when reading this propaganda
and I do not accept that my sense of
humor has lost its sharp edge. Humor
plays on the incongruities and surprises
of human nature, not on the desperate
bravado of the articulate bully who mis-
uses his skill to degrade the religion,
culture and aspirations of an indigen-
ous people.
But, as one article among many of its
type, the most worrying aspect is the as-
sumption by editors that the community
as a whole tolerates and encourages the
deliberate promotion of racial hatred
and misunderstanding through the me-
dium of the nationally recognised news-
papers and periodicals. The apparent
willingness of the conservative, liberal
editors to sacrifice honor and integrity is
a reflection of the worst aspects of our
free press society.
It is simply not true that:
■ Anyone can declare that they are of
Aboriginal descent.
■ Any one plot of ground can be, or is
being, declared a sacred or significant
site.
■ The mining industry is being brought
to its knees by Aboriginal interests.
■ All Aboriginals are opposed to
mining under any circumstances.
■ Compensation payments have be-
come enormous relative to the actual
dispossession of the land involved.
I am well aware that there are both
ideological disagreements and proce-
dural problems that confront the
mining industry and Aboriginal com-
munities. This merely reflects that the
balance of power has shifted more to an
equilibrium. The trouble is, some of the
mining companies liked the old days
better when they didn’t have to worry
about negotiating with anyone but their
mates in Canberra. Where the ideologi-
cal differences occur over the rights of
Aborigines to land and to restrict
mining of that land if they so wish, then
they have every right to pursue the de-
bate in a respectable manner. When
procedural problems exist which cause
delay and expensive cost overruns, then
they should join together with the Abor-
iginal Land Councils to find procedural
reform, for it is in both their interests to
resolve these difficulties.
Meanwhile, this contribution from
Pierpont should be condemned by all
fair-minded citizens as a piece of ugly,
mud-slinging journalism unworthy of a
“It’s a Get Re-incarnated Soon card
from Neville.”

BASS STRAIT 1964
BASS STRAIT 1984
Nearly 20year s ago Esso/BHP took on the challenge to
develop the Bass Strait oil and gas fields. Nowhere in the world
had platforms been built in such hazardous waters.
THE LOCAL OIL SCENE
HAS SURE CHANGED A LOT
OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS.
A vast complex of giant platforms
was required, linked by pipelines running
132 kilometres under the sea and
across the Victorian coastline to the
processing plants.
In just 4 years the first phase
was completed. A remarkable achievement.
Today there are 12 platforms, with expanded onshore
processing plants representing an investment exceeding $l.B
billion.
The first and smallest platform, Barracouta, stands 65
metres high and weighs over 2,000 tonnes.
The largest, Mackerel, stands in 92 metres of water and
weighs over 8,000 tonnes.
The platforms supply all of Victoria's natural gas and
almost two-thirds of Australia's oil needs.
Further development of Bass Strait continues to be an
imposing challenge.
But the rewards are flowing not only to those directly
involved, but all Australians.

I enclose herewith my cheque (the de-
ferred part of the $lO,OOO only) for
shares in Pierpont’s Sacred Site Mining
No Liability group (B, June 19).
I’m sure that around three-quarters
of the population will also be sub-
scribing, as most people are aware of
the need for such a group. However,
there is a fear at the back of my mind
that in these days when so-called racism
is only that when whites make a com-
ment, however light-hearted or true,
such heavy-weights as the Anti-Dis-
crimination Board, the Human Rights
Commission, the Press Council and
other (no names) support groups may
try to interfere with the group’s forma-
tion.
Should that happen, may I make a
contribution of my deferred part to the

Riverland woes
Bert Kelly has hopefully concluded his
Riverland rendezvous with a fair
“Smoking or non-smoking?”
chance of leaving the local Riverland
fruitgrowers in a state of epilepsy.
The Riverland Summit Conference
held in Berri on February 9 and 10 was,
in the view of participants, both produc-
tive and successful. The region contrib-
utes $l5O million a year to the South
Australian economy about 20 percent
of the state’s annual agricultural in-
come.
The mischievous theme of the Riv-
erland epilogue, portraying Riverland
growers as mendicants of government
hand-outs, requires comment. Our
Modest Farmer, as a member of parlia-
ment, saw first-hand the destruction of
the Australian brandy industry over a
decade of disastrous federal govern-
ment policies. The Riverland Distillery
once contributed 70 percent of a sub-
stantial Australian brandy market but
recent vintages have come and gone
A bed is a bed is a bed.

So why stay at the Crest?
There are some people who could quite
happily sleep on a barbed-wire fence. But for
those who appreciate the little comforts of life,
the Crest International Hotel has the
accommodation to make you feel very much
at home.
And when we say accommodation, it's
even more than a spacious, luxury room. It's
the total facilities we offer that make your stay
more pleasurable. The two swimming pools
for instance, the saunas, the fully equipped
gymnasium, and of course the excellent bars
and restaurants. All yours to enjoy whenever
you get a break during your business day.
The Crest International Hotel, right in
the heart of Brisbane. When it comes to
providing the very best in accommodation,
we're not lying down on the job.

without a drop of brandy being made
there. The Hawke Government, in its re-
cent ill-advised fortified spirit tax, puts
at great risk yet again another
major Riverland product. (The govern-
ment abandoned the tax on June 22).
The Riverland Summit Conference
witnessed well-based criticism of the
efficiency of our statutorily-controlled
Engineering and Water Supply Depart-
ment and the South Australian Electri-
city Trust. The yearly increases by these
departments over the past four years
have averaged 18.8 percent and 15.25
percent, respectively. The legislated
price of wine grapes for growers in the
Riverland has risen on average by 6.75
percent over the same period. In more
realistic terms, Riverland wine grape
growers receive approximately 18c to
22c for their grapes per bottle of wine
and will wait up to 12 months for final
payment from the winemakers.
Hopefully, Farmer Bert may ap-
preciate Riverland fruitgrowers as
battlers not squealers. The summit
conference spelled out quite clearly the
need for both state and federal govern-
ments to implement long-term policies
for the region. It takes years for citrus,
deciduous fruits and grapes to reach
maturity. It takes governments only mo-
ments to destroy them.

Financial assistance
In an article about film-maker Paul
Cox, by Susan Molloy (B, June 19) Paul
is quoted as saying: “The Australian
Film Commission has never given me
money for a major film . . It may be
that Paul does not regard his film about
his marriage problems My First Wife
to be a major film but, if he does, he
has forgotten about the substantial
financial assistance provided to him by
the Australian Film Commission for the
film.
Through its Special Production
Fund, the Film Commission provided
both an underwriting facility and a dis-
tribution guarantee. These commit-
ments totalled $235,000 and I am sure
were critical in the securing of finance
for the project. Since the film was fully
funded and has now been substantially
pre-sold, the Film Commission’s com-
mitments have been discharged by the
production company and the monies re-
allocated to other film-makers.

The highly respected “Your Computer”
magazine has just named the Apple Lisa as
Computer Of The Year, 1984.
In their own words, “People will remember
1983 as the year that Lisa revolutionised
personal computing.”
Surely good news for the business on the
verge of choosing the ideal system.
In the frantic, fast-moving world of micro


technology, where new models are here today
and gone this afternoon, Lisa seems to be a
reassuring exception.
This is the most advanced personal
computer in the world, with up to one million
bytes of internal memory.
Unlike conventional computers, Lisa
works visually, the way you do. Those complex
computer commands are replaced with familiar
symbols and a palm-sized mouse.
Countless man-hours are saved because
Lisa starts being productive from the moment
it’s switched on. (Even for staff who’ve never
used a computer before.)
Little technical miracles like these don’t
exactly happen overnight.
Considering they’ve taken us a good five
years to perfect, even if our competitors simply
copy, they should be kept busy for some time.
There are three Lisa models of varying
price and capacity, any one of which your Apple
dealer would be proud to demonstrate.
You probably won’t be the only company
moving to Lisa technology this year.
We expect quite a few of our
competitors will be doing likewise.

“He may be in middle management
but he’s a handy lad.”
Here is a person with the ability to econ-
omise not merely in film but in ap-
proach to identifying those internal re-
trievals which keep us all ticking over.
Indeed, it is our duty to do something
with our talents. And I share his belief
that the talented need not think about
the future yet they need to travel
there, no matter how painful or lonely.
It is people such as Cox with his fire,
middle age and determination who en-
sure film (and, for that matter, art) will
survive the influence of the megabuck,
“tax incentives” and the “social upgrad-
ing” of individual importance. His
magic of providing us with the percep-
tive ability to see who we really are
makes me hope his bank manager will
consider a second mortgage.

Method of payment
At last (federal Health minister) Blewett
has revealed what he really thinks:
“Why is it,” he said in his interview with
David Armstrong (B, June 19), “that the
method of payment is supposed to de-
termine what produces the best?”
This question reveals a basic, funda-
mental lack of understanding of why
the doctors are so angry. And not just
the orthopods, either; it is the main-
stream of practitioners except, of
course, the 200 members of the Doctors’
Reform Society and those few get-rich-
quick GPs who bulk-bill everybody who
enters their mass-production factory.
Let me explain: When a doctor and
patient sit down together, each should
have a sense of responsibility toward
the other. The doctor is responsible to
the patient to get him well and to give
him his money’s worth. The patient is
also responsible for two things: carrying
out instructions and paying for the doc-
tor’s services.
Now, if anything removes that re-
sponsibility from either party, the rela-
tionship breaks down.
If a third party pays the doctor,
the patient’s personal responsibility
diminishes and his attitude toward his
doctor changes.
Doctors who have worked, for
example, for a mining company or for
the government in Britain’s national
health service find that they are soon
physically and emotionally exhausted
by the unreasonable demands of a sig-
nificant minority of patients who, not
having to bear the responsibility of pay-
ing at the time of service (or, at least,
receiving an account), abuse the system,
fail to heed the advice given, don’t finish
the course of medication and generally
give the doctor a hard time.
This is why the method of payment
CERTAINLY DOES determine what
produces the best results.

Cost of legislation
Before the Family Law Act was passed,
in 1975, it met strong opposition from
many who saw it as being a recipe for
disaster. After nine years in operation,
they see their worst fears realised.
With broken marriages costing tax-
payers almost $1.2 billion a year in so-
cial security benefits and the Family
Court Counselling Service calling for a
doubling of its staff to cope with the de-
mands made on it, it is obvious that the
legislation has been a tragic mistake.
Broken marriages with all the
trauma for the many thousands of chil-
dren affected are but one of the conse-
quences of the unfortunate legislation.
In permitting either partner to walk
out of marriage at will, it has demeaned
the institution of marriage and created a
situation where it has become accept-
able to by-pass the marriage ceremony.
In this regard, the Bureau of Statis-
tics figures are most illuminating. In
1971, the number of de facto couples
approximated only 17,000. By 1976
the year after the Family Law Act was
passed the figure had risen to 65,000
and, by 1982, it had risen to more than
167,000.
Statistics cannot adequately give a
picture of the social consequences of the
Family Law Act but they are becoming
increasingly apparent as most families
find themselves either directly or in-
directly affected.

While the present federal govern-
ment cannot be held responsible for the
mistake made by its predecessors in
1975, it will be held responsible if it fails
to take action to correct that mistake.
For the present, the government does
not appear to be prepared to grasp the
nettle. Indications are that moves are
afoot to accelerate the disintegration of
the family by placing de facto relation-
ships on a par with marriage the first
step being to review the tax laws to give
de facto couples tax relief.

Proper disarmament
It is ridiculous that an expensive cam-
paign is being waged in Australia for
nuclear disarmament. The fact is that
Australia has no nuclear weapons and
our conventional defence forces are in-
capable of thrashing anyone.
Ansett Airlines recently claimed that
they could transport all Australia’s
frontline troops, fully equipped, from
the north of Australia to the south in
one day.
The first presence by the Australian
navy in the Indian Ocean for 12 months
is the current seven-week tour of duty
by the 4500-tonne HMAS Brisbane.
In contrast, the Soviet Pacific and In-
dian fleet totals more than 500 ships
including two aircraft carriers, 28 nu-
clear-powered and 92 conventional sub-
marines and more than 300 other sur-
face ships.
Disarmament is necessary but it must
be equal, progressive, verifiable and in-
cluding not only nuclear but also con-
ventional, chemical and biological
weapons.

School funding
The Commonwealth Schools Commis-
sion has a brief to stimulate interest in
the improvement of schools and so I
was pleased to see Richard Farmer’s
article (B, May 8). It was a genuine at-
tempt to come to grips with a complex
issue and for the most part I have no
problems with his sums.
I do, however, have a problem with
the bald assertion which he attributes
to unnamed officials that the commis-
sion’s proposals would increase educa-
tion funding to 10 percent of gross
domestic product.
This is not right.
I note that Farmer has not costed the
commission’s proposals for a commu-
nity standard which are now before the
government. If he had, he would have
found that this figure would tend to re-
store school funding to about the same
level in proportion to Gross Domestic
Product as in the mid-19705, which was
less than 4 percent.
As the commission pointed out in
Funding Policies for Australian Schools,
public outlays on schools as a percent-
age of GDP declined from 3.8 percent
to 3.5 percent between 1977-78 and
1980-81. If there had been no decline in
schools’ share of GDP over that period,
an additional $450 million or more
might have been available for schools.
The commission views this overall re-
duction in national investment in edu-
cation with concern, particularly in
view of the increased pressures on, and
greater expectations held of, schools in
Australia in the 1980 s.
Adopting the commission’s commu-
nity standard target would gradually
move school funding back towards 3.8
percent of GDP, a proposal that few
people would find alarming.
Farmer has not chosen to cost the
concrete proposal before the govern-
ment but instead has extrapolated from
a set of ideal standards contained in a
companion background document,
Commonwealth Standards for Austra-
lian Schools.
The ideal standards had no specific
“You do realise, in a nuclear
holocaust
we’ll only have four minutes
to generate a spirit of
wartime bonhomie. ”
time frame and would clearly be depen-'
dent on economic growth for achieve-
ment. Farmer has chosen to use these to
set up a “worst case” for the impact of
the commission’s educational judg-
ments of schools’ share of GDP. But,
even granting his assumptions, the con-
clusions of his unnamed sources go
further than his own figures actually
permit.
Public spending on schools grew at
an average rate of 5 percent a year from
1974 to 1983. Using Farmer’s 1993 time
frame for the realisation of the ideal
standards his time frame, certainly
not the commission’s his “worst case”
figures imply an average annual growth
in school recurrent resources of less
than 4 percent. Over 20 years, the av-
erage growth implied by those ideal
standards would be about 2 percent. To
suggest these standards would tend to
expand education spending to the as-
tounding figure of 10 percent of GDP
must assume no economic growth over
the next decade.
The commission is of the corporate
view that moderate increases in invest-
ment in schooling will be important to
sustaining and optimising economic
growth. Our economic structure is
changing. Australian students will need
better foundations for learning acquired
in the first years of school and they will
need a full secondary education to be
productive within the society and
workforce of the future.
Nobody can credibly argue that pro-
viding school resources of high stan-
dard for all children is going to be
cheap. But, unless Australia makes an
effort to provide the goods for all stu-
dents, the money we spend on educa-
tion may tend to reinforce inequalities
in our society.
In the long run, that is something we
cannot afford.

"THE AFTER-DINNER CONVERSATION HAD BEEN RATHER BORING
UNTIL SOMEONE MENTIONED INVESTMENT BANKS."
lliilsa - :
JWT015.P.019
"THE AFTER-DINNER CONVERSATION HAD BEEN RATHER BORING
UNTIL SOMEONE MENTIONED INVESTMENT BANKS."
"What do you think of this new
approach by Schroder Darling?" Fd said
quietly.
All other talk sputtered out.
I suddenly felt as if I had unwittingly
stepped onto forbidden ground.
"Dashed bad sports." That was the
Major.
"Totally reprehensible," agreed
Soames, tipping the ash from his half-
Corona.
"In my day, these sort of financial
opportunities weren’t available to just
anyone.
"One had to have the right
connections, work in the City, lunch at the
Club, that sort of thing.
"And one certainly couldn’t invest
without a minor inheritance to play with."
The others nodded in silent agree-
ment with the Major.
"They tell me Schroder Darling are
offering trust funds for those with as little
as $l,OOO to invest," I inteijected - secretly
enjoying the consternation I was obviously
causing.
"$1,000? AS LITTLE AS THAT?"
"A disgrace!" mumbled Soames. "What
on earth is the world coming to?"
"And how on earth can they do it?"
asked Smith.
"Well," I said, as all eyes turned on me,
"it seems that by pooling a large number of
small investors’ money, Schroder Darling
can take advantage of some of the more
lucrative investment opportunities avail-
able in the stock market."
"The stock market?" thundered the
Major. "It takes years of experience to invest


profitably in that."
"And a pretty sizeable stake," added
Smith.
"They have both," I answered imme-
diately, making the most of the unusual
attention being paid to me.
"After all, the Schroder Group have
been around a long time. And been pretty
successful at it, too - they currently have
$12 billion under management, worldwide.
"As for the stake - well, a lot of small
investors working together have all the
advantages of a large one."
"MIMMIZED RISK/
MAXIMIZED RETURN, EH?"
mused Smith, showing a tug of interest.
"It s the beginning of the end, you
mark my words!" bellowed the Major.
"Where would we be if everyone could
have the advantages we enjoy?
"Why, one couldn’t get a decent table at
the Ritz for all the hoi polloi there."
"Just a moment, Majoif said Soames
firmly. "I want to hear more."
"It’s quite impressive, really,"
I continued as the Maj or sub sided reluctantly,
clutching his port
"Take their Australis’ fund."
"‘AUSTRALIS’ FUND?"
"Yes. It’s a unit trust that provides
investors with a convenient, professionally
managed fund that is aimed at achieving
high returns.
"In fact, in the past five and a half years,
Australis’ achieved annual compound
returns of - listen to this - 2.2.4%*!"
"22A°/o? IMPOSSIBLE"
"Not at all," I riposted.
"You see, Schroder Darling have used
the Australis’ fund to invest in smaller
companies showing a high growth perfor-
mance or potential for such."
"You mean like...?" asked Smith,
mentioning the name of a company that
had received considerable and favourable
press the previous year.
"Exactly."
I could sense their interest now.
"What’s more," I added, "the income is
distributed six-monthly.
"One can either take the cheques, or
have it re-invested automatically."
"TWICE-YEARLY CHEQUES.
NOT BAD."
"But I suppose there’s quite a hefty up-
front charge, eh?" prompted Smith.
"Hardly enough to affect your profits,"
was my quick reply. "In fact, Schroder
Darling’s fees are appealingly small."
"‘Australis’ fund, y’say," murmured
Soames, surreptitiously jotting the name
down on his napkin.
"Yes - and while you have your pen out,
why don’t you make a note of the telephone
number as well!" I laughed.
"Mmmm. Quite," was his somewhat
shamefaced reply.
This apparent weakening of resolve
obviously stung the Major.
"How come you know so much about
Schroder Darling, m’boy?"
"Actually, they handle my investments.
In fact, it is quite a sizeable sum now."
"There you go!" pounced the Major.
"That proves it. No offence, but if chaps
like you can make money by using Schroder
Darling, anyone can.
"Pretty soon everyone will be as well
off as, well, me."
"I’m glad you said that, Major,"
interjected Smith.
"Ah, so you agree with me. Jolly good,"
smiled the Maj or, who had sensed the tide of
opinion moving steadily against him.
"Actually, no. I’m glad you’ve admitted
you’re well off -1 seem to remember it’s
your turn to pick up the bill!"

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Call for unity
PRIME MINISTER Bob
Hawke chose a radio inter-
view and later a news confer-
ence to answer criticism
(mainly from his own party)
over a number of issues inclu-
ding East Timor, uranium,
strategic bases and the entry
of foreign banks. He urged the
99 delegates to next week’s
ALP national conference to
put the nation before the
party in policy votes and said
that the increased popularity
of the government since the
elections proved the rightness
of the government’s policies
in spite of party opposition to
some of them.
Doctors go
THE FEUD between the
NSW Government and the
state’s doctors continued. Ac-
cording to figures issued by
the NSW Health Department,
by the weekend more than
1100 doctors had resigned
from 1559 posts in the state’s
public hospitals. There are
more than 8000 posts in NSW
public hospitals and some
doctors hold several pos-
itions.
ANZUS defined
SPEAKING at a conference
on US-Australian defence
links organised by the Austra-
lian Studies Centre at Penn-
sylvania State University,
Paul Wolfowitz, American
Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, said that the ANZUS
relationship covered an attack
on Australia “from any
source.” He added that Am-
erica’s commitment to help
Australia “in any emergency”
applied to the Indian as well
as the Pacific Ocean.
Press Council chief
JOHN Halden Wootten, QC,
is the new chairman of the
Australian Press Council. He
replaces Professor Geoffrey
Sawer, who was forced by ill-
health to retire after serving
roughly half his three-year
term. Wootten recently retired
after 10 years as a judge of the
NSW Supreme Court. He will
take up his three-year ap-
pointment from August 1.
Left man wins
THE Queensland ALP elected
Socialist Left candidate, lan
McLean, 49, as its president
by 115 votes to 100 at the state
ALP conference. He is State
secretary of the Australian
Telecommunications Em-
ployees Association.
THE WORLD
Soviet offer
ANATOLY Dobrynin, Soviet
ambassador to Washington,
handed a note to US Secretary
of State George Shultz pro-
posing talks in Vienna in Sep-
tember on preventing “the
militarisation of outer space.”
In what seemed to be a change
in American attitude, White
House National Security Ad-
viser, Robert McFarlane, said
American negotiators were
willing to bargain with the
Soviets any time, anywhere
regardless of whether the
problem of nuclear disarma-
ment was included in the dis-
cussions. However, the Soviet
news agency Tass reported
that the US was raising pre-
conditions for taking part in
talks on space weapons and
rejected any link between
them and nuclear issues.
PNG protest
PAPUA New Guinea has
“strongly protested” to Indo-
nesia alleging that soldiers
from Irian Jaya crossed the
common border and burned
huts and gardens in a PNG
village on June 21. The note
was handed to the Indonesian
ambassador in Port Moresby,
Imam Soepomo, by Foreign
Affairs secretary Paulias
Matane.
Israeli attack
ISRAELI planes and gun-
boats attacked a small island
off the northern Lebanese port
of Tripoli, killing 15 and
wounding 70 members of
the Sunni fundamentalist
Tawheed militia. Israel said
that Tawheed had used the
island for training terrorists
and for storing weapons and
ammunition.
POW swap
ISRAEL and Syria exchanged
war prisoners at the Golan
Heights front. Syria released
six Israelis and Israel 290
Syrians.


Iraq claims successes
IRAQ claimed further suc-
cesses in its attempt to block-
ade Iran’s vital Kharg Island
oil terminal. Bagdad Radio
announced that Iraqi jets de-
stroyed five “enemy naval tar-
gets” and shot down an
Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter at
the northern end of the Gulf.
The broadcast also claimed
that several other Iranian ves-
sels were damaged when they
ran into a minefield.
Gore released
FATHER Brian Gore, the
Australian priest jailed on
multiple murder charges since
February, was released this
week after the Marcos govern-
ment agreed to drop all
changes against him, his fel-
low priest Fr Niall O’Brien
and six lay co-workers in ex-
change for the immediate
exile of the missionaries.
Coup fails
BOLIVIAN police and army
officers attempted a coup
against President Siles
Zuazo’s left-oriented regime.
The putsch failed when the
majority of the armed forces
refused to participate in it.
Bolivia has had to introduce
stiff austerity measures to ob-
tain help from the Inter-
national Monetary Fund in
repaying its $4OOO million for-
eign debt.
BUSINESS
BHP boost
BHP Ltd achieved production
targets in the financial year to
May 31, ensuring a $6OO mil-
lion profit for the 12 months.
This is a dramatic recovery
from the $245 million result of
the previous year which was
restrained by a $144 million
loss in steel operations. BHP
also announced that it would
spend up to $5OO million this
financial year in taking over a
United States oil company,
vastly expanding its North
American presence.
Down and back
STOCK exchanges had a
mixed performance, falling
early in the week on the Jab-
iru 3 oil well result but
recovering. The All Ordin-
aries Index finished at 658.9
points, against 659.3 the pre-
vious week. The worst per-
former was the oil and gas in-
Dr Niall O’Brien (left) and Fr Brian Gore before their release
Bolivia’s President Zuazo: survived a coup attempt
dex, down from 572.5 to 549
points. BHP began the week
at $9.24 and fell as low as
$9.22 on the Jabiru news be-
fore recovering to end the
week at $9.42, after reaching
$9.50.
Food losses
INCREASED losses in
Amatil Ltd’s meat division
and lower profits from its
snack foods division saw
profit off 2.3 percent from
$23.5 million to $22.9 million
in the six months to April 30.
Revenue of the diversified
tobacco, food and consumer
products group fell margin-
ally to $793 million.

AUSTRALIA
Hawke faces strong left jabs
at a bruising conference
Next week the Labor Party faces one of the most crucial national conferences in its
stormy history. The left is threatening to humiliate a popular Labor government
and prime minister and may well do so even though the left lacks public support for
any of its major policies. A lan Reid and Richard Farmer report.
ON HIS retirement from parliamentary
politics some years ago, Kim Beazley
summed up his concept of the Labor
Party as it was then. “When I first joined
the ALP,” Beazley said, “it consisted of
the cream of the working class. Now I
am afraid it consists of the dregs of the
middle class. I am tired of them using
the Labor Party as their spiritual spit-
toon.”
Things have not changed much as
Beazley’s son, Kim, now the minister
for Aviation, can vouch. Beazley junior
is at the thick of the fight to ensure that
next week’s federal conference of the
party does not succumb to the forces of
middle-class trendyism. Like his father
before him, Beazley has a lively interest
in defence and foreign policy. He has
been working closely with Foreign Min-
ister Bill Hayden to ensure that the con-
ference decisions do not wreck Austra-
lia’s relations with the United States and
Indonesia.
Of prime concern to Beazley, who is
also minister assisting the minister for
Defence, is the attitude the conference
takes to visits to Australian ports of nu-
clear powered and armed ships. He was
disturbed at the composition of his own
WA state delegation to the Canberra
conference and rang Hayden recently to
warn him that the decision might go
against them.
Until that call, Hayden had not con-
sidered seriously losing on this issue.
Prime Minister Hawke: problems with the closed minds of single-issue people
Like Prime Minister Bob Hawke,
Hayden was slow to realise the depth of
feeling about nuclear matters among the
left wing of the party.
In part, this over-confidence reflects
the failure of the leadership of the par-
liamentary party to appreciate the
changes that have taken place at the
grass roots since Gough Whitlam em-
barked on his campaign to give rank-
and-file members a greater say in party
affairs. Whitlam was concerned with
what he saw as the stranglehold on
party forums of left-wing unions. His
answer was to open the way for ordi-
nary branch members to take part in de-
cision-making.
Things have not worked out as
Whitlam envisaged. In 1970 the federal
executive removed George Crawford,
the federal secretary of the Plumbers’
Union, from the presidency of the
Victorian branch. Today Crawford is
back in charge but the left-wing unions
did not put him there. The left’s new
strength comes from the very rank-and-
file branch members whom Whitlam
envisaged being a check on the left.
Branch membership of the Labor
Party is now very much the preserve of
the educated middle class. In working-
class areas such as the western suburbs
of Sydney it is rare to find 20 members
gathered together. In the inner-city


areas branch membership is much
higher, with a motley coalition of
people attracted to join because of a de-
sire to influence one policy or other.
The right-wing controllers of the
NSW branch have a grudging admir-
ation for the way their left-wing oppo-
nents have recruited members. They tell
of membership application forms being
left on all car windscreens displaying
“Save the Whale” stickers. Wear a T-
shirt with an anti-nuclear slogan when
shopping in Balmain on a Saturday
morning and an invitation to a Labor
branch meeting is on the way. Yet try to
get a fitter and turner from Blacktown
to turn out on a winter’s Tuesday night
and the answer invariably is that he
would prefer to be home watching the
television.
People who feel strongly about a
single issue are much more likely to par-
ticipate at often-boring political party
meetings than are those whose political
views are more general.
Hawke, after 16 months as prime
minister, has realised just how difficult it
is to satisfy single-issue party members.
Their prime concern is that one issue. It
would not matter, he has told col-
leagues, how much of the party policy
had been implemented, how well the
government was running the country or
how skilfully the economy was being
managed. If the government did not do
the one thing such people wanted, it was
a bad government.
Perhaps it was the closed minds of
the single-issue people which were be-
hind Hawke’s rather extraordinary de-
cision not to attend the recent round of
state Labor Party conferences. On the
eve of the important federal conference,
he did not want to give his opponents
an opportunity to rebuff him publicly.
But there must be some doubts about
the wisdom of this course. Whitlam al-
Victoria’s Bill Hartley (left) and George Crawford: check on the left went astray
ways tackled his party opponents in
their own den. So, too, did the man
Hawke quotes as his political hero. John
Curtin fought in the machine for view-
points which were opposed by import-
ant elements within the party. Curtin
finally won on conscription, just as
Whitlam did over changing the party
structure.
One difference between Hawke’s
position and those of his predecessors is
that Hawke alone has had to put up
with real hatred. Other Labor leaders
have had strong opposition. Yet their
disagreements rarely took on the per-
sonal bitterness that is evident between
Hawke and the Socialist Left.
Hawke has tailored his government
to the needs and desires of people who
have voted for Labor or might do so. He
is interested in winning elections so that
at least some of the party’s policy can be
implemented.
The new left prefers ideological pu-
rity and refuses to acknowledge that its
actions could damage electoral pros-
pects. Within the party branches, the
left-wing members would happily wear
Hawke’s replacement by Hayden. Their
view is that Hayden would be more sen-
sitive to the views expressed at state
party conferences that is, that Hayden
would be more compliant to the party
platform and the left’s wishes.
In one sense Hawke is winning in
tailoring his government to what the
electorate at large believes should be
done. On the major matters where fierce
debate is certain at the federal confer-
ence, the Hawke view has the endorse-
ment of the people if public opinion
polls are to be taken at their face value.
On uranium mining, Hawke would
like an open go as long as there are
stringent conditions for peaceful use of
the product by customers. Asked in a
Morgan Gallup Poll in May this year:
“Do you think Australia should or
should not develop and export uranium
for peaceful purposes?” 65 percent re-
plied “Yes should develop” against
29 percent who replied “No do not
develop.” Asked if they agreed or dis-
agreed with mining Australian uranium,
62 percent agreed against 31 percent
who disagreed.
Other issues which the left wing re-
gards as important suggest that, from
the broad ALP viewpoint, at least some
of its attitudes are electoral minuses
rather than pluses.
Some of the issues on which the ALP
left seems out of step with the general
community, as reflected by the polls, in-
clude:
■ The United States alliance, which
the left would like to see discarded but
which Hawke wants to preserve. With
this is associated such questions as US
bases in Australia and the entry into
Australian ports of ships of friendly
powers carrying nuclear weapons.
■ Aid to Vietnam.
■ Ties with South Africa.
On the US alliance, only 2 percent of
ALP voters polled believed that it was
dangerous, although the left persistently
and consistently has insisted that
maintenance of the alliance and the US
bases on Australian soil which are an
outcome of the alliance turns Australia
into a near-certain nuclear target in the
event of a major confrontation between
the US and Soviet Russia. Seventy-three
percent of all Australians and 70 per-
cent of ALP voters said that the alliance


Kim Beazley (right) with Premier Brian Burke: at odds with middle-class trendyism
was very important or fairly important
to. Australia.
Aid to Vietnam, which is ALP policy
but not implemented and which the left
is keen to see operating, was the subject
of a Morgan Gallup Poll in the middle
of last year. The poll said that it had
been suggested that the Australian gov-
ernment should resume aid to Vietnam
and asked for responses. Thirty-six per-
cent favored resumption of such aid but
49 percent were against it.
The answers to a poll on South Af-
rica suggested community sentiment
lagged behind even the government’s
action in discouraging formal sporting
ties with South Africa and far behind
the more radical action the left would
prefer taken against that country. On
whether Australia should trade with
South Africa 65 percent answered
“Yes” and 22 percent “No”, with 13
percent undecided.
On allowing individual South
African sportsmen into Australia, 81
percent said “Allow,” 14 percent said
“Do not allow” and 5 percent were un-
decided. On allowing into Australia
teams representing South Africa 77 per-
cent said “Allow,” and only 17 percent
said “Do not allow,” with the balance
undecided.
There are other problems besides
these coming up for Hawke and his fol-
lowers at the conference. There threat-
ens to be trouble, for example, over that
section of the 1982 national conference
decision which reads: “The ALP ... re-
jects the Australian (Fraser) govern-
ment’s recognition of the Indonesian
annexation of East Timor (and) op-
poses all defence aid to Indonesia until
there is a complete withdrawal.” The
Hawke government has ignored this
finding and a section of the ALP left is
extremely hostile over what it describes
as Australian subservience to Indon-
esian interests.
Another potential source of trouble
is the desire by Hawke and his
Treasurer, Paul Keating, to allow for-
eign banks into Australia to compete on
the local money markets against local
banks. This is prohibited by existing
ALP policy which is to “maintain the
existing restrictions of foreign entry to
strategic sectors of the economy, inclu-
ding banking...”
It is going to be a testing national
conference for Hawke and his support-
ers on the party’s right. The left, who
will begin proceedings with at least 42
of the 99 conference votes, have an op-
portunity to damage the government
seriously. This is why Hawke is commit-
ted to making changes in the party’s
structure to ensure that the numbers at
subsequent conferences are different.
The right-wing strategy is to undo the
work of Whitlam and build up again the
trade union influence within the Labor
Party. The attempt to have the Fed-
erated Clerks Union, the Shop Dis-
tributive and Allied Employees Associ-
ation, the Federated Ironworkers As-
sociation and the Amalgamated Society
of Carpenters and Joiners re-affiliated
in Victoria is a vital part of the strategy.
The balance of power would move the
right’s way and Crawford would have a
much harder task to stay state president.
Not surprisingly, the left has refused
to give up its advantage voluntarily and
the question of re-affiliation is now
waiting for the federal executive to in-
tervene as it did under Whitlam’s prod-
ding in 1970.
Hawke and his colleagues cannot be
certain of having the numbers at that
body, just as they will have trouble get-
ting them together to control the federal
conference proceedings and the de-
cisions it takes. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Retain the
flag, say
majority
THE AUSFLAG movement, which
wants a new national flag for the
bicentennial in 1988, is swimming
against the tide of public opinion ac-
cording to the latest Morgan Gallup
Poll.
The poll shows two out of three
Australians aged 14 and over want to
keep the Union Jack in our flag and
only 39 percent favor a new design.
In the Australia-wide poll, 2107 men
and women were asked: “Do you think
the Union Jack should continue to be in
our national flag or not?”
Sixty-six percent said retain the
Union Jack, 28 percent said take it out
and 6 percent were undecided.
The table compares the latest result
with previous Morgan Gallup Polls:

Sixty-nine percent of women said
retain the Union Jack, compared with 62

answered: retain Union Jack 48 per-
cent, delete it 37 percent and undecided

A further question on whether

UNESCO
veteran quits
in anger
By OWEN HARRIES
THE SENIOR Australian in the
UNESCO secretariat, Peter Lengyel,
has resigned and written a letter de-
nouncing the way in which the organ-
isation is run under director-general
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow.
Lengyel had been employed by
UNESCO for more than 30 years, the
last 22 of them as editor of the Inter-
national Social Science Journal, one of
the oldest and most respected of
UNESCO’s publications.
Given the current international con-
troversy over the organisation,
Lengyel’s seven-page letter to M’Bow is
an extremely important document and
given the nationality of its author and
that Australia contributes millions of
dollars a year to UNESCO it is of par-
ticular importance to Australians.
The letter probably constitutes the
most detailed and damning indictment
of UNESCO’s management practices so
far available and it comes from the Aus-
tralian best qualified to make a judg-
ment in this area.
Lengyel began by making two points
about the circumstances of his resigna-
tion. First, in the three months after he
announced his decision, no senior offi-
cer of the UNESCO secretariat hier-
archy had even bothered to ask why he
had decided to resign after such a long
service. He commented: “I interpret this
indifference to be part and parcel of the
wider refusal by the organisation’s lead-
ership to entertain any meaningful dia-
logue with the body of the staff.”
Second, he said that “the secretariat’s
currently widespread mood of dejection
and disaffection is certainly expressed
perfectly clearly by the numberless col-
leagues who have so warmly con-
gratulated me on leaving it.”
Lengyel stated unequivocally that his
resignation was not prompted by ideo-
logical or political considerations but
by the failure of the UNESCO leader-
ship to observe accepted professional
norms, ethics and values and to ensure
the integrity of officials.
He listed some of the practices he
found intolerable. They included:
“Posts left vacant for prolonged
periods, resulting in a variety of unsettl-
ing stop-gap arrangements, recruitment
by favoritism or the application of cer-
tain narrow geographical criteria to the
detriment of specific skill requirements,
absence of concern for orderly suc-
cession, the by-passing of the estab-
lished hierarchy via parallel cohorts of
‘co-ordinators,’ shadowy advisers and
grey eminences, junior officials vested
with mysterious personal powers, con-
sultants foisted on to divisions which
have neither asked for them nor know
how to employ them, arbitrary promo-
tions and so on.”
As a result of all this, Lengyel said he
believed that professional functionalism
and lines of authority in UNESCO were
“threatened with overall collapse.” Pro-
gramming, the execution of projects
and even the rendering of normal ser-
vices been “violated ... systematically
at all levels.”
Lengyel illustrated from his experi-
ence what he called “the process of de-
spoliation through the wilful destruc-
tion of professionalism at both the level
of programming and that of program
execution.”
This material is too detailed and
technical to quote in its entirety, though
it will be invaluable for those familiar
with issues and the circumstances. But
its flavor can be conveyed accurately by
some excerpts.
In the preparation of the second
medium-term plan (supposedly UN-
ESCO’s master plan for the next six
years), the drafting of texts for the social
science programs “was hastily accom-
plished principally by the hand-picked
caucus (excluding the majority of div-
ision directors and program specialists)
.. . the resulting material thus reflected
no broad participation of the sector’s
staff...” This experience led to the res-
ignation of the director and two other
officers of the Division of Human
Rights and Peace.
The result of these working methods
was that much of the plan “read as if
UNESCO had been afflicted with col-
lective amnesia: sentences are artlessly
stitched together with a careful eye to
low common denominators, the elabor-
ation of self-cancelling platitudes and
the enunciation of unsubstantiated as-
sertions ... an amateurish presentation
of this calibre can hardly command re-
spect in informed circles . . .”
Things got worse. Lengyel said that
“the draft program and budget for 1984-
85 was initially prepared in the social
science sector in an atmosphere of cyni-
cal hilarity. In pursuit of encourage-
ment from yourself (ie, the director-gen-
eral), all its members were to advance
‘imaginative’ suggestions ... in any
sphere at all in which the social sciences
were remotely implicated, irrespective
of professional specialisation, as of div-
Director-general M’Bow: under fire again


isional demarcation and hierarchies, in
a spirit of alleged ‘interdisciplinarity.’
The resulting scramble resembled a riot-
ous auction in which each participant
throws miscellaneous heirlooms up for
sale in the hope of attracting fabulous
bids, with wild speculation on budgets
sometimes running into hundreds of
thousands of dollars.”
Concerning his own editorial work,
Lengyel complained of the increasing
obstruction of basic editorial autonomy,
a great decline in the quality and punc-
tuality of translation and production
services and the running into heavy
deficit of a publications fund which
only a few years earlier had boasted
assets running into millions of dollars.
Lengyel told of the predicament of
the members of the secretariat which ex-
plained why the demoralisation which
was so evident had taken place: “Direc-
tors, some of whom cannot direct, while
others who could are paralysed by
unyielding centralisation of power; pro-
gram specialists whose expert advice is
ignored, financial and administrative
officials whose attempts to apply the
rules are regularly overridden, tech-
nicians deprived of tools, secretaries
enervated by recurrent panics, running
after multiple visas for routine corres-
pondence, antiquated equipment the
secretariat is at sixes and sevens. Mana-
gerial practices contravene the most el-
ementary principles...”
Lengyel ended by speaking of the re-
quirement for “the healing of the
wounds left not only by despoliation
and the destruction of professionalism
but also the re-establishment of confi-
dence among a staff atomised by sus-
picion and fear. For, if shared striving
after higher common goals is the cement
of solidarity, its dissolvent is assuredly
the classical colonialist strategem of
dividing in order to rule. The signs that
this strategem has been applied are
many ...”
Lengyel’s letter is moving as well as
informed. It is clearly written by a man
deeply distressed at seeing the organisa-
tion to which he has devoted his life
reduced to such a state. The conclusion
to which his critique points is inescap-
able: The “healing of the wounds” of
which he speaks requires the removal of
the leadership which has come close to
destroying UNESCO completely.
M’Bow, whom Australia’s Ambassa-
dor Gough Whitlam has defended so
eloquently, must go; that the far-reach-
ing changes required could be brought
about under his leadership is inconceiv-
able.
It is not known whether Whitlam in-
tends to make a return visit to the Can-
berra Press Club to explain that
Lengyel, despite his 30 years’ experi-
ence, does not know what he is talking
about. □

Priest warns that
Philippines is
ripe for revolution
Father Brian Gore with young parishioners: concerned about the future
By BRUCE STANNARD
FATHER BRIAN GORE has a grim
vision of the Philippines wracked by vi-
olent revolution and bloody civil war.
On the eve of his release after five
months in prison on multiple murder
charges, the Australian priest predicted
that the Marcos government’s decision
to “crush” his social reform movement
would fuel the conflict and play into the
hands of the Marxist guerillas of the
New People’s Army (NPA).
“It’s not Marxism that wins the
people over,” he said. “It’s pure, practi-
cal survival in a civil war situation. Aus-
tralians don’t seem to be aware of the
fact that we have a civil war situation in
the Philippines.
“It’s growing day by day into a full-
scale civil war. Filipino killing Filipino.
That’s what it means. There is a revol-
ution going on here. There is a revol-
utionary movement that is causing splits
between families right down the board.
You’re either on one side or the other.
And, inevitably, that situation is going
to get worse if the government con-
tinues to be repressive. We are looking
at the threat of the re-imposition of mar-
tial law. That’s one indication of how
serious things are. Another was Presi-
dent Marcos himself admitting that he
didn’t realise how strong the NPA is. He
has been fooled all along by the intelli-
gence people who have claimed they
have everything under control.
“The black-and-white mentality is
what dominates government thinking
in the Philippines. You’re either for
Marcos or you’re a communist. They
say you can’t be anywhere in between.
We are not communist but neither are
we anti-communist. That makes life
very difficult. For the vast majority of
people, that means they are pitched
headlong into a struggle they would
rather not be in.”
Gore had established a network of
Basic Chrisitian Communities (BCCs)
in his parish in the hills of Southern
Negros Island. These were meant to
promote Catholic church teachings and
encourage parishioners, most of them
poor farmers, to undertake practical
self-help projects and stand up for their
rights against abuses of power by mem-
bers of the security forces, local land-
owners and politicians. It was the suc-
cess of these BCCs in challenging the
almost feudal land ownership system
which Gore believes led to trumped-up
charges of murder against him.
“Basically what this case has been
able to show is that, even if you have a
battery of lawyers, even if you have a lot
of support international and local
even if you have a reasonable amount of
money, it is still an uphill battle to try
and get basic justice in the Philippines.
It’s a real struggle and we are saying:
‘What about the ordinary poor person?’
There are a lot of innocent people here
in jail. We know that. But, once you’re
thrown in jail here, it’s very hard to get
out.”
Gore said the BCCs could now be
used by the NPA as a ready-made grass-
roots organisation in their armed


struggle against the Marcos regime.
“That,” he said, “all depends on the
government. If the forces here become
very repressive they will leave the
people with no other choice. Given no
other, choice, you cannot blame the
people for making a decision for their
own safety and their own future. The
policy of the BCCs is one of dialogue.
They live in the same areas as the NPA.
They have to come to some sort of
modus vivendi. It’s all very well for the
military to say the people cannot have
anything to do with the NPA. The truth
is that the NPA treat the people very
well. What convinces the people is not
the ideology of Marxism; it’s the practi-
cal way in which they are respected and
protected by the NPA. That’s what’s
happening all over the country. The
credibility of the NPA is generally very
high.”
Gore said: “Australians have to
understand the feudal nature of society
here. My parishioners, the workers and
the peasants regard themselves as being
in the same position as medieval serfs
as the goods and chattels of the land-
owners. From the womb to the tomb,
people regarded themselves as being the
possessions of the haciendas. They re-
ferred to themselves using the term
‘ sakup ’ which translates as ‘possession’.
These people depended on the goodwill
of the landlord for everything, even
baptisms and marriages.
“They referred to themselves using
the word ‘ tao ’ literally ‘I am the per-
son of Mr so and so.’ They identified
themselves as belonging to the owners
of the land they worked.
“Father (Niall) O’Brien and I were
working in an area where you had small
farmers, many of them who had fled the
haciendas, into the mountains, cleared
small bits of land which was now in
danger of being taken away from them
because they had no legal status. If they
had been working a good piece of land,
there was always the danger of some
rich person applying to the Bureau of
Lands for title and coming up with a fait
accompli. That’s when the military were
brought in to enforce the ejection of
those people. The Christian communi-
ties were able to organise people and in
my parish, Oringao, we were able to
stop all the land-grabbing.
“We were a threat to the feudal na-
ture of society here. That’s the way we
were perceived by the landlords and the
military. What we were advocating was
a change in the whole social structure.
That was nothing short of revolution in
their eyes but we were trying to show
that change doesn’t necessarily have to
come through bloody revolution. We
were advocating radical change but a
non-violent change. The irony is that
they felt more threatened by our non-
violent change. The military is equipped
to handle violence. They’ve got the mili-
tary hardware, the helicopters, to deal
with a guerilla-style confrontation but
passive resistance was something that
really threw them.
“They just don’t know how to deal
with situations in which people through
their numbers and their determination
band together, protest and stand up to
contradict them when there are viol-
ations of human rights.”
A local priest meets members of the New People’s Army: there is a no-man’s-land
Gore said there was an inevitability
about the growth of violence. “Sadly,”
he said, “I have to say that once people
like us who were for non-violence
are crushed and pushed out of the way,
the rebels are going to harden in the
view that armed struggle is the only al-
ternative. We hoped that, if the church
in the Philippines had really got its act
together behind the Basic Christian
Communities theology, we could have
had a tremendous impact. We could
have harnessed all the non-violent
forces and made it a viable alternative.
But now, no. It’s precisely because we
were successful in a small area that they
were out to crush us. You can say that
the government has had a victory in get-
ting rid of us. It’s a victory for viol-
ence.”
Although the Pope has recently
spoken out strongly against priests who
involve themselves in “the theology of
liberation” in Third World countries,
Gore conceded that that was precisely
what he had been preaching and
practicing in the Philippines for the past
16 years.
“We were waging a form of revol-
ution. It was revolution in the sense that
we were asking for radical social
change. Social, cultural, even religious
structures were being challenged. A lot
of people were threatened, not only the
government. Church people, all people
are threatened by radical change.
“The theology of liberation is cer-
tainly not identified with revolution in
the sense of armed struggle. It’s a theol-
ogy which basically tries to bring recon-
ciliation between landlord and peasant.
The Marxist ideology is much
more into class struggle which
brings about friction and the
annihilation of one group.
That’s where the people say:
‘the only way we’re going to
get anywhere with these land-
lords is to kill them.’ That was
not on as far as we were con-
cerned.
“When 5 percent of the
people own 60 percent of the
wealth that is an unjust struc-
ture and it should be changed
so that there is much more
equal distribution.
“The saddest part is that,
now that our non-violent
movement has been
effectively crushed, the whole
situation is going to go viol-
ent. We are already seeing the
growing dissatisfaction of
people that the government is
not able to deliver the goods.
The economic situation is get-
ting appalling so things are
gradually degenerating. There
will be a lot of violence and a
lot of unrest.” □


PICKERING’S WEEK


THE DOLLAR
Keating
stays on the
sideline
The jagged fluctuations of the $A against the $US and the trade weighted index
By RICHARD FARMER
AS FEDERAL Treasurer Paul Keating
watches the gyrations of the Australian
dollar exchange rate he is more con-
vinced than ever that floatng the
currency is the right thing to do. The
market forces which Keating unleashed
with his float decision last December
certainly have led the dollar a merry
dance. But there are no im-
mediate government plans to
intervene in the market to iron
out the sharp daily move-
ments.
Back in December, an
Australian dollar bought
about 90.5 United States
cents. It dropped within days
to about 87 cents, rallied in
March to more than 96 and
plunged last week to just
above 85.
Changes of that order
under the old system of ex-
change rates fixed by the
government would have seen
the Treasurer defending him-
self from political opponents
demanding explanation of the
reasons for revaluation or
devaluation. Under the
current system, Keating has
been getting away with a
shrug of the shoulders and a
defence of the free market.
Underlying the calm
response of the government
and its advisers to the latest devaluation
against the US dollar is the belief that
the situation will correct itself.
The Australian currency is not the
only one to have suffered as rising US
interest rates caused by that country’s
budget deficit force its dollar’s value up.
Australian Treasury officials are confi-
dent that whoever wins the US pre-
sidential elections in November will be
forced to tackle the deficit problem very
early in his term. Signs that the deficit
was being curbed would encourage US
interest rates to fall and the value of the
US dollar to fall with them.
In the short term, there are even
some advantages flowing from the
Australian dollar’s weakness. It will
result in greater profits for
exporters while commodity
prices remain at low levels.
Local manufacturers are effec-
tively receiving more protec-
tion from imports. The
government can see little
wrong with either of those
effects at this stage of the
country’s economic recovery.
The risk for the Australian
Government is that increased
protection will work its way
through to higher prices on
the local market. Combined
with higher prices for
imported goods, a potential
exists for a jump in the Con-
sumer Price Index which
automatically would work its
way through indexation into
higher wages.
Keating is gambling that
the assessment that the
Australian dollar’s value will
rise after the US election is correct. In
the meantime, the expectation is that
importers will be reluctant to increase
prices they believe will come down
again within a few months.
Despite the economic recovery of the
past 12 months, demand is still slack
with a lot of under-used resources. The
hope is that this climate will make it
hard for companies to pass on price
increases.
There is an appreciation within the
government that the sharp daily move-
ments in the exchange rate are creating
difficulties for both importers and ex-
porters. The judgement of when to buy
and sell a currency is one that gives not
only the professionals in the foreign


Sir Robert Sparkes and Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen: a long-term plan to beat Hawke
exchange market problems. Australian
company treasurers have had little ex-
perience to prepare them for the kind of
decisions they now have to make. It is
not merely a matter of deciding on
which week or day to make foreign
business transactions but in which hour!
Jumps of 2 percent within a single day’s
trading were the norm last week and
amount to a considerable difference on,
say, a shipment of 100,000 tonnes of
coal.
Keating has heard some suggestions
that he should encourage the Reserve
Bank to become more interventionist in
the market to smooth out at least these
daily fluctuations. He has chosen so far
not to do so but is relying on the extra
foreign exchange dealers recently ap-
pointed to give the market more depth.
Having embarked on a policy of de-
regulating the financial markets,
Keating will only very reluctantly begin
intervening. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Equal split
for, against
assets test
AUSTRALIANS are divided equally in
their attitudes toward the assets test for
pensioners, according to the Morgan
Gallup Poll.
In this Australia-wide survey, 2115
people aged 14 and over were told that
the Federal Government was going to
apply an assets test to decide the level of
pension. People were then asked: “Do
you agree or disagree with the assets test
for pensioners?”
Of all people surveyed, 45 percent
agreed with the test, 45 percent dis-
agreed and 10 percent were undecided.

QUEENSLAND
A National looks
at politics
without Joh
By DENIS REINHARDT
FOR YEARS, correspondents have
been writing of the impending depar-
ture or even downfall of Sir Johannes
Bjelke-Petersen. When plain Joh took
his KCMG last month it was taken as
his swan song. But the premier con-
tinues to tell confidantes he wants to be
around for the bicentenary.
Nevertheless there is a strong school
of thought within the Queensland
Nationals that contingency plans have
to be made for Sir Joh’s departure be-
fore then. Party president Sir Robert
Sparkes is a subscriber. A fear widely
held in this school is that Sir Joh may
leave the door agape when he departs.
One member told The Bulletin: “He
has an ego and he believes that it is he
and not the National Party which rules.
When he goes, he goes, he wants that to
be seen by history.”
Sparkes appears to have this in mind
with a plan for a new national conserva-
tive party, but his plan does not neces-
sarily coincide with the groundswell of
conservatism which the Queensland
premier and one of his former Liberal
ministers, Charles Porter, have recently
tried to promote.

Toyota Land Cruiser...because you never know.
It doesn’t matter if you’re out
driving for work or for pleasure, you
never know when the elements may
decide to test your vehicle.
That’s why you need Toyota Land-
Cruiser - the toughest 4WD on earth.
Put it up against snow, sand,
rock, streams, in fact anything else
you care to name. It’s as much a part
of this country as the kangaroo.
Over 100,000 Land Cruisers have
been sold in Australia since Sir Leslie
Thiess brought the first ones in to
help build the Snowy Mountains Hydro-
Electric project.
Wherever there’s rugged work to
be done you see Toyota Land Cruisers.
They’re used in Australia’s
Antarctic Territory, by police, the Army,
bush fire brigades, geologists, foresters.
Farmers wouldn’t rely on anything else.
There are 14 models, from the
luxurious station wagon to the military-
style LX hardtop.
See your Toyota dealer for a test

beard the Queensland premier in mo-
ments of crisis, Sparkes believes that
only the creation of a new conservative
party in Australia will prevent decades
of Labor rule. Elements of the Queens-
land National Party want to draft
Sparkes, party president since 1970, into
leading a full scale campaign among
Liberals and Nationals.
Sparkes, 55, a Darling Downs gra-
zier, shire chairman and intellectual ar-
chitect of the decade-long transform-
ation of an agrarian socialist club into
the all-conquering National Party of
Australia (Qld) does not contemplate
the task lightly.
Ironically Sparkes theorises, it will
become easier with a landslide defeat of
Andrew Peacock and lan Sinclair at the
next federal election.
Sparkes is little known to the public
outside Queensland. He is both liked
and, which is more important, highly re-
spected by key Liberals who see the in-
evitability of some post-federal election
settlement between the two parties.
Despite the expulsion of the Queens-
land Liberals from cabinet and their re-
duction to a parliamentary rump, the
Liberal state president, John Moore,
would find Sparkes an acceptable work-
ing partner, whatever might at present
be said for the benefit of party faithful.
Sparkes’ gameplan is simple, as ex-
plained to The Bulletin last week. He
said: “We cannot be exactly sure how
things will develop federally, but it
would seem there are three options.”
The first is for the two parties of the
right to persevere with the status quo
which, says Sparkes, is a path of folly.
The key election, Sparkes calculates,
is not the next, which he is convinced
will be this year, but the 1987 poll. He
says: “If the conservative parties
haven’t got their act together in time for
1987, Hawke will be around for a long
time unless there’s another Khemlani.”
The second option is full amalga-
mation, which Sparkes argues, will be
organisationally impossible because of
the federal nature of the Liberal and
National parties.
The third option, creation of a new
conservative party, “which would later
be joined by members of the present
two parties” appeals to Sparkes. He
says: “It may be that the creation of a
new political party might have less
structural difficulties than all the at-
tendent hassles of two party organisa-
tions wanting to have a say”
“If we erect a new political structure,
say ‘The Australian Conservative Party’
then people can come and join us and
the others will wither and fade away.”
There have, according to National
Party sources, already been tenuous
negotiations with federal Liberal lead-
ers, but these have now been deferred
until after the federal elections. □

WORKERS’ COMPENSATION
The no-win
dilemma of
insurance costs
By TIM DUNCAN
VICTORIA is at reviewing its intoler-
ably expensive workers’ compensation
system. But so many sectional interests
are involved that neither the govern-
ment nor the opposition can advocate
reform which does not bring with it pol-
itically inconvenient trade-offs.
Each of the players has something to
lose and none can be sure that they and
not competing interests, would gain.
First, the government. Nearly a year
ago, it commissioned the Cooney en-
quiry into workers’ compensation ar-
rangements in the state. Conceived to
run for three months, the committee
chaired by labor lawyer Bernie Cooney
came in with split findings after 11
months. The government is unhappy
with the line of the Cooney majority
and, maintaining the spirit of consulta-
tion, last week set up yet another com-
mittee with which to consult on the
findings.
It seems that there were oversights in
the composition and, thus, the reliabil-
ity of the Cooney committee. Its ma-
jority recommended that the system of
private and forward-funded workers’
compensation insurance should remain,
albeit with fine tuning. A minority of
two, including Cooney, argued that the
current system should be scrapped and
replaced with a “pay as you go” one
that is, a centrally-administered single
fund which would raise insurance pre-
miums in line with accident claims.
The difference has significance well
beyond the arcane world of pro-
babilities and actuarial symmetry. A
funded system, such as Victoria has
been suffering, is expensive but the ben-
efits are satisfactory as far as the unions
are concerned and there is the certainty
that future liabilities are covered.
An unfunded system is cheaper in
the short term: For the first year’s oper-
ation of an unfunded system, employers
may save up to two-thirds of their cur-
rent premiums. But the difference is that
they would not be paying for future
claims that arise out of this first year. As
they began to pay for accrued claims
arising out of past years, their premiums
would have to rise. After about five
years, the premiums would approach
what the employers are paying now.
The political advantage is in the first
five years. If the Cain government in-
troduced an unfunded system, it could
save Victorian employers overnight up
to $4OO million in premiums. It fore-
shadowed such a move in its 10-year
strategy, The Next Step, which argued
that workers’ compensation was an
avoidable on-cost and that it would
grapple with the problem after the
Cooney report was tabled.
Unhappily for the government, the
committee went the other way. It did so
for the obvious reason that those
involved in workers’ compensation
insurers, unions, lawyers and doctors
are doing very well out of it. The com-
mittee did so as well for the less obvious
reason that a switch to an unfunded sys-
tem would solve nothing beyond the
short term if benefits to workers were to
be maintained.
For political reasons, the govern-
ment is not prepared to confront either
the unions or the labor lawyers.
According to Premier John Cain, the
level of benefits to workers is not negoti-
able; it will remain.
The position of the labor lawyers is
less clear but, since the unions want
lump-sum settlements and access to
common law claims to continue
which, in turn, enable double-dipping
on compensation and social security
payments it is likely that the adver-

sary system of claims settlement also
will continue.
Labor lawyers in Victoria are so
wholly enmeshed in union affairs that
the interests of the one are generally
considered to be those of both.
Nevertheless, the government is still
in a dilemma. Total workers' compensa-
tion insurance income now amounts to
about $6OO million. The government is
desperately short of money. Indeed,
things are so tight that Victorians are
still being reminded of the state budget
shortfall due to High Court invalidation
of its Bass Straight pipeline levy. Its
taxes and charges have shot out of line
with other states because the
government has been unwill-
ing to control spending pro-
grams.
Control of the workers’
compensation premium in-
come, if the government
wanted it, might for a couple
of years take the pressure off
state revenues.
On the other hand, Cain
has made a powerful commit-
ment to the doctrine of The
Next Step.
Released this year and ad-
vertised regularly throughout
Australia ever since, The Next
Step is not just an economic
strategy it is also an elec-
toral strategy. It offers voters a
vision of a party intent on
confronting the structural
problems of the Victorian
economy.
The workers’ compensa-
tion scene is the first major
test of the credibility of Tlie
Next Step. A sharp drop in
premiums next to the gov-
ernment’s taxes and charges,
the chief contributors to Vic-
toria’s burgeoning labor on-
costs certainly would put out critics
intent on persuading the electorate that
the government is not interested in the
problems of employers.
Cain has made no secret of his favor-
ing a state takeover of workers’ com-
pensation insurance. The short-term
gains whether in the form of in-
creased state borrowing capacity or of
reduced costs to employers are unde-
niable. A premium freeze at current
levels would give the government im-
mediate access to most of the invest-
ment income of the industry. A drop in
premiums, in line with the significantly
lower liabilities of the first year of oper-
ation of an unfunded scheme, would
take the pressure off employers immedi-
ately.
Workers' compensation in Victoria
has become so expensive largely be-
cause the level of claims has grown so
quickly. The growth of claims is to some
extent determined by industrial safety
(or lack of it) but mainly by the rate of
unemployment and the occupational
composition of the workforce,
In times of high unemployment,
when employers can pick labor from a
large pool, it is much harder to get an
injured worker back into a job. This is
compounded if, as in recent times, the
economy offers fewer skilled workers
fewer opportunities for work. General-
ly, it is the traditional industries pri-
mary manufacturing and construction
whose labor requirements have been
contracting. These are the industries in
which most claims originate.
Premier Cain: state takeover favored
Current conditions impose tremen-
dous pressures on workers injured in
the traditional industries to maximise
their claims. If they can’t find other jobs
they have no choice.
Under the forward-funded system,
the traditional industries are at least
charged for future costs. Under a single
unfunded system, premium payers
would be financing the claims that arise
from the accidents of the past. Safer
sunrise industries would be financing
the claims of the declining ones.
The Next Step dedicated much of its
attention to the need for Victoria to de-
velop a sunrise economy. It would be
unhappy irony if the electoral appeal of
The Next Step, of which initially
cheaper and unfunded workers’ com-
pensation would be a part, were to over-
shadow the more fundamental need
also outlined in The Next Step for the
economy to restructure. □
DEFENCE
Good omens
behind the veil
of secrecy
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE DEPARTMENT OF Defence last
week lifted the curtain of secrecy that
for decades has cloaked the Defence
Research Centre at Salisbury, north of
Adelaide and the glimpses which re-
porters had of work under way point to
good news for Australia.
Scientists and engineers at Salisbury
and also at the related Aeronautical Re-
search Laboratory near Melbourne
have invented and patented a new auto-
matic pilot system that is so cheap it can
be classed as “throwaway” for use in
rockets. It uses a completely new prin-
ciple. When it comes off the secret list, it
could well be used in such booming
fields as ultralight aviation.
■ Project Winnin, the hovering rock-
et decoy designed to entice missiles
away from ship targets, is arousing in-
tense interest in the United States and,
although it’s early days, could well go
into mass production within a few
years. The Australians invented the hov-
er-rocket principle which is the key to
the system.
■ Jindalee, the over-the-horizon
radar located near Alice Springs, which
can track ships and aeroplanes thou-
sands of kilometres out into the Indian
Ocean has passed its “hands-on” trials
with flying colors. It is going into a final
development phase but looks certain to
give Australia the surveillance eyes it
needs over our north-western ap-
proaches.
A visiting press party the first
invited to the closely-guarded Defence
Science and Technology Organisation
(DSTO) complex in recent years also
saw scores of other projects involving
weapons, communications, submarine
detection and aircraft development
which will enhance Australia’s defence
capabilities greatly.
At meetings attended by senior staff
of the three laboratories, some of the
country’s leading scientists and engin-
eers spoke frankly about the frustra-
tions of working on secret projects
many of which do not come to fruition
and also about their disappointment
that many of their inventions don’t
eventually benefit either local industry
or the nation’s export earnings.
The new style in the DSTO reflects
major changes both at Canberra head-
quarters and in Salisbury in recent
years. Of concern to the professional
staff is that the proportion of the de

fence budget allotted to re-
search and development has
fallen sharply.
There is now a determina-
tion to make public many of
the achievements of the or-
ganisation and in particular
the laboratories, about
which the defence estab-
lishment has been reticent.
Of the major projects,
Winnin is the one at the criti-
cal stage.
The Salisbury groups have
proved the rocket propulsion
system which allows Winnin
to be launched from a ship
under direct threat of missile
attack. The rocket goes into a
hover and moves away at a
speed comparable to that of
the ship. The decoy’s electron-
ics pick up the radar search
signals of an in-coming mis-
sile and relay them back so
that they are much stronger
than the reflections from the
ship. The missile is tricked
into tracking the expendable rocket
rather than the ship.
The key to the system is an electronic
device, called a travelling wave tube,
which picks up the radar transmissions
and copies them back. These are ex-
The Defence Research Centre’s hovering rocket under test
tremely expensive. However, both Aus-
tralian and American engineers believe
that the price of the electronic com-
ponents will fall if a hover-rocket such
as Winnin is put into mass production.
The new auto-pilot was also devel-
oped for Winnin it is the
key to the rocket’s hovering
ability. Mass production
would also be needed to get
the price down to where it,
like the rocket, would be re-
garded as expendable.
It is this numbers game
which prevents Australia from
going ahead with the develop-
ment and production of
Winnin. Our fleet is so small
that the numbers required are
not big enough to achieve the
falls in prices for individual
components.
If, however, the Americans
(or some other major power)
took it up, the combined or-
ders probably would do the
trick.
Eight United States navy
experts have been in Australia
studying Winnin in the past
few weeks and three Austra-
lians from Salisbury are in the
US briefing the US navy on
the concept further.
The Americans have made a major
move toward the idea. They accept that
a hover-rocket is the best way to decoy
missiles such as Harpoon and Exocet
away from surface ships. If they do not
take advantage of the technology which
Australia has developed over years in
this field, they will have to reinvent it.
Our other major project Jindalee
has also reached a most encouraging
stage. The Royal Australian Air Force,
which will operate the radar as part of
the nation’s air defence system, tried it
out with conventional radar operators
over some months. Although the system
is very different from normal radar and
involves much higher technology, oper-
ators picked up the skills quickly and
turned in performances comparable to
those of the highly-qualified engineers
who have been developing Jindalee for
years.
The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Mar-
shal David Evans, reportedly tracked
aircraft himself after only a short period
of instruction.
Jindalee works by bouncing high-fre-
quency radio waves off the ionospheric
layer some 300 to 400 km above the
Earth’s surface. The signals are reflected
back from ships and aircraft and return
via the ionosphere to sensitive receivers.
The very weak returns are then pro-
cessed on high-speed computers to yield
target information.
As a result, the computer software is
a major part of Jindalee and this has
gone into a final phase of development.
When the system is finally cleared
and the decision taken to use it oper-
ationally, $2O million or so will need to
be spent to turn the sites into operation-
al bases and upgrade the equipment. □

METEOROLOGY
Why the winter
rains are
running late
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
LATE LAST month dust shrouded the
wide streets of Adelaide. And at the
start of the skiing season, the only thing
missing was snow. Over thousands of
square kilometres of south-eastern Aus-
tralia, grain farmers waited for rain to
begin sowing the 84-85 crops, the return
from which will aid the farm sector’s
contribution to national economic re-
covery.
In Melbourne last week, meteoro-
logical scientists were getting ready to
issue a climate report which
warned of the possibility of a
new drought.
In Canberra, the acting
executive director of the Na-
tional Farmers’ Federation,
Andrew Robb, tried to temper
the growing apprehension
with a soothing statement:
“Don’t panic,” Robb said.
“Lots of seasons start like this.
Some turn out to be excellent
and others bad. What we need
now is rain — not much. An
inch or so should allow plant-
ing to get under way. Then
we’ll be looking for follow-up
falls, of course. But it’s too
early now to start talking
about drought.”
The facts are:
■ After last year’s good
falls, there is still good sub-
surface moisture in most of
Australia’s agricultural areas.
■ But the long drought
which ended in 1983 caused
damage to land in many parts
of the country. The top soil
and sand which was blown
around during the drought
still hasn’t stabilised and it
was this dust that blanketed
Adelaide a few days ago.
■ Some parts of Australia
have had good rains. Western
Australia has been one and
the north-west of NSW, from
roughly Moree and Walgett
into southern Queensland, is
another. It got a good start
from falls in mid-June.
■ Perhaps most important-
ly, the causes of the present
shortfalls of rain and the late
start to the winter season bear
no relation to the appearance
of the South American cur-
rent, El Nino, and the massive global
weather event called the southern oscil-
lation which lay behind the last drought
and the Pacific basin weather disturb-
ances.
In the opinion of some weather-men
(and meteorology remains an imprecise
science because of lack of knowledge),
the event governing 1984’s weather con-
tains the seeds of self-correction and
could change to allow good rains in late
July over much of southern Australia.
But the trouble is that the weather
scientists are working in the dark. A few
months ago the Japanese synchronous
weather satellite stationed north of New
Guinea went on the blink, just when we
needed it most.
The satellite scanned the area from
Australia north to east Asia in which the
present climatic pattern is developing.
Without it, it is hard to measure the de-
gree of the present perturbation and to
pick when and if it is about to alter to a
normal pattern.
In recent months, Australian scien-
tists have argued for greater national
participation in weather and other satel-
lites. The present situation is a compel-
ling argument for involvement in space
sensors that can monitor the movements
of the vast temperature and wind
changes that make our weather and also
the effects of this weather on Australia
itself. Without them we are to a large
extent guessing about global events that
have a massive impact on our economy.
The present problem lies in a north-
south atmospheric movement that
crosses the equator and relates to high
sea temperatures which are being re-
corded in the South China Sea, north of
Indonesia’s Kalimantan and south of
Hong Kong.
Although the South China Sea tem-
peratures are probably only one or two

An ordinary personal computer that
handles one person at one time is fine - if
you want to operate like a one-man band.
However, your
performance
suffers.
That’s why
we have developed ICL
multi-user microcomputer
systems.
ICL computers bring
people together by
letting them share
their information
whilst working
on a number of separate
functions at ;he same time.
For instance, the ICL Personal
Computer handles not one, but
four people at once, without
waiting or confusion.
And it doesn’t stop there.
As your business performs
better together, it will probably
grow. So ICL have a whole range of
microcomputer systems to take
kdu into the future - like the brand new ‘ICL Clan’
that handles up to sixteen operators at once,
without loss of power.
ICL’s experience in mainframes has made us
Europe’s leading, and one of
Australia’s major, computer
companies. (We began
operating here
in 1921.) And
it’s that expertise
that ICL have brought
to the field of multi-user
micro-computers.

degrees higher than normal,
the coincidence of this with
the northern summer means
that much more air than nor-
mal is being warmed and
thrust into the upper atmos-
phere. The inter-tropic de-
pression acts as a barrier to
this air flowing north so it
arches south (see page 43).
As moist air rises and pre-
cipitates rain in the northern
monsoon, it cools and dries
out. The cool dry air has to
descend and the present
atmospheric system means
that it is flowing into south-
eastern Australia, creating the
series of high pressure systems
that have dominated our
weather in recent weeks.
As newspaper and tele-
vision weather maps show, the
same succession of rain-bear-
ing fronts springing from de-
pressions to the south of Aus-
tralia march around the globe
in the southern latitudes. The
high-pressure systems, result-
ing from the outpouring of
colder, down-flowing air,
shoulder the rain-bearing
fronts southwards so they
miss the mainland. Conse-
quently there is no rain, no
snow and the growing threat
of drought.
The meteorologists who
are studying the situation,
however, believe that it is to
some extent self-correcting,
unlike the east-west oscilla-
tion which the El Nino phase
brought about.
As the season changes and
the sun appears to move
southwards again, leading
into spring and the southern
summer, the heat engine of
the South China Sea will be-
gin to moderate. The upward
air flows north of Australia
will ease off and, hopefully,
stop. And the subsidence of
the cooled air over mainland
Australia will taper off, allowing the
frontal systems to strike north.
If the weather sequence develops
along these lines, we should be seeing
rain in the next few weeks, which should
be within the farmers’ deadline that
Robb outlined.
Hundreds of millions, perhaps bil-
lions, of dollars are at stake.
The main area in doubt is the south-
western wheat belt, stretching from the
south-west slopes of NSW, across the
Riverina, into Victoria’s Wimmera and
Mallee regions and across the middle of
South Australia.
In this region, farmers need a solid
Drought reminder: a mid-afternoon dust storm shrouds Adelaide’s St Peter’s cathedral
fall of rain within a month so they can
use the moist topsoil to sow seed grain.
The grain has to be planted ready for
the warmer weather to germinate it. It
will # then need the follow-up rains of
late winter and spring to help it grow.
There is a limit to how late the grain
can be sown. In a good season, the
plants have plenty of time to mature
and produce good heads for a heavy
crop. But if sowing and development is
late, the onset of high summer tempera-
tures dries the plants off with the grain
only partly developed before it ripens.
This leads to a smaller harvest.
Every week from now on means a
cutback in estimates for major grain
crops from this region next season, as
would also the absence of follow-up
rains in the growing season,
If the meteorological hunches are
right and the north-south atmospheric
flow eases off into a more normal pat-
tern, the rains will come and crops and
stock will prosper.
If, however, the winter rain pattern
in the southern states fails to develop,
we could be looking at the onset of an-
other drought.
One thing is sure: if ever we needed
an eye in the sky to monitor these
events, it is now. □

PROSTITUTION
Sounding the
drums of
Kaigoorlie
Two NS Wparliamentarians embark this
month on a fact-finding tour of the mas-
sage parlors and brothels of Australia
and Europe, as part of an inquiry into
prostitution. DA VID HASELHURST
reveals what they can expect of Kalgoor-
lie’s Hay Street despite the shooting and
fire which destroyed one bordello last
week.
WHEN THE NSW politicians in-
vestigating prostitution visit Kalgoor-
lie’s celebrated red light district this
month, they can expect no favors. The
madams are very chary about this
further visit upon their street of
whorehouses. They don’t like nosey out-
siders on the West Australian goldfields
But Kalgoorlie’s mayor, Ray Finlay-
son, told The Bulletin that he would
have no hesitation in introducing the
visitors to Kalgoorlie’s brothel-owners
provided that the politicians first as-
sured him that they were not there to
ridicule Kalgoorlie or its way of life.
“I have the greatest respect for our
madams,” he said. “It’s not an easy job
they have, you know.”
Finlayson was speaking from the bar
of Kalgoorlie’s Hannan’s Club, water-
ing-hole for mine executives, business
and professional men on the goldfields.
The club, with its well-watered bowling
greens and neat garden, is on Brookman
Street. From the front gate, one can
look west to where respectable Brook-
man ends at an intersection and be-
comes Hay Street on the other side.
For 300 metres along either side of
the road straggle the “drums” a col-
lection of single-storey houses, most
with frontages resembling horse boxes.
The stall doors open at night and, under
colored lights, a girl in each box dis-
plays her allure to the passing trade.
Prospective customers make their in-
quiries and a tourist bus or a paddy
wagon slowly cruises the street every
now and then.
Five madams dominate the business
along Hay Street, to which the district
trade is confined.
Mona Maxwell’s Mexican-style haci-
enda El Casa del Sol is probably
the best-known establishment. It has
been featured in advertisements as
having “the biggest in-ground swim-
ming pool on the eastern goldfields.”
Mona began her career in “the game”
when she arrived from Europe in 1938
and went to work in Perth’s once-no-
torious Roe Street. She has plied her


trade in Kalgoorlie for 26
years and every year hostesses
one of the biggest parties in
town when 400 ticket-buying
guests attend her charity fund-
raising turn in the brothel gar-
dens during the racing round.
They drink champagne and
scoff oysters and barbecued
steaks under a candy-striped
marquee set amid the jacar-
andas and trellised vines. A
player piano, juke box and
visiting band provide the
more public entertainment.
Now 83, Mona has her
bordello on the market for a
reputed $lBO,OOO according
to police sources.
The most modern estab-
lishment is (or was) Irene’s
place, across the road from
Mona’s. Last weekend, sever-
al people were wounded and
killed in a shooting and
suicide after which Irene’s
sturdy cream brick house with
its nine street-front stalls was
gutted in a fire.
The other madams
Stella, Marlene and Sue op-
erate out of more traditional corrugated
iron bungalows.
Although prostitution is officially il-
legal in Western Australia, it has been
tolerated in Kalgoorlie for decades with
a set of unwritten rules that are broadly
observed and understood by the
madams, the council, the community
and the police.
No local girls are employed. The
girls must steer clear of public places.
Health inspectors regularly check the
houses and a local doctor checks the
girls every Monday.
“They all have to have a clean card,”
said Finlayson. “None of this would
work, of course, without tolerance. We
have an enormous tolerance in this
town. If it were not for that tolerance
and the tolerance of the police they
wouldn’t exist.
“There are conventions. They may
not visit hotels, for instance they
might run into a man when he is with
his wife.
“But, of course, if they went in, they
wouldn’t be refused a drink. Most
people wouldn’t know them because
they don’t appear generally in public.
“They may not go to the races or any
public concerts. But it means more that
they are not expected to if they went,
they would not be refused admission.
The madams wouldn’t allow them, any-
way. Any hanky-panky and they’re out
of town otherwise the police leave
them alone unless they play up.”
As a result of that system, the mayor
is pleased to report: “We have no sol-
iciting in the town no need for it.”
Mayor Ray Finlayson: respect for madams
WEST AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPERS
The police do make their occasional
“pinch,” however. It tends to happen
after press reports draw attention to the
street and authorities in Perth decide it’s
time to show some discipline.
Mona last went off in December 1983
when she was charged under her real
name, Lucy Domingo, and fined $2OO
for having been the keeper of a brothel.
Perth newspapers headlined the raid:
“Madam Mona mad over arrest” and
“SM has scared brothel veteran.”
Magistrate Richard Bromfield stern-
ly warned Mona that, should she appear
in court again on similar charges, he
would send her to jail.
Mona later told reporters that she
did not know why she had been charged
it was the first such charge she had
faced for five years. “I have always kept
to the rules which the police lay down,”
she told the Perth Daily News. “Usually
the police come down and speak to us
about how we are going but this time
they didn’t. They rang me when I was in
bed. They told me to get dressed and get
my girls up and dressed. I thought it was
going to be their normal inspection.
“People who have a say in running
this town are going to find out why I
was charged. I have been waiting to see
if they treat the other houses the same.”
The newspaper quoted a senior
police officer as saying: “Brothels here
go off from time to time when the evi-
dence is available. The days are still
early concerning the other brothels.”
It was a late Saturday night when
The Bulletin visited Hay Street. A cold
moon stared down out of the clear win-
ter sky as the temperature slipped to one
degree above freezing.
In the stalls that were still open, the
girls sat in their cane chairs with two or
three radiators each. The stalls are
about two metres wide by 2.5 metres
deep, barely furnished, with a few sexy
posters and colored lights. They are the
shop windows through which the cus-
tomers enter a carpeted hallway.
In the centre of the house is a large,
eat-in kitchen. Irene is out to dinner
with friends at the Sandalwood Motel.
At the table is her acting madam,
Thelma, dispensing cans of beer to two
or three waiting patrons.
Only four girls are on tonight but
they are all busy. In the entire street, we
were told, only 13 girls were at work. It’s
the quiet time of the year and too cold
to tempt out many customers.
Next month, however, when the
Mona Maxwell, 83, in the garden of her “house”: in “the game” for 46 years


August racing round starts, the street
will be booming with more than 40 girls
accommodating the needs of the punt-
ers and playboys. The busy time then
runs through to Christmas when it goes
quiet for a month or so and picks up
again until Easter.
Two tax inspectors are in town and
the girls are most unwilling to talk about
their earnings. But a hard-working girl
should easily net more than $lOOO a
week in the good times.
The madam has a catalogue of stan-
dard prices: $25 for 15 minutes straight
sex; $4O for 15 minutes with “half-
French”; $5O for 20 minutes with half-
French; $lOO for an hour with the lot
and an extra $2O for a spa afterwards.
An all-nighter runs to $250 with a hot
breakfast at 8.30 am. But the all-nighter
doesn’t start till 1.30 am and not until
2.30 on Friday and Saturday nights.
A cartoon on one wall has a sleepy
girl saying: “I’d like the day better if it
started later.” Another cartoon has a
pussycat sniffing a sleeping dog. The
caption reads: “Some people have no
respect for slow risers.”
A young man suggests to the madam
that he’d like a gentle girl for an all-
nighter. She suggests Samantha, a good-
looker of about 22 summers from New
Zealand. She has just finished a job. She
takes him to her room.
All 10 bedrooms are basically the
same about 3 metres by 4, with king-
sized bed, stereo-player, washbasin,
wardrobe, vinyl-covered bar and a
drinks fridge. On the dresser is a kitchen
timer clock.
For short-time customers the alarm
rings five minutes before the end of the
game so the player knows he is in “time-
on.”
Samantha returns to the sitting-room
in a negligee after five minutes. Her cus-
tomer has only $236. His mates chip in
the other $l4.
Thelma will be pleased to see the end
of a long night. Tomorrow, the “house”
is going on a picnic 80km east of Kal-
goorlie where one of their woman
friends has a small gold show.
Thelma says that nobody in the street
wants to talk to the NSW politicians
when they arrive. “But, if they don’t say
who they are, we’ll take them on just
like the rest,” she adds “They wouldn’t
learn much from our girls, however
our girls only talk about sex.”
The last waiting customers are bed-
ded down and the hard word is put on
your Bulletin correspondent who has so
far contributed nothing to the bordello’s
bank account. But, would you believe
in the fine traditions of those old Truth
reporters who long ago filed their last
editions I can relate that, having com-
pleted my inquiries, I made my excuses
and left? If you believe that, you’ll be-
lieve anything. □

“AMP FIRE A GENERAL LOOKS AT
ITS INVESTMENTS VERY CAREFULLY.
WE WENT WITH PERKINELMER COMPUTERS!’
Mr. J. K. Staveley, Managing Director, AMP Fire a General Insurance Co. Ltd.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how AMP Fire 8c General
and Perkin-Elmer Computers work together.
Consider 600,000 general insurance
policies Australia-wide and a computer system
which enables rapid response to customer
gueries.
Consider a general insurance computer
system working on a real time updating basis in
one of the most volatile areas of insurance.
Because in the business of general
insurance, you deal with policies which are
continually changing.
Policyholders buy and sell cars, houses and
other assets, and change addresses and
coverages.
A fast updating computer system with
absolute efficiency and reliability is
mandatory.
Working together since 1981, AMP
Fire 8c General and Perkin-Elmer Computers
developed a system based around four
Perkin-Elmer 3200 Series Computers.
A system which is currently being expanded
to bring New Zealand and another 100,000
policies on lineduring 1984.
Right through the system’s development,
both companies worked as closely together as
any two companies can.
Developing, refining, testing, installing.
The result?
A general insurance computer system as
advanced as any in Australia.
But then, this is the Kind of result you
expect when you deal with the company which
revolutionised the information industry with
its pioneering of the 32-bit minicomputer.
A company which today employs over
14,000 people world-wide and turns over more
than $1 billion annually.
It was exactly this Kind of stability and
reliability that a stable and reliable company liKe
AMP Fire & General wanted.

BUYING WINE
Buying good red wine has been called an investment in
pleasure. You have the satisfaction of drinking a wine that
is better than when you bought it, and its original cost
(inflation aside) is a thing of the past.
With a tremendous variety of wines available there are
a few useful guidelines. Always buy wines ahead of your needs.
Very little money is needed to convert you from a bottle
by bottle buyer to the proud owner of a ‘cellar.’
Plan your needs over say
the next three or six months and
buy accordingly. Buying by the case
is invariably cheaper.
Be careful about buy-
ing unknown wines, or quantities
of a wine you have not tasted.
Reputations for consistent
quality are hard earned and
worth following.

KALIMNA BIN 28
Kalimna is a famous vineyard in the
Barossa Valley. It is considered by most
wine people to be one of the premium dry
red vineyards in Australia. Kalimna has been
part of Penfolds since 1945 and has

COVER STORY
THE US ALLIANCE
What Uncle Sam means to
Australia’s economy
A McDonald’s eatery in an American town: it could be almost anywere in Australia
Many Australians still make a lot of noise about ANZUS and our past military links with the
United States. But, says JOHN EDWARDS, the importance of these has diminished and
economic integration is now more important.
THE CELEBRANTS don’t like saying
it during the annual observances of
Coral Sea Week or at the ceremonies
here to mark American Independence
Day but the relationship between Aus-
tralia and the United States has lost
much of its political and military im-
portance to Australia over the past dec-
ade. We no longer plan to fight battles
in alliance with the United States and
we no longer discuss with the US State
Department a great many issues of di-
rect importance to us.
Yet America has become more im-
portant to Australia over the same dec-
ade. We are integrated much more
closely with the American economy. Be-
cause our trade and financial system is
so much more open than it was a decade
ago we are influenced more deeply by
the US in this area and exert a small
influence upon it, even though the pol-
itical and military relationship is wither-
ing.
The debate about Australia and the
US often is conducted today in the
wrong terms, just as the domestic debate
in Australia is conducted in the wrong
terms. At home we refuse to believe our
luck, to accept that this is a wealthy
country, pretty well managed, which
adapts reasonably quickly to changing
international circumstances. Inter-
nationally we refuse to see that the rela-
tionship between Australia and the US
has changed its character completely,
rendering most of the old arguments un-
necessary or irrelevant.
The usual debate today about Aus-
tralia and the US is one about military
connections. Yet it is more than a dec-
ade since Australian and American
troops fought together in a war. It is
difficult to imagine any circumstances
in the next several decades in which
Australian and American troops would
be fighting together again.
Australia’s defence strategy for a
decade and its new weapons decisions
today are based on making Australia
too costly to invade and able to deliver
punishing blows to any enemy power in
the region. We conduct an arid debate
on whether the US would defend us
against Indonesia, without recognising
that we are quite capable of defending
ourselves against Indonesia, which any-
way has no intention of attacking us.
The Americans might or might not
help us, depending on the circum-
stances. Our defence planners assume
sensibly that the Americans would not.
American State Department officials
sometimes say America would and
sometimes say America would not.
Most recently the Assistant Secretary
of State for the Asia-Pacific area, Paul
Wolfowitz, said an attack on Australia
would “require” and “receive full and
prompt fulfillment of the ANZUS se-
curity commitment including, when
necessary, military support.” Wolfowitz
drew an analogy with American support
for Britain during the war over the
Falklands.
But the real lesson of that war, and of
past political and military disputes be-
tween Australia and Indonesia, is that
the natural preference of the US is to
negotiate a settlement between friends
and it will choose between them only
when compelled to do so by decisive
action.
The truth is that the American re-
sponse would depend on time and cir-
cumstance, on the mood of congress
and the political complexion of the ad-




ministration. The views of
Japan and China and the role
of the Soviet Union would be
taken into account.
Over the past decade Am-
erican military interest has
shifted from the Pacific to-
wards Persian Gulf con-
tingencies, Central America
and strategic nuclear warfare.
The US navy is being ex-
panded greatly under current
programs. This expansion
ought to have some relevance
to Pacific defence but it does
not. The American navy is
preponderant in the Pacific
anyway, with eight fixed-wing
aircraft carriers to none for
the Soviet Union.
Because Australian and
US defence policies are mov-
ing in different directions,
most of the debate about
ANZUS is irrelevant. Both its
proponents and opponents
say too much for it.
True, American intelli-
gence and communications
bases remain in Australia and
they will be increasingly im-
portant as America deploys more Tri-
dent submarines and constructs satellite
systems for extended nuclear warfare.
True, the intelligence relationship be-
tween Australia and the US remains
strong, particularly in sharing data on
Indonesia, Vietnam and China.
It is also true that the presence of
these bases and the existence of ANZUS
Fraser: pressured US to increase defence spending
USS Enterprise in Sydney Harbor: intelligence rather than military strength is the major link now
precludes Australia from taking a neu-
tral stance between the US and the
Soviet Union. But it is not true that
commitment to the US side in any way
diminishes our importance in the world
or that we would be safer and more
prominent without being identified with
the West.
ANZUS is acceptable to the Austra-
lian people because it reflects
our views about the dispute
between the US and the Soviet
Union; we do not have these
views because of ANZUS. But
while there are few disadvan-
tages in a formal alliance with
the US there are not many ad-
vantages, either.
In practice, our military re-
lationship has not developed
at all in the past decade. Aus-
tralia consistently has dec-
lined any military involve-
ment in the Middle East, with
the exception of the Sinai
peace force, even though Aus-
tralia leans to the Israeli pos-
ition in world affairs. We have
declined to buy an aircraft
carrier, which would give us
the kind of offshore strike
capability the Americans
want us to have. There has
been no development of joint
Australia-US-Japan defence
co-operation beyond RIM-
PAC exercises nor is there
likely to be, given Australian
attitudes, Japanese attitudes
and the want of any clear
military purpose. Australia’s closest
military connection to the US and the
most powerful argument for a formal
alliance is in our superior access to
advanced weapons such as the F-18
fighter. It is the combination of our vast-
ly wealthier economy and our superior
access to America’s advanced weapons
which underpins Australia’s regional
military strength.
The declining importance of our offi-
cial military relationship is com-
plemented by the declining importance
of our official political relationship. In
the US-Australia bilateral relationship
little of moment has occurred for years.
In the US State Department, Austra-
lia is the responsibility of one desk offi-
cer and an assistant and claims half the
time of one deputy assistant secretary.
Wolfowitz, the assistant secretary in
charge of the Pacific region (who can
report to the Secretary) is, sensibly,
much more concerned about China and
Japan than about Australia.
Because Australia is an ally, Ameri-
can officials such as Secretary of State
George Shultz are careful to respect the
formal observances of the ANZUS part-
nership, though they must wonder often
whether the annual consultations and
visits to the US by prime ministers and
foreign ministers could perhaps be less
frequent ? shorter or of greater moment.
For Australian leaders, visits to the
US are a chance to find out what’s going
on in the wider world. For the American
officials involved, there is no outcome
which can win a headline in a US paper
(or even a five-paragraph story in most


The F-18 fighter: our access to such advanced weapons is a big plus
cases), no opportunities to cut a dra-
matic figure and few to find out useful
information.
The agenda of strictly bilateral issues
can scarcely fill out a State Department
lunch. When the officials have run
through beef quotas, sugar prices, state
taxes on foreign earnings, entry of Am-
erican banks to Australia, the status of
intelligence bases and American press-
ure on the Japanese to increase beef
quotas ... that’s that.
Nor is this polite vacuity likely to
alter soon. Over the next three or four
years we are most likely to have a
Hawke Labor government in Canberra
and a Reagan Republican adminis-
tration in Washington but we know that
these two apparently divergent political
constellations are perfectly compatible.
Hawke expects Reagan to be re-elected
and he is willing, publicly and privately,
to endorse the administration’s view of
its role in the world and its intentions in
economic policy.
Hawke has no sympathy with the
Soviet Union; he can see the evidence
of US recovery, despite deficits and high
interest rates; he knows the affection
Australians have for the American al-
liance; and he has no intention even
under provocation of jeopardising
the substantial benefit of being in good
odor in Washington for the fleeting ben-
efit of joining in the criticism of the
most right-wing American President in
memory.
For its part, Washington has no com-
plaint against the Hawke Government.
Those who knew him welcomed him to
the leadership of the Labor Party and
the prime minister’s office and they have
had no reason to regret their preference.
Australia and the US may disagree
moderately over the pressure being ap-
plied on Japan to increase its defence
spending more swiftly, or over tactics
toward Vietnam, or over the many trade
issues on which Australian governments
must be seen to be deeply in-
dignant and ruthlessly tough.
But of real disagreement there
is none not over US pos-
itions at the strategic arms
limitation talks, or the inter-
mediate range talks, or gener-
al attitudes towards the Soviet
Union, or the pace and
character of strategic nuclear
weapons development; all
issues on which Labor’s politi-
cal counterpart in the United
States, the Democratic Party,
is pitted against the adminis-
tration.
But while there is no active
disagreement, there is no ac-
tive agreement either. The
Labor Government is not, like
the Fraser Government, press-
ing America to increase de-
fence spending against the
Soviet Union or urging it to be
more alert to the Soviet men-
ace in world affairs. It is not
taking a world view worth the
name and its professed inter-
est in international nuclear
disarmament is the flimsiest
kind of political platitude, un-
informed by any useful in-
sights or information, neces-
sarily limited by the US pos-
ition at the substantial negoti-
ations and directed more at
the left of the Labor Party in
Australia than governments
abroad.
It is no accident that the
Australian disarmament am-
bassador, Richard Butler, is
spending many of these criti-
cal days before the ALP feder-
al conference not abroad but
at home. Nor is it an accident
that Hawke will not visit the
US before he calls an election,
though the Americans would
be happy enough to see him.
For Hawke there are few
points to be gained by such a
visit, though his predecessors
thought an American tour in
an election year was practical-
ly a necessity. Today the offi-
cial relationship is more fic-
tion than fact, more sentiment
than content, and politicians,
press and public are ac-
customing themselves gradu-
ally to the new era.
The real link today between Austra-
lia and the US or, rather, between
Australia, the US and Japan is a cul-
tural and economic convergence far
outweighing in importance to Australia
the official defence and political links
between either Japan and Australia or
the US and Australia. The importance
of convergence rather than direct trade
Shultz: respecting the formal observances of ANZUS


Disarmament ambassador Butler: staying at home
Former PM Whitlam: his tariff cuts have had a lasting effect
links is revealed in the small direct con-
tribution to the Australian recovery that
has been made by the US or even the
Japanese recovery.
Of the nearly 18 percent increase in
nominal output to March 1984, exports
to Japan and the US accounted for only
half of one percentage point. So the US
and Japan are not directly powering the
Australian recovery, which is based on
an increase in government spending, in
housing, stocks and agricultural output.
The US recovery also was powered
by a government deficit but the causal
connection is that both the US deficit
and the Australian deficit blowouts
were caused partly by the 1979-1980
downturn in the US economy, which in
turn was caused by the Federal Reserve
system of the United States, which was
prompted to act by inflation following
the 1979 oil price rises.
Because of lead and lag times and
the different policies followed by each
country, the causal connections are lost
in time. What we observe is a close simi-
larity between the economic patterns of
the United States and Australia (and
Japan) which is better thought of as a
convergence towards a common pattern
than a direct causality or dependency.
This shows itself in a variety of sim-
ultaneous developments in Australia,
Japan and the US. Most of these
changes appear first in the US. Their im-
pact in Australia has been assisted enor-
mously by the most remarkable change
in Australia’s trade patterns, which
neither side in the Australian protection
debate wishes to acknowledge.
The protectionists here warn of the
dangers to existing industry and the
threat to employment; the free traders
say the country is being held back by
trade barriers. Neither side wishes to re-
cognise that the protection debate in
Australia now is confined pretty much
to cars and textiles and that Australian
industry has changed dramatically over
the past two decades.
Since the Whitlam tariff cuts and re-
valuations, the possibilities for imports
replacing manufacturing in Australia
have diminished sharply. We notice as
we travel abroad that a wide range of
imported consumer and business prod-
ucts are no more expensive here than
they are in the US or in Japan even
when they are made in Japan, since
Japan has such an expensive system of
domestic distribution.
In the 70s, while we argued over tar-
iff policy as though nothing had
changed, we increased our imports of
manufactured goods from Third World
countries more rapidly than any devel-
oped nation except Holland. So the re-
turning expatriate finds a society in
which the consumer products available
and the level of computer sophistication
are indistinguishable from those in
United States.
If the actual and largely unrecog-
nised elimination of trade barriers has
been one powerful force for conver-
gence, the floating of the dollar this year
has been another. With the prospective
entry of foreign banks, the wide distri-
bution of foreign exchange licences and
the large-scale deregulation of financial
institutions and the financial system,
Australia is now integrated into a pat-
tern of instant electronic markets that
extends from London and New York to
Hong Kong and Singapore.
In New York, large Australian cor-
porations such as Westpac, Lend Lease
and BHP are extending rapidly into the
American economy, certainly more rap-
idly than LIS corporations are extending
into Australia. Our corporate assets are
being internationalised, finding affin-
ities with American markets, so that
while Australia will for a long while re-
main a net capital importer it is es-
tablishing the base for a reciprocal in-
terconnection of markets and assets
which is a more influential source of
mutual influence than direct trade flows.
Our freer trade, integrated financial
system and geographic position open
Australia to the other influence which is
transforming our relationship with the
United States and Japan. We happen to
be in the Pacific Basin, the one area of
the world which is growing strongly,
which weathered the latest recession
best and which is increasing most dra-
matically its regional trade.
If we include the US and exclude
Latin America, the region is one of ex-
traordinary prosperity. While Europe is
recovering only sluggishly from re-
cession and will be tangled for decades
in problems of agricultural protection,
industrial restructuring and unemploy-
ment, the countries of the Pacific region
are romping ahead, while absorbing
rapid changes in their economic pat-
terns.
Australia finds itself in the region by
chance; by chance the changes the re-
gion has made to its economic policies
have allowed us to participate in its
growth and its impact on our economy
is now irreversible. □

Adelaide $90,000
How much further will your housing
dollar go in South Australia?
Chances are it will go a lot further than it will in Sydney or Melbourne. For instance, a typical luxury
town house, in one of Adelaide’s prestige suburbs, can be bought for around $90,000 to $llO,OOO.
An equivalent town house in Sydney would cost between $160,000 and $275,000. Best of all, many of
Adelaide’s prime town houses are situated in quiet tree-lined streets only 10 minutes from the city. You’ll
save time as well as money. Adelaide is full of nice surprises like that.
Like the rest of South Australia, Adelaide is a
place where people with ideas can make a name
for themselves and their business.
It’s a place where the hassles are fewer. The
obstacles smaller. And the rewards easier to attain.
South Australians have been keeping the
good things to themselves for far too long.
Now the secret is out.

the coupon today and post it to the Director of

THE ARTS
Barry Cohen’s world:
Arts, angst and a rumor mill
From ballet to basket weaving, the world of federal arts minister Barry
Cohen is fraught with demands and jealousies that ensure him a constant
flow of drama and not a little black comedy, as GLENNYS BELL reports
BARRY COHEN is thinking of setting
up a new arts board a rumor board.
This would deal with all the gossip,
scandal, wild reports, third-hand tales
and garbled hearsay that spread
through the arts world faster than an
encore.
The latest is the community arts
rumor which has, for the past few
weeks, kept the arts world in a tremor.
This is, in the exquisitely apt parlance
for which arts people are justly famous,
the takeover of the arty farties by the
raffia mafia. If successful, the result
would be the gradual transfer of empha-
sis and, inevitably, of money from
the traditional and elitist arts such as
opera, ballet and chamber music to the
folksy charms of “pop, high jinks and
dahlia shows, finger painting exercises
in municipal carparks and basket weav-
ing in Balmain,” as the quotes go.
“What can you do?” moans Cohen,
wiping his brow and worrying over the
latest batch of rumors and caustic cuts
to reach his office. As Minister for
Home Affairs, his portfolio includes
arts, museums, the environment and
consumer affairs. None gives him more
angst than arts. Everything he says and
does makes him a target and the slings
and arrows are cunningly fashioned, as
is to be expected from a community
which includes some of the most intelli-
gent, articulate, creative and imagina-
tive people in the country. They are art-
ists and communication is one of their
skills.
Ever since he became minister,
Cohen has been advocating greater ac-
cess and participation in the arts for the
whole community. His electorate is
Gosford, NSW, between Sydney and
Newcastle. Many of the people living
there are commuters or the aged or low-
income workers, for whom a trip to
Sydney for the performing and visual
arts involves time, trouble and money.
“Those people don’t see arts as some-
thing for them,” Cohen says, “but it
should mean something for everyone
from children to the aged, irrespective
of financial resources or geographic lo-
cation. I recognise it’s extremely diffi-
cult to provide that. You can’t have the
national opera in Gosford but there
must be ways and means of achieving
access.”
As an example he gives Sidetrack
Theatre, “one of the most exciting
groups I’ve seen in a long time.” It was
formed from the Chullora railway
workshops in Sydney and most of the
actors are recent arrivals, among them
Lebanese and French, and they perform
in factories and schools. It has been de-
scribed as ethnic, working-class, trade
union-oriented. To Cohen, it is one
form of community theatre. He is trying
to arrange a performance in Parliament
House, Canberra, for his colleagues.
As far as participation goes, Cohen
remembers his schooldays when few
students were encouraged to be in-
volved in dance, theatre and music.


“Most kids at school were
made to feel very self-con-
scious if they participated in
those things. Boys were made
to feel sissy. The big break-
through in changing attitudes
will come when we get
involved in education in the
arts, when we get started in
the schools.”
Cohen is looking at ways
and means of establishing the
arts more firmly in the
schools. “There’s a past re-
cord of government involve-
ment which revolutionised the
schools. These were the
Menzies science block and li-
brary systems. It was a wide-
ranging attack on the
deficiencies in the 50s and
took 20 years to establish.”
Cohen hopes to establish arts,
maybe through something
such as family leisure centres
providing access for the com-
munity as well as centres for
the schools. His department is
working on the idea.
It is also a long-term plan,
as dependent on a buoyant economy as
it is on Labor being in federal office for
several terms.
In the meantime, Cohen is arguing
the case for increased funding for the
arts. Last year, the budget was $37.9 mil-
lion which the Australia Council al-
located among its eight boards, the mu-
sic, theatre, crafts, community, Aborigi-
nal arts, visual, design and literature
boards. It is the fear that funding might
be cut to the flagship companies, as the
Australian Opera and the Australian
Ballet are called, and transferred to the
community board, with its journeyman
companies taking arts to the people,
that is causing the current lobbying
campaign and spate of rumors.
At this stage, Cohen can only wipe
his brow and worry. “What can you
do?”
He has never advocated sinking the
flagships in order to launch folk music
and companies such as Sidetrack
Theatre into the community. He says
that as minister he has no power to de-
cide how the funds are allocated; that is
up to the boards. But he has had dis-
cussions with the boards: “I’ve made
clear the decision is theirs.” The boards
have, of course, asked him what he
would do if he were chairman. “I’ve
told them I’d try to keep the major com-
panies at their existing levels and what
new funds are available in real terms
should go to community arts.”
So the rumors arose about the take-
over of the raffia mafia. But worse is to
come.
In recent years, under the Fraser
Government, appointments to the vari-
A scene from the Brazilian play Macunaima. For Cohen, “like listening to a Marcel Marceau record”
CHOOI TAN/BLACK WATTLE STUDIO
ous arts boards tended to be conserva-
tives who favored the traditional arts.
Cohen plans to make appointments
which he believes will be more represen-
tative of the Australian community. He
will soon announce the names of at least
four trade unionists who will be joining
the Australia Council, the theatre and
community boards.
“It’s four out of about 80 board
members,” Cohen says. “They will take
into account the views of unionists such
as the musicians and actors.”
Cohen has been 15 months in the
job. That is a record. Previous ministers
have held the portfolio an average of
nine months.
An amateur actor in his younger
days, Cohen still suffers first night
nerves in his relations with the arts
world. He recently visited the Crafts
Board. His reception was pure theatre.
“Minister, this is an historic occasion.”
His reaction was equally theatrical. “I
expected a panning.” Instead, he
received applause. He was the first arts
minister to visit the board.
Not all his reviews have been so
favorable. His worst panning was prob-
ably over his performance at the Adel-
aide Arts Festival. He walked out of the
Brazilian production of Macunaima. “It
was entirely in Portuguese. I apologise
for my lack of knowledge of Portu-
guese. The rest of it was people tearing
up pieces of paper. There was no music,
no dance. It was like listening to a Mar-
cel Marceau record.”
Anyone but the minister might have
walked out without fanfare but Cohen is
a natural target. And some of the slings
and arrows find their mark.
Like all good politicians, he has an
answer for nearly everything but, when
it was mentioned that in the arts world
he was thought to be a “bit of a
philistine,” it was his private secretary
opera-lover Sergio Sergi who
quipped: “He can’t be. He’s a Jew.”
Cohen preferred not to comment but
kept returning to the subject. “I don’t
have any power over the Australia
Council. If all I liked doing was playing
the mouth organ and tap dancing, it
wouldn’t matter what my tastes were be-
cause my tastes are irrelevant.”
He never sought the arts portfolio.
He had been shadow minister for tour-
ism, sports and environment before
Labor took office. But when appointed
he was quite excited at the prospect. He
has discovered since that, when the arts
community wants to talk to him, it is
usually about money.
“I haven’t stopped fighting for these
Thoughts of Cohen
i Every major arts organisation
says it believes in ‘arms length’
funding but the minute it doesn’t
get the decision it wants, it goes
straight to the Minister. J
Artists will survive and thrive if
people will pay to see what they
are doing. J
We’ve all heard the cliche: ‘l’m
an artist.’ ‘Yes, but what do
you do for a living?’ 3

WITHOUT EPSON, HALF THE WORLD’S COMPUTERS
WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO WRITE THEIR OWN NAMES.
If you’ve ever had anything to do with computers, you’ll
be familiar with the name EPSON.
After all, EPSON is the world's largest manufacturer of
computer printers.
But this is only one of a long list of EPSON achievements
| over the past two decades. EPSON developedthe first printing
I head for miniature calculators.
It pioneered the development and
application of Liquid Crystal Displays. ?
And it developed the world's first
It low-cost computer printer.
I Today, almost half the world’s calculators, cash registers
'and computers depend on components developed and manu-
factured by EPSON.
This has all been made possible because of EPSON'S
specialisation in “mechatronics” - the art of combining precise
mechanical and electronic technologies. In fact, more than 15%
of EPSON’S workforce are devoted to research and develop-
ment in this important field.
The result is EPSON’S own range of business computers
and printers. Each one begins with an inbuilt operational advantage.
Perhaps this is why so many business people have made
EPSON a part of their success.

people since day one,” says Cohen,
“and all we get is criticism not for
what we do but what they think we do.”
Cohen gained a university degree in
1980, at the age of 43, and specialised in
Australian history. As minister for the
arts, he would like to see a greater em-
phasis on “things Australian” on Aus-
tralians taking pride in their cultural
heritage and using it as the basis for
creativity in the arts. It is such thinking
what he sees as a way of putting
Labor policy into practice which is
behind appointments such as the new
chairman of the Australia Council,
Donald Horne, author of The Lucky
Country and one “of the generation that
created the break from the sycophancy
of the cultural cringe. He’s not embar-
rassed to be an Australian and look for
creativity in Australia, whether it is in
theatre, music or literature.”
Cohen admits he is not a great opera-
lover, which may be a good thing.
Otherwise, he might identify with a
tragic hero such as Samson in Samson
And Delilah.
After a hard finance session with the
Prime Minister and other cabinet minis-
ters, Cohen was visited by the man who
has the portfolio which Cohen initially
wanted John Brown, of Tourism and
Sport. “How was it?” Brown wanted to
know.
“I’ve still got my toenails,” said
Cohen. Brown commiserated: “You’ll
have another chance at the budget cabi-
net.” Cohen grimaced: “I’ll lose my
kneecaps then.”
Obviously, a minister who is suffer-
ing for his arts. □
COLLECTING
The Bulletin
held the
best cards
Some of the postcards produced by The Bulletin between 1903 and 1907: promotion material that became classics
By JOHN ALEXANDER
THE POSTCARD of the early 1900 s
was no different from those produced
for holiday resorts today. It was color-
ful, pictorial, promotional and above all
cheap, attracting the minimum rate of
postage.
But when The Bulletin chose to’prod-
uce a series of postcards between
December 1903 and January 1907 it had
loftier ideals in mind.
The 150-odd Bulletin cards featuring
its artists, such as Norman Lindsay, his
brother Lionel, Phil May, “Hop”
(Livingston Hopkins), B. E. Minns,
Harry Weston and Arthur Dyson, were
sold to readers in 11 different series in
that three-year period at less than a
penny a card.
They were designed as much for their
artistic merit as for promotional pur-
poses. But even The Bulletin could not
have known that, 80 years later, its cards
would become classics.
At an auction staged by Melbourne
dealer Nick Vukovic in August 1982, a
Norman Lindsay card from his Austra-
lian Types set, titled The Artist and pub-
lished by The Bulletin in 1907, fetched
$630 easily a record for any Austra-
lian postcard at a public sale.
It was a dramatic reappraisal by the
market. Just six years ago, according to
leading Melbourne postcard dealer Paul
Kornan whose collection of 90 Bul-
letin cards ranks as the biggest in Aus-
tralia Norman Lindsay’s Bulletin
postcards cost no more than $5 each.
Within a year, the price had jumped to
$4O and today, says Kornan, collectors
can expect to pay between $3OO and
$5OO. But the heat of the saleroom can
drive prices even higher as buyers com-
pete for cards missing from their sets.
Behind the price rise is a sharp
growth in the number of postcard col-
lectors in Australia. While Melbourne
which plays host to the Australian Car-
tophilic Society and the major postcard
auctioneers is the centre of the hobby
in Australia, all states have now formed
or are forming collecting societies.
From a few buyers just a decade ago, an
estimated 2000 postcard collectors are
active in Australia today.
The Bulletin had no doubts about
what it was doing when it embarked on
its postcard venture.
An advertisement in the magazine in
1907 said its cards .. commend them-
selves for artistic and Australian inter-
est. Designs by leading illustrators are
printed on each, in black on tint, and
the cards are the best and most distinc-
tive yet produced here ... The subjects
are for the greater part humorous and
characteristically Australian.”
It is a claim which holds true. The


cards were produced in the golden
period of Australian cartooning, a
period in which The Bulletin held a near
monopoly on the most talented illustra-
tors.
The most valuable Bulletin cards are
Norman Lindsay’s Australian Types
series. Twelve different designs were
printed but they are so scarce that only
10 sets and 30 individual cards have
turned up. The cards featured individ-
ual characters of a particular Australian
style, a popular theme with artists at
that time. There was The Shanty Keep-
er, The Pug, The Digger, The Swaggie,
The Shearer and The Larrikin.
Almost as scarce and as valuable as
Lindsay’s efforts are the six cards in the
Weekly Worries series of Harry Weston,
released in January 1907. Comic cards
with titles such as The Fresh Fish’O’,
The Dog Licence’O’ and the Wild
Postcard dealer Paul Kornan: a dramatic surge in prices
Rabb’O’, they are among the hardest to
find.
Most of The Bulletin postcards which
have surfaced in the past three years
have turned up overseas. The initial
Norman Lindsay cards to be discovered
were found in New Zealand, another
previously-unknown Lindsay card was
found in England and since the produc-
tion of Kornan’s catalogue (Australian
Postcard Catalogue, 1984), a further six
Lindsay cards have been found in
Northern Ireland.
However, last July an elderly woman
from the Sydney suburb of Belfield
walked into a Manly stamp and card
dealer’s shop with more than 100 pre-
viously-unknown Norman Lindsay
postcards. Her hoard also included
Lindsay’s original pen and ink drawings
for those cards.
Her late husband, she told the dealer,
had worked in a printing house just
after World War I. The cards had
proven too risque to publish so he had
taken all the originals home.
She wanted $3OOO for the lot. The
dealer, not knowing their value, balked
but offered to try to sell them to a friend,
David Cook, president of the NSW So-
ciety of Postcard Collectors. The
woman gave the dealer two days.
Unfortunately for Cook, he was
away on holidays at the time un-
fortunately, because the postcards are
worth at least $3OO to $5OO each and the
drawings even more.
But we might never find out. Good to
her promise, the woman returned to the
stamp shop and picked up her collec-
tion. She has not been heard of since. □


OPERA
AO chases
the Ring
of success
Christine Hore, Bruce Martin (with spear), Robert Gard in The Rhinegold: the Muppets strike back
By BRIAN HOAD
NO DOUBT there will be many bizarre
events staged around Australia in 1988
to commemorate the bi-centenary of the
founding of the penal colony of New
South Wales. As the most opulent flag-
ship of the nation’s performing arts, the
Australian Opera is planning to make a
particularly big splash. It intends to
stage Richard Wagner’s gargantuan,
four-part music drama, The Ring of the
Niebelung, a pertinent tale of gold and
greed and power and corruption, sung
in German. But things aren’t shaping up
well.
The choice was not a matter of care-
ful consideration. Its origins go back to
1977 and the arrival at the AO of a new
general manager, Peter Hemmings, a
devoted Wagner fan. To begin with
there was a lack of enthusiasm within
the company for the proposed project:
the pit at the Sydney Opera House
could hold only about half the number
of orchestral musicians required;
singers for some of the more difficult
roles were not available locally; and the
company’s musical director, Richard
Bonynge, thought the whole idea would
be a stupid waste of money. It was one
of many matters on which Bonynge and
Hemmings disagreed.
Yet before departing prematurely in
1979, Hemmings had caused the AO to
join forces with the ABC to present a
concert version of The Rhinegold, the
first part of the tetralogy, which so
stirred the blood of local fans that the
AO was trapped.
Having obtained from England the
services of Rita Hunter for the mighty
role of Brunnhilde, the AO and the
ABC were back in the concert hall again
in 1981 presenting parts two and four,
The Valkyrie and The Twilight of the
Gods.
Part three, Siegfried, was not given
its concert airing until last month in
Melbourne. Another English import,
Alberto Remedios, was needed to fill
the horribly difficult title role. He was
taken ill during the first performance
and forced to cancel the second.
Neither the AO nor the ABC had
thought of arranging a stand-by. The
only other tenor in the country capable
of tackling the role, Jon Weaving, was
otherwise engaged.
Despite all the glaring problems
involved, the AO’s final decision to
stage The Ring was made rather
whimsically in 1981. The company’s
current general manager, Patrick
Veitch, was day-dreaming through one
of the more boring passages of The Twi-
light of the Gods when it occurred to him
that if he scheduled the first complete
performance for the prominent year of
1988, he probably could persuade the
local German business community to
foot the bill. And so he did. With the
backing of the Government of the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany, $1
million was promised for the
greater glory of the fatherland
and the project was under
way.
Considering the ignorance
of local audiences it was
decided to start on stage
last October, in topsy-turvy
fashion, with The Valkyrie, ac-
cording to the simple argu-
ment that it contained some of
the better-known tunes and
the least complicated bit of
plot.
The local production team,
led by the company’s prin-
cipal resident producer,
Andrew Sinclair, in collabor-
ation with Allan Lees (sets)
and Desmond Digby (cos-
tumes), took a similarly pat-
ronising approach. A straight-
forward, traditional produc-
tion was the aim. The rather
simple-minded result proved
acceptable enough within the
context of the company’s
largely second-rate repertoire.
Now it’s The Rhinegold, the first new
production of the company’s current
Sydney season.
It’s certainly not an easy work to
stage, demanding naked naiads swim-
ming around the stage in the company
of randy gnomes, avaricious giants,
magic dragons and a gaggle of gods
who, at the drop of a thunderbolt, are
able to summon up a rainbow bridge or
a grandiose castle-in-the-air like their
new home, Valhalla.
On this occasion, however, there is
only a non-stop, two-and-a-half-hour
display of theatrical incompetence
which could be re-titled more aptly The
Muppets strike Back.
From the opening scene beneath the
Rhine, where overdressed naiads labor
mysteriously at rearranging river rocks,
to the final entry of the gods into a
Valhalla made of tremulous blanc-
mange, one ludicrous stage picture is
piled upon another to form a theatrical
nightmare which overwhelms meaning,
drama and music.
Not surprisingly, the AO is in some-
thing of a dither over what to do next. It
is muttering that The Rhinegold will be
improved an unlikely prospect. It has
quietly postponed the first staging of
Siegfried planned originally for next
year.
It could offer up prayers for another
of those cleansing warehouse fires to
help solve the problem.
Or it could admit to having made a
dreadful mistake, call off The Ring pro-
ject and commission some new local
work, full of rousing convict choruses,
as a more apt offering for the bi-
centennial. □

FILMS
Girls’ own
escapism
with style
By SANDRA HALL
ROMANCING THE STONE is a girls’
own adventure a witty variation on
the Boys’ Own Paper style of the Indi-
ana Jones stories and a graceful ac-
knowledgment of the possibility that
these films are only incidentally for chil-
dren.
Their fondest audiences may be
those adults still marvelling that film has
caught up at last with the power of the
imagination able to produce a Super-
man who looks like Superman and
space wars that really do conjure up
fathomless distances and awesome
other worlds, as well as situations which
exploit vividly the more thrilling aspects
of this one.
As a romance novelist, author of
what are known in the trade as “bodice
rippers,” Joan Wilder, heroine of Ro-
mancing the Stone , is an expert on esca-
pism. Her own most devoted fan, she
identifies with each heroine she creates.
Each happy ending is typed up in a
crescendo of sobs. Each hero is a para-
gon; strong, handsome, smart and utter-
ly unlike every man she has met.
Joan has a cat, an apartment in Man-
hattan and a best friend and publisher,
Gloria (Holland Taylor), who thinks she
is doing Joan a good turn by taking her
to singles bars to look over Manhattan’s
swingers, although these expeditions de-
press even Gloria. “Wimp,” she says
glumly as she scans the line-up across
the bar. “Loser, major loser.”
Joan also has a sister, Elaine (Mary
Ellen Trainor), in Colombia and it’s
Elaine who changes everything when
her husband is murdered and she is kid-
napped by thugs out to steal an implaus-
ible-looking treasure map.
Joan flies off to Colombia to save
her, meets Michael Douglas who is pur-
suing a recklessly inefficient career as a
parrot smuggler and everything that
happens from then on is high-grade
farce.
Produced by Douglas from a script
by Diane Hill, Romancing the Stone is
by a young director, Robert Zemeckis,
and while it lacks the breathtaking scale
of the Indiana Jones films it displays the
same sense of bravura the same
deadpan way with action and the same
relish for set-pieces.
There are chases, crashes, cliff-
hangers and fights with snapping croco-
diles. If all these episodes are entirely
derivative, they are at least good bur-
lesque.
Kathleen Turner, last seen seducing
and abandoning William Hurt in Body
Heat, is engaging as Joan.
She slips credibly between the con-
servative and adventurous sides of her
nature without having to resort to the
use of glasses. A certain amount is done
with changes of wardrobe and hairstyle
but this is limited by her spending most
of the film in a suit from Bergdorf
Goodman which deteriorates about her
as she goes.
Joan is backed up by Danny De Vito
(Shirley MacLaine’s short suitor in
Terms of Endearment) as a gangster
from the Bronx who has had enough of
South American greenery and is han-
kering for the asphalt jungles of home;
and Manuel Ojeda is forcefully nasty as
the arch-villain, Zolo, who commands a
corrupt police force with enough Jeeps
and machineguns for a short world war.
The only flaw in the casting is
Douglas himself.
While looking just as battered as
Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones,
Douglas lacks Ford’s talent for making
something likeable out of irascibility.
And, although Joan soon begins to see
something glamorous in him, it is a bit
more difficult for the audience.
Romancing the Stone was shot in
Mexico and Turner and Douglas are
hunted across some spectacular scenery
through jungles and villages, across
rivers and ravines, up mountainsides
and down waterfalls. It all adds to the
handsomeness of the production values
while conjuring up inevitable compari-
sons with Steven Spielberg’s work in
similar circumstances. Spielberg comes
out well ahead.
When in doubt Zemeckis turns on a
car chase and, while they’re all well-
paced and inventive, one finishes up
looking much like another. There is,
too, a moment in the middle when the
logic of the plot is abandoned suddenly
in order to speed things up. And it’s no
use saying that it doesn’t matter since
nothing here is meant to be believed: It
does matter because the plot’s unity is
damaged by this lapse and, with it, the
sense of narrative tension which gives
the film its energy.
But the tone is right and Joan is an
appealing character as she tries to
handle the fact that life finally has
caught up with her fiction. In a village
full of gun runners, she is welcomed as a
celebrity because the chief desperado
reads aloud to the others from her
books every Saturday.
And, when at last she has to face
Zolo, she shows that her panache is not
all on paper.
The violence of this encounter is
diluted by the outrageousness of the
slapstick that goes with it. It helps to
make up for the car chases, as does the
consistently witty script. Romancing the
Stone is not only escapism done with
high style; it’s full of good-humored ob-
servations on all the reasons for its own
existence. □

BOOKS
Australian
brand of
explosive
By GERARD WINDSOR
Wild Man of Letters, the story of
P. R. Stephensen, by Craig Munro.
Melbourne University Press, 1984,
$27.50
WHAT DO student activists do when
they grow up? Become Rhodes Schol-
ars. And what do they do then? Austra-
lia’s most fascinating Rhodes Scholar
spent three and a half years in a concen-
tration camp in his own country. The
judge who finally decided this had been
a well-deserved fate, and that there
should be no apologies or compensa-
tion, added to his judicial report the in-
sulting comment that the man had
“done little to realise the aspirations of
Cecil Rhodes since leaving Oxford.”
Yet now, less than 20 years after
his death, P. R. “Inky”
Stephensen has won a full,
scholarly biography. And he
deserves it. Until the spark
was crushed out of him by his
internment from 1942 to 1945
his life had been something of
a spectacular Catherine wheel.
He went to Oxford from the
infant Queensland University
in 1924, and spent eight years
in England working hard on
his own erratic brand of liter-
ary/political fireworks. He
was nearly sent down from
Oxford for distributing com-
munist literature among In-
dian students, he rode out
with the fox-hunting set, he
imported Lindsayism into
England by the harem load,
and he published a form guide
for greyhound punters. Once
back in Australia he added to
this a newspaper venture with
the father of the Sydney ec-
centric Bea Miles, agitation
on behalf of Aborigines,
ghost-writing for Frank
Clune, constant tributes to
Hitler, and a 1941 call for
Australia to make a separate
peace with Japan.
The obvious challenge to
Stephensen’s biographer is to
make a pattern out of the
jumble and contradictions of
this life. Craig Munro worries away at
the problem throughout this book, and
he does manage to make good sense of
it. If you didn’t like or still don’t like
Stephensen, he was an artistic reaction-
ary, a fascist and an anti-Semite. If you
do like him, he was a great nationalist, a
talented writer and an unflagging toiler
for literary culture. On one occasion the
American writer Hartley Grattan
characterised a rhetorical performance
by Stephensen in a way that was equally
true of his whole style. He had “stuffed
his cannon not only with tried and true
ball and powder but also with old nails,
bolts, screws and odd bits of rusty iron
he has found roundabout and fired the
thing off with a childlike delight in the
bang it made.”
Certainly youthful exuberance, mag-
pie habits and an addiction to polemics
were always part of Stephensen’s per-
sonality. But it can also be argued that
there was a coherence to his ideological
progress. A World War I working-class
background led him to a strong anti-
imperialism, an evil embodied above all
in Britain whose corrupt decadence was
the work of the class system and the
Jews, and was symbolised by the effete
hopelessness of modernist literature.
Against this, Stephensen believed,
should be thrown the vigour of nation-
alism, and the vitality of an indepen-
P. R. “lnky” Stephensen: an artistic reactionary to some
EDWARD QUICKE
dent and classical heroism, such as pro-
pounded by Nietzsche and Norman
Lindsay.
So in London he found himself
involved with Norman Lindsay’s son,
Jack, in the Fanfrolico Press, publishing
quite beautiful editions of, not infre-
quently, rubbish. This venture never re-
covered from Stephensen’s lack of busi-
ness acumen, although he was ousted
well before the Depression finally killed
it. Jack Lindsay moved the journalist
and novelist Brian Penton into the office
and wrote to his father: “P.R.S. fights
trench after trench to keep his muddle
intact . . . However, order can only be
achieved by his departure.” Stephensen
promptly started his own private press,
the Mandrake. D. H. Lawrence, in spite
of remarking of Fanfrolico “what a
waste of good printing!”, had been keen
to have some erotic drawings of his own
done by them, but was obliged by
Stephensen’s Mandrake Press instead.
With all the male nudes in the paintings
the dead-spit of Lawrence himself, and
with a police raid on the coinciding
exhibition, the success of the book was
assured. But after that it was all down-
hill.
Back in Australia by 1932
Stephensen tried one indigenous pub-
lishing venture after another. All were
disastrous. Increasing frustration with
the forces that he saw as ruin-
ing him led to his involvement
with the Australian First
Movement, and thence to
trumped-up charges of com-
plicity in a plot to collaborate
with the advancing Japanese.
This story does not make
pretty reading. Very few
groups come out well, least of
all the Labor Party. Evatt
emerges very shabbily indeed.
And, Munro remarks, “as this
case clearly showed, questions
of civil liberties and freedom
of expression depended very
much on political sympathy,
and most of the traditional
protest groups had nothing
but contempt for
Stephensen.”
This is an absorbing but
also a salutory story about be-
ing an Australian. It contains
enough of its own lessons, and
the only real flaw in the book
is the author’s readiness to
moralise. There is a dictum
that you need years, plenty of
them, before attempting
biographies. Wild Man of Let-
ters suggests a truth in this, for
Craig Munro is remarkably
young, 26. He preaches gratu-
itous sermons about the
dangers of Nietzscheanism
and the morality that con


demned Lady Chatterley’s Lover, he re-
fers, distractingly at the very least, to
“that philistine institution, the Sydney
Stock Exchange”: he has an appalling
undergraduate pun about cremation:
and, unforgiveably, he passes the om-
niscient judgment that Stephensen “be-
came a traitor to his conscience”!
Munro is an editor by profession, and a
few strokes of his own blue pencil
would have removed some unsightly
blemishes from a very fine book indeed. □

is thus able to recreate the private world
into which he was born and
the families to which he was
attached in one way or an-

of that intimate world and the
beginning of Smith’s public
career. His work with the Art

well as seminal books such as

He is able, for instance, to get

partment suggested a family at
Burwood who would look after him.
For a time, his mother could visit the
child regularly. Eventually, however,
the search for work took her away to
Queensland again and Bernard became
a state ward.
Not that he was unhappy. His surro-
gate family, the Keens, loved him as one
of their own. Salvation Army Sunday
school gave him friends. For a state
ward, this was important because there
was an unspoken taboo against bringing
school playmates home or confiding in
them. Smith remembers, “the easy give
and take, the normal transactions of the
legitimate, the chatter about one’s
parents were not for them and they
knew it.”
At Enmore High School, Smith came
under the influence of an exciting group
of teachers who opened his mind. His
chapter on the school will hearten any-
one who doesn’t think well of the teach-
ing profession.
Success at Enmore enabled him to
get to teachers’ college which meant
that, despite the Depression, he was as-
sured of a job. At college, it was Art
teacher May Marsden who fired his en-
thusiasm.
Then, a bush school. Isolated in a
one-teacher school for three years, he
began to draw and paint. He started a
state-wide art club for teachers. Books
on modern art came through the state
library’s lending service, still our
greatest community-arts network. Smith
read and thought and wrote and devel-
oped.
Always a serious person, he was
troubled by the great ques-
tions of existence. Sunday
school and the Keens had
given him a solid grounding
in the Bible. Now, as a young
man, he began to show an in-
terest in his mother’s
Catholicism. Discussions with
priests ended in frustration:
he became a communist, not a
Catholic.
One of the priests, how-
ever, had persuaded him to
read Augustine’s Confessions.
That made an impact, as great
books do. Augustine’s illegit-
imate son, Adeodatus, gives
him the title of this autobi-
ography. What is more aston-
ishing, the book’s pages are
studded with Augustinian
quotations as a running com-
mentary.
It is this assured sense of
belonging to the same mental
world as St Augustine that
makes The Boy Adeodatus, in
my experience, a unique book
among Australian auto-
biographies. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Macquarie leads the data race
by PatriciaRolfe
OXFORD’S announcement that it is
putting its 21,000-page English diction-
ary on computer has not left others in
the field at a loss for words. The Mac-
quarie dictionary has been on computer
for three years and Collins should get
end results next year, well ahead of Ox-
ford, from its Birmingham University
project which, unlike Oxford and Mac-
quarie, does not rely on frail, fallible
human beings but on a clever computer
for lexicography.
Macquarie may be ahead in almost
every direction. For the past two years it
has been sold direct computer-to-com-
puter to newspaper and other such
libraries. Beginning in August, the full
text can be fed into home or office com-
puter. Computing 2000 Corporation
claims that the uses to which the Mac-
quarie database can be put make it a
world first and it will be opening offices
in Europe and US to market their prod-
uct.
Colin Hendrick of Computing 2000
says there are three main uses: free-text
retrieval, thesaurus and what he calls
fuzzy-searching. Free-text retrieval
means that if, say, you want a list of
Aboriginal languages, the computer will
find all mentions in the dictionary. As
thesaurus, Hendrick said, the computer
for example found more than 100 refer-
Colin Hendrick: outdoing Roget
JOHN ELLIOTT
ences covering “ambiguous,” far
more than Roget’s. “Fuzzy searching” is
the Hendrick term for helping people
with their spelling. You feed in your
version and the computer lists words it
could be, but, Hendrick admits that
with spelling it can be as easy to take
down the dictionary.
Collins’s Birmingham project uses a
computer which can read type. It is be-
ing fed constantly with selected material
books, newspapers and so on and it
reports frequency of use, changes in
sense and construction, anything which
takes its fancy. Its reading, Collins point
out, is much wider than that of the most
conscientious scholar.
However, the size of the Oxford pro-
ject is impressive. It involves keyboard-
ing 60-million words used to record a
vocabulary of about 500,000 and more
than two million quotations. Loading
and checking the material will take
about four years.
THE FIRST four titles from Sydney
feminist publisher Redress Press will be
issued on July 16. They are Mother’s
Day, two novellas by Leone Sperling;
Velou, My Brother, a novel by Faith
Bandler; and books of verse by Pamela
Brown and Colleen Burke. They have
been packaged by Redress but will
come out under the Wild and Woolley
imprint; Pat Woolley is publishing
manager for Redress.
Redress is launching its first titles as
the Melbourne-based Sisters is winding
down for a spell. Sisters, in five years,
has produced about 20 titles, all, or
most, of which have done as well or bet-
ter than expected. Poetry has done very
well (for poetry) with sales of more than
1500 for some titles. Sisters’ mailing list
of about 1000 has gone to the Murphy
Sisters bookshop in Adelaide which will
continue to service it.
DAVID YALLOP’s In God’s Name,
which alleges that Pope John Paul I was
murdered, has not been published in
Italy. John Cody, who represents pub-
lishers Jonathan Cape here, says that he
has been told that Italian booksellers in-
variably operate on large overdrafts and
had made clear they did not want to
stock a book which made Italian banks
look so unsavory.
Business almost everywhere else has
been brisk. Cape’s first print run was
60,000 and Corgi has paid its highest
sum ever for non-fiction to get
paperback rights. □


AUSTRALIANA
Ringbarked in the Alice
The giant mural on the wall of Coles Supermarket in Alice Springs: money and moselle flows
PHOTOGRAPHS BY RON WATTS
In Australia’s most famous outback town, the Todd River is dry in more ways than one. Lenore
Nicklin reports on some of the changes that have made Alice Springs one of Australia’s fastest
growing towns.
IT’S BOOM TIME at the Alice. In Aus-
tralia’s most famous outback town, the
hawks circle lazily in a clear blue sky
and clouds of pink dust rise where the
new hotels and houses and the 18-hole,
Peter Thomson-designed golf course are
being built.
In the Aboriginal camps on the out-
skirts of the town buildings are also go-
ing up. An interesting piece of graffiti
says: “White man, we’ve got you sur-
rounded.” “Ringbarked,” say some of
the whites.
Alice Springs, 51 years ago just a
stop on the new overland telegraph line,
is one of the fastest-growing towns in
Australia. Its population of 22,000 has
almost doubled in the past 10 years.
Pizza shops, computer shops, video
shops are booming. Governor-General
Sir Ninian Stephen last month opened
the $5.8 million Araluen Arts Centre
the outback’s answer to the Sydney Op-
era House.
Itinerant workers arrive each week
knowing they’ll be able to find a job.
Entrepreneurs are welcome. You can
ride a camel or fly in a hot air balloon.
You can’t catch a bus there are no bus
services but you can get a taxi if you
are prepared to wait. Taxi drivers are
kept busy driving Aborigines and their
flagons back to camp often for fares of
$lOO and more. Some dri-
vers have ways of making
even more money. A taxi
driver sold Jimmy Jungari
a knife for $lO during a
ride back to camp and that
night Jimmy used it 200
times to kill his tribal wife.
“Me full drunk,” he told
the police the next day.
But most of the traffic in
Alice Springs is tourist
traffic. Last year there were
190,000 visitors. In the
winter months 20 buses a
day disgorge their grey-
haired passengers. The
young and the merely middle-aged ar-
rive in four-wheel-drives with red dust
covering their bull-bars. There are still
500 km of dirt road between Alice
Springs and Adelaide and in 1986 when
the highway is finished, the traffic is ex-
pected to increase greatly.
Out at the airport, holidaying Ameri-
cans touch down on their way to Dunk
Island via Ayers Rock. They have been
promised buffalo steaks, billy tea and
jumping kangaroos and will see little of
“down-town” Alice Springs. The locals
are already worrying that an inter-
national airport will be built at the rock
and the Alice will be bypassed altogeth-
Mayor Oldfield
er. The $l5O million
Yulara international tour-
ist resort at Ayers Rock is
due for completion next
year.
At the Alice, against a
backdrop of the Mac Do-
nnell Ranges, gamblers sun
themselves beside the
bright blue swimming pool
of the Casino Hotel, and
wait for the roulette wheels
to resume spinning. In a
deal that some find curi-
ous, the Northern Territory
Government is taking over
the Darwin and Alice
Springs casinos from Federal Hotels.
Said one Alice Springs businessman:
“Paul Everingham has been living too
close to his mates Marcos and Lee Kuan
Yew for too long,” Paul Everingham as
well as being chief minister for the Ter-
ritory is Minister for Lands, Industrial
Development and Tourism. Joe Martin
has been doing the floorshow at the Ca-
sino Hotel. “It’s not Vegas,” he says rue-
fully.
At Coles Supermarket, which has
one of the biggest turnovers of any
Coles store in Australia, a dozen Abor-
igines sit and wait patiently and silently
for the liquor section to open. Sharp on


The dry river bed of the Todd: a noticeable change took place overnight with the introduction of new drinking laws
12 o’clock, the first one rises, walks to
the shelf carrying flagons of Orlando
moselle “52.75 save $1.05” and
makes his purchase. The flagon goes
into a plastic shopping bag and he de-
parts. The others follow. Moselle has
become the new favorite since the sale
of fortified wines was restricted. On
every second Wednesday when the so-
cial security cheques “sit-down
money” are collected, the queues are
much longer. Money as well as moselle
flows.
Everyone has been complimenting
Mrs Leslie Oldfield, the mayor (“don’t
call me the mayoress!”) on how neat
and tidy Alice Springs is looking. “We
had this magic thing happen,” she ex-
plains. “Eighteen months ago the gov-
ernment brought in the two-kilometre
law which makes it illegal for anyone to
drink in a public place within two kilo-
metres of a licensed outlet. Overnight it
changed Alice Springs from the real
rubbish dump it was becoming.”
The Todd River beds are noticeably
dry in more ways than one. The groups
of Aborigines who used to gather there
and drink have disappeared. They are
not in the pubs either. The Riverside
Hotel, which was their favorite has
changed owners and last month became
the Todd Tavern complete with chand-
eliers, indoor fountain, security guards
and a yellow baby grand piano. The
sign in the red-carpeted foyer says “No
Jeans, No T-shirts, No Thongs.” The
Stuart Arms has also changed hands
the beer garden has been closed and the
sign out front says “No thongs, No
workclothes, No soiled Clothes, Man-
agement Discretion Prevails.” The only
Aborigine I saw in Alice Springs who
would have passed the dress rules for
either hotel was Neville Bonner, who
was visiting on ABC business.
Most Alice Springs hotels have
changed ownership in the last few years
and the small family-run motels are fast
disappearing. “Big money has taken
over,” said a bank manager. The new
Sheraton International Hotel being
built near The Gap will cost $34 million
and have 250 rooms.
Leslie Oldfield, who used to be per-
sonal secretary to Eddie Connellan, of
air\vays fame, came to Alice Springs on
a six-month working holiday in 1969
and stayed. “I certainly didn’t think that
one day I’d be mayor,” she said from
behind a tidy desk in the council cham-
bers. There is about her an air of quiet
efficiency. Her politics are conservative
but unlike most of her predecessors she
listens to the Aborigines. She attended a
cross-cultural course at the Institute of
Aboriginal Development and feels that
she has a good relationship with the
Aborigines. Not that she has any time
for “the white stirrers.”
The visitor to Alice Springs
fast discovers that “the
white stirrers,” “the white
do-gooders” have the
blackest name in town.
Oldfield has been may-
or for just over 12 months.
She is the first woman may-
or of Alice Springs and
was the only woman on the
council for four years. At
last month’s election, how-
ever, three more women
were elected, as was an
Aborigine, former boxer
Bob Liddle who in the
Berto McMasters
mid-60s fought for the Victorian welter-
weight title.
Alice Springs’ new neat-and-tidy
look came not only from the two-kilo-
metre law, Oldfield said. There was the
Territory Tidy Towns competition,
which offered prizes of $lO,OOO for tidy
towns, and TALC the Territory Anti-
Litter Committee which has organised
payment for the collection of cans and
bottles.
“It’s getting that way that if you drop
something, there is someone there to
pick it up,” she said. The Conservation
Commission was also doing its bit by
cleaning up the river banks, cutting
grass, planting trees and building picnic
furniture. Alice Springs had just become
the first Life Be In It town in Australia
which meant that everyone was being
encouraged to take part in community
activities.
It’s too late to rescue Todd Street, the
main street of Alice Springs. With the
exception of Adelaide House the old
Flynn-designed hospital and
Marron’s newsagency
which still has overhanging
posted verandahs, all the
old buildings have been
replaced by newer and
uglier ones. Tourist shops
with names such as Dinki-
Di Gifts and Red Heart
Souvenirs sell the usual “I
Climbed Ayers Rock”
teatowels and Aboriginal
watercolors that all too
often appear to have come
off an assembly line.
In nearby Hartley
Street, many of the old
houses remain and Abor-

iginal organisations occupy several of
them. The taxi-driver who delivered me
to the Aboriginal Legal Aid office said:
“Now you’ll get a load of negative
bullshit.”
It is recognised as one of the best
legal aid offices in the country and can
take credit for the fact that there is less
police brutality in Alice Springs than
anywhere else in the Territory.
The office has a staff of 20 and
Scottish-born Pam Ditton is one of five
white lawyers. She was due in court that
afternoon for the trial of Jimmy
Jungari. “We run more murder trials
out of this office than anywhere else in
Australia,” she said.
She had worked in neighborhood
law centres in London during the early
70s and was invited to apply for the job
at Alice Springs. “I said I was free to
come for nine months and ended up
staying,” she said. “I thought the job
was important and the country was
special. But we are a drastically under-
funded, under-resourced organisation.”
The roof leaks, sheets of plastic cover
the files and there are only the modest
beginnings of a law library. Ditton has
about her the weariness and the deter-
mination of the embattled. She is well
aware of the prejudice against white ad-
visers.
She said: “Of course there are silly
white advisers no movement is with-
out counter-productive mem-
bers, but that is not the issue.
White advisers are being
scape-goated by people who
find it convenient to attack
Aboriginal aspirations.”
Despite a number of recent
cases in which Northern Ter-
ritory Supreme Court judges
had freed Aborigines on man-
slaughter charges that
involved the pay-back killings
of tribal law, Ditton said legis-
lative policy was hardening
against Aboriginal customary
law. Some provisions in the
new 1984 Northern Territory
Criminal Code worked
against Aboriginal people.
Tennant Creek stipendiary
magistrate Denis Barritt, pre-
viously at the bar in Victoria,
has his own strong views on
customary law. He said: “It’s
a terribly harsh system of jus-
tice and it is terribly unevenly
applied any law that applies
unevenly applies unfairly.
“If courts make a practice
of giving credence to tribal
justice, as it is erroneously
called, they are denying rights
to decent Aboriginal Austra-
lians that the law ought to
protect. Aboriginal customary
law still provides for a person
Vincent Jamina (front) and friends visit Mt Nancy
to be killed or to be seriously physically
assaulted both by spearing and nulla
nullas.
“These assaults are extremely severe
and I don’t think that an Aborigine
should be subject to that sort of punish-
ment. He is entitled to be protected by
Australian law.
“I don’t see any reasons for preserv-
ing an anthropological dreamtime for
the future by holding back the natural
Barb Shaw with niece Lindy Lou Shaw: a long-term optimism
development of the law for all Austra-
lians, black or white.”
While lawyers argue, Pat Miller, 36,
director of the Legal Aid Office and sis-
ter of the Aboriginal council member
Bob Liddle, worries about her people’s
most desperate problem. “There’s just
too much grog flowing in this town,” she
said. Miller joined the office as a filing
clerk seven years ago and has been its
director for 18 months. She used to
work at the airport canteen
and has no legal qualifica-
tions, but she has others
compassion and a gentle wis-
dom. She has two children,
one at high school and one at
primary school.
“The amount of drink that
is readily available is really
sickening,” she said. “The cor-
ner shops that used to sell for-
tified wine now sell casks of
moselle and riesling, all
wrapped and ready to go. The
community of Alice Springs is
worried about how many
drunks are around town and
the disturbances they cause,
but nobody wants to look into
why it is happening.”
Miller remembers the Ab-
original stockmen who used
to come to town at the week-
ends, all dressed up and
proud as peacocks. Everyone
would gather in Todd Street
on Saturday mornings. There
are no longer jobs for Abor-
iginal stockmen they lost
them in 1967 when the law
said they had to be paid white
men’s wages and motor bikes
and helicopters have taken
their place. “It makes my
heart ache to see them now,”
said Miller. “To see how al-


Winning by a long neck: the Camel Cup is now an annual event
cohol has taken over. It seems as if they
have lost everything.”
At the Aboriginal radio station run
by CAAMA the Central Australian
Aboriginal Media Association the
mood is cheerful. It’s a ramshackle
place with the usual dogs and Toyotas
in the yard. On the door of the tiny stu-
dio is a sign, “DON’T SCRATCH ANY
MORE BLOODY RECORDS OK?”
CAAMA broadcasts five days a week in
five different languages through the
Alice Springs community FM station. It
also produces monthly cassettes that are
mailed to 31 remote Aboriginal com-
munities. The cassettes contain news,
information, music and stories. The
Warumpi Band is a favorite, as is the
rock group Coloured Stone. CAAMA,
which has been operating for four years,
also has a video unit and has just
launched its own record label, Imparja,
an Arrernte word for tracks. Thirteen
people work at the radio station inclu-
ding three interpreters, six announcers
and a couple of white advisers. “Don’t
quote me,” said training officer Russell
Guy. “I’m just a white fella.” All white
advisers are extremely wary about being
quoted. Rod Cooch, also white, arrives
with a truckload of packages for
mailing the cassettes. “What’s that thing
on my desk?” he asks. It is a white con-
tainer, a metre wide. I suggest, half
joking, that it might be a computer.
Janet, the administrator, looks up from
putting $5O notes into pay packets and
says “That’s right, that’s the computer.”
The computer is plopped on to the floor
and Guy sells me a $6 CAAMA cassette
which includes a lively version of Three
Blind Mice sung in Pitjantjatjarra.
The 1300 Aborigines who live in the
17 town camps surrounding Alice
Springs, now have their own council
Tangentyere an Arrernte word mean-
ing “Working together.” The day I
arrived the Liquor Committee was
meeting to discuss action on the two-
kilometre law. (All the Aboriginal or-
ganisations are strong on committees,
meetings and background papers.) The
law, explains a council staffer, is placing
enormous pressure on the camps where
Aborigines are learning to cope with liv-
ing in houses and adjusting to a new
way of life. People who never came near
the camps now use them as safe places
for drinking. The result violence and
vandalism. That Liquor Committee
wants exempt areas established in the
Todd, within the two-kilometre zone.
Bob Durnan, a red-bearded former
Adult Education instructor and assist-
ant co-ordinator of the council, said:
“One of the things that I find encoura-
ging in Alice Springs is that the people
here have begun to take grog problems
very seriously. A lot of Abor-
iginal leaders don’t drink at
all and there is a move
towards Aboriginal manage-
ment of grog problems.”
(Durnan uses one language
for me and another when
talking to Aborigines drop-
ping “gs” and saying “youse”
instead of “you.”)
He said there had been im-
provement in the town’s
white/black relations. Alice
Springs was still very con-
servative but the “white-fella”
attitudes were becoming less
extreme and the mayor and
some of the new council mem-
bers were more prepared to
talk and listen.
Durnan drove to two of the
camps where building was go-
ing on. Both were deserted but
as we were leaving the second,
Berto McMasters arrived,
climbed aboard a large yellow
earthmoving machine and amid clouds
of dust and deafening noise began to
attack the surrounding rubble,
The two new besser brick houses at
the camp designed for extended fam-
ilies were locked up, fenced in and
had never been used. They were waiting
for water and power services to be con-
nected and had been waiting some time,
If at times the government appears to be
throwing money recklessly at the Abor-
igines, at other times it seems to be
meanly withholding it. Out at the Mt
Nancy camp the scene was a lot more
hopeful. Young men were chopping
wood and digging a pit for the next
day’s barbecue. A Land Council meet-
ing was to be held and roast kangaroo
was planned.

You’re a business executive so you won’t mind discussing money,
will you?
You see it’s like this. When we opened the Southern Cross in
Sydney we knew we were up against some pretty stiff competition.
So we had to match it.
With spacious rooms, stylishly decorated. With staff who
understand that the sole objective of their working day is to make you
comfortable.
We added a few extras that the other luxury hotels don’t have. Like
a rooftop garden with heated swimming pool and sauna.
Having matched the competition we decided to make a stay at the
Southern Cross an even more attractive business proposition.
By offering you rates that will bring a smile to your accountant’s
face.
They’re below other international hotels and they look better the
more you stay with us.
Sydney’s new Southern Cross. It’s a great business
proposition.

Council, lives there. She was
h,- 'n the nearby riverbed
1 ; v s educated at a high
’elaide, trained as
.u did courses in
health education and sociol-
ogy. She is 32, tall, goodlook-
ing and confident. “If I wasn’t
optimistic about the future I
wouldn’t survive, but it’s a
long-term optimism,” she
said.
For her, the development
of the Aboriginal organisa-
tions is the most positive thing
happening. Aboriginal people
are doing things for them-
selves. Home care and ser-
vices for old people are being
established, and health care
and simple household
maintenance-are being taught.
“Mistakes are being made
but we are learning from our
mistakes,” she said. “And
more and more Aboriginal
people are acquiring skills
that will give them the oppor-
tunity for employment.
“The lease granted to the
Mt Nancy camp was the first
and we’ve been the guinea
pigs. There’s this attitude that
at the camps the blackfella’s
on a good wicket. But we pay
water rates, electricity, rent. Each family
and each house has to pay rent. Now 14
more leases have been granted. We
build houses on the leases but the De-
partment of Transport and Works has
to inspect them and put on power and
water. Sometimes the houses stand emp-
ty for months on end.”
Shaw defended the role of the white
advisers. Bob Hawke and Bill Hayden
were allowed to have their advisers, how
much more necessary they were for the
Aboriginal people, most of whom could
neither read nor write. “No white men
are in any policy-making positions
the decisions are made by black
people,” she said.
Many of the white businessmen of
Alice Springs do not agree. “The Abor-
igines have simply exchanged one set of
overlords for another,” said one Todd
Street retailer. “The white stirrers
threaten them with ‘Do this or you
won’t get your Toyota.’ They have the
power and they control the purse
strings.”
He resented the waste of money
Aborigines with charge accounts for
their taxis, thousands of dollars of tax-
payers’ money spent each week on taxis.
But further north in the territory, he
said, it was even worse thousands
more dollars spent on chartering air-
craft. At least in Alice Springs it was
only a taxi drive to Liquorland or the
corner store.
Two of the 190,000 visitors to the Alice in the past 12 months
Eighty-three-year-old Xavier Her-
bert, late of Redlynch, Far North
Queensland, has returned to the North-
ern Territory to die. He has given away
his possessions and lives in his 20-year-
old Landrover on the Ross River where
he is finishing his autobiography. “The
Northern Territory belongs to two races
both very determined not to share it,”
he said.
But until the white men gave back to
the black man some of his land, the
whites would remain “a people without
integrity, not a nation, but a community
of thieves.”
Former motel-owner Reg Harris
came to Alice Springs in 1947 when the
population was fewer than 1000 and
everyone knew one another. The main
industry was cattle and if there was a
six-month drought, the town was broke.
You could buy a block of land for £5
($10). He is now 60, wealthy, semi-re-
tired and not pleased to find himself one
of the oldest men in town. “Ninety per-
cent of the people who live here haven’t
been here for more than two or three
years,” he said. “The average age of the
population is 15.” Harris used to play
football with Charlie Perkins: “Why
should he be allowed to call himself an
Aborigine he’s only a quarter caste? I
can remember when if you called some
of these half-castes a blackfellow they’d
thump you.”
Harris said there was no color bar in
Alice Springs, only a hygiene
bar “Anyone who looks
after himself is accepted.”
Harris, having made his
pile, is no longer sure that the
Aborigine doesn’t have the
right attitude to life after all.
“There’s never been a case of
an Aborigine with a stomach
ulcer,” he said. “There were
days when I’d be working
hard and I’d see an Aborigine
sitting under a tree in the
Todd having a cold beer and
I’d wonder what I was doing.”
David Ross, as secretary to
the executive of the Central
Land Council, knows what he
is doing fighting for land
rights and the recognition of
sacred sites. The people at the
Land Council are openly hos-
tile; whites are the enemy.
Ross, neatly bearded, quietly
spoken, had been to Canberra
the day before for the inevi-
table meeting this time with
the Prime Minister. The
Northern Territory Land
Rights Act had been under at-
tack and Ross had sought an
assurance that there wouldn’t
be any changes to it. “We got
no assurance from the Prime
Minister at all,” he said. He
handed me a media release and a back-
ground paper. He had another meeting
to go to but spoke briefly about sacred
sites. “Sacred sites are the boss of the
land,” he said. “If there were no sacred
sites there wouldn’t be any Aboriginal
land left.”
Last year, a sacred site was pro-
claimed in the middle of the course for
Henley-On-Todd. This annual antic, a
waterless boat-race, together with the
Bangtail Muster and the Camel Cup is
one of the most important events on the
Centralian calendar. It is a day when
racial tensions are mostly forgotten and
Alice Springs once again becomes an
old-fashioned outback town that knows
how to enjoy itself. For Henley-On-
Todd a detour of the sacred site was
organised.
However, plans to build a large rec-
reation dam on the edge of the town are
held up because another sacred site has
been proclaimed. The pro-dammers say
they don’t want to destroy the sacred
site merely cover it with 10m of water.
THE LAW courts in Alice Springs are
among its most imposing buildings. It
was here that the famous Azaria Cham-
berlain inquest was held. Very few at-
tended the trial of Jimmy Jungari. It
was a small, sad drama. He was found
guilty of manslaughter and unlawful
wounding and remanded in custody un-
til July 27. □


Advent ure Country
Just getting to Karawari is an
adventure. Yet its one of the
300 best hotels in the world.
The jungle-fringed Karawari
River winds majestically through
the remote East Sepik region of
Papua New Guinea, passing on
its way some of the country’s most
isolated and primitive villages.

A hotel built by hand
High on a ridge overlooking the
river is Karawari Lodge, a hotel
built like a Sepik village. Among
the privileged travellers who have
stayed there is top international
travel writer Rene Lecler. He was
so impressed with the other-
worldly isolation of Karawari
that he included the Lodge
in the latest edition of his book
The Best 300 Hotels in the World!

A singular sense of style
Karawari offers its guests an
uncommonly high level of personal
service. Your laundry is spirited
away and returned, hand'\vashed
and ironed before you realise
that it has gone. You are woken
in the morning with steaming
coffee and fragrant freshly baked
cinnamon rolls, which you can
eat on your own private balcony
as you watch the mist rise over
the endless sea of jungle. You
dine in style, surrounded by a
collection of artifacts that would
be the envy of any art museum.

Excursions into history
In villages upstream and down,
ancient ceremonies, dances and
rituals are re-enacted for Karawari
visitors. This is probably the only
place on earth you can photograph
the living past.

Simply grand
A lofty central building in the
form of a Haus Tamboran or
spirit house acts as bar, lounge
and dining hall, dou sleep in
smaller houses on stilts, with
roofs thatched in local grass,
walls lined with wonderful hand-
woven mats-and Sepik River
wood carvings as bedside tables!
(Concessions to European
comforts include private bath-
rooms and a swimming pool.)
Numbers are limited
At Karawari you’re a guest, not
a client. It is essential to make
reservations well in advance.

How to be seen by th
It’s a very simple matter to have your
commercial seen by the whole state.
All you have to do is run it on every
commercial television station in the state.
And then, to be sure everyone sees it,
run all your spots on all channels at once.
Of course, while this is a highly efficient
way of reaching everyone you want to reach,
it’s not exactly cost efficient.
Except in Tasmania. Where this kind of
schedule happens automatically through the
Tasbuy network.

Australia’s only watertight television market.


Next, a magazine that gives you a smorgasbord
PHILLIP ADAMS
AS YOU’LL HAVE noticed, this publi-
cation is currently celebrating the im-
probable matrimony of Kerry Packer
with Katharine Graham. That is, the
blending of Bulletin with Newsweek.
This is but the initial step in creating the
world’s first all-purpose, all-encompass-
ing magazine, containing the most de-
sirable attributes of a plethora of publi-
cations.
Within the next few months, Bulletin-
Newsweek will start featuring Norman
Rockwell covers from the Saturday Eve-
ning Post and the fuzzy, Guccioni cen-
trefolds from Penthouse. The Bulletin
has, for many years, reprinted the pick
of Punch cartoons and will soon, I’m
told, reprint the editorials from Pravda
and the recipes from L’Humanite. I
understand that Mr Packer is currently
negotiating with the Watch Tower, the
Salvation Army’s War Cry and Herbert
W. Armstrong’s Plain Truth, so that the
spiritual needs of our readers will be
catered for in an ecumenical
smorgasbord.
Instead of having to sub-
scribe, expensively, to ump-
teen mastheads, you will
simply have one, even if you
do have to lug it around in a
wheelbarrow. For as a service
to readers, the organically-
growing, ballooning Bulletin
will also subsume journals de-
voted to CB radio and chick-
en sexing while embracing,
betwixt its generous covers,
the inflight magazines of
Garuda, Aer Lingus and In-
terjlug. Voyeurs of interior
decoration will no longer
need to invest in Architectural
Digest The Bulletin will take
you to the boudoirs of Burts
Reynolds and Lancaster.
There will also be a tasteful
selection of half-naked
Hottentots from the National
Geographic, a lift-out version
of the Gideon Bible and ex-
tracts from Hansard.
ALL THAT is needed to
make The Bulletin-Newsweek-
Punch-Saturday Evening Post-
Plain Truth, etc, the ultimate
reading experience is, in my
view, a selection of the car-
toons from New Yorker, to
which I am hopelessly ad-
dicted. Since the days of
Thurber, I’ve been buying
New Yorker not for the prose, which I
understand is exemplary, or even for
Pauline Kael’s vindictive film reviews
but for the doodles of Steinberg,
Addams, Saxon, Stephenson, Booth,
Miller, Steiner and Webber to name but
a few of the magazine’s admirable
jesters.
The jokes are rarely funny in the
belly-laugh sense. They tend to be wry
comments on metropolitan anxieties,
subversive counterpoint to the up-mar-
ket pretensions of the New Yorker’s
prestige advertisements. They are
poignant, melancholic and disap-
pointed jokes for poignant, melancholic
and disappointed readers.
The most recent issue to arrive in my
letterbox is cover-dated March 26 and I
offer you a random cross-section.
Seven men with absurd, identikit
smiles of rigor mortis rigidity crowd a
car. “The person we have to thank is
Arthur here,” says one of the crazed
“What this place needs is a film festival”
NEW YORKER
smilers. “He’s the one with the infec-
tious grin.”
“General Hoskings,” says the Chief
of Staff in a Pentagon meeting attended
by a dozen five-star generals with hec-
tares of service ribbons, “I don’t care if
you are in charge of our Star Wars de-
fence. You must wear a regulation uni-
form.” General Hoskings sits among
them, wearing the bright, tight under-
wear of a Captain Marvel.
People mill at a Manhattan cocktail
party. “I certainly am worried about the
whales,” says a guest apologetically.
“It’s just that I’m not worried about
them right this minute.”
The scene is a small lounge-room.
While husband sits reading beneath a
standard lamp, his wife has spread
newspapers on the table and is em-
broiled with seedlings, potting soil and
hanging baskets. Her expression is
transfixed, wistful. “Leon, I think I’d
like to have a farm.”
A couple of peasants, with
donkeys, climb a winding
road to a remote little village
stuck awkwardly on top of a
remote crag. “What this place
needs,” says one, “is a film
festival.”
A king gazes over his
battlements. Far below, in an
otherwise empty vista, stands
a single knight with battle axe.
“We are not under siege, your
majesty,” says a royal offsider.
“You just have a siege mental-
ity.”
And a woman of singular
unattractiveness, with hair
like a doormat, gazes bale-
fully into the mirror as she in-
structs her hairdresser: “I
don’t care what you do as
long as it says ‘spring’.”
A pompous boss finds him-
self in the lift (or as the Ameri-
cans call it, the elevator) with
an underling from middle
management. “Well, Cun-
ningham, it looks like we’re
stuck with each other for the
next 40 seconds.”
A cartoon worthy of
Hieronymous Bosch, wherein
the devil and one of his bu-
reaucrats look down on a
steaming, seething Hades full
of suffering, tormented sin-
ners: “We do pretty well when
you stop to think that people
are basically good.” □

The only thing old fashioned about The Windsor is exceptional service.
A concierge still arranges everything from making reservations in restaurants
and confirming flights, to parking your car. His attention to small details can
change what would otherwise be another monotonous business trip into an
enjoyable experience.
The Windsor is a beautifully restored first class international hotel with all the
modern facilities you now expect. Direct dialling for local, STD and ISD calls, Telex,
secretarial services and a computerised reservation and account system prove it has kept
up with the times.
So the next time you have to go to Melbourne on business, stay at The Windsor.
The services are still exceptional.
People with taste prefer The Windsor.

AD pipes have
some advantages.
Ductile Iron Pipe is a major
step forward in water supply and
sewage pressure pipe technology.
It is not just a replacement for
grey iron, but a vastly superior
product.
It offers great impact
resistance coupled with high
tensile strength and material
flexibility, allowing it to survive
damage caused during
construction and operation that
would cause failure in plastic,
asbestos and even grey iron.
Ductile Iron Pipe has even
higher corrosion resistance than
grey iron and considering that
there are grey iron pipelines still
effectively functioning after 300
years’ service, long life and low
maintenance can be assured.
Ductile Iron Pipe is
particularly easy to lay.
The 5.5 metre lengths and the
patented “Tyton” Joint gasket
mean quick, leak-tight jointing.
When it’s all added up,
Ductile Iron Pipe is no luxury: it
is the most efficient and cost-
effective pipe you can use.
If you’d like to know more
about our product or our
technical service, then call us now.

Australian photographers turned ver-

tiny (152 cm) Sally Samins took off to
photograph the America’s Cup chal-
lengers in the US, Canada, the UK,
France, West Germany, Sweden, Italy
and New Zealand. Samins, already an
experienced round-the-world sailor, did
what no other Australian apart from
our own Bruce Stannard, who is a re-
porter, anyway thought to do: took
pictures of the last cup challenge and
came back with a wad of snaps of boats
and people. The result of that and her
new travels will be three books, edited
by Jeff Toghill, written by all the OK
yachting writers but photographed by
none but Sal.
Five dons from the University of New
England, in Armidale, NSW, led by
Chancellor Dr Robert Robertson-
Cunninghame, flew to Sydney last week
to bestow an honorary degree of Doctor
of Letters on the distinguished
Hungarian-born Australian artist
Desiderius Orban. The ceremony seems
to have created a world record: Orban
appears to be the oldest recipient of a
doctorate anywhere, ever. He will be
100 next November.
Richie Benaud has a nice story about
Lindsay Hassett in his newly-published
book, On Reflection. Captain of the
1953 Australian cricket team, Hassett,
whose deadpan humor was legendary,
took Benaud and the rest of the contin-
gent to lunch at a swank London hotel.
During dessert, a waiter dropped a dish
of ice-cream into Hassett’s lap. Hassett
got up and removed his trousers,
handed them to the waiter and in-
structed: “Have these sponged and
dried for me, please. And I’ll have an-
other ice-cream.”
In Australia it is acknowledged general-
ly that after, say, her third facelift the
average woman is looking, narrow-
eyed, at her shoulder-blades. In the US,
the worst-kept secret of elegant women
for the past 20 years has been “face
draping,” in which old skin is peeled
away and a new surface makes the
woman or the man permanently 10
to 15 years younger. From London,
where the operation has been In for
nine months, Dr Alan Kingdon arrived
to work at Sydney’s Harley Medical
Centre and defended his craft to Mike
Willesee. Statistics: the job takes one
week, requires then a wait of three
months. Cost, $l5OO. The first three
Australian drapees, all women, are from
Wollongong, NSW.
Sir James Killen: quips and sllps
Now it can be told. Sir James Killen,
former Defence minister, last week ex-
plained the background to his memor-
able quote (when in opposition during
the Whitlam days), “Australia would
not be able to protect Botany Bay on a
hot Sunday afternoon.” The repentant
Killen recalled that he had just arrived
at the Leichhardt Hotel in Rockhamp-
ton and was having a beer when the
phone rang. The plummy voice at the
other end said the caller was from the
BBC in London doing a round-up on
commonwealth defence capability.
Killen then was shadow spokesman for
defence. What were his views? “I was
quite convinced that a friend, a col-
league or an opponent was indulging in
what might be described as a payback,”
Killen wrote last week in Brisbane’s
Courier-Mail. But it was the BBC and
the story cabled back from London
hung round Killen’s neck when he be-
came minister. Warning of the danger
of quick quips, he listed some other
clangers: the late Arthur Calwell’s immi-
gration gem, “Two Wongs don’t make a
white,” and Malcolm Fraser’s “Life
wasn’t meant to be easy.” Mused Killen
in his article: “But then, if the mistakes,
the whims, the excesses and the aberra-
tions of those in politics were not re-
ported, political literature would be
given a new dimension of dullness.”
In Croydon, SA, Bill Fox, 80 who,
according to Brian Gill in the Adelaide
Advertiser, is “no bigger than a jumps
jockey” was still hoping to get some-
body to challenge him at hoisting
100 kg; still doing what he’s been doing
in his own gymnasium for 60 years:
pumping iron and swelling a chest the
size of a water-butt. When William
Arthur Fox was 74, he was the national
over-50 weightlifting champion. Then
he was billed as “the strongest man for
his age in the world” and that was in
Perth where everyone is older and
stronger than anyone anywhere. The
Fox secret: chomp lots of oatmeal, mil-
let, buckwheat, prunes, raisins, fish and
fresh fruit, not too much red meat, drink
nothing, but nothing, with meals and
take plenty of vitamin tablets.


In New York, Yoko Ono set up an auc-
tion that raised $500,000 selling relics of
her life with John Lennon. Their 1965
Rolls-Royce brought $209,328, a
Lennon guitar about $25,000. Which
made it a pity that there was no way that
dingalings could buy (a) the spoons
from which they sniffed and became
hooked on heroin in the late 1960 s
and (b) the two acorns they planted at
an “exhibition of British sculpture” at
Coventry Cathedral about the same
time. Over the implantation was to be a
brass plaque declaring “ ‘John’ by Yoko
Ono and ‘Yoko’ by John Lennon.”
When the cathedral’s Canon Verney said
that he didn’t think it was sculpture,
Yoko, “spluttering with fury,” tried to
appeal to Henry Moore but the great
sculptor couldn’t be found. It didn’t
matter much. The acorns were stolen a
week later and, by the time replace-
ments had been sent, people had lost in-
terest. Today, if discovered, the acorns
or possibly oaks would bring hard-
ly more than $lO,OOO each.
Gudrun and Wilfred Brend recently got
hitched underwater in a swimming pool
in Westphalia in West Germany. A
scuba-wearing marriage celebrant
asked: “Will you share your cylinder for
the rest of your lives?” They gave a
thumbs-up and swam off to the strains
of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles.
Lord Carrington, ex-United Kingdom
High Commissioner in Canberra who
resigned as Foreign Secretary during
the Falklands crisis, has just taken over
civilian command of NATO. Before he
left London, his friends farewelled him
at a Kentucky Fried Chicken shop in
Kensington where the 80 VIPs licked
their fingers in parting salute. The
Kremlin must now be wondering about
this Colonel Sanders and his role in
NATO.
Somewhere in the US they are making a
TV documentary (officially called a
“docudrama”) on the boxing career of
Joe Louis who was perhaps as good a
heavyweight as the world has known.
The screenplay is by Budd Schulberg
and the producers wanted Peter Allen to
do the theme song. He was enthusiastic
but “Who’s Joe Louis?” he asked. The
publicists, having pulled themselves
together and mopped their streaming
brows, hurried to point out to the press
that Allen, after all, had been but a lad
growing up in Australia when the
Brown Bomber was at it. Which could
well mean that Allen now believes that
Joe Louis was a Sydney parking cop.

David Yallop’s book In God’s Name,
which says that Pope John Paul I was

two weeks after publication in the UK
figures to warm the heart of any pub-
lisher. But in Australia the rate was as-
tonishing a first print run of 17,500
copies sold with hardly more than a
mention. Why should this be? Is the
percentage of Catholics here greater?
Possibly it has something to do with the
promotional work of The—Australian
Publishing Co’s John Cody or with his
“family” interest: one of ths alleged
conspirators was Cardinal John Cody.

different from the South Africa I saw
first 11 years ago would be the under-
statement of the week.
For one thing, television. Back in
1973 the magic box was barred, re-
garded as a thing of potential evil.
Today, tens of thousands of blacks
watch the antics of The A-Team and
cheer Mr T, the black hero of the series.
And just imagine, in 1973, advertise-
ments in the papers urging attendance,
for those interested, at gay bars. Yet
today the ads are there.
In the luxury Carlton Hotel in
Johannesburg and the four-star
Burgerspark Hotel in Pretoria, the scene
is black and white; white South
Africans, coloreds, blacks and Indians
all moving with perfect amity in the
rooms, restaurants and bars.
It might have been a bit too soon
when Harold Macmillan first men-
tioned the winds of change but there is
no doubt that the winds of change are
whispering around South Africa and
nothing will stop them blowing
stronger.
Before anyone says I’ve been
“snowed” let me say that much that is
abominable remains the pass laws,
the Group Areas Act and other inhu-
man restrictions.
But the move to better days is appar-
ent in the end of petty apartheid, in the
extraordinary freedom of the press, in
the obvious lessening of tension and the
setting up of a new parliament to in-
clude coloreds and Indians (for a start).
THE CHANGES in this country have
been so dramatic that the ruling Nation-
al Party has splintered, the extreme con-
servatives not only distancing them-
selves from their own party but also
leaving the Broedersbond, the strange
secret society which held the high
Afrikaners together.
Talking to Dr W. Breytenbach, the
youthful architect of the new constitu-
tion, I asked if blacks also would have
parliamentary representation soon. “It
would be hard to put a date on that,” he
said. “But it is not impossible it will
happen.”
Breytenbach, like everyone I have
seen, is ecstatic about the positive reac-
tion South Africa has had from all
Western countries to the new constitu-
tion.
The only country to hold out was
Australia, which greeted the news sour-
ly. “They wouldn’t even say it was a
Harry Oppenheimer: hater of apartheid but lover of his country
move in the right direction,” said
Breytenbach.
DR DANIE CRAVEN, South Africa’s
rugby guru, believes South Africa will
be back in the world’s sports arena with-
in five years. In a most extraordinary
interview given to a London journalist,
Craven got stuck into South Africa’s
sporting administrators, accusing some
tour managers of being “disastrous am-
bassadors” for their country.
He said it was essential that in future
team managers should be English and
not Afrikaans speakers. “Our case must
be argued to the world in English, not
Afrikaans,” said Craven.
JOHN OXLEY, former South African
ambassador in Canberra, retired from
the diplomatic service after his Austra-
lian tour of duty. But not from work. He
has set up a most successful photo-
graphic agency known as Spix Inter-
national.
HARRY OPPENHEIMER, just retired
boss of Anglo American and De Beers,
is a passionate South African a hater
of apartheid but a lover of his country.
In Johannesburg I went to his man-
sion, Brenthurst, in the grounds of
which he has built a magnificent library
for the use of students of South African
history. It contains books about the
country going back several hundred
years, volumes which would cause a riot
if ever put up at Sotheby’s or Christie’s.
Dominating the library is a mural
which Oppenheimer commissioned
from Australian Len French, depicting
French’s view of Africa. An interesting,
huge work, it is filled with figures black
and white.
At the opening of the library Alan
Paton, the famous anti-apartheid author
(Cry the Beloved Country), who is un-
moved by recent lessening of tensions,
made a speech saying he saw in the
painting the overthrow of the whites by
the blacks.
Oppenheimer, in his speech, went for
the optimistic view. In his opinion
French has painted the eventual
reconciliation between black and white
and their march towards joint progress.
It’s one of those paintings where you
pays your money and you takes your
choice.
TO REVERT to TV. The independent
state of Bophuthatswana, close to the
centre of South Africa’s most populous
areas, has its own TV, known fondly as
Bop TV. South Africans get their sets
adjusted to pick up the signal, much to

the annoyance of the South African
broadcasting system.
Bop is about to screen Dynasty,
which will draw rapt attention from the
inhabitants of Soweto, not exactly fam-
iliar with the Dynasty milieu or be-
haviour.
TALKING of Soweto, that million-
strong enclave of humanity on the out-
skirts of Johannesburg is looking a lot
better than when I saw it last. Now that
the inhabitants can buy their houses, at-
tention is being paid to appearance.
Houses are being painted and some are
being almost rebuilt. In some cases two
small houses have been joined together
and a top floor added.
There is still plenty of sordid housing
in Soweto but there are also some
luxury homes, generally belonging to
doctors or owners of the supermarkets.
Outside one house I saw the latest
BMW, outside another a Mercedes 450.
The deputy mayor of Soweto, Isaac
Buthelexi, told me that the electrifica-
tion of Soweto had made a tremendous
difference to life. Television sets by the
thousands are being installed, along
with refrigerators and other comforts.
But the locals won’t get rid of their
coke stoves, so the smog problem which
hangs over Soweto will remain. “We
think it’s sensible to keep our stoves in
case the electricity breaks down,” said
Buthelezi, “and, besides, most women
prefer to cook in a coke oven than an
electric one.”
THE professional drain from South Af-
rica is down to a trickle and some South
Africans who migrated for various
reasons are coming home.
In the past couple of weeks two doc-
tors who went to Canada have returned
to South Africa.
FROM THE chill, Transvaal winds
which had Johannesburg down to 10 de-
grees I flew to the balmy breezes of Dur-
ban, where it was 25 degrees and warm
enough for intrepid bathers to be out
looking for the big waves.
I was the guest of the committee at
the Oceanair Derby at Durban’s mag-
nificent Clairwood course. The new
stand at Clairwood, based on Long-
champs, cost $7 million and is one of
the best I have seen. The view of the
racing is unparalleled and the facilities
for the public excellent.
The derby was won by an Argentine
filly. Argentina is to South African turf
men what New Zealand is to Australia.
The trainers fly to Buenos Aires for the
sales, pick up the likely champions and
fly them to the Cape, a seven-hour flight.
The hospitality at Clairwood was tre-
mendous but winners even with com-
mittee assistance were no easier to
pick than in Australia. □

Little wonder when you consider few hotels in Singapore

Whether it’s the Brunei Suite in the tower with its private

The Goodwood has ten restaurants (offering Continental

The naked and the (hopefully) dead
RON SAW
THERE ARE times when I think that I
may have spent quite half of my life
passing among my fellow men in a state
of nudity. I use the word men in its gen-
eric form and it may be misleading: I
could stroll, mother-naked, with 90 per-
cent of the men in Australia and worry
not at all; it’s the women who catch me
on the wrong foot, so to speak.
For some arcane reason, I can’t wear
pyjamas ... well, that’s a bit of a sol-
ecism, too: I can put ’em on, pull ’em
up, fasten the waistline, button up the
jacket and all will be okay if I want to
spend the night or the day doing
nothing more than digging in the gar-
den, presiding over an annual general
meeting or packing down in the second
row for Parramatta.
But let me anywhere near a bed and
ruin sets in. What feels like a straitjacket
falls around my shoulders and begins to
shrink under my armpits. My legs,
which for maybe 15 hours have waved
free as those of a tarantula or a giraffe,
now seem to be wrapped as those of the
pharaoh Tutankhamen. If the weather is
hot or if I’m sleeping with an electric
blanket, the straitjacket and bandages
seem to be made of chewing-gum it-
self an unpleasant sensation.
Until I was 30 years of age I had no
such trouble. At school I slept, in
pyjamas, under heavy rugs on a mat-
tress perhaps 2cm thick that was made
of some astonishingly-hard vegetable
matter: some said it was dried kelp,
some said carrageen though I think
that carrageen was the stuff they put into
cough mixture. But I digress.
On these terrible mattresses, in
pyjamas, I would sleep for eight hours
without moving. In a hospital bed,
which is not much better than the kelp
or carrageen, I might be wearing gossa-
mer or, at most, the Emperor’s New
Clothes.
One night in Vietnam I slept, on a
blow-up mattress, wearing not only
jungle greens but also huge boots, about
50m away from a thunderclapping Am-
erican artillery battery. About every
four minutes a barrage of crashes
caused me to arise, horizontally, per-
haps 15cm from my bed, sobbing with
terror. Yet I lost not a wink of sleep.
Now show me a pyjama and a bed to
go with it and it’s straitjackets all over
again.
So I sleep in the raw.
There has been all kinds of trouble
mostly to do with intrusive hotel maids
but one of my worst moments came in
Paddington, NSW, with a lady named
Carmencita, or something, who used to
Do for my wife.
One morning I had been lying in bed
thinking, vaguely, about the warm,
charming way the morning sun hit our
verandah, drying a number of clothes
my wife had out there on the donkey or
mule or horse or whatever it was called.
It occurred to me that I should bring in
these clothes before I took a shower:
there were some smalls I wanted to wear
that day. I arose, went to the verandah,
collected the clothing, brought it inside
then not thinking as well as perhaps I
might have went back for the donkey.
Two facts now became manifest: I
was naked and in public view from the
east and Carmencita, bent on bed-
making, was approaching from the
west.
Quick as a flash I seized the donkey,
used it to cover my loins, and made a
dash for my bedroom door. The don-
key-mule-horse, being made of thinnish
wire, was a cover so inefficient that Car-
mencita called aloud to her mother and
the Holy Mother of God to protect her,
slammed and locked the door. So I
stood there on the verandah, naked and
shouting and observed with alarm,
scandal and concern by perhaps 40 of
the Italians who lived in a house across
Glenmore Road.
I don’t remember how I escaped. I
don’t like to think about it. Certainly I
was trying to put it out of my mind
about a month later when the Ameri-
cans made their first landing on the
Moon. I had been shaving, naked as
usual, when I had realised that the land-
ing was on TV and, with a fully-lathered
face, I had rushed downstairs
to watch. Now, two hours
later, I was about to climb
back to the bathroom when
the doorbell rang. Dizzily I
opened it to find a wispy
gentleman who might have
been a clergyman but was in
fact an AMP man trying to
sell me a policy. Behind him
stood Adelaide Throttling, the
Shrew of Paddington.
She was, I think, drawing
his attention to the fact that I
had been mother-naked with
the donkey the month before
and now she was tri-
umphantly aghast to find me
not only naked again from my
neck down but also, from
there up, wearing a sort of
icing that had been dry and loathsome
for two hours.
But neither of these embarrassments
compares with that I suffered last week
with Raimunda, yet another of the
ladies who Does for my wife.
She, my wife, had left me a note
which gave Raimunda entirely esoteric
directions which had to do with the
management of our kitchen-tidy.
I was reading it, sitting on a bedroom
settee, when the customary screaming of
the dogs announced that Raimunda had
arrived. Had I been concentrating I’d
have left the note on the kitchen bench,
going about my own occasions and al-
lowing her to go about hers. As it was I
walked slowly to the kitchen, talking:
“Raimunda, my wife asks if you’d
get the prawnheads out of the freezer
and chuck them out before ...”
I think Raimunda and I began
screaming together: I because, I realised
now, I was as usual unclad; she because
(a, b and c) I was unclad and (d) she was
with her husband, Paolo, whose eyes
shone white, their son who began to cry
and their airedale who had come to
play with our dogs and who could only
slink to a place of concealment.
Reacting as usual, I could think only
of my loins; well, my parts. I sought to
cover them with a tea-towel, advanced
and caused the screams to rise shriller.
When, I think, all five us were on the air
I covered myself with the only drape I
could reach: perhaps 40 sq cm of note-
paper. I don’t think it covered much.
I will, I suppose, have to learn to
wear pyjamas. I won’t like it. Nor will
my body. But I’m not too whoop about
what nudity is doing to my mind. □

Superior adidas German
technology delivers the
most advanced running
shoe yet.
The running shoe of the year is here.
New adidas Dynamic. A shoe so
advanced it leaves many high priced
shoes at the back of the field.
adidas Dynamic is the product of
adidas Body Science and unparalleled
knowledge of serious runner’s needs.
Years of intensive research, testing,
then re-testing in the adidas German
laboratories, exhaustive practical testing
in all conditions over all types of terrain,
prove adidas Dynamic features are
unmatched by any competitive shoe.
Now all these proven features are
together in one pair of shoes...
adidas Dynamic.
[A] adidas Dellinger Web reduces
body shock by 10 %*
Every serious runner is aware of
body shock. The heel jarring impact of
about 180 kg reverberates through the
entire body at least 600 times each
kilometre, adidas Dynamic takes it
all in its stride.
The mid-sole wedge design
optimises shock absorption without
sacrificing lateral stability.
To further reduce body shock, only
adidas has the patented Dellinger Web.
Working like a miniature trampoline,
the Dellinger Web’s fine polymide netting
encloses the mid-sole to dissipate shock
by an incredible 10%.
adidas Dynamic gets motion
under control
adidas Dynamic shines again.
Two impressive features enable the shoe
to achieve a remarkable degree of motion
control.
A stable platform for maximum
lift off is provided by a combination
of dual density rubber sole and a unique
preformed heel counter.
[B] Dual density rubber sole for
greater stability
If you tend to overpronate or
oversupinate, adidas Dynamic is the
answer. The rubber sole increases in
density towards the outer edge and in
combination with the concave design,
corrects the foot motion as it strikes
the ground.
An ideal platform is created for
better lift off, lessening the chance
of injury and reducing fatigue.
Traction is also improved
by the unique studded sole configuration.
[C] The preformed heel counter for
extra support
Notice the extended heel counter on
the adidas Dynamic. Because the heel is
the most important part of any running
m
shoe, it’s been preformed from thermo
rubber for effective rear foot control.

The combination of Ghilly lacing and
conventional lacing allows you to choose
the ideal lacing pattern. The best possible
fit, guaranteed.

The suede upper on the adidas
Dynamic is sculptured at the correct flex
points. So the adidas Dynamic flexes for
improved roll off and weight transfer after
the ball of the foot hits the ground.
[H] Dual nylon mesh toe box

It’s no secret, your foot generates
excessive heat during a run. The nylon
mesh upper provides maximum ventilation

The vital Achilles tendon is well
protected as the heel is comfortably held

wear out points
adidas Dynamic covers the traditional
weak points of shoe construction with
extra reinforcing. So you can expect
adidas Dynamic to take plenty of punish-
ment without punishing your feet.
There’s never been a better running
shoe. There won’t be, for some time
to come.
Try a pair on at your nearest adidas
retailer.
Because adidas Dynamic stays
ahead of the competition, so can you.

Norm just won’t be in it
BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
IF YOU go to Melbourne picture edi-
tors or TV news directors and ask for
their Top 40 - “Who day by day by day
gets the most relentless exposure?” in-
evitably they come back with Bob
Hawke, the extraordinary Sir Johannes
Bjelke-Petersen, Neville Wran and John
Cain. But immediately after them come
Norm Gallagher and the immediate
tops of the pops VFL footballers such as
Paul Salmon.
Gallagher has become the greatest
folk hero since Ned Kelly. He has a su-
perb advantage: he has been con-
demned by the Prime Minister, con-
demned by the president of the ACTU,
condemned by the Premier of Victoria,
condemned by the AWU and by a
whole gaggle of his fellow unions.
He has been lacerated by The Age,
thundered against by The Herald and
ridiculed daily by the cartoonists.
They’ve got him now very nicely: Norm
of the pudding-basin hair cut, Norm of
the sulky “won’t play” schoolboy ex-
pression, Norm of the early Carson’s
Law button-up shirt-cardigan, Norm of
the noble bay window beer gut.
How easy it is to devise similarities
between Norm of the Life. Be In It cam-
paign and the Norm of the Builders
Laborers’ Federation.
But there is the old law of action and
reaction. It rarely fails in Australia. The
more you knock Norm, the greater hero
he becomes. He hasn’t been hanged like
Ned Kelly but he can show his war
wounds. He has been to jail 55 days
for contempt of court and he could go
again.
Anyone who doubts the devotion
Norm commands should witness his
front-line troops on duty at the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground. It is a strange
scene there and the Melbourne Cricket
Club is almost weeping with frustration.
The MCC wants to spend nigh on $4
million so that it can erect lighting
towers and hold a grand world cricket
cup to celebrate Victoria’s 150th birth-
day come February-March. There has
been no action all year because of bitter
rivalry between the BLF, the AWU and
the Federated Ironworkers’ Association
as to who should do the job.
On June 1 an arbitration commis-
sioner gave the job to the AWU and the
FIA. But Norm battles on, pickets on.
He says he won’t worry if he has to
picket for a year; he’ll win in the end.
So what do they have to do to get the
work done? Go down there any week
day and you’ll get this picture. There’s a
great wire fence more than 2m high to
keep worker from worker. This is an ex-
tra perimeter on the outside of the
MCG. Inside there is a group of bored-
looking policemen sitting around a
brazier. Outside there is a group of
bored-looking BLF picketers, some of
them wearing Eureka Flag T-shirts.
The fence has to come down on Sat-
urdays if they are going to let the crowd
in to see the football.
Work started on June 4. Police pro-
tection for the workers in the first week
cost Victoria $150,000 and the bill be-
fore the towers are finished will be more
than $1 million. That’s if the towers are
finished.
Norm has all sorts of methods. For
example, there is the concrete. Last
week the AWU men were ready to pour
the concrete for the construction of the
bases of the six lighting towers. But
Norm had applied pressure to the
Transport Workers Union and deliver-
ies of concrete were being delayed.
It is awfully cold and bleak standing
outside the MCG. Troops parading the
Berlin Wall wouldn’t have had it any
warmer. The Sun News-Pictorial sent a
man to talk to the picketers and one re-
plied that he couldn’t count the weeks
and months of pay packets he had lost
over the years.
“I don’t look at what I’ve lost,” he
said, “I look at what my kids will gain.
If our fathers hadn’t struggled and won,
where would we be now?”
The BLF has bans on a whole range
of Victorian Government projects, par-
ticularly the trams and trains. A few
weeks back executives of the Metropoli-
tan Transit Authority were worried
about flushing their toilets because of
bans on their building.
At the Melbourne Cricket Ground,
Norm has bans on everything involving
work that his men could be doing.
The Melbourne Cricket Club hopes
to get the ground revamped for the VFL
Grand Final in September and con-
tracts worth $4 million have been let.
These include new public lavatories all
round the Southern Stand, new entry
and exit facilities on the Southern
Stand, 14 luxury executive-style viewing
boxes, new dining and viewing rooms in
the Northern Stand, $350,000 worth of
improved catering services and new in-
door practice wickets.
On top of that, allied with a Com-
monwealth grant, the MCC wants to
spend more than $3 million to build a
Gallery of Sport. The idea is to have one
of the greatest sporting museums in the
world, depicting not only cricket but all
the sports and to have it open during the
state’s 150th year.
Dr John Lill, who manages the
MCG, reckons there’s a total of nigh on
$8 million worth of work there for the
BLF but nothing happens because
union fights union. Norm and the BLF
want to be the dominant force in the
building industry.
This is all very sad for the MCC. The
Sydney Cricket Ground got its lights
back in 1978 and was able to build them
very comfortably for a mere $1.3 mil-
lion.
Lill could ponder the sad irony that
in August 1879 there was a night foot-
ball match on the MCG between Carl-
ton and Melbourne. It was the first com-
mercial use of electricity in Melbourne
and just possibly the world’s first night
football match.
The promoters borrowed lights of
7000 candlepower from the Gippsland
Railway Workshops. They had a devil
of a time getting the steam engine to
provide enough power for the gener-
ators and the lights didn’t come on until
8.30 pm.
They used a white ball but after only
five minutes it blew up. The only time it
was possible to see the thing was when it
passed through a bank of light. It was 20
minutes before anyone scored a goal
but Carlton eventually adapted better to
the gloom and won by two goals.
Towers were erected for the lights
and apparently on that occasion there
was no trouble whatever with the build-
ers laborers. □

Future Shock for the Koreas
Military hardware on parade in Seoul, delegates at the truce talks in Panmunjom, paying homage to a statue of Kim II Sung in Pyongyang:
Political, economic and military changes are transforming both North and South.
It was a scene from the 19505, endlessly
looped in one of the world’s longest-
running dramas. In the bleak no man’s
land that separates North and South Ko-
rea near Panmunjom, hard-eyed North
Korean troops goose-stepped across the
concrete parade ground. Nearby, Ameri-
can and South Korean guards bristled to
attention as delegates to the 31-year-old
military talks filed into a cinder-block hut.
At the table inside, a North Korean repre-
sentative charged that the United States
was preparing to wage a nuclear war
against his country. The U.S. delegate
brandished photographs of a North Kore-
an spy ship recently sunk off South Korea.
After 2 Vi hours of heated debate, the
425th session of the Military Armistice
Commission dragged to a close three
weeks ago—and signs of an accommoda-
tion appeared as remote as ever.
More than three decades after the end of
the Korean War, the talks in Panmunjom
seem destined to remain in freeze frame. But
elsewhere on the Korean peninsula, this is a
time of rapid economic, political and mili-
tary change. Both North and South Korea
are entering important new phases in their
development. North Korea’s self-pro-
claimed Great Leader, Kim II Sung, 72, is
preparing the country for its first transfer of
power by grooming his son, Kim Jong 11, 43,
to succeed him. In South Korea, aggressive
investment and government support are
turning the country into a new global eco-
nomic power. In a bid to sustain that pros-
perity, President Chun Doo Hwan has at
least tentatively begun to ease the govern-
ment’s repressive political system and tight
control of the economy. At the same time,
the South’s remarkable economic growth
has allowed Chun to pour more money into
the armed forces —and close the military
gap with the North.
The danger of a showdown on the penin-
sula is manifest. Nowhere in the world are
tensions so continually high and the level
of enmity so poisonous as along the pill-
box-encrusted hillsides of the 38th parallel.
Seoul’s 620,000-man military is backed by
40,000 American troops, the second larg-
est U.S. force stationed overseas, and by
what is said to be a formidable arsenal of
tactical nuclear weapons. (As a matter of
policy, the Pentagon will not confirm or
deny the deployment of any nuclear de-
vices.) With the help of Chinese and Soviet
supplies, North Korea has doubled the size
of its armed forces to 750,000 in the
past decade.
Skirmishes: Provocations to use that
military might are also plentiful. In the
space of two months last year, a Soviet
fighter plane shot down a Korean Air
Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan and
North Korean agents in Rangoon planted
a bomb that killed four members of the
South Korean cabinet and 13 other visiting
dignitaries. On both occasions, U.S., South
Korean and North Korean troops immedi-
ately went on heightened alert. Despite
recent peace overtures, border skirmishes
are still frequent. And officials in the South
worry that the 1986 Asian Games and the
1988 Olympics scheduled to be held in
Seoul could provide Pyongyang with new
opportunities for terrorism.
Given the delicate geopolitical balance
on the peninsula, even minor diplomatic
shifts by Seoul and Pyongyang are apt to
have repercussions in other capitals. In
South Korea the country’s growing eco-
nomic muscle has encouraged Chun to
attempt some new foreign-policy initia-
tives. More broadly, a new generation is
coming to power that has no memory of
the Japanese occupation before and during
World War II and only faint recollections
of the Korean War. Today, Seoul is eager
to establish close ties with Tokyo. The
country would also like to become friend-
lier with China and gradually improve
relations with the Soviet Union. The net

After three decades of uneasy peace, the dangers of a showdown are real
I. S. HONG
effect of such moves will be to alter
the South’s dependent relationship with
Washington. “We’ll see more independent
and assertive policies,” acknowledges one
U.S. official in Washington. “We’ll be less
able to take South Korea for granted.”
The prospects for substantive diplomat-
ic shifts by North Korea are more uncer-
tain. If and when he takes charge, the
younger Kim will face the problem of
establishing his credibility as a leader, and
that could rule out any major policy
changes. In the meantime, the still-vigor-
ous Great Leader continues to pursue his
often puzzling brand of foreign policy.
Since the beginning of the year, Kim has
shown signs of trying to cozy up to Mos-
cow even as he maintains ties with his
traditional patrons in Peking. He also
made a surprising proposal for new peace
talks with Seoul and Washington. And
Pyongyang coyly announced that it was
may have strikingly different attitudes
MATSUMOTO— SYGMA
ready to consider establishing eco-
nomic ties with “friendly capitalist
countries” in the West, a once he-
retical notion. In the last case,
Kim’s motive is clear enough: after
years of devoting as much as 25
percent of the country’s GNP to
military spending, North Korea
is in desperate need of a financial
transfusion.
As in the past, mutual mistrust will
continue to overshadow relations between
the two Koreas. In January North Korea
announced that it would be willing to
break the impasse on the question of reuni-
fication and open talks with Washington
and Seoul. Presumably, such negotiations
would include the possible removal of U.S.
troops from the peninsula. But South Ko-
rea promptly rejected the offer, arguing
that it preferred to deal with Pyongyang
one-on-one—and only after it received an
apology for the Rangoon bombing. Hoping
to keep the initiative alive, Ronald Reagan
suggested that China also be included in
the talks, an arrangement that would give
North and South Korea equal status at the
bargaining table. But on his visit to Peking
last spring, Chinese leaders told the Amer-
ican president that they would not partici-
pate in a four-way parlay.
Bear Hug: South Korea’s wariness about
dealing with the North is well founded.
Even Kim’s longtime allies occasionally
have trouble keeping up with his latest
stratagems. A few days after welcoming
Chinese Communist Party boss Hu Yao-
bang in May, the Great Leader boarded a
train for a three-day trip to Moscow—his
first visit to the Soviet capital in 20 years.
On his arrival, it quickly became clear that
the Soviets intended to keep him at arm’s
length; party chief Konstantin Chernenko
greeted him with a polite handshake in-
stead of the traditional bear hug. Even so,
Kim may have been able to pry one signifi-

cant concession out of his hosts. According
to government officials in Seoul, Moscow
is preparing to supply the North Korean
Air Force with at least 20 top-of-the-line
MiG-23 jet fighters.
Seoul and Washington say they have no
disagreements over the issue of peace talks.
Still, South Korea has grown increasingly
reluctant to be identified too closely with
U.S. interests. That may be partly due to
the country’s growing spirit of national-
ism. But some officials in Seoul have also
come to believe that improving ties with
China and the Soviet Union could be an
effective means of undercutting North Ko-
rea’s influence in those countries.
South Korea has no diplomatic relations
with either China or the Soviet Union. But
when a hijacked Chinese jet landed in the
South in May 1983, Seoul and Peking
made official contact for the first time.
Since then, they have carried out a handful
of athletic exchanges. As far as relations
with Moscow are concerned, the Soviet
downing of the KAL jetliner put the ques-
tion of rapprochement with the Kremlin
on hold. But the issue is apparently not
dead. Despite the bitter rage that the KAL
episode stirred in South Korea, officials in
Seoul foresee the possibility of some kind
of reconciliation. Says Foreign Minister
Lee Won Kyung: “Time will solve [the
problem].’’
In relations with Washington, Chun has
displayed an unprecedented willingness to
break stride occasionally with his chief ally
and protector. In the past, all South Kore-
an armed forces units, except the Army


B. S. YOON
garrison in Seoul, have been under the
ultimate control of the American joint-
forces commander. But during the student
uprising in Kwangju four years ago, when
Chun came to power, the Army’s 20th
Division took part in crushing the revolt,
to the dismay of U.S. officers. Recently,
well-informed sources in Seoul say, the
20th and the 9th Divisions were officially
removed from the American chain of com-
mand. That may spare U.S. commanders
from becoming involved in quelling any
future civil unrest. But American officials
and some Koreans worry that the move
could backfire by giving division com-
manders an uncomfortable degree of au-
thority to put down disturbances.
Cautious: Fear of domestic disorder has
always been something of an obsession in
the two Koreas, and the leaders on both
sides have instituted repressive political
measures of varying degrees to deter dis-
sent. But Chun now seems to be trying
diligently, if cautiously, to limit some of his
country’s more authoritarian practices.
Although no potential successors have yet
emerged, Chun has reiterated his pledge to
step down from the presidency in 1988.
Since the beginning of the year, he has
ordered several important political re-
forms. Three weeks ago, for instance, the
government announced that 82 college
professors and more than 100 journalists
dismissed in the wake of Chun’s 1980 coup
would be permitted to seek their old jobs
again. Earlier in the year, authorities also
removed all police details from uni-
versity campuses, the traditional breeding
ground for the opposition in the South. A
more tolerant attitude toward student dis-
sent could go a long way toward under-
scoring Chun’s commitment to greater
freedom.
A key test for Chun’s liberalization poli-
The haul from a North Korean spy ship, a student demonstration in Seoul: Threats
cy will come early next year. In February
the government is expected to call nation-
wide elections for the National Assembly.
The 276-member legislature is dominated
by Chun’s Democratic Justice Party
(DJP); the country’s two main opposition
groups, the Democratic Korea Party and
the Korea Nationalist Party, exercise little
power. Nonetheless, several hundred poli-
ticians who were banned from political
activities after Chun took power will once
again be permitted to run for seats in the
upcoming balloting. But in challenging the
government, the politicians will have to
walk a fine line. “If some hint of instability
from tough competition emerges,” says
Lee Jong Ryool, a DJP official, Chun
might call early elections “to put an end to
an overheated situation.”
Critics charge that Chun’s reforms are
largely cosmetic. Three weeks ago 60 of
the country’s 99 political figures still under
government ban gathered at a restaurant in
Seoul. They contended that the president
was actually tightening his grip on power.
Dissidents maintain that Chun has no in-
tention of permitting the growth of funda-
mental freedoms. But it is far from clear
that the country’s conservative establish-

CHIP HIRES—GAMMA-LIAISON
ment is necessarily opposed to greater lib-
eralization. Despite the Army’s sometimes
brutal record in quashing protests, for in-
stance, there are actually a number of key
military officers who say they are very
much in favor of allowing the development
of democracy. For whatever reason,
though, both the South’s press and its
budding labor movement remain firmly
shackled. “Signs of opposition are still not
taken as a legitimate political view,” says
one Western diplomat in Seoul, “but often
as approaching treason.”
Math Primer: By contrast, the North
permits almost no freedoms. By whipping
up fears of an American-backed invasion
from the South, Kim has been able to
create what is arguably the world’s most
tyrannical police state. The indoctrination
in the evils of the outside world begins at
an early age. According to a South Korean
newspaper, one sample problem from a
current grade-school math primer reads:
“Take 10 tanks belonging to the American
imperialist warmonger. Blow up nine.
How many tanks are left?” Radio and
televsion constantly bombard citizens with
standard-issue Big Brother fare; soap op-
eras extoll the early life of the Great Lead-
er and the revolutionary exploits of his son.
As long as fears of a U.S. nuclear attack
persist, the prospects for any sort of
“Pyongyang spring” liberalization are re-
mote indeed. “In their own way,” ac-
knowledges one South Korean analyst in
Seoul, “the North Koreans must feel
threatened.”
Unlike Kim, President Chun has a pow-
erful incentive to permit greater liberaliza-
tion. The South’s burgeoning middle class
is not likely to put up with the kind of
repression that has prevailed in the past.
And without the wholehearted support of
the country’s small businessmen and entre-
preneurs, Chun will find it difficult to keep
the economy humming. Saddled with a
foreign debt of nearly $47 billion, the
South must continue to achieve impressive
growth rates if it is to preserve its credit


rating. Traditionally, the country has re-
lied on exports, which represent nearly a
third of the GNP, to fuel economic expan-
sion. But last year only eight large con-
glomerates accounted for half of all the
South’s exports. In an effort to broaden
that base and position the country for even
greater growth in the future, the govern-
ment has moved to provide low-interest
loans for small and medium-size business-
es, particularly in the automotive and elec-
tronics fields.
But any attempt to boost exports runs
the risk of antagonizing the United States,
Mindful of its lopsided trade with Japan,
Washington has viewed South Korea’s
mounting surplus, which reached $1.7 bil-
lion last year, with considerable alarm. But
businessmen in the South argue that the
Japanese analogy misses the point. The
South, they contend, doesn’t produce the
same range of high-quality goods and
doesn’t have the marketing reach that
would allow the country to dominate large
segments of the U.S. economy.
Dumping: Washington has signaled that
it takes the trade threat seriously. In
March the Reagan administration handed
down an antidumping ruling against South
Korean television sets, infuriating busi-
nessmen in Seoul. Still, both sides seem
committed to resolving the issue amicably,
The United States, for instance, agreed to
review the dumping case more swiftly than
usual. And in March, Seoul dispatched a
blue-ribbon group of businessmen to the
United States to buy $2 billion worth of
American products as a good-will gesture.
The South’s economic miracle has clear-
ly given the country a new sense of confi-
dence. Whether that will ultimately trans-
late into substantially greater freedom for
the South Korean people is an open ques-
tion. Certainly, the overall outlook for the
South is far brighter than for the North.
“Just compare what’s happening here with
Pyongyang,” says former Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Han Bin. “That gives some
idea of the different level of maturity
our system has already achieved.” Fair
enough. But for all the vast differences that
divide the two countries, the fates of North
and South are intertwined by their shared
heritage and geography. Crowded onto a
powder-keg peninsula, the two must find,
if not the path to reunification, at least a
way to keep their uneasy peace.

Getting Ready for 1988
South Korea has few hopes of winning any medals at next
month’s Olympics in Los Angeles, but the Games have become a
national preoccupation. The 1988'Games, that is: Seoul will host
the next summer Olympics, and the country is already gearing
up for the event. In the capital, workmen are racing to finish a
sprawling, $1.6 billion sports facility, including a 100,000-seat
stadium and lodging for nearly
29,000 visiting athletes and journal-
ists. A stretch of the Han River is
being dredged to make way for mari-
nas, and the city’s subway system is
being doubled in length. National
spirits are high: many regard the
Games as a sign of the country’s
growing international prestige. “Fif-
teen years ago this was a country with
no self-confidence,” says Sports Min-
ister Young Ho Lee. “Now, self-con-
fidence is spreading.”
Spotlight: Winning the right to
host the Olympics was a major coup
for South Korean President Chun
Doo Hwan. Since he came to power in
1980, his government has energeti-
cally lobbied a host of organizations
worldwide to hold conventions and
meetings in South Korea. Several big
groups have responded, including the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, an inter-
national forum for legislators that
convened in Seoul last year. As it did
for Japan in 1964, a smooth-running,
economically successful Olympics
would focus a favorable international
spotlight on South Korea, proving to the world that the country
has more to offer than just cheap steel and electronics. “If it was
good for the Japanese in 1964, it will be very good for Koreans in
1988,” says former Deputy Prime Minister Lee Han Bin.
But the high expectations may be premature. Already there
are questions about whether enough athletes will show up. South
Korea’s staunchly anticommunist regime has no diplomatic
relations with the Soviet bloc countries, and even before the
Moscow-led withdrawal from the Los Angeles Olympics there
were fears that the Soviets might refuse to participate at the 19 8 8

games in Seoul. North Korea might also try to sabotage the
Olympics, perhaps by staging terrorist attacks inside South
Korea before the Games begin. Any violence could frighten
would-be spectators away. Given the potential pitfalls, one
Western diplomat in Seoul believes that “the Olympics just
won’t make the impact the Koreans are hoping for.”
Still, some South Koreans have been
hoping that the Games might provide an
opportunity for rapprochement with the
North. In 1980 Seoul raised the pros-
pect of creating a joint Olympic squad
with North Korea, and Pyongyang
finally agreed to discussions on the
subject last April. But they seemed to
have as much chance of succeeding as
the perennially fruitless armistice ne-
gotiations in Panmunjom. From the
start, the talks were characterized
by hostile, fist-pounding exchanges,
touching less on sports than on the
tense political issues that separate the
two sides. Hopes for a joint effort this
year were shattered when the North
Koreans broke off the talks, an-
nouncing they were following the
Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles
Games. Some South Koreans are still
optimistic about putting together a
joint team at the Asian Games in
Seoul in 1986 or the 1988 Olympics,
but the chances are widely regarded
as remote. Even so, government offi-
cials view the sports talks as one way
of lessening the tensions between the
two nations. Says one South Korean
official: “Talks are better than no
talks at all.”
In the next four years South Korea will continue to invest its
diplomatic energy, money and hopes in the 1988 Olympics.
“The important thing about hosting the Olympics is that it will
confirm that we have really come a long way, from the Japanese
occupation, from the Korean War and from dire poverty,” says
Sports Minister Young. “And that will be very important for our
development.” Should all go as planned, a successful—and
safe —Olympics will be a greater reward to South Korea than
taking the gold.
JACOB YOUNG with FRANK GIBNEY Jr. and TRACY DAHLBY in Seoul


The Big-Power Dilemma
HAN SUNG-JOO
The United States and South Korea have
enjoyed close and cordial relations
since President Reagan took office in 1981.
In fact, officials from both countries main-
tain that the relationship has never been
better. In the wake of several years of stress
and strain during the Carter administra-
tion, South Korea is especially happy about
the improved relationship. But the two
countries cannot afford complacency. The
alliance is built on asymmetrical needs and
objectives. The United States sees Korea as
part of its global strategy, but Korea’s con-
cerns are far more local. Unless both sides
understand this, the relationship between
the two countries could be weakened.
The United States signed a mutual de-
fense treaty with South Korea in 1953 —
primarily to check the expansion of the
Soviet power in East Asia. But South Korea
wanted only to prevent another North Ko-
rean invasion. This remains substantially
the case to this day. Indeed it is no accident
that South Korean security ties with Amer-
ica have become stronger as tension be-
tween the United States and the Soviet
Union has grown over the past several
years. This presents a dilemma for South
Korea. It wants strong U.S. security sup-
port but does not want to become closely
involved in big-power politics. Inevitably,
however, big-power politics affect U.S.-
South Korean relations and vice versa.
South Korea has, for example, sought
reconciliation with the Soviet Union for
more than a decade, but with only limited
success. As it is drawn more closely into
U.S. attempts to build a regional anti-Soviet
coalition, Seoul will find it even more diffi-
cult to build ties with Moscow. In fact,
critics now argue that Seoul’s stance toward
the Soviet Union is too stiff, while its enthu-
siasm for China is warmer than it need be.
They worry that an alienated Soviet Union
might support and encourage North Ko-
rea’s military adventurism.
Boycott: Last September’s Korean Air
Lines incident disrupted what little prog-
ress was being made on the Seoul-Moscow
front. But Korea’s strong U.S. connection
will make it all the more difficult to restore
Soviet-South Korean relations to the pre-
KAL level. Now that deteriorating East-
West relations have led to the Soviet boycott
of the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles,
South Korea will have to work harder to
induce the Soviet Union and its allies to
participate in the 1988 Games in Seoul.
Big-power politics also seem to be behind
the recent Sino-American discussions of the
Korean issue, and that has made some Ko-
reans nervous. The United States and China
have found that they have a common out-
look on Korea: both would like to see ten-
sion on the peninsula reduced and to con-
tain Soviet influence. But in Seoul the
proposals coming from Washington and
Peking are seen as serving the two powers’
interests more than South Korea’s. Re-
sponding to U.S. overtures to become in-
volved, China has supported the North Ko-
rean proposal for tripartite talks involving

both Koreas and the United States. The
American counterproposal —for a four-
party conference that would also include
Peking—seems to have been offered, at least
in part, to avoid embarrassing the Chinese.
Peking has been balancing its American
leaning with more friendly and supportive
gestures toward Pyongyang. Thus, the eu-
phoric expectation that closer Sino-Ameri-
can ties would bring about a breakthrough
between China and South Korea is proving
unrealistic or at least premature. The Unit-
ed States wants China to help cool tempers
on the Korean peninsula. But Peking is
looking out for itself and seems willing to go
only so far to mollify the United States. The
danger is that the United States may overes-
timate China’s ability or willingness to en-
courage Pyongyang to promote peace be-
tween the Koreas, and Washington may
become receptive to proposals that are nei-
ther safe nor prudent for South Korea.
Japan is another country that looms large
in U.S.-South Korean relations. Ever since
the end of World War 11, when General
MacArthur supervised the U.S. occupation
forces in Korea from Tokyo, Koreans have
always been sensitive to the prospect that
Washington might view Korea through a
“Japanese prism.” Koreans are uneasy
about the notion, sometimes suggested by
U.S. officials, that America’s security inter-
ests in Korea derive only from its interests in
Japan’s security. Recently the United States
has taken pains to assure South Korea that
it values the strategic and political impor-
tance of Korea in its own right. During his
visit to Korea last November, President
Reagan even said that Korean security was
“vital” to the United States. Nonetheless,
Japan has been a critical factor in U.S.
security calculations toward Korea. And
Koreans cannot help but wonder if U.S.
strategic thinking will be skewed by how
Japan views the regional situation and what
Tokyo does about it.
Memories: Japan is slowly but steadily
increasing its defense spending to assume a
greater regional security role. Koreans and
other Asians are haunted not only by their
memories of Japanese militarism, but also
by the fear that the United States may re-
duce its military presence in the area. An
active military buildup by Japan may be
consistent with Washington’s anti-Soviet
strategy, but it would not address Korea’s
main security problems.
What all this suggests is that despite the
appearance of complete agreement between
the United States and South Korea on ma-
jor security issues, there are many areas of
potential disagreement and disappoint-
ment. The danger is that the two countries
may be too complacent about their friend-
ship and that they will take each other’s
good will and cooperation for granted.
Seoul and Washington should recognize
that their alliance cannot prosper if it is
based only on continuing U.S.-Soviet ten-
sion. They should build upon their common
interests in cultural, economic and political
areas —as well as in security relations. The
two countries should use the extraordinary
cordiality of today as an opportunity to
provide for tomorrow a broader basis of
friendship and cooperation for their genera-
tion-old alliance.

PAKISTAN
A General for All Seasons
Zia reviewing his troops: A durable mixture of strength, cleverness and good luck
Pakistan’s President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq is a strong man in a weak coun-
try—a man who knows his way around
power. For the past seven years Zia has
fended off Soviet dabbling in South Asia
and provided a counter to volatile Iran. In a
region of constant conflicts and fragile loy-
alties, he has provided some stability, break-
ing Pakistan’s habit of lurching between
inept civilian governments and inept mili-
tary rulers. Now Zia may even vindicate
Jeane Kirkpatrick’s theory that authoritar-
ians of the right are preferable to totalitar-
ians of the left because they occasionally
change. After years of hemming, hawing
and postponing, he seems ready, for the first
time, to hold an election.
The election, which could come as early
as this fall, is not likely to jeopardize Zia.
The general is writing the rules to make
certain of that. He has made no promise that
outlawed opposition parties will be able to
participate—or even that party slates will
be permitted at all. He has decreed that he
will not allow “drunkards, adulterers,
thieves, bandits, smugglers, cattle lifters
and all antistate and antisocial elements” to
run. After the balloting, there will still
be a military-dominated national-security
council to keep an eye on the civilian politi-
cians in the new Parliament.
Selections: Although Zia has disavowed
any desire to be president in a civilian gov-
ernment, few believe him. Since seizing
power in July 1977, he has tenaciously con-
solidated his own authority, and Pakistan
has no tradition of leaders voluntarily relin-
quishing office. The odds are high that the
new Parliament will “draft” Zia for presi-
dent. “There’s nobody else around of any
stature,” says a State Department analyst.
“Zia hasn’t got a lot of competition.”
Opposition groups have been skeptical
about Zia’s motives. “We call them selec-
tions, not elections,” says the most promi-
nent opposition figure, Benazir Bhutto,
from her exile in London. Bhutto, 31, is the
daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prede-
cessor Zia deposed and later hanged on a
charge of plotting the murder of a political
opponent. The question for her and other
opposition politicians has
been whether to partici-
pate. Although the gov-
ernment says Bhutto can
probably return to Paki-
stan and run, she said last
week that she and her sup-
porters “don’t think we
can be a party to some-
thing which is not fair,
free and impartial.” Other
members of the fragment-
ed opposition seem ready
to settle for what Zia is
willing to allow them.
“We would rather take
back 50 percent of power
and leave some power
with the Army, than not
take anything,” said Mian
Tufail Muhammad, lead-
er of the religious fundamentalist party, the
Jamaat-i-Islami. “If we don’t take part in
their elections, under their conditions, we
might have to wait another seven years.”
In fact, Zia’s base is strong enough that he
probably doesn’t have to rig the elections.
During his seven years, the country has had
six excellent harvests. Oil-rich, labor-poor
countries on the Gulf have hired hundreds
of thousands of Pakistani laborers who send
home $3 billion each year. As a result, Paki-
stanis have gone on a shopping spree. Even
in remote areas villagers have bought televi-
sion sets and refrigerators, which they store
in their backyards, waiting for the day when
electric power arrives. Some critics say Zia
should have been investing in industrial
infrastructure instead of consumer goods.
But the sight of new cars on Pakistani
streets makes a sharp contrast to the pover-
ty and rioting of Bhutto’s final days. “Zia’s
been exceptionally lucky,” says a Western
diplomat in Islamabad, “but he’s been clev-
er enough to take advantage of that luck.”
Vital Bulwark: Zia has even managed to
turn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to
his own advantage. At a stroke it trans-
formed his international image: instead of
being the general who hanged his predeces-
sor, he became a vital bulwark against Sovi-
et expansionism. The resulting influx of
foreign aid more than made up for the $1
million-per-day cost of sheltering Afghan
refugees—l 2 U.N. camps alone have taken
in an estimated 2.3 million refugees near the
border. More important, the invasion
squelched efforts to end U.S. military aid to
Pakistan because of suspicions that the
country is developing an atomic bomb. Sen.
Alan Cranston charged recently that Paki-
stan is now capable of building six bombs
per year, and is waiting until it has collected
all of a five-year, $3.2 billion American
military- and economic-aid package before
testing one. Pakistan insists that its nuclear
program is peaceful. The Reagan adminis-
tration says it is concerned, but not enough
to cut off military aid. “The important
thing,” said an administration official, “is
that Pakistan is on our side.”
But how long can Zia’s
luck hold? His country is
surrounded by belligerent
neighbors. The Soviets are
stepping up operations
in Afghanistan. Unrest
among Sikhs continues in
the neighboring Indian
Punjab, and there is evi-
dence they buy their weap-
ons in Pakistan, though
not from the government.
Nonetheless, if India’s
Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, facing elections
herself, decides she needs
a foreign scapegoat for the
violence, she has one obvi-
ous candidate. Last year’s
harvest was poor. The war
in the Gulf does not bode
well for continued infusions of money from
Pakistan’s emigre labor force. Any of those
problems could prove far more dangerous
to Zia’s political health than the upcoming
elections: when things go wrong in a mili-
tary dictatorship, the people have only one
person to blame. But for now, Zia still holds
the whip hand.

PHILIPPINES
Manila’s Secret Marshals
Marshals carry the body of an alleged thief killed in a gunbattle: Death squads?
Ferdinand Marcos unleashed them two
weeks ago: a roving army of gun-toting
plainclothesmen known as the Secret Mar-
shals. Their mission is to round up thieves
and thugs and to shoot anyone who resists
arrest. But they tend to blast first and ask
questions later. In just a week, the marshals
have gunned down and killed at least 30
suspected criminals, ranging from a gang-
ster allegedly trying to lob a grenade to a
purse-snatcher clutching a toy pistol. Mar-
cos says that the undercover force of 1,000
auxiliary police is needed to clamp the lid on
a soaring crime rate. Civil libertarians, how-
ever, accuse the president of creating a
vigilante patrol resembling a Latin Ameri-
can death squad. And some opposition
leaders say they are afraid that the marshals
will start shooting political dissidents along
with the muggers.
‘Goons’: The worst fear was that Marcos
was “preparing the people’s minds, step by
step,” as one opposition politician put it,
for a major crackdown on his political en-
emies. Marcos dismissed his critics as
“busybodies.” He insisted that the anti-
crime force is popular with ordinary Filipi-
nos who are tired of being victimized by
crime. In support of the president’s posi-
tion, columnist Teodoro Valencia wrote
that impoverished Manilans “want protec-
tion, and if it is necessary to shoot some
people to have it, they approve.” But even
some backers of the president disagreed; the
problem was that hardly anyone seemed to
trust the cops. “The Secret Marshals are
more feared than admired in Metro Ma-
nila,” wrote columnist Arturo Borjal. “The
reason is simple: many lawmen themselves
have acted like goons and hoodlums.”
The marshals haven’t done much to as-
suage such fears. The auxiliary police force
was orginally established in 1982, then dis-
banded after the plainclothesmen gunned
down 32 people in three months. Now the
reconstituted force is killing criminal sus-
pects at an even more rapid pace—and the
controversy has intensified. The mother of
one victim says that her son was a well-paid
worker with an overseas job, not a stickup
artist. Another woman accused police of
executing her brother with a final shot after
he was lying wounded and helpless on a
The First Lady: A warning to Aquino
CHRISTOPHER MORRIS— BLACK STAR
Manila sidewalk. And a top Manila police
reporter suggested that some policemen
may be killing for profit. The going rate for
handing bodies over to some funeral parlors
is $39 —an amount equivalent to several
weeks’ pay for the average Manila cop.
Casualty: There was an ironic twist to the
resurgence of the secret police. Last week
they suffered their first casualty—at the
hands of government troops. Police reports
said that Ronaldo Paras, 25, a marshal, was
stripped of his weapon by soldiers in a disco-
theque; he fled into the street where he was
shot down from behind. Two bodyguards of
the teen-age son of the commander of the Air
Force then delivered the wounded police-
man to a hospital, allegedly punching and
kicking him all along the way. Paras later
died of his wounds. Not long afterward,
battle lines shaped up at Manila’s Western
Police District headquarters: police bearing
M-16 assault rifles faced off against airmen
in combat gear. A bloody fire fight was
averted only after tense negotiations.
The incident left the people of Manila
feeling more insecure than ever. The reputa-
tion of the security forces was already at an
all-time low because of evidence amassed by
the Agrava commission suggesting that
military men may have planned and carried
out the assassination of opposition leader
Benigno Aquino last August. In a develop-
ment that can only further embarrass the
government, Imelda Marcos was scheduled
to testify before the investigative commis-
sion. In deference to her position, the com-
mission had agreed to interview the First
Lady at Malacanang Palace late last week.
They intended to ask her about a warning she
delivered to Aquino in New York a year ago
that there were people plotting to kill him if
he returned to the Philippines. But at the last
minute, Mrs. Marcos brushed off her ap-
pointment and flew instead to her home-
town in Leyte province to celebrate her
birthday. She may reschedule the meeting
after her return to the capital.
Raid: Meanwhile, fears were mounting
that Marcos was preparing to reimpose mar-
tial law. In a swift, surprising raid last
week, intelligence agents burst into the
headquarters of the Nationalist Alliance, an
opposition political movement that had ad-
vocated a boycott of National Assembly
elections in May. And at a caucus of his
ruling party, the president bluntly hinted
that martial law “may happen all over
again.’’ For now, Marcos continues to toler-
ate modest challenges to his authority; late
last week the Supreme Court was consider-
ing a petition that called for the disbanding
of the secret marshals, in part to prevent
them from “liquidating” people opposed to
Marcos’s rule. But Filipinos were left won-
dering whether the president would soon
run out of patience with such democratic
procedures—and leave the country to the
arbitrary violence of the cops and soldiers.

What does success
mean to you?
Greater profit in
business, job
satisfaction, material
goods, more leisure
time to spend with your
family or the respect of others ?
It’s perfectly normal to look for
one or all of these in the pursuit of success.
But why do you think most hardworking,
intelligent people do not achieve everything they
want? Why don’t they achieve everything they are
capable of achieving?
The answer is that most hardworking,
intelligent people lack the skills to motivate,
manage and make the most of their own talents
and time. But these skills can be learned. The
Success Motivation Institute can teach you.
Whatever you want, if you want it enough,
you can have.
The first person to define the skills of success
and prove their worth, was Paul J. Meyer. Some
years later he founded the Success Motivation
Institute, to pass on his proven principles and this
conviction: ‘Whatever you vividly imagine,
ardently desire, sincerely believe and enthusiastic-
ally act upon . . . must inevitably come to pass’.
Listen to this free tape and start acquiring
the skills of success.
The Success Motivation Institute has now
grown to be a world-wide organisation, by
assisting success-oriented people like you.
In Australia alone we have worked with over

CHINA
The Longer March of Women
On the farm and on a city street: Despite glowing images of socialist sexual equality, females invariably get the back seat
PHOTOS BY WALLY McNAMEE— Newsweek
One of Mao Tse-tung’s pet slogans as-
serted that “women hold up half the
sky,” and Chinese propaganda of his era
lauded female comrades who repaired high-
tension cables and hauled fishing nets on the
high seas. But more recently, those glowing
pictures of socialist sexual equality have
increasingly been exposed as myth. As even
Peking officials now admit, Chinese women
suffer not only from job dis-
crimination, but also from such
practices as female infanticide,
bride selling and wife batter-
ing—“feudal” abuses that may
actually be on the rise.
Such striking inequalities are
doubly embarrassing to a re-
gime that considers the emanci-
pation of women an integral
part of its revolution. Discrimi-
nation against women is “intol-
erable in a socialist country such as ours,”
says Chen Pixian, a member of the Commu-
nist Party secretariat. But, in fact, the situa-
tion is partly the government’s own doing. A
stringent, one-child-only, family-planning
campaign has combined with the traditional
Chinese preference for sons to trigger the
widespread killing of infant girls, especially
in rural areas. Economic reforms have re-
vived such bourgeois phenomena as maid
services and cosmetic surgery. And the gov-
ernment’s decision to end lifetime jobs hits
hard at generally low-ranking women.
Legacy: Publicly, officials place much of
the blame on a breakdown in social mores
during the tumultuous 1966-1976 Cultural
Revolution. They say an even deeper reason
is the stubborn legacy of thousands of years
of feudalism. Against that backdrop, Chi-
nese women have unquestionably come a
long way from the foot binding and concubi-
nage of the early 1900 s. The Chinese Consti-
tution enshrines equal rights for women in
all spheres of life. Arranged marriages, biga-
my and child betrothal are all banned by law.
MELINDA LIU —Newsweek
And Chinese officials point out that nearly
37 percent of the urban work force is female,
compared with only 7.5 percent when the
communists took power in 1949.
But the secondary status of women is
deeply entrenched. Only one member of the
24-seat Politburo is a woman: Deng Ying-
chao, the 80-year-old widow of Chou En-lai.
And even high-ranking female officials of-
ten bear the brunt of household
chores —no small matter in a
country where the lack of mod-
ern appliances can mean hours
each day standing in market
queues and scrubbing in wash-
basins. One of China’s up-and-
coming women officials is Hao
Novelist Zhang, Peking danc-
ers: Bride sales and wife beating
Jianxiu, 49, an alternate member of the party
secretariat and a former textiles minister.
Despite that, her physician husband assured
a Chinese magazine that she “is not a minis-
ter at home.” Hao does the cooking, shop-
pingand housecleaning, heboasted, and also
supervises the children’s education.
Harsh: Job discrimination is equally prev-
alent. Women often face harsher school and
university entrance examinations, single fe-
males rarely get plummy overseas posts and
women generally have a hard time attaining
top positions in their fields. In Shanghai the
U.S.-educated president of Fudan Universi-
ty, Xie Xide, concedes that the number of
female professors is still small, even though
the percentage of women faculty members is
substantial. “Women have to work harder
than their husbands to achieve similar aca-
demic positions,” she says.
But such concerns pale in comparison to
the abuses in rural areas. The post-Mao press
has published grisly reports of female infan-
ticide, husbands beating their wives for
bearing girls instead of sons and women
being abducted for sale as brides. In Sichuan
Province, one ring reportedly sold 35 wom-
en for $7,800 in grain coupons and cash,
while another crudely calculated the price of
its human merchandise by weight.
In Peking’s eyes, the solution lies in educa-
tion. Women’s federations in some areas
have set up legal advisory services, and the
government has organized propaganda
teams to publicize women’s rights. Chinese
newspapers have tried to confront the prob-
lem of wives being blamed for not bearing
sons by pointing out that the father’s chro-
mosomes are equally important in determin-
ing a child’s sex. For the most part, though,
the regime seems to have assumed that time
is on its side—and that the status of women
will improve automatically as China mod-
ernizes. One well-known Chinese feminist,
novelist Zhang Jie, 47, has said that “only
within the ideal communist society can ideal
marriage exist.” A better question might be
whose ideal—men’s or women’s —that
would represent.

WORLD AFFAIRS
A New Blueprint for Israel
Ahead in the polls, Shimon Peres has ambitious plans for his first hundred days.
Shimon Peres is an optimist. When Mena-
chem Begin resigned as prime minister
of Israel last September, Peres immediately
recruited eight young academicians to help
him figure out what he should do as prime
minister. Now, with Israel’s national elec-
tions only three weeks away, Peres and his
Labor Party hold a strong lead in the opinion
polls over Begin’s successor, Yitzhak Sha-
mir, the head of the Likud government. If the
lead holds up, Peres will know exactly what
to do with his mandate. He
and his brain trust have
worked out a bold plan of
action for Labor’s first hun-
dred or so days in office —a
blueprint for peace and
prosperity that is more am-
bitious than many Israelis
realize.
Many details of the strate-
gy have not been made pub-
lic, but Newsweek’s Jeru-
salem bureau chief, Milan
J. Kubic, has pieced togeth-
er an outline. The Peres plan
includes a quick withdrawal
of Israeli troops from south-
ern Lebanon. It calls for at
least partial controls over
wages and prices in an at-
tempt to stabilize Israel’s
self-destructing economy. It
envisions a grandiose re-
gional aid program, similar
to the Marshall Plan, that
would benefit both Israel
and its neighbors. Most of
all, Peres wants to generate
new momentum toward
peace. He will push for nego-
tiations with Egypt and Jor-
dan over the occupied West
Bank. He is prepared to give
up some territory and to impose a partial
freeze on Jewish settlement in the region. If
Arab governments decline to negotiate,
Peres might unilaterally grant a degree of
autonomy to the West Bankers themselves.
Peres also will angle for an early summit
meeting with his favorite Arab interlocutor,
King Hassan of Morocco. “If the Arabs
show that their intentions are to make
peace,” says one of the brain trusters, Dr.
Nimrod Novik, “Peres will be most
forthcoming.”
First, of course, he’ll have to get himself
elected—and by a healthy margin. Peres
has a record of snatching defeat from the
jaws of victory, as he did in 1981, when
Labor relinquished an even bigger lead in
the opinion polls than the one it enjoys now.
In the current campaign, nearly a third of
Israel’s voters still haven’t made up their
minds, which makes any forecast chancy,
At the moment, however, the polls suggest
that Labor will win about 51 seats in the
Knesset, compared with 36 for the Likud
bloc. If that’s the way it works out, Peres
will be able to assemble a majority in the
120-seat Knesset by forming a coalition
with a few small, relatively liberal parties,
Labor’s leader: Will the Arabs cooperate with a search for peace?
SHLOMO ARAD
Many analysts think it is too late for
Shamir to overtake Peres. The prime minis-
ter has conducted a lackluster campaign,
and even a dramatic exchange of prisoners
between Israel and Syria last week didn’t
seem to do his party much good. “I don’t see
how the Likud can close the gap with Labor
to less than three or four seats,” says respect-
ed pollster Hanoch Smith. But if the Likud
can cut Labor’s lead significantly, Peres
would be forced to fill out his coalition with
one or more of the hard-line religious par-
ties, in which case some of his initiatives
would never be launched.
Even if Labor receives a powerful elector-
almandateon July 23, parts of the Peres plan
may never go anywhere. Jordan’s King Hus-
sein and other Arab leaders may not be at all
interested in responding to overtures from a
new Israeli government. But the Arabs
aren’t the only audience to which Peres is
playing. “We’ve taken very much into ac-
count the political needs of the White
House,” says Novik, a U.S.-affairs specialist
at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at
Tel Aviv University. The Reagan adminis-
tration has encouraged Peres to pursue the
brain-trust plans, which could produce
progress toward peace —or
at least the appearance of
progress—at a useful time
for a president whose Mid-
east policies have not been
notably successful.
As described by public
statements and by private
sources, the brain trust’s
blueprint contains these ma-
jor elements:
The West Bank Peres
wants to get the United
States involved in new nego-
tiations that his government
would conduct with Jordan
and Egypt. The Labor Party
leader supported the 1978
Camp David agreement,
which Shamir opposed, and
he endorsed Reagan’s 1982
proposal for a federation be-
tween Jordan and the West
Bank Arabs, an idea that Be-
gin rejected. If elected, Peres
will talk to King Hussein on
any basis at all—the Camp
David accord, the Reagan
plan or United Nations Res-
olutions 242 and 338, which
call for the return of Arab
territory and recognition of
Israel’s right to exist. In
1978, when Labor was out of power, Peres
planned to meet Hussein secretly in Lon-
don—until Begin asked him not to. Now a
meeting between the two men, openly or in
secret, seems possible again.
There is a distinct limit to the concessions
that Peres is prepared to make. Labor insists
that it will not accept a complete return to
Israel’s 1967 borders and will not tolerate
the creation of an independent Palestinian
state on the West Bank. It also insists that
Jerusalem must remain united as the capital
of Israel. But Peres is willing to give up
territory that is not vital to Israel’s defense,
The Reagan administration is expected to
support Peres’s initiative on peace talks. If
the Arabs refuse to negotiate, Peres’s advis


ers want him to reinstate most of
the elected West Bank mayors who
were removed by the Likud and
then grant them autonomy over
their own bailiwicks. If that
doesn’t get peace talks going, the
Labor government would “annex
the Jordan Valley and the Gush
Etzion bloc of settlements [south
of Jerusalem] and return the re-
maining 60 to 70 percent of the
territory to Jordan,” says Yossi
Beilin, Peres’s spokesman and the
leader of the brain trust.
The Settlements. Labor says that
it will not dismantle any Jewish
settlements; in fact, it will build
new ones in unpopulated but stra-
tegically important parts of the
Jordan Valley. But Peres and his
advisers want to cut off govern-
ment financial support for new set-
tlements in populous areas of the
West Bank. And they intend to
curtail government handouts to
existing, Likud-built settlements
in places inhabited by large num-
bers of Arabs. A Peres government
also might cut off funds for a new
network of roads that the Likud planned to
build on the West Bank. Whether Peres can
get away with this partial freeze on the
settlement movement will depend largely on
the strength of his electoral mandate.
Lebanon. To ease the strain on Israel mili-
tarily and economically, Peres has said that
he will withdraw Israeli troops “within
three to six months.” Of all the elements in
the plan drawn up by his think tank, this is
the one that U.S. officials regard as most
likely to succeed. But still there could be
many sticking points. Peres will
want assurances—from the Leba-
nese government or from U.N.
peacekeepers—that Syrian and
Palestinian forces will not take
over the area vacated by Israel. He
also intends to set up a mobile
strike force that could move back
into Lebanon to deal unilaterally
with any such threat. The possibil-
ity of new Israeli incursions, how-
ever, could make it more difficult
to obtain the security assurances
that Peres wants.
Regional Cooperation. Peres
will suggest that the United
States and Saudi Arabia set up a
fund to assist Israel and any Arab
nations that sign peace treaties
with Israel. He has discussed the
idea with Saudi entrepreneur Ad-
nan Khashoggi, but even the brain
trusters do not know how the Sau-
dis could be talked into bankroll-
ing a Mideast Marshall Plan. Per-
es’s advisers also have been talking
about a “regional security arrange-
ment” to protect shipping in the
Red Sea. For now, that plan,
too, looks like pie in the sky.

The body of an Israeli soldier comes home on the Golan Heights: No bonus for the Likud
Diplomacy. A Labor government would
try to improve Israel’s standing in the inter-
national community. As vice president of
the Socialist International, Peres has
worked closely with European leaders, in-
cluding his friend Felipe Gonzalez, the
prime minister of Spain. The brain trusters
believe that Gonzalez is only waiting for a

The Economy. Peres expects to save about
$1 billion by withdrawing from Lebanon
and cutting back on settlements. He also
would ask labor unions and industry to ac-
cept at least a partial freeze on wages and
prices. “He will do his best to lift the level and
performance of Israel’s scientific industry,”
adds Beilin. “And he will search for large-
scale development projects which would fire
the imagination of the country, give it a new
focus and a new zest for accomplishment.
He’d take large risks to achieve this.”
So far, the Laborites have managed to
avoid the major mistakes of past campaigns.
The party is unified and well disciplined.
With a big lead in the polls, Peres shrewdly
decided on a low-key, almost tranquilizing
campaign. Likud has tried to stir up the
voters by warning that Labor is “the only
hope of Yasir Arafat,” as former Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon put it recently. But
Shamir’s own bland performance seems to
be getting the Likud nowhere. There was no
surge of support for the government after
the prisoner exchange, in which six Israelis
and coffins containing the bodies of five
others were traded on the Golan Heights for
311 Syrians and the remains of 72 more.
“Peres will be an innovative, unafraid,
well-prepared prime minister,” Yossi Bei-
lin boasted last week. The brain trust’s
program will not require much legislation;
many of the moves can be made adminis-
tratively. But success will require an unwa-
vering majority in the Knesset, and to get
one, Shimon Peres will have to do some-
thing he’s never done before: win a nation-
al election and win it big.

SOVIET UNION
The Kremlin’s Happy Warrior
Aliyev (second from left) with Romanov, Gromyko and Chernenko: A dash of vigor
Around the Kremlin, where a frown and
a fedora are almost part of the dress
code, Geidar Aliyev sports a winning smile.
Tall, trim and confident, the 61-year-old
first deputy prime minister has risen quickly
in the Soviet hierarchy—and he seems des-
tined to rise even higher. Though he is just as
prone to hard-line rhetoric as his Politburo
colleagues, Aliyev has style. “He’s the only
guy with anything considered to be sex ap-
peal in the West,” says one Western diplo-
mat in Moscow. Other Politburo mem-
bers—notably Mikhail Gorbachov, widely
viewed as a likely successor to Konstantin
Chernenko —can also display poise and fi-
nesse. But what sets Aliyev apart is that he
always seems relaxed, genial—even hap-
py—both in and out of the limelight.
In the past year alone, Aliyev has shown a
deft touch in carrying an expanding portfo-
lio. He took two highly publicized trips
overseas—one to Syria, another to Vietnam.
When French President Franqois Mitter-
rand visited the Great Kremlin Palace two
weeks ago, Aliyev prominently rubbed
shoulders with fellow Politburo members
Andrei Gromyko and Grigory Romanov
and strode up next to Chernenko in the
receiving line. He has played host to Third
World dignitaries—a role that seems to suit
him well given his ethnic roots in the largely
Muslim republic of Azerbaijan. As the head
of transportation, he took a much-celebrat-
ed trip on BAM, the new Siberian railroad.
Last spring he gave a major speech at the
Supreme Soviet on school reform. Aliyev
also appears to have a strong role in cultural
affairs (even though there is a minister of
culture), and has a key job as head of the
Politburo’s commission on consumer plans.
Perhaps most important, Aliyev has
shown an ability to thrive regardless of who
is in power. He distinguished himself as the
party chief in Azerbaijan by improving labor
productivity and cracking down on corrup-
tion. When Leonid Brezhnev paid him a visit
in 1982, Aliyev doted on The Boss to the
point of sycophancy. Aliyev was promoted
to the Politburo and then to the post of first
deputy prime minister later that year, short-
ly after Yuri Andropov took power. In pro-
moting Aliyev, Andropov may only have
been honoring a Brezhnev wish. But as for-
mer head of the KGB, Andropov had been in
position to study Aliyev’s credentials:
Aliyev joined the KGB at the age of 18 and
spent the next 28 years with the secret agen-
cy. Whatever the reasons for Aliyev’s suc-
cess under Andropov, his future looks bright
under Chernenko, a Brezhnev crony. “If
anything, I think [Aliyev] will do even better
under Chernenko,” says a Western diplo-
mat in Moscow. “He’s on a roll.”
Wits: Some believe that Aliyev is the most
likely candidate to succeed Nikolai Ti-
khonov, 79, as prime minister. There had
been some speculation that Andropov was
considering Vitaly Vorotnikov, a new mem-
ber of the Politburo, for the post. But with
Chernenko’s rise, Aliyev now appears to be
the front runner. A non-Russian back-
ground, however, makes Aliyev a long shot
for the top job of general secretary. Perhaps
hoping to advance up the ladder, he adopted
a Russian patronymic two years ago. Now
he is Geidar Aliyevich Aliyev; before that he
was Geidar Ali Rza ogly Aliyev. He may
have muted the alien sound of his name, but
he has made good use of an outsider’s wits to
reach the Kremlin’s inner circle.

IRAQ
A Turncoat Ayatollah
Takes to the Airwaves
His rhetoric, if nothing else, stamps Ali
Teherani as an ayatollah of the modern
Iranian school. The 67-year-old bearded
cleric describes the enemy as a “hyena,” a
“mad dog” and “a butcher of young chil-
dren.” When he wants to be really nasty, he
calls him “a renegade Muslim” and “a Zi-
onist agent.” Indeed, Ayatollah Teherani
learned his theology and his epithets at the
feet of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini him-
self. What separates Teherani from the run-
of-the-mill Iranian cleric is that he delivers
his scathing appraisals not from Teheran
but from Baghdad, on Iraqi television. And
the man he is attacking is none other than
his old mentor —Khomeini.
Teherani has become the Tokyo Rose of
the Iran-Iraq war. For three months, the
turncoat ayatollah has been a mainstay of
Iraqi propaganda, broadcasting in Farsi to
eastern Iran and to the 80,000 Iranian
POW’s in Iraq. When he criticizes Kho-
meini, he does it with authority. Teherani
met Khomeini 50 years ago, when he began
14 years of study with him in Qom. He was,
he says, the master’s favorite pupil, the one
Khomeini called “the light of my eyes.” He
had also married a sister of Iranian President
Ali Khamenei. Until 1979 Teherani was
part of Khomeini’s inner circle. After break-
ing with the regime, he spent eight months in
jail. Upon his release, he remained under
house arrest before escaping to Iraq several
months ago. He won’t say how he got out,
but diplomatic sources
believe he had help from
Iraqi agents in Iran.
Teherani delivers an
unrelenting message:
Iran’s revolution has
turned rotten. At Qom,
he says, Khomeini “ap-
peared to be a saintly,
humble man .. . But
once in power, he be-
came a bloodthirsty dic-
tator.” Teherani esti-
mates that 90 percent of
Iran’s clergy is now disil-

Teherani: Rebel
lusioned with Khomeini, though “there is a
reign of terror and the opposition to him is
unorganized.” The real power, he says, be-
longs to Khomeini’s son, Ahmad.
For all Teherani’s vehemence, there is no
evidence that his diatribes are tempting
many Iranians to the Iraqi side. Iraqi offi-
cials say that several Iranian officers have
defected and are now fighting with Iraqi
troops. But Teherani has not managed to
produce what his Iraqi sponsors hope for —
a legion of anti-Khomeini Iranian volun-
teers who might tilt the balance toward Iraq
in the long and bloody war.

EUROPE
A Truce at Fontainebleau
One big, happy family: After five years of bitter squabbling, the Common Market frees itself from the grip of a ‘paralyzing
The end of the British budget dispute may herald the return of European unity.
They arrived in the grandiose ballroom
of the Chateau de Fontainebleau in the
grip of what one French official called a
“paralyzing obsession”—the bitter five-
year-old battle over Britain’s contributions
to the European Economic Community.
But last week the EEC leaders finally settled
the nagging dispute that had pushed the
EEC to the brink of insolvency and threat-
ened to tear the Community apart. The
agreement cleared the way for Spain and
Portugal to join the Common Market, tem-
porarily resolved the EEC’s own budget
mess and allowed the Europeans to pursue
their goal of a closer economic and political
union. “All the arguments that were block-
ing European construction at the beginning
of this year have been unblocked,” said
French President Frangois Mitterrand,
who concluded his six-month term as presi-
dent of the Community. “There are no long-
er any major disputes.”
That may be an overly optimistic view,
but such enthusiasm was understandable
after the end of the most divisive dispute in
the EEC’s history. After a flurry of intense
last-minute bargaining, the British accept-
ed somewhat less money than they had been
demanding—and the other EEC partners
wound up giving more than they would
have liked. But the hard-won compromise
was well crafted and ambiguous enough for
all sides to claim victory. “We have succeed-
ed in constructing a satisfactory settlement
out of what was initially a very unpromising
situation,” said British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. “This is a good deal
for Britain and a good deal for the
Community.”
‘Good Sense 9 : In fact, some political-oppo-
sition leaders in Britain and France com-
plained that their respective governments
had given in too easily. And many worried
that the agreement was little more than a
temporary cease-fire in the budget battle.
But it was clear that a failure at Fontaine-
bleau would have doomed the EEC to sever-
al more months of painful inaction, perhaps
permanently damaging the chances for an
accord —a fate the EEC leaders were deter-
mined to avoid at almost any cost. The Ten
showed a surprising willingness to compro-
mise on side issues that in the past might
have dashed the prospects for larger agree-
ments. The Community agreed to allow
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
raise subsidies for German farmers, and
even acceded to Kohl’s demand for a cap on
German contributions toward the British
rebate—if only to achieve a compromise on
the budget question. “It was a victory,” said
Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, “dic-
tated by good sense, by necessity and by
exhaustion.”
Thatcher had complained for years that
an out-of-control farm-subsidy system—
J. LANGEVIN— SYGMA
Craxi: ‘A victory dictated by exhaustion ’


obsession ’ —and tries to form a closer union
LANGEVIN— SYGMA
which pays farmers to produce surpluses
that can no longer be sold at a profit—had
unfairly penalized her country because
Britain contributed far more to the EEC
coffers than it got back. Last year, for
example, Britain paid roughly $1.6 billion
more than it received in agricultural subsi-
dies and other programs. But with the
EEC itself expected to run a $1.6 billion
deficit this year, other Common Market
leaders were unwilling to give in to
Thatcher’s strident demands for a rebate.
At the Brussels summit in March, the EEC
countries had agreed to erase the budget
shortfall by raising their contributions to
the Community from 1 percent to 1.4 per-
cent of the sales taxes (value-added taxes)
each country collects. But Thatcher “re-
served” her approval of the budget hike
until the rebate issue was resolved —
implicitly threatening the Community
with economic strangulation unless she
got her way.
Giving Ground: In the end, however, both
sides gave considerable ground. Under the
terms of the agreement, the EEC will refund
to Britain $6OO million for 1983, funds the
Community had frozen months back pend-
ing a more permanent agreement on the
British contribution. The EEC will give
Britain another $BOO million for 1984, and
in future years it will rebate 66 percent
of the difference between what the British
contribute in sales taxes and what the
EEC spends in Britain. That sum will prob-
ably end up being less than what Thatcher
had initially bargained for, chiefly because
Britain agreed to drop its demand that rev-
enue from customs duties and levies on agri-
cultural imports be included in the 66 per-
cent figure.
There is a provision in the pact that could
cause more problems for the Community,
The formula will only be in force so long as
the EEC countries hold their budget contri-
butions to the new 1.4 percent level. But the
Common Market may be forced to seek
another budget hike by as early as 1987
and then the British contribution formula
would have to be renegotiated. Britain
would again have the power to veto any tax
increase. “You can be sure that we will not
agree to [another increase],” Thatcher said,
inless we are offered the same system for
our budget compensation or a better one.”
Many British critics of the agreement
argued that the same system is not good
enough. They pointed out that Thatcher
had turned down in Brussels a better offer
than she accepted in Fontainebleau. Neil
Kinnock, leader of the Labor Party, con-
tended that Thatcher had agreed to pay
higher contributions to the EEC “without
closer at hand (following story), and the
Common Market will at last be able to
concentrate on the urgent issue of European
unity. So far the steps have been largely
symbolic. The leaders agreed to consider
the creation of a new European flag, a Con-
tinental anthem, a Europassport and even
the development of standard history
courses. But there were more practical
ideas. A committee will attempt to devise a
standard lading document for European
truckers, who often lose several hours at
each border filing different papers. Perhaps
most important, the EEC ordered the devel-
opment of common standards for telecom-
munications and biotechnologies. Unless
the Europeans begin pooling their re-
sources, they will permanently fall behind
the United States and Japan in the race to
develop essential high-tech industries,
Abyss: There are other problems that
could destroy attempts at European coop-
eration. The EEC still faces a huge budget
deficit this year and is expecting an even
larger shortfall in 1985. Many critics argue
that the Community’s runaway agricultur-
al-subsidy system must undergo radical re-
Demanding a Europe without borders: Resisting the temptation of national interests
having won any of the desperately needed
reforms” in the farm-subsidy system that
many say is the root of the EEC’s problems.
Others said that the agreeement was simply
a bad deal for Britain. Had the new formula
been applied to last year’s payments, they
argued, Britain would have ended up with
20 percent less than it received under the old
system. But Thatcher aides insist that such
hypothetical situations are irrelevant now
that Britain is assured an annual rebate for
the next few years—and can avoid the de-
structive yearly battles over the size of its
contribution.
With the budget issue finally resolved,
the Community could once again get down
to business. Mitterrand rushed off to Portu-
gal and Spain to tell the two governments
that their membership in the EEC was now
form if the EEC is ever to attain long-term
peace. Last year about 65 percent of the
Community’s $20.4 billion budget went to
fund the farm subsidies—a figure almost
all members acknowledge is unacceptably
high. Yet there has been substantial politi-
cal pressure from powerful farm lobbies on
the governments of almost all the countries
to keep the subsidy system intact. It will
probably be difficult for the EEC leaders to
follow the example they set in Fontaine-
bleau and resist the temptation to pursue
narrow national interests at the expense of
European unity. But having stared into the
abyss, they may now be more determined
to avoid it.

PERISCOPE
The Conventions: The GOP Tries for Life...
Ronald Reagan may hear some grumbling from conservative
delegates at the GOP convention in Dallas. The president now plans
to approve the deletion of three planks from the GOP platform:
opposition to the 55-mph speed limit and pledges to abolish the
Education and Energy departments. All three planks, says one
White House aide, are “losers,” despite their conservative appeal.
The speed limit is no longer an issue, but the two cabinet departments
created by Jimmy Carter still rouse ire on the right. Reagan,
however, has apparently surrendered to the combination of interest
groups, congressional supporters and executive-branch bureaucrats
who resist abolition. Besides, the president doesn’t want to tilt
against Education at the same time he is courting teachers’ votes.
■ GOP strategists have been searching for ways to enliven the
president’s coronation. Planners for the Dallas convention have
fastidiously redesigned the podium in earth tones to make it more
appealing to the eye and have streamlined the program itself: fewer
speeches will be given. Delegates in the convention hall will be
treated to glossy documentaries of Nancy Reagan as well as of the
president, and eight television screens will beam charts, graphs and
film clips at them to hold their attention. And for home viewers who
want more than the networks’ prime-time coverage, the GOP has
created the RNC Network, offering gavel-to-gavel coverage to
independent stations and cablecasters for a piddling $250 hookup
fee. Perhaps the main event, other than Reagan’s acceptance speech,
will be the keynote address by U.S. Treasurer Katherine Ortega,
whose entertainment value is that she will be the first Hispanic
female to kick off a GOP convention. One senior party official is so
taken with the demographic deftness of Ortega’s selection that,
asked whether she figures to give a rousing speech, he responded:
“Who cares?”
.. .And the Democrats Go for Nostalgia
With credentials and delegate fights settled in advance, Demo-
cratic convention planners are assembling a four-day ceremony that
will be heavy on nostalgia and will provide plenty of opportunities
for air time to three women Walter Mondale is eying as prospective
running mates. As tentatively set now, Monday, July 16, will include
a welcoming address by San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and
assumption of chair duties by Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Col-
lins. The plan calls for quick dispatching of rules and credentials
matters. There is expected to be a short appearance by Jimmy Carter
on that day, a film about Harry Truman and the keynote address by
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. On Tuesday, plans call for showing a
film about legendary female Democrat Eleanor Roosevelt. Tuesday
will also be the night for what few platform disputes are expected to
make the floor—including ones on the Middle East and defense
spending—and, tentatively, for an address by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
on voting reform. The discussions will give Rep. Geraldine Ferraro,
who headed the platform committee, a chance for prime-time
exposure. On Wednesday, presidential-nomination night, Sen.
Gary Hart is expected to speak, and perhaps Jackson again. DNC
officials are determined to keep the convention sessions within the
prime viewing hours of 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time.
A Hard-Line Ambassador to Guatemala?
Politically moderate Guatemalans have expressed concern and
disappointment over the nomination of a Jesse Helms favorite to be
the next U.S. ambassador to Guatemala. Alberto Piedra, 58, who
fled his native Cuba shortly after Fide! Castro seized power, is
currently an adviser to the U.S. delegation to the Organization of
American States. In 1980 he coauthored a monograph titled “Gua-
temala: A Promise in Peril,” that some read as an apologia for the
regime of Gen. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, considered among
the worst human-rights violators in recent Latin American history.
Guatemalan moderates in the opposition Christian Democratic
Party now wonder if the Reagan administration is trying to send
them a message a year before presidential elections are expected to be
held in that country. But some Guatemalans suspect that the
nomination might have even greater political significance in the
United States during an election year: Piedra will be the first
Hispanic ambassador Reagan has sent to Central America.
A New Choke Point for the Coke Trade
Colombia’s cocaine refiners are not happy. Their industry is
suffering from a shortage of ether, a key refining ingredient, because
of a crackdown in Panama, where half a dozen shipments of ether
were recently seized on their way to Colombian refineries. Panama-
nian President Jorge Illueca ordered the freeze after more than 2,000
pounds of cocaine shipped through Panama were seized in Miami
last month —the second largest coke bust in south Florida history.
As a result of the Panamanian pressure, U.S. officials say, the price of
ether has jumped in Colombia, and cocaine prices in Miami are
beginning a corresponding rise. But the cokebusters may have
plugged one hole only to see another open up: U. S. drug officials say
there is evidence that Venezuela is now a major way station in
international cocaine trafficking.
And Now, the Bill Bradley Tax Book
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, considered a possible contender
for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, is laying his
political groundwork in a new paperback to be published by Pocket
Books this month. Called “The Fair Tax,” the 190-page book
features a large picture of Bradley on the cover and lays out his ideas
for tax reform, many of them embodied in the Bradley-Gephardt tax
bill now before Congress. But the book also has a narrower function:
to collect names of potential Bradley supporters. On the last page is a
mock letter demanding tax reform on which readers are supposed to
write their names and addresses before mailing. Although the letter
is addressed to “President Reagan, House Speaker Thomas O’Neill
and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker,” the form instructs
signers to return it to Bradley’s own “Fair Tax Foundation.”
France Takes a Chance in the Gulf
France is continuing to arm and train the Iraqi Air Force, despite
concerns among officials in Paris that such aid might aggravate the
Gulf war between Iraq and Iran. This spring France reinforced the
Super Etendard jets it sold Iraq last fall with about 100 Exocet
missiles, which have been used to devastating effect against neutral
ships in the Gulf. The French rationale is both diplomatic and
economic. France fears that Iran will win the war and destabilize the
Gulf —even though it realizes that the Iraqi air strikes are themselves
destabilizing. Just as important, Iraq, which has been the biggest
buyer of French goods in the Middle East, owes France more than $4
billion. If Iraq is ever to pay that debt, it must prevail against Iran.
The French also hope that by supporting Baghdad against Teheran,
it will win future customers among Arab Gulf states.

U.S. AFFAIRS
CAMPAGN'84
Jesse Jackson Goes to Cuba
He brings back U.S. prisoners but is upstaged by a controversial supporter
Inside the VIP lounge at Havana’s Jose
Marti airport, Fidel Castro and Jesse
Jackson were discussing final details of their
deal. The Cuban president offered the
American candidate one of his trademark
Cohiba cigars. As Jackson rolled the hand-
made cigar between his fingers with Grou-
cho-like relish, someone reminded the Bap-
tist minister about religious restrictions on
smoking. “This is not a cigar,” Jackson
snapped. “This is a peace pipe.” Then Jack-
son stuck the lit Cohiba in his mouth, made a
show of savoring it and pointed it skyward.
“Havanahasbeengoodtome,”hesaid.“But
Washington, here I come.”
Havana had been good to Jackson: in the
Farrakhan:Hate
WAYNE SOURCE— JB PICTURES
end, Castro agreed to re-
lease 49 jailed Americans
and Cuban political pris-
oners to his care. But
Washington was a differ-
ent story. An enthusias-
tic throng of Cuban ex-
iles, families of released
prisoners and chanting
supporters greeted the
Democratic candidate at
Dulles airport. But Sec-
retary of State George P.
Shultz had already dis-
missed Jackson’s Cuba
coup as Castro’s attempt
at “a propaganda victo-
ry,” and neither Shultz
nor President Reagan
showed any interest in
debriefing him on his “moral offensive for
peace.” The White House openly ques-
tioned Jackson’s patriotism, and even many
who wished him well were distressed by his
cozy performance with Castro.
Crusade: Moreover, Nation of Islam lead-
er Louis Farrakhan —Jackson’s most con-
troversial supporter—had upstaged his can-
didate’s six-day, four-nation Latin
American tour. Once again Farrakhan, un-
til a few months ago a Jackson campaign
surrogate, had broadcast an anti-Semitic
outburst, and this time his performance
threatened Jackson’s expectations for a
prominent role at the Democratic conven-
tion. The latest controversy had seriously
rattled party leaders —including Walter
Mondale in part, whose presidential hopes
depend on a fragile coalition embracing both
blacks and Jews.
Jackson had hoped his trip would become
the same kind of headline-stealing triumph
as his mission to Syria last December to win
the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman
Jr., and at times he sounded more like a rock-
and-roll promoter than a presidential candi-
date as he chronicled the “good vibrations”
of his “give peace a chance” crusade. Jack-
son’s exuberance far exceeded that of almost
anyone else involved. In ajoint press confer-
ence on the steps of the presidential palace in
San Salvador, El Salvador’s new president,
Jose Napoleon Duarte, dismissed guerrilla
proposals for negotiations brought to him by
Jackson as “nothing new.”
All along, Jackson had been counting on
Castro to guarantee the success of his mis-
sion. But while the Cuban leader signaled
friendly intentions with a hero’s welcome,
the two met for more than eight hours before
Castro officially agreed to release 22 Ameri-
can prisoners—most of them in Cuban jails
on drug charges. There were some signs that
the deal was preordained: the Americans’
cells had been freshly whitewashed in prep-
aration for Jackson’s visit. Reagan adminis-
tration spokesmen denigrated Jackson’s
achievement, and one senior presidential
aide commented, “Castro’s got to be going
ho ho ... he has given us a bunch of drug
dealers and hopheads.” (Upon returning to
the United States, six of the Americans were
arrested on outstanding federal or state
warrants.)
Before Jackson’s scheduled departure for
Nicaragua, Castro informed him that he
would also free 27 Cuban political prisoners

with family ties in the United States. Jackson
elatedly announced the release on the way to
Managua, telling reporters, “We knew that
to just take the Americans back without
dealing with the issue of family reunification
. . . would be inadequate.” But a final turn-
about was awaiting Jackson. When his en-
tourage reached Washington, the one freed
Cuban invited to address the crowd chose to
disagree with Jackson. Andres Vargas Go-
mez, who had spent 22 years in Cuban pris-
ons convicted of being a CIA operative,
denounced as “a moral offense” any attempt
to deal with Castro. “We don’t want peace
where there is repression,” he said. Jackson
smoothed over the awkward moment with a
tribute to “what makes America America
. . . the right to express ourselves and differ-
ent points of views. ”
‘Outlaw’: Jackson had heard about Far-
rakhan’s latest outburst in the midst of his
negotiations in Havana. During a Chicago
radio broadcast, the Nation of Islam leader
called the existence of Israel an “outlaw act”
and decried the “criminal conspiracy” of the
United States and other allies of the Jewish
state. “There can be no
peace structured on injus-
tice, lying and deceit and us-
ing the name of God to
shield your gutter religion
under his holy and righteous
name,” Farrakhan de-
clared. He later insisted that
he had used the word
“dirty” rather than “gut-
ter,” but that seemed a Tal-
mudic distinction. “Wheth-
er he said ‘gutter’ or ‘dirty,’
the statement comes from
the gutter,” said Irving M.
Levine, a spokesman for the
American Jewish Commit-
tee. Black leaders, too, ex-
pressed outrage over the
militant Muslim’s words
and suggested Jackson should follow suit.
As the protests grew, Fritz Mondale sud-
denly had a Jackson problem to rival Jack-
son’s Farrakhan problem. Henry Siegman,
executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, urged the prospective Democrat-
Vargas Gomez reunited with his wife: ‘A moral offense ’
ic nominee “to screw up enough courage” to
repudiate Jackson if he refused to speak out
against Farrakhan. Mondale, who had been
busy searching for a vice president and
trying to make peace with Gary Hart, ap-
peared reluctant to offend Jackson’s fervent
black constituency. He branded Farrak-
han’s remarks “venomous, bigoted and ob-
scene” and again beseeched Jackson to repu-
diate him. But Mondale declined to threaten
a break with Jackson over the issue.
Unity: Jackson initially tried to duck the
controversy. “Don’t keep putting me in the
middle of that,” he told CBS from Havana.
“I feel no obligation to respond to it.” But
when some party officials and congressmen
began to suggest that Jackson might forfeit
his right to address the convention, the
preacher reconsidered. He directed his staff
in Washington to draft a statement; it char-
acterized Farrakhan’s attacks on Judaism
and Israel as “reprehensible and morally
indefensible,” and added, “I will not permit
Minister Farrakhan’s words —wittingly or
unwittingly—to divide the Democratic Par-
ty.” Jackson, later told Newsweek’s Syl-
vester Monroe that he and Farrakhan hadn’t
spoken for about two months. But at a week-
end meeting at Operation PUSH in Chicago,
which he founded, Jackson was seated
onstage along with Abdul Akbar Muham-
mad, Farrakhan’s right-hand man.
Jackson’s response stopped short of de-
nouncing Farrakhan personally, but top
party and Mondale campaign leaders eager-
ly seized upon it as a prelude to harmony at
the convention and in the fall campaign. “It
was a very positive statement,” said Mon-
dale campaign manager Robert Beckel, who
had worked with Jackson’s staff to help draft
it. Mondale now plans to meet with Jackson
Tuesday in Kansas City in hopes of making a
joint plea for black-Jewish unity. But with
the convention still two weeks away, the
path to Democratic unity may be trickier
than the one Jackson just traveled in Latin
America —and the peace pipe far more
elusive.

Mondale: What Women Want
Mending fences in New York: Unity in the drive against Reagan—and new rules for 1988
MARIO RUIZ—PICTURE GROUP
1t was the warmest welcome on his three-
day southern tour, and Walter Mondale
rose to the occasion. In Miami last weekend,
some 1,000 delegates to a National Organi-
zation for Women convention cheered,
whistled and waved their “Woman VP
Now” signs as Mondale declaimed on a
pledge he had made months before. “I said
all along that I didn’t want the best man to
be my vice president—l just wanted the
best, ” Mondale said. “And if I choose a
woman, it will be because she is the best.”
In fact, Mondale hadn’t committed him-
self to anything. But—partly because he
continues to raise expectations among wom-
en and partly because of a powerful lobby-
ing campaign among Washington’s “old
girl” network —the notion of a woman on
the ticket may prove irresistible. He has
already interviewed San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, and this week will inter-
view Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins
and Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York,
the consensus favorite among women’s lead-
ers. Surveys of the delegates, moreover,
show that three-quarters would support a
“well-qualified” woman for veep. And there
was the risk of rebellion in San Francisco,
where half the delegates, by a longstanding
party rule, will be women. NOW president
Judy Goldsmith, who said she opposes any
such demonstration, nonetheless observed
that women delegates might well walk out if
Mondale picks a man.
Mondale himself stuck dutifully to his
preconvention game plan, interviewing each
of his prospective running mates in turn and
carefully nurturing the seeds of party unity.
His current list is almost as carefully bal-
anced as a federal commission appointed by
James Watt: in addition to the three women,
there are two black mayors, Wilson Goode
of Philadelphia and Tom Bradley of Los
Angeles; one Hispanic, Mayor Henry Cis-
neros of San Antonio; three white males,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Gov. Robert
Graham of Florida and Sen. Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas. (Other names could surface.

With Rep. Ferraro: Looking for Ms. Goodvote
ARRY DOWNING— NESWEEK
tricia Schroeder, cochairman of
Gary Hart’s campaign—wrote
Mondale a lengthy memo recom-
mending his wife for veep.)
It was by no means clear, how-
ever, that all of the interviewees
saw themselves as genuine possi-
bilities —and some seemed to be
striving for nonchalance. Fein-
stein said that she did not “lust
after” the vice presidency and did
not want to run. Goode said he
“loved” being mayor of Philadel-
phia, and that he would consider
the nomination if and when it was
offered. Graham went further: on
Friday, he withdrew his name
from consideration. And then
there was Hart, whose runner-up
status could make him the logical
running mate —but who still in-
sists that he will be No. 1.
Bubble: The Mondale camp, for
its part, was being cautious about
offering Hart the job—partly out
of concern for whether he would be
what one aide called “a team play-
er,” and partly because of its cur-
rent interest in evaluating poten-
tial women candidates. By one
theory, the women’s boomlet has
already made the choice of a “tra-
ditional” male candidate —a Bentsen, for
example—virtually impossible. But if, for
whatever reason, the woman-for-veep bub-
ble burst, Hart’s chances could improve
dramatically: he has 1,250 delegates, a
strong record on women’s issues, and nei-
ther side is burning its bridges.
In fact, Hart and Mondale met in New
York last week to mend their differences—a
meeting that followed a week of intensive
negotiations between their staffs. Their rap-
prochement was eased by Sen. Edward Ken-
nedy on the condition that Hart abandon
any challenge to Mondale’s convention del-
egates; in exchange, Mondale agreed to
support Hart’s appeal for more favorable
delegate-selection rules in 1988. Aides said
Hart had already made that decision on his
own —but Kennedy sealed the deal
with a phone call from Mondale’s
living room in North Oaks, Minn.
Seated on Mondale’s couch, Ken-
nedy reviewed the terms with
Hart, then flashed the thumbs-up
sign at Mondale. “That’s great,
Gary,” said Mondale, taking the
phone. Two days later Hart and
Mondale breakfasted privately in
Manhattan, then emerged to an-
nounce their mutual respect for
each other and their determination
to unseat Ronald Reagan. Stand-
ing together, they looked like a
unity ticket —though for the Dem-
ocrats this year, unity seems to be a
sometime thing.

A Start to the‘Star Wars' Talks
Ever. since President Reagan vowed to
build a “Star Wars” defense system,
Moscow has been trying rather desperately
to talk him out of it. Only last April the
president told Congress he did “not believe
it would be productive to engage in formal
international negotiations” on antisatellite
weapons because it would be impossible to
verify a ban. But the Soviets made yet an-
other pitch last week, and this time the
Reagan administration quickly agreed to
begin talks this September.
Only in the context of seven months with-
out negotiations could this maneuvering
look like progress. Instead of talking about
not talking, the superpowers were talking
about talking. Administration hands saw it
as a first sign that the Kremlin was slow-
ly beginning to abandon its recent hard
line. Negotiations would also blunt the
peace issue the Democrats plan to use
against the president in the fall cam-
paign. But there was a tactical advantage
for the Soviets. The timing of the talks
could give them the best chance they
have yet to extract concessions and stop
the Pentagon’s push into space.
The new Soviet proposal appeared un-
expectedly in the form of a statement by
Tass, the Soviet news agency. It called for
talks “to prevent the militarization of
outer space” and to completely ban anti-
satellite weapons. Within hours, in time
for television’s evening-news programs,
national-security adviser Robert McFar-
lane appeared in the press room to read a
one-page response. He said the United
States agreed to meet anywhere the Sovi-
ets would like and to talk about several
items, some on the Soviet agenda and
some not. The U.S. list included resump-
tion of START and INF talks, limita-
tions on anti-satellite weapons and “any
other arms-control concerns or other
matters of interest to both sides.” Said a
senior official: “There are no
preconditions.”
Conciliatory: The administration por-
trayed the exchange as a conciliatory move
by the Soviets. “They may have concluded
that Ronald Reagan is going to be re-elected,
and they’re going to have to deal with him for
four more years,” said one Reagan hand. But
there was room for another interpretation.
The only new wrinkles in the Soviet proposal
were the time and place: Vienna in Septem-
ber. Yuri Andropov had proposed a treaty
prohibiting all space weapons in April 1983.
He renewed the offer in August; Konstantin
Chernenko repeated it in May and June. The
administration spurned the Soviet overtures
because of the problem of verification.
But Washington’s refusal to talk came
under mounting attack from Democrats,
both in Congress and on the campaign trail.
Both the House and Senate passed restric-
tions on U.S. antisatellite tests. The presi-
dent, in response, abruptly softened his po-
sition. He told a news conference in
mid-June, “We haven’t slammed the door”
on negotiations. Last week it became appar-
ent that the door was wide open.
Talking did not mean agreeing. The two
sides will have problems just setting an
agenda. The Soviets are not likely to be
interested in the administration’s desire to
talk about ways to resume the INF and
START talks. They walked out of those
talks last fall when NATO began deploy-
ment of new intermediate-range missiles,
and they have persistently refused to come
back while those missiles remain in Europe.
The administration will not be interested in
Soviet proposals to foreclose the president’s
proposed missile defense system. And while
AUTH—PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER
High-tech space battle: Negotiations might blunt the peace issue in the coming campaign
the Soviets want a “complete renunciation”
of antisatellite weapons, the United States
still believes that a total ban is unverifiable.
It wants to discuss only “limitations” on
antisatellite weapons.
The most promising limitation the ad-
ministration is considering would ban the
development of high-altitude satellite kill-
ers. Both sides can already destroy low-
altitude satellites, but neither has tested a
weapon that can reach and kill sentry satel-
lites in 22,000-mile geosynchronous orbits
that provide early warning of enemy missile
launches. Other possible U.S. proposals in-
clude a future ban on testing antisatellite
weapons, a limit of one antisatellite weapon
per side, or a “rules of the road” agreement
covering incidents in space.
The Soviets will open with a demand
calculated to give them an immediate re-
ward for coming to the table. They will ask
that both sides refrain from testing antisa-
tellite weapons while the talks are in prog-
ress. The Soviets are already observing a
moratorium on testing their crude anti-sat-
ellite system. A joint moratorium would
benefit them by blocking the administra-
tion’s plans to test the new and more sophis-
ticated American antisatellite system this
fall.
Leverage: Modest though the two sides’
common ground might be, the very possibil-
ity of talks confounded some of the conven-
tional wisdom on U.S.-Soviet relations in
this election year. It debunked the theory
that the Soviets would have nothing to do
with Reagan until after November. Re-
opening arms negotiations of any kind in
September would be a major boost for the
president, undercutting the Democrats’ ar-
gument that the administration’s hard-line
policies have made negotiations impossible.
But were the Soviets really prepared to
help Reagan win re-election? The Kremlin
presumably is maneuvering to gain some
leverage over Reagan. The Soviets may be-
lieve that if they walk out of the talks as
Election Day approaches, charging Ameri-
can intransigence, they could tip a close race
to the Democrats. Their best-case scenario
may even foresee Reagan cutting a deal to
abandon Star Wars and assure his re-elec-
tion. Similar thinking backfired on the Sovi-
ets after they walked out of the Geneva
arms-control talks; the president was able to
turn their tantrum to his advantage. But the
end game of an American election can be
very fluid. And Moscow may now have
concluded that this will be its last chance to
bargain with Reagan from a position of
strength.

Hong Kong’s ‘Deng Lashing’
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST
Traders at the stock exchange, Hong Kong construction site: A crisis of confidence has triggered an economic guessing game
HUBERT VAN ES—PHOTOREPORTERS
The colony seeks reassurance —and gets another dose of Peking shock instead.
For Hong Kong, it was the second shock
from Peking in less than a month, and it
was a bombshell. The first came late in May
when Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping turned
earlier official statements inside out and
announced that China would station troops
in the colony after Britain’s lease runs out in
1997. Then, in a meeting with some high-
powered visitors from Hong Kong two
weeks ago, Deng declared that Peking had
already decided how it would run the colo-
ny when it took over—and that any effort by
Hong Kong to influence that course would
be considered an unacceptable “external
interference.”
The “Deng lashing,” as one news-
paper in the colony termed it, drew a
new hard line in China’s dealings
with Hong Kong. Just a few years ago
Deng had a pat answer to questions
about the colony’s future: “Put your
hearts at ease.” But since formal ne-
gotiations between London and Pe-
king began in late 1982, the Chinese
leadership has seemed increasingly
less inclined to take the steps that
would give substance to those words.
The reaction in Hong Kong has been
alternating cycles of panic and
gloom. Real-estate values have plum-
meted, stock prices have become in-
creasingly volatile and capital has
flowed into and out of the colony with
alarming irregularity. With his own dead-
line on the 1997 talks with Britain less than
three months away, Deng’s tough talk
could set the stage for a new crisis of confi-
dence in the colony.
Ironically, it was the “confidence factor”
that brought the Hong Kong delegation to
Peking in the first place. Led by Sir S. Y.
Chung, a prominent businessman and ad-
viser to the colony’s Executive and Legisla-
tive Council, the three-person group hoped
to convince Deng of the depth of the colo-
ny’s anxieties over the future. Beyond that,
they sought to convey their concern that the
Deng Xiaoping: Dropping a political bombshell
AP
high degree of autonomy promised to Hong
Kong by China’s current regime might be
watered down by subsequent governments.
And they intended to warn Peking that a
hasty Sino-British, accord riddled with
holes would, in their view, be worse than no
accord at all.
Blunt: Chung had already delivered the
same message to British officials during a
visit to London in May. But when the trio
got to Peking, they could barely get a word
in edgewise. Deng told them bluntly that
Hong Kong would have no role in deciding
how Peking runs the colony after 1997, and
he denied that there was a crisis of
confidence in the colony.
To drive his points home, he
inflicted an unprecedented series of
symbolic snubs on the unfortunate
delegates—and made sure that the
Hong Kong press was on the scene
to record them. The Chinese strong-
man did not come to the door of the
conference room to greet the delega-
tion. And he rudely dispensed with
the ceremonial chitchat to get right
down to business. “If you have any
opinions, please state them,” said
Deng, with cameras rolling and
loudspeakers strategically placed to
carry his words to all corners of the
room. “But I have to tell you that we
have already decided our position


The higher your standards
the better we look.

and policy, and these cannot be changed.”
Deng topped off the browbeating with a
reminder of his earlier message about Pe-
king’s military plans for Hong Kong. The
People’s Liberation Army would be station-
ing troops there, he said, despite previous
assurances. Deng also appeared to edge
away from another pledge—that Peking
would neither interfere in the day-to-day
administration of Hong Kong nor attempt
to direct the selection of its leaders. Accord-
ing to the New China News Agency, Deng
told the delegates that “all organs of the
government should be comprised mainly of
patriots [who support] the recovery of sov-
ereignty over Hong Kong.” The underlying
threat from Peking, said one Western diplo-
mat there, was clear: “We’ll talk to anybody
except those who criticize us; and if you
disagree with us, you’re not a patriot and
have no place in our Hong Kong.”
Joint Accord: How the latest signals will
affect Hong Kong in the long run remains
to be seen. When it first came out in May,
the news that China would send troops to
the colony sparked an instant round of
jitters and triggered a sharp drop in the
Hang Seng stock index. But some Hong
Kong residents speculate that Deng’s fol-
low-up hard-lining may have been little
more than a negotiating ploy designed to
win new concessions from Britain. His
well-publicized snub of the Hong Kong
delegation came just as the talks with Brit-
ain entered a new phase. Two days before
Chung’s delegation visited Peking, a Sino-
British working group began meetings to
draw up a “preliminary” draft of a joint
accord. At a press conference in the Chi-
nese capital last week, Pieter Dankert,
president of the European Parliament, dis-
closed that British and Chinese officials
had told him that a preliminary agreement
would be “concluded” by September—
China’s deadline —and Western diplomats
have said that a “final” statement would be
made public by the end of the year.
Beyond that, the colony is trying hard to
develop a wait-and-see attitude toward the
post-1997 future. Hong Kong still has time
to go about its business —which, for the
most part, is making money. The key ques-
tion now seems to be what cumulative effect
Peking’s policy reversals will have on inves-
tor confidence.
Usual Caution: The latest signs are dis-
concerting. No one really knows how
much money is coming into the colony—
or how much is going out. But Hong Kong
entrepreneurs, who account for 90 percent
of all investment in the colony, are begin-
ning to show more than their usual cau-
tion. They are keeping their assets liquid
and staying away from long-term ventures.
And last week Chinese entrepreneur Wang
Guangying, president of the Hong Kong-
based Ever Bright Corp., announced that
he was pulling out of a $l5O million real-
estate deal —and sent the Hang Seng stock
index into a 21-point dive. Wang, a broth-
er-in-law of the late Chinese President Liu
Shaoqi, is Peking’s No. 1 money man in
Hong Kong, and his decision was predict-
ably seen as a signal that despite Deng’s
insistence that there is no crisis of confi-
dence, China itself is less than bullish
about the local economy.
Wang linked his withdrawal to the deci-
sion by the giant multinational Jardine
Matheson & Co. earlier this year to transfer
its legal base of operations to Bermuda.
Strategies similar to Jardine’s are being
adopted by foreign investors. Even Ameri-
can corporations, which had managed to
remain relatively bullish about Hong
Kong’s economic future, are now having
second thoughts. Investments by U.S. man-
ufacturers in Hong Kong rose by 6 percent in
1982, according to the U.S. Commerce De-
partment. But when the department releases
its 1983 figures next month, that growth is
expected to have fallen to nearly nothing.
Old Commitments: To be sure, few for-
eign firms are forsaking the colony altogeth-
er. In recent months the Bank of America
decided to base its North Asia regional
data-processing center there. Citibank just
occupied its new headquarters in Hong
Kong, Chase Manhattan Bank is expanding
its financial-services operations and Sears
has launched a new Hong Kong trading
outlet. But many of the projects now under
way represent commitments made several
years ago. And other ventures are not so
much new initiatives as efforts to protect
current operations. “You are not going to
see any major new plants,” says one U.S.
electronics executive.
For Hong Kong’s nervous leaders, such
signs of pessimism are bound to be disturb-
ing. In spite of Deng’s rebuff, however, they
have not given up hope that Peking will
eventually realize that Hong Kong’s confi-
dence crisis is real enough to threaten Asia’s
chief financial center. As one target of
Deng’s snubs put it: “We hope people will
continue to express their views, and that
those views will be listened to.” Until that
happens, the colony’s heart —and its capi-
talist soul —will not rest easy.

‘We Are Not
Obstructing’
SirSze-yuen Chung, 66, a senior adviser
to the Hong Kong government, led the
group to Peking that ran into Deng Xiao-
ping's calculated snub and hard line on the
1997 negotiations. Last week Chung spoke
with Newsweek’s lan Findlay in Hong
Kong. Excerpts:
FINDLAY: Do you think Peking has
done enough to maintain international
confidence in Hong Kong?
CHUNG: Certainly not. Propaganda is
meaningless. Confidence is built on truth.
You cannot manufacture confidence.
Q. After your discussions with Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, do you feel you are
able to trust the Chinese government?
A. We do have faith in the present Chi-
nese leadership. But we are worried that
the future leadership may not follow the
Chung: ‘Propaganda is meaningless ’
same line as . . . the present leadership.
Q. What do you think will happen if
Hong Kong cannot maintain its stability
and prosperity after 1997?
A. It won’t be able to survive.
Q. What is your response to the charge
that the Hong Kong people have been ob-
structing the talks?
A. We are not obstructing. We are try-
ing to help. What we are trying to avoid is
a bad agreement . . . that will not com-
mand confidence in the Hong Kong peo-
ple and the international community.
And you can’t get a good agreement until
the British and Chinese governments
know the wills and wishes, the fears and
feelings, of the Hong Kong people.
Q. Some people have said that Hong
Kong should set aside its 1997 worries.
A. People who come to Hong Kong for
a short period of time certainly can forget
1997. People like me who were born here
and have their roots here cannot.

WORLD BUSINESS
An Argentine Soap Opera
Confronting a billion-dollar black hole: The question is how to apportion the pain of ‘another winter ’
BEATTIE— DAYTONA BEACH SUNDAY NEWS-JOURNAL
For all its urgency, the Latin debt drama
continues to unfold at the excruciating-
ly slow pace of a soap opera. As soon as the
players resolve one conflict, the plot lurches
forward into the following week, where new
crises loom. In last week’s episode, Argenti-
na, the struggling young democracy, faced a
June 30 deadline for a $450 million interest
payment to its creditor banks. As the cur-
tain was about to fall, the world’s third
largest debtor dipped dramati-
cally into its own reserves
and —with the banks playing a
supporting role —paid its bills.
For Argentina, meeting the
deadline was a tacit admission
that efforts to stare down its
creditors are not succeeding.
At the previous quarterly
deadline, in March, Argentina
chipped in only $lOO million
to keep its loans current. This
time Argentina put up a total
of $325 million and the banks
provided a 45-day loan of $ 125
million to cover the difference.
Argentina’s compliance was
all the more remarkable com-
ing in the wake of a sharp blow
from U.S. banks. Just after 11 Latin debtor
nations meeting in Cartagena, Colombia,
had demanded better treatment, the banks
raised their prime rate one-half of a point
to 13 percent. That little uptick could cost
Argentina $2OO million in added interest in
1984 alone.
Argentine President Raul Alfonsin was
quick to condemn the hike, but tellingly, his
next move was conciliatory. On national
television last week, he lectured the nation
on the need for austerity. Speaking halting-
ly, his hands atremble, Alfonsin insisted
that “sacrifice must be shared.” That was a
marked departure from his recent rhetoric:
he had been arguing that domestic pressures
made it impossible to accept a strict auster-
ity plan or meet debt bills. The political
opposition reacted coolly to Alfonsin’s plea.
“What the president really said,” asserted
Grinspun (right) and Regan face off: Defiance?
Democratic Center Union Party leader Al-
varo Alsogaray, “was that we have to pass
through another winter.”
Alfonsin’s new posture may have been
prompted by pressure from fellow Latin
debtors. Though they backed Argentina in
Cartagena, a condition for that support,
says a Latin ambassador, was that Argenti-
na avoid a total break with the banks and the
International Monetary Fund.
Argentina has also lost some
of its leverage with U.S. banks.
Two weeks ago the Federal Re-
serve System imposed rules
that make it harder for banks to
count shaky loans as assets. As
a result, some bank earnings
will fall no matter what Argen-
tina does. And to reassure in-
vestors, Manufacturers Han-
over Trust Co., Argentina’s
chief creditor, announced that
even if it didn’t get a penny in
interest from Argentina this
year, earnings would drop no
more than 15 percent. But Al-
fonsin’s cooperation may pay
off. Even though Alfonsin lost
this round, says Peter Perkins,
an analyst at Data Resources,
Inc., he did win “more time to
get concessions and to prepare
the country for austerity.”
In any case, the interest pay-
ments remain a sideshow: Ar-
gentina still must strike a deal
with the IMF to put its econo-
my on a more stable footing.
Returning last week from two
days in Washington, where he met separate-
ly with IMF officials and U.S. Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan, Economic Minis-
ter Bernardo Grinspun said that the IMF
talks were on a “promising course.” But he
denied that he was backing off the terms
Argentina laid down in its letter of intent
earlier this month: a 6 to 8 percent gain in
real wages and a budget deficit of 9.1 per-
cent of the gross domestic product. The
IMF judges those figures unacceptably
high. Said Grinspun defiantly: “Do you
think we’re going to take an eraser and begin
changing what we wrote?” Yet some bank-
ing analysts speculated that the banks and
Argentina would not have been so eager to
meet the interest deadline unless they ex-
pected an IMF pact to follow in due course.
Last Act: Even that, however, won’t be the
final act. The banks are now holding debt-
rescheduling talks with several nations that
already have IMF agreements. Manufac-
turers Hanover, handling the negotiations
with Chile, has agreed to permit delays in
interest payments due this year and a five-
year moratorium on principal payments.
Citicorp has worked out similar terms with
Peru. And the banks are likely to grant
Mexico 15 years to make principal pay-
ments that fall due through 1988.
As with any soap opera, it doesn’t seem to
matter when you tune in on the debt crisis—
all the basic problems remain the same.
Beyond the immediate need to straighten
out their payment schedules, the debtor
nations must repair their ragged economies
while keeping their social fabric intact. If
they don’t, the melodrama may turn to
tragedy before it ends.

MEDICINE
Headache for a Pain Remedy
Advil and Nuprin: Controversial new entries in a billion-dollar relief market
The demand for fast pain relief is appar-
ently insatiable. Americans now spend
$1.4 billion a year for over-the-counter an-
algesics, and the competition to get a slice of
the market is sharp. The latest entry in the
field is ibuprofen, the first painkiller to be
introduced as a nonprescription drug in
nearly 30 years. Sold by American Home
Products and Bristol-Myers, under the
trade names Advil and Nuprin, the drug has
been especially touted as a remedy for men-
strual cramps. But no sooner had it hit
drugstore shelves this month than it began
to raise enough bothersome questions about
side effects to give its makers an Excedrin
headache.
Ibuprofen has been available on prescrip-
tion for a decade under the trade names
Motrin and Rufen. But during the next year
consumers will be treated to $5O million to
$7O million worth of advertising for the
nonprescription versions. Like aspirin, the
first-ranking analgesic, ibuprofen not only
relieves pain but also reduces inflammation
and fever. Acetaminophen (best known as
Tylenol), which does not share the anti-
inflammatory properties of the others, is the
second leading painkiller on the market. All
three have potentially dangerous side ef-
fects—and that’s where the ibuprofen con-
troversy arises.
Bleeding: Although chemically different
from aspirin, the new drug has a similar
potential for causing intestinal bleeding.
Moreover, up to 90 percent of people aller-
gic to aspirin will also be hypersensitive to
ibuprofen and subject to symptoms ranging
from hives to asthma attacks and, most
serious of all, anaphylactic shock. “We do
not want anyone to think that this ‘non-
aspirin’ pain reliever can be safely taken by
people with aspirin allergy,” cautions Dr.
Robert Temple of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
The package labeling for Advil and Nu-
prin approved by the FDA warns about the
allergy risks. But some experts argue that the
warnings don’t go far enough. And they note
that the Federal Trade Commission, which
has jurisdiction over advertising of nonpre-
scription drugs, has not insisted on full
disclosure of the possible hazards. In a letter
to the FDA, Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Public
Citizen Health Research Group charged
that recent newspaper ads in some localities
have omitted mention of the sensitivity
problem. “As a result of misleading and
illegal advertising,” Wolfe said, “thousands
of people with aspirin sensitivities may be
misled into thinking that ibuprofen is safe for
them. As a result, many could suffer serious
and even fatal allergic reactions.”
According to critics, another possible risk
has been overlooked. Dr. Leslie Dornfeld of
the University of California at Los Angeles,
a member of the panel that recommended
approval of over-the-counter sales, warned
at the recent International Congress of
Nephrology that ibuprofen can aggravate
high blood pressure and even cause kidney
failure in susceptible people. The drug, he
explains, blocks body chemicals called pros-
taglandins. These substances play a role in
pain and inflammation, but they also are
important to normal kidney function and
can be natural anti-hypertensive agents.
Anyone with mild renal insufficiency, typi-
cally the elderly and diabetics, would be
especially vulnerable, according to Dorn-
feld. Ibuprofen, he adds, poses a risk of
kidney damage to anyone taking diuretics,
widely used for hypertension and premen-
strual symptoms. “Ibuprofen is a good
drug,” says Dornfeld, “but we’ve got to
warn people about all the potential risks.”
The FDA and the makers of ibuprofen
contend, nevertheless, that untoward side
effects from the over-the-counter version
will be rare. They note that the drug will be
sold in 200-mg tablets, only half the
strength of the prescription versions. More-
over, an FDA spokesman adds, even at
twice the strength, ibuprofen has had “a
good track record for 10 years.”

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Instant X-Rays for Doctors on the Go
Large, expensive X-ray equipment is impractical to install in
remote areas and every small village and industrial site. To
help fill the need for easily available medical diagnosis, a small
American company has developed a simple, hand-held X-ray
device that can be carried almost anywhere.
The Lixiscope gives instant X-ray images of hands, arms,
feet and other small parts of the body. The radiation is provided
by a small amount of iodine 125, a low-
energy isotope, housed in a cylindrical
tube at one end of the machine. When
the operator pulls a trigger to unshield
the radioactive source, the X-yay image
appears instantaneously on the view-
ing screen. A series of screens and im-
age intensifies convert and magnify
the invisible X-ray into visible images
that appear on the two-inch-diameter
screen. Because of the low intensity of
the isotope and since only a small area
of the body is exposed at any time to
radiation, the Lixiscope can be used for
a minute or more without exposing the
patient to a potentially dangerous
amount of radiation. No shielding for
either the operator or the patient is
needed. Permanent film images can be
made with any 35-mm or Polaroid
camera using an adapter.
The battery-powered Lixiscope (the
name stands for Low Intensity X-ray
Imaging Scope) is manufactured by
Lixi, Inc., of Downers Grove, 111., which licensed the technol-
ogy from NASA. The company is offering seven models of the
device, ranging in size and power, from $8,500 to $lO,OOO.
The Lixiscope: Checking for broken bones
Documents that Say ‘No’ to Photocopiers
Corporations and governments with secrets often find it
hard to protect that confidential information. Foreign agents,
corporate spies and even their
own employees often are able to
walk away with copies of sensi-
tive documents after a quick visit
to a photocopying machine. Re-
cently, three companies, one
American and two Japanese,
have introduced products that
might cut down on unauthorized
photocopying.
The Japanese firms, Toray In-
dustry Inc. of Tokyo and Kiso
Chemical Corp. of Osaka, joined
forces to develop a thin film cov-
ering for documents that will
spoil photocopies. Their film—
only 0.05 mm thick —consists of
a dark orange or red polyester
sheet backed with an aluminum
membrane. When placed on a
piece of paper, the cover allows
the text to be read, but diffuses a
photocopier’s bright fluorescent
light. As a result, photocopies
Scitex’s Satlight: From Paris to New York in seconds
come out black. The film has an adhesive backing that prevents
it from being removed without destroying the document. The
covering, called “KSK-Secret,” can be cut to any size—even
big enough to fit large-scale blueprints.
One of America’s largest paper-products manufacturers,
Boise Cascade, is offering several types of paper that also resist
or deter copying. One, Hidden Void Security Paper, contains a
mottled background that will blur the printed text when
photocopied on some machines. The background can also be
designed to contain hidden messages—
such as “Unauthorized Reproduc-
tion,” or “Official Government Docu-
ment”—that will appear on copies
made from the original.
Quicker Color Photos
Newspapers and magazines go to
great lengths to get color photographs.
Unlike black-and-white photos, which
can be transmitted by satellite or over
telephone lines, color transparencies
are still physically transported from
the field to the home office for process-
ing. This leaves publications at the
mercy of airline schedules and some-
times forces them to charter planes to
transport the film. Photographers and
editors have long searched for faster
ways to get pictures of news events into
print, and now a leading manufacturer
of photographic and graphics-process-
ing equipment may have found one.
Scitex Corp. Ltd. plans to demonstrate the first transport-
able photographic scanner this summer. The Israeli company
says the machine can transmit color transparencies worldwide
in just seconds. Using Scitex’s Satlight scanner, publications
should be able receive color photographs of events thousands
of miles away that occur only hours before the printing presses
start running. The photographer in the field has only to
develop the film and place the desired negative or slide on the
unit’s viewer. The photo image
will appear on a six-inch color
monitor, where it can be focused
and cropped to cut out the un-
wanted areas. The photographer
then indicates where the photo
should go and, with the push of a
button, the scanner converts the
image into a digital code and
sends it via any of several trans-
mission links to the home office.
Satlight is encased in a shock-
absorbent aluminum suitcase,
and weighs about 110 pounds. At
that weight, the machine isn’t
portable enough for a photogra-
pher to carry along, but it can be
set up in hotel rooms and bureau
offices. Each Satlight will cost
about $ 100,000 and at first will be
compatible only with Scitex
equipment, which many major
publications already use.

Labor’s Lange in fighting
trim for heavyweight contest
The careful packaging of New Zealand Labor and its leader, David Lange, seems to be working
in the current general election campaign with help from the Hawke connection although
Prime Minister Muldoon is too tough a nut to write off yet David Armstrong reports.
LAWYERS from Auckland tell of a
time only a few years ago when one of
their colleagues, a great hulk of a man,
waddled into court each day followed
by a retinue of folk who looked as
though they would have had trouble
scraping together a dollar between
them.
The lawyer who led them seemed to
care little for his personal appearance.
His hair had a shaggy dog look as often
as not and he was given to wearing un-
becoming tweed jackets or checked
suits. Today the lawyer is a politician
representing the electorate of Mangere,
the area around Auckland airport. It is a
poor district with high populations of
older people, Maoris and state housing
tenants. Mangere is, not surprisingly,
one of the safest Labor seats in New
Zealand.
Its representative, however, has been
transformed.
He is still a bulky man but he is very
much slimmer. He wears well-tailored
dark grey or blue suits with subtle
pinstripes. His hair is trimmed neatly,
his black shoes shine. David Lange, 42,
leader of the opposition, has been
packaged for the prime ministership.
Those in the New Zealand Labor
Party who worked the transformation
had some help from the professionals,
men who have assisted in turning Aus-
tralian Labor Party leaders into prem-
iers in four states and who aided Bob
Hawke in developing the style which
was such an asset in the campaign 16
months ago to oust Malcolm Fraser.
The first Australian adviser to help
the NZ Labor Party was ALP federal
secretary Bob McMullan who spent
about four days across the Tasman in
February. The second was Rod
Cameron, managing director of market
research company ANOP which con-
ducts the opinion polling vital to ALP
campaigns. Cameron talked to NZ
Labor officials for hours during a busi-
ness trip late in April.
Both visitors gave similar advice:
Labor’s campaign had to be built
around the leader. McMullan, in par-

ticular, insisted that Lange had to ap-
pear “more prime ministerial.” The
personal style of a prime minister,
McMullan told his colleagues, was not
so important since he held the authority
of the job. But a potential prime minis-
ter had to appear prime ministerial.
So, Lange was dressed in what might
be called the Labor premier’s uniform.
He was advised to moderate his person-
al style which was a little too hale and
hearty. And his speaking style was
changed. The rather florid mode of ex-
pression of the former law lecturer was
tightened and simplified.
Lange himself may never have
thought of dressing more smartly: such
matters were not important to him. But
he had realised that he must change to
become prime minister. In his case, the
change was drastic: about two years
ago, he had his stomach stapled to lose
weight. He stopped smoking at the same
time. He had been a chain smoker.
NZ Labor officials had borrowed an
Australian technique even before the
visits of McMullan and Cameron. Late
last year, the party shed its traditional
seat-of-the-pants approach to campaign
planning and commissioned voter re-
search in selected seats. It found that
people were concerned primarily about
“bread-and-butter” economic issues,
prices especially food prices health
and education.
The broader economic matter that
worried people most was the extent of
the country’s overseas debt an issue
which the National Party had exploited
in 1975 when it tossed out a Labor gov-
ernment.
The people showed little enthusiasm
for ideological questions such as
whether nuclear-powered ships from
the United States should be allowed to
dock at New Zealand ports.
The idea of modelling a campaign on
Hawke’s suggested itself, particularly as
it became clear that Australia under
Labor was experiencing relatively high
economic growth while reducing infla-
tion and unemployment without un-
duly frightening business leaders.
Lange has some endearing personal
qualities which work against his being a
good politician.
Late last year, for instance, party offi-
cials thought it likely that Prime Minis-
ter Sir Robert Muldoon would call a
snap election over an industrial rela-
tions issue: workers were threatening to
cut electricity supplies. Lange was con-
tacted at home on one weekend and
told of the danger. But when officials
rang him back some hours later, Lange,
father of three, could not be contacted.
He had taken his children to the cinema
to see Superman 111.
Lange is opposed to one of the
toughest of politicians. Muldoon, 62,
the longest-serving leader in the western
world, led the National Party to power
in 1975 and is too proud and too crafty
to be ousted easily.
Labor launched its campaign at
Christchurch on Tuesday night of last
week. But earlier that day, in Welling-
ton, Lange and Roger Douglas, the
party’s finance spokesman, disclosed
what had been one of the country’s bet-
ter-kept secrets Labor’s economic
policy.
It was barely worth having waited
for, being more a statement of aims and
approaches than of precise policy. It
talked of striving for full employment
and economic growth, of achieving a
fair prices and incomes policy, of re-
forming industry assistance and the tax
system, of welding together a Hawke-
style consensus on economic manage-
ment. It suggested that wages would be
controlled through indexation and tax
trade-offs but generally it was remark-
ably short of detail on the mechanisms
to be used to achieve the aims and con-
tained no specific figures.
Lange and Douglas argued that the
economy almost certainly was sicker
than Muldoon would admit, so it would
be irresponsible for Labor to make hard
and detailed commitments until it had
access to government accounts. But the
effect of their stance was to sidestep a
potential political embarrassment: by
refusing to say where the money was
going, they avoided the perennial ques-
tion asked of Labor parties where’s
the money coming from?
Douglas said that the example of the
Hawke government showed how eff-
ective a policy of reconciliation could
be in promoting economic growth.
Whether it would work in New Zealand
is another question: Lange, for instance,
does not have a drought to break.
The other question is whether Lange,
a man without Hawke’s high-level con-
tacts in business and the trade unions,
could stitch together an accord. The
government, employers and the unions
have been trying for more than two
years to devise a new wage-fixing sys-
tem. The talks were still going on when
the election was called.
Lange launched Labor’s campaign in
the Christchurch Town Hall, a modern-
istic building with large balconies jut-
ting toward the stage to create a feeling
of intimacy even though the hall when
full as it was that night holds more
than 2500 people.
His delivery was preceded by the
campaign theme song, Up Where We
Belong, the chorus of which begins:
“Love lifts us up where we belong.”
Labor paid SNZ2OOO ($A1450) for the
rights to use it to spread the Lange
gospel.
His backdrop was a big red banner, a
symbolically inappropriate choice of
color for a party which Muldoon at-
tacks for alleged links with communists.
On the banner was the campaign
slogan, “Bringing New Zealand
together.” The slogan will sound famil-
iar to Australians but it was not copied
from Hawke’s 1983 campaign; it was
used at one stage in the 1981 NZ elec-
tion.
A nervous Lange raced through his
speech, telling his very enthusiastic
audience that New Zealand had the
lowest growth of the 24 countries in the
Organisation for Economic Co-oper-


The ALP’s Bob McMullan: assistance for NZ Labor
ATTILA KIRALY
ation and Development; that the na-
tional debt public and private was
SNZI7 billion ($A 12.25 billion); that
prices were rising again; that 100,000
New Zealanders were out of work. His
panacea was the economic summit.
The audience reaction had exceeded
his expectations, Lange said at a small
party later as he pranced nervously
from group to group, throwing peanuts
in the air and catching them in his
mouth.
Missing from the speech was any ref-
erence to Labor’s pledge to re-negotiate
the ANZUS treaty, to work to have the
region declared a nuclear-free zone and
to bar visits by nuclear warships.
Lange’s views on these matters are simi-
lar to Hawke’s and Lange is unhappy
about being burdened with the policy. If
he sticks to the plan, he will not volun-
tarily utter a word about them through-
out the campaign.
Muldoon, of course, had reminded
his audience about Labor’s defence and
foreign policies when he opened his
campaign in the old Wellington Town
Hall the previous night.
Muldoon’s launch was a sober affair:
his speech was flat, at times boring, and
the 2000 party faithful who listened to
him were surprisingly muted.
The difference in reactions can be ex-
plained, in part, by a similarity between
Wellington and Christchurch: both are
Labor strongholds.
The Wellington hall, too, is a much
more austere room a long, narrow
barn. It is painted white. On the night,
the color was supplied by a big blue
banner declaring: “New Zealand,
you’re winning.”
Muldoon began with an economic
dissertation, explaining that New Zea-
land had been in recession for 10 years
because of its dependence on costly im-
ported oil and poor prices for rural ex-
ports. He then spouted a
series of statistics to show how
exports had improved and de-
pendence on imported oil had
been reduced; how his poli-
cies would create jobs; how
his government was control-
ling the external trade bal-
ance; and how, with inflation
running at 3.5 percent and
growth in the last half of 1983-
84 at 7 percent, NZ did not
compare too badly with Aus-
tralia under Hawke.
This last claim came from
a publication called Quarterly
Predictions , produced by the
NZ Institute of Economic Re-
search. The government does
not publish quarterly national
accounts. In their absence,
Quarterly Predictions is the
economist’s bible. The June
edition was issued, fortuit-
ously for Muldoon, that day. He mined
it for nuggets with which to salt his
speech.
Not surprisingly, he omitted un-
favorable estimates. He did not say that
the 7 percent spurt in growth had come
and gone, so that average growth for
1983-84 was 2.5 percent and that pre-
dicted growth in 1984-85 also was 2.5
percent. He did not say that inflation
was forecast to rise to more than 6 per-
cent. He did not say the institute pre-
dicted falls in home building and big
project investment toward the end of
the year. He did not say that the govern-
ment deficit, while likely to fall slightly
to $NZ2.75 billion (SA2 billion), raised
fears of the crowding out of private sec-
tor investment.
In fact, a reading of Quarterly Predic-
tions lends credence to the view that
Muldoon called the election now, rather
than waiting until November, because
the news would be worse.
Muldoon and his audience
warmed up when he moved
on to Labor’s associations
with communists and policy
on ANZUS. It was crude,
19505-style red-baiting. Mul-
doon recalled the rape of
Hungary, the Soviet occupa-
tion of Czechoslovakia, the
suppression of Solidarity in
Poland, the invasion of Af-
ghanistan and the shooting
down of a South Korean air-
liner as proof that Soviet com-
munists had no regard for
normal human decencies.
“Their direct representa-
tives sit on the Joint Council
of Labor with the New Zea-
land Labor Party, making pol-
icy,” he said. The council
comprises Labor politicians
and union leaders.
On defence, Muldoon’s rhetoric was
desperate. “I lost five years of my life
during World War II,” he said. “My
best friend lost his life in the skies over
Britain. I am not going to let him and all
the others or the other young New
Zealanders down on this issue ... not
I, nor my government, any more than
Bob Hawke in Australia.”
It was easy to imagine Muldoon’s
television audience switching over en
masse to watch Falcon Crest on the al-
ternative channel during the economic
section of Muldoon’s speech but both
National and Labor politicians thought
it was a clever and effective address.
As one minister said, the issue in the
election was experience and com-
petence versus inexperience during a
time of crisis. In the early section of
Muldoon’s speech, he was presenting
himself as the expert and the man who
was achieving progress in the face of
great adversity. The second section was
an old-fashioned appeal to prejudice
stroking the dark side of New
Zealanders, as a Labor frontbencher
said. It would have gone down well in
the rural seats which Labor needs to win
to form a government the seats which
won Muldoon the 1981 election by sup-
porting him because he had allowed the
South African Springbok rugby tour
three months previously.
Muldoon and Lange were followed
later in the week by Social Credit leader
Bruce Beetham and New Zealand Party
boss Bob Jones who turns 45 on election
day.
My strong feeling is that, at the end
of last week, Muldoon was behind. But
he is such a hard fighter that his chances
cannot be dismissed before the votes are
counted.
Only then will Lange know if all the
packaging was worth the trouble it
involved. □
Labor finance man Roger Douglas: no precise policy


Labor quietly
drowns out
Muldoon thunder
Sir Robert Muldoon opens his campaign: “The choice is between my lot and the other lot”
By lAN TEMPLETON
AS THE New Zealand general election
campaign moved toward its climax, the
political pendulum already may have
swung far enough to assure the Labor
Party of victory on July 14. The Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Muldoon, had de-
ployed his considerable armory of pol-
itical weapons but the big crowds which
used to follow him had drifted away.
Labor on the other hand had ab-
sorbed the lessons of its defeats of 1978
and 1981 and had plotted the kind of
campaign which would keep its leader,
David Lange, clear of a knockout
punch.
Basing its strategy on a simple belief
that the 1981 election result after the
turmoil of the South African rugby
union tour was a freak, the Labor Party
decided that it did not need to make
bold pledges to turn around swinging
voters. It had convinced itself that it al-
ready held a majority. Supporting evi-
dence came from the apparent collapse
of the Social Credit vote. That had
amounted to 21 percent of the poll in
1981. But, with that support eroded, the
spoiler effect which Social Credit
exercised in as many as 20 key marginal
seats would disappear. Labor could see
majorities emerging in those electorates
so long as it did nothing to upset the
susceptibilities of those who had voted
Social Credit and were moving toward
Labor.
The Labor Party traditionally has
provided the radical edge to New Zea-
land politics but in this campaign it has
eschewed anything that smacks of doc-
trinaire socialism.
Lange turned to evangelical rhetoric:
Labor could heal the wounds of the
Muldoon years; New Zealand could re-
discover itself in the reconciliation, con-
sensus and co-operation that Labor
offered; if the community felt anger, it
should be constructive anger leading to
“internal peace.”
In Lange’s vision, New Zealand
would be remade. There would be “re-
newal” of society and its rewards would
become “fair.” He promised a sense “of
purpose, of dignity, of self-respect.”
If this sounds simplistic even naive
it seems to have worked.
While Muldoon has been punching
the air, Labor has kept tip-toeing
toward the Treasury benches. It has
concentrated on the sins of the
Muldoon government, economic disas-
ters in the shape of overwhelming debt
and massive unemployment, and at the
same time has avoided offering any of
the hard answers on the grounds that
Labor must first see the books.
Muldoon has made that strategy easy
for Labor by his defence of the NZ dol-
lar against speculators.
As much as $5OO million drained out
of the country’s reserves in the
run which started the day
after the snap election was
declared. But, in propping up
the dollar, Muldoon called on
emergency credit lines to an
extent not yet disclosed fully.
Labor has not faced such a
favorable opportunity since
1935.
New Zealand is divided,
uncertain, holding on to its
living standards only by mas-
sive borrowing abroad. Mar-
kets for wool, butter and lamb
are shrinking. The inter-
national recovery has not
brought any improvement in
export prices.
Labor has made a virtue
out of its refusal to define
specific answers to these econ-
omic problems.
As the New Zealand Her-
ald noted, the eight points on
which Labor would “rebuild
our economy” are virtually
unexceptionable as statements
of principle. “Who could
quarrel with Mr Lange’s aim
of substantially improving the
living standards of the vast
majority? Who does not want a fair tax
system? But what is fair? And how
would Labor finance its proposed re-
form of income tax for lower and
middle-income households?” the paper
asked.
Interestingly, the same paper re-
turned to the issue the next day and
took a different tack (and the Herald has
been no friend to Labor). It said that
emphasising national unity as a de-
sirable and attainable goal touched on a
matter just as important to national
well-being as are laws and taxes. “Per-
haps Mr Lange has read the signs that
manifested themselves more than three
years ago. The tactics of adversary poli-
tics, it cannot be denied, have dismayed
even sickened many voters. Any
politician, regardless of party, who
promises to unite the nation is bound to
find receptive ears.”
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has
been trudging round the country saying
that the issue before the electorate is
leadership. Or, as he put it to one tele-
vision audience: “The choice is between
my lot and the other lot.”
He has sought to rally those he calls
Rob’s Mob. But National support, at
least on the far right, has been nibbled
away by the New Zealand Party
founded less than a year ago by proper-
ty millionaire Bob Jones. The Nationals
may succeed in pulling back some of
those voters in the last week of the cam-
paign but, by then, the Lange band-
wagon could be moving too quickly
even for Muldoon to derail it. □


BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The threat to Australia’s
private enterprise sector
To mark this special edition of The Bulletin, the executive director of Western Mining
Corporation, Hugh M. Morgan, has written this specially-commissioned article.
Morgan, one of the most articulate and controversial business leaders in Australia,
argues that private enterprise is under increasing threat in Australia
partly through failing to defend itself in the past.
GEOFFREY BLAINEY pointed out
recently that the liberty and the political
freedom that we take for granted is, in
historical and geographical terms, a rare
almost unique social occurrence.
Such comment applies, with even great-
er force, to the economic system we con-
veniently label “private enterprise.”
Societies based on economic free-
dom where the individual, operating
under the rule of law, is able to buy and
sell, to spend or save, invest and prod-
uce in order to seek his fortune, have
been rare in the history of mankind and
still are restricted to small areas of the
globe.
One such society was that of 18th
century Britain and the transformations
which took place there have been called
the Industrial Revolution.
Eighteenth-century Britain was
transplanted, in various ways, first to
North America and then to Australasia.
The political and economic freedoms
we enjoy in contemporary Australia de-
rive from our origins in Georgian Brit-
ain.
The most effective way to develop a
growing, adaptable, resilient economy
which offers full employment, increas-
ing per capita wealth across the board
and diversity of opportunity for all is
through the mechanism of the free mar-
ket: through private enterprise operat-
ing in a competitive environment, under
the rule of law, free from government
intervention, ministerial discretion and
from bureaucratic harassment. In a
word, through capitalism.
Even socialists of various hues now
accept much of this. A recent and extra-
ordinary example of socialist recogni-
tion of the efficacy of Adam Smith’s
doctrines was the public approbation
showered upon an entrepreneur in
Deng Xiaoping’s China, who received
official publicity as a successful specula-
tor after a canny venture in agricultural
marketing. When did an Australian
most recently receive an official honor
for successful speculation?
WMC’s Hugh Morgan: Australia is becoming relatively poorer and poorer
In Australia, it is true that govern-
ments from both sides of the political
fence have acknowledged from time to
time that Smith’s “invisible hand” is
more effective than the all-too-visible
strong arm of executive fiat. In particu-
lar, our current Prime Minister and
Treasurer are at least as committed to
the efficacy of the market place as were
their predecessors.
It is also now widely understood that
Australia, which was one of the richest
countries in the world (in per capita in-
come terms), is becoming relatively
poorer and poorer. Japan has overtaken
us and Singapore, on present trends,
will do so in the early 19905.
Professor Helen Hughes, of the Aus-
tralian National University, has argued
that these trends unreversed mean
that our gifted children will have to
undertake postgraduate studies and re-
search work in Singapore and Tokyo in
order to stay at the front of world devel-
opments and that our less gifted grand-
children may well be forced to seek em-
ployment opportunities in Jakarta and
Kuala Lumpur as waitresses and hotel
porters.
Hughes’ arguments are, I think, sup-
ported by the following:
■ Between 1975 and 1980 (good
years, in retrospect) Australia’s per
capita real gross domestic product
(GDP) increased by 7 percent, com-
pared with the Organisation for Econ-
omic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) average of 14 percent.
■ For the same period, real private
consumption expenditure in Australia


South Australia’s Roxby Downs: its development has involved negotiations with 32 government departments
increased by 13 percent.
The OECD average rate
was 18 percent. On the
other hand, real govern-
ment consumption in-
creased by 24 percent and
the OECD average was 14
percent. This was the
period 1975-80 and the in-
cumbent federal govern-
ment had won office in
1975 with a strong commit-
ment to small government.
■ In this period, the
growth of Australia’s real
gross fixed capital expendi-
ture was 8 percent. The
OECD average was 16 per-
cent.
■ Australia’s real value
of exports increased by 27 percent, com-
pared with the OECD average of 37 per-
cent.
All of these figures are for the half-
decade 1975-80 a period upon which
we look back as relatively prosperous.
Sir Roderick Carnegie has pointed
out the defence implications of continu-
ing decline in economic com-
petitiveness and performance. In his
CRA annual report, he said: “We Aus-
tralians have not had to learn the pain-
ful lessons but we can try to understand
them from the experience of others: The
right to inhabit depends on the ability to
defend. The ability to defend depends
on people, on technology. A world con-
scious of our huge resources in food,
fibres and minerals may not stand idly
by if we are seen to fail to use them or to
fail to make them available to others.”
Is this decline in economic perform-
ance in wealth creation, which is the
essence of Australian economic history
since the war linked to the perform-
ance of the private sector?
Professor Helen Hughes
Certainly, the indices of
private sector prosperity
are gloomy.
Consider the market
capitalisation of the pri-
vate sector as shown by
values on Australian stock
markets. While this indica-
tor does not encompass
major foreign companies,
such as Ford or General
Motors-Holden, nor the
greater proportion of the
vital rural sector, it does
show very clearly how the
private sector is perform-
ing. That value has
declined, in March 1984
dollars, from more than
$79 billion in June 1970 to
less than $59 billion in May 1984 (be-
fore the recent substantial drop in share
prices). This is a 26 percent decline.
After 15 years of hard yakka, the capital
base of the productive sectors of the
community is 26 percent worse off de-
spite new capital raisings
or retained shareholder en-
titlements.
Government prosperity,
on the other hand, has
been on the up-and-up.
Commonwealth govern-
ment expenditure share of
GDP has increased from
24 percent in 1970 to 31.6
percent in 1983. The total
government and public au-
thorities expenditure share
of GDP has increased from
31.7 percent in 1970 to 42.6
percent in 1982-83 and is
projected to be 44 percent
this financial year. It is not
realised widely enough just
how portentous this trend
Sir Roderick Carnegie
is. Unreversed, it means impoverish-
ment. It also means loss of liberty.
Samuel Johnson, the great poet and
lexicographer, had known extreme pov-
erty in his young days as a literary hack
in 18th century London. He wrote to
Boswell exhorting him to guard against
extravagant expenditure: “Resolve not
to be poor: Poverty is a great enemy to
human happiness; it certainly destroys
liberty, it makes some virtues impractic-
able and others extremely difficult.”
Johnson’s stern exhortation “resolve
not to be poor” should be updated to
read: “Resolve to reduce public and
government expenditure.”
Government expenditure, of itself, is
not the whole story. More insidious but
just as important is the accelerating
diminution of property rights through
government and bureaucratic interven-
tion. This is most easily demonstrated
by reference to building regulations.
As zoning, planning and building
regulations grow more constrictive and
the discretion of the owner of a property
more constrained, so the
market value of that prop-
erty is reduced. Ultimately,
a property may become
unsaleable because it is so
hedged about with restric-
tions or the prospect of re-
strictions that no buyer will
take his chance with it. But
no formal acquisition may
have taken place, no case
for compensation may
have occurred. All that
might have been said is
that the public interest has
taken precedence over pri-
vate greed. And so it is
with the business and
wealth-creating sector gen-
erally.


In the mining industry we have a
classic example of government inter-
vention with incalculable but very real
costs. When Western Mining Corpora-
tion discovered nickel at Kambalda in
1965, the company was involved in
negotiations with two government de-
partments. The first shipment of nickel
concentrates was on its way within 18
months to take advantage of a buoyant
market.
In contrast, the first intersection of
the orebody at Roxby Downs took
place in 1975. We are nine years down
the track: at the latest count, the joint
venturers had had negotiations with 32
government departments.
The joint venturers have spent $l3O
million and, provided both the feasibil-
ity studies and the Australian Labor
Party federal conference come up with
the right numbers to give Roxby Downs
the go ahead, the joint venturers can
look forward to first finding and then
spending up to $1.5 billion in invest-
ment capital and shipping out their first
income-producing concentrates in 1988
or 1989 14 years after discovery.
The costs of negotiating with 32 gov-
ernment departments are very high. The
uncertainties of political fortune under-
mine confidence and these factors
ultimately diminish the company’s
ability to invest, to raise capital, to ex-
plore, to create wealth.
The Roxby Downs story is typical of
any new large mineral development.
That is the substantial reason why there
are fewer of them.
Australia the land of the mining
boom of the late 70s is in danger of
becoming, as a leading international
commodity commentator put it, “a sup-
plier of last resort.”
Is this the fault of the private sector?
I fear the answer has to be yes, it is.
The private sector has, because of in-
nocence and gullibility, been seduced,
massaged and even intimidated into ac-
cepting a continuous erosion of the
property rights which are absolutely es-
sential to which are the very founda-
tion stone of a healthy, expanding
private sector. This process of private
sector attrition has gone on under all
governments. There is no partisanship
here.
The private sector in general and the
mining industry in particular are faced
with continuing erosion of capital base
and continuing decline and contrac-
tion : if it continues, Australia as a whole
is facing impoverishment in conse-
quence.
The private sector has yet to discover
the same political savoir-faire and confi-
dence which the trade union movement
or the conservation movement, for
example, have in such abundance.
Private enterprise in Australia has a
major challenge ahead of it. □
EXPLORATION
Jabiru 3
gives BHP
the bird
Drilling at Jabiru: first disappointment, then a reappraisal
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
THE BIGGEST and most disappoint-
ing piece of news in financial circles last
week was the failure of BHP Ltd’s ap-
praisal well Jabiru 3.
Development of the Jabiru field in
the Timor Sea has been set back an in-
determinate period. Most analysts late
last week agreed that the 200 million
barrels-plus estimates of reserves for the
field will have to be significantly dis-
counted. Jabiru 3, after showing encour-
aging signs a week ago, when traces of
hydrocarbons were found at 1598 m a
depth almost identical to that of the
main oil-bearing horizons of the suc-
cessful Jabiru 1A failed to come up
with quality sands when cores were cut
between 1598 and 1642 m.
What the latest well confirms is the
highly complex geological structure of
Jabiru. This week the partners in the
Jabiru permit NT-P26 sit down to dis-
cuss just where the next hole will be
drilled. The drillship, Regional Endeav-
our, may move north of Jabiru to drill
the Pollard wildcat well. This would
give the partners time to assess results of
the dry holes Jabiru 2 and 3 and pin-
point a possible Jabiru 4.
Jabiru has become a puzzle for oper-
ator BHP which has a 50 percent inter-
est in permit NT-P26. Other consortium
members are Citco Australia (18.75 per-
cent), Norcen Australia (12.5), Weeks
Australia (10.3), Ampol Exploration
(6.25), Brenda Mines (1.1) and Noranda
Minerals (1.1). When Jabiru 1A
produced its promising flow rate from a
sand or pay zone of more than 50m, the
operators thought the sand qualities
would be uniform over the structure.
Following Jabiru 1A BHP decided to
first drill the Eclipse 1 well in NT-P2,
the permit south-west of NT-P26. After
failing to encounter significant hydro-
carbons the well was plugged and aban-
doned.
BHP then concentrated its attention
back on Jabiru. Drillship Regional En-
deavour travelled from Eclipse 1 to the
new location, Jabiru 2, I.6km south-
west of Jabiru IA. Jabiru 2 drilled
through the 1600 m level of the pay zone
in Jabiru 1A but encountered no hydro-
carbons. What made things confusing
for BHP was that apparently the well
penetrated the water level found under
the oil in the successful well. No other
system of oil and water was located
after the well was drilled past 2000 m
and then plugged and abandoned.
After the failure the BHP consortium
met to decide the position of the next
well. Initially the first Jabiru appraisal
well was to be followed by the Pollard
wildcat, about 100 km north-west of the
Jabiru action. The Jabiru partners, how-
ever, decided on Jabiru 3, the step-out
well located about a kilometre north-
east of Jabiru IA.
What BHP found last week were in-
terbedded shales and fine-grained sand-
stones between 1598 and 1628 m but
these generally appeared to lack poros-
ity or the ability to flow hydrocarbons.
There was a water table beneath the oil
reservoir but the highly porous sands
which produced the spectacular oil
flows in Jabiru 1A some of the best
recorded were encountered much
deeper and held only water in Jabiru 3.
BHP is not likely to rush out to drill
the next well at Jabiru. Each well costs
about $lO million. □


V 6 power,
just part of the pleasure
of real grand touring.
Nissan 300ZX.
w
In the history of motoring, few cars, if any,
have captured the imagination quite as vividly as the
timeless Z-cars.
From its inception in 1969, this classic marque
has provided a unique blend of performance and
style, comfort and safety.
Now, Nissan proudly introduce the 300ZX.
Its styling is reassuringly familiar yet it is
sufficiently re-styled to reduce drag to a co-efficient
of a mere 0.31. But it’s beneath these sleek exterior
lines where the real advancements lie.
The most radical change is the introduction of
the brilliant new VG 30E V 6 engine. Of oversquare
design, the 60° bank angle and pentroof combustion
chambers combine to make this lightweight
powerhouse capable of producing a remarkable
balance of power (124 kW @ 5,200 rpm DIN) and
torque (241 Nm@ 3,600 rpm DIN). Yet, for all this
output, efficient economy can be realised thanks to
the introduction of Nissan’s highly advanced ECCS
(Electronic Concentrated Control System). With
silicon chip electronics the ECCS system monitors not
only fuel flow but temperature, mixture, spark and
other critical engine functions. Such sophisticated
technology takes 300ZX to the forefront of
automotive development.
On the inside, 300ZX belies its sports tradition
because, here, the number one priority is comfort -
comfort unimaginable in most performance cars
and unrivalled in most sedans.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The truth will out
ALL THE legislation in the world will
not make share punters either intelligent
or honest.
In the past decade, we’ve created ar-
mies of expensive bureaucrats to watch
both the witless and the wily partici-
pants in the marketplace. The NSW
Corporate Affairs Commission alone
employs more inspectors and investiga-
tors than there are members of the Syd-
ney Stock Exchange. And how many
crooks have they all caught?
But, despite all the intervention to
pervert the free marketplace, the truth
filters through to the privileged partici-
pants. So it was with BHP share punters
chasing the Jabiru oil-well-sinking
affair.
Two weeks ago and ahead of any
official announcement the rumor was
abroad throughout Australia that
hydrocarbons had been found.
BHP’s fully-paids peaked that week
at $9.60 but the real punters seeking the
leverage were in the contribs, which
peaked for that week at $6.24. By the
end of last week and again ahead of
any announcement that Jabiru No 3
was to be abandoned the shares were
tumbling against a background roar of
disaster that could be heard from Syd-
ney to Siding Creek. The contribs fell
ahead of the bad news to $5.72, al-
though the market picked up after the
news was official.
Nevertheless, while the entire oil
market is reeling and Senator Peter
Walsh is putting in the boot with his
tricky resources rent tax, the Speculator
is prepared to show some hope.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd appears to
be a bargain and I’m encouraged to see
that Potter Partners endorse that view.
Based on a 20-year life for the North
West Shelf gas and condensate project,
the broker calculates a net present value
for Woodside shares of between $1.72
and $2.53 far above their price of
$1.06 late last week. That assessment
also excludes any value for Woodside’s
holding in its Cooper Basin gas, con-
densate and oil subsidiary Vamgas Ltd.
The broker values that Vamgas holding
at a further 40c a share for Woodside.
Of perhaps more significance is the
fact that the broker’s study was com-
pleted before the Japanese trading
giants Mitsui and Mitsubishi had com-
mitted themselves to take up equity
in the North West Shelf gas export
project.
Late last month, the two Japanese
trading houses agreed to take up a joint
one-sixth interest in the $8 billion ex-
port phase of the project.
Woodside retains a 50 percent inter-
est in the domestic operation and will
retain a 16.6 percent interest in the ex-
port project, having reduced its holding
late in 1982 in return for a $320 million
payment by the other equity partners.
The Japanese involvement virtually
assures the expectation that long-term
contracts will be completed with a range
of Nipponese energy supply authorities
for the supply of liquefied natural gas.
Potter Partners’ projections for the
next three financial years are:
1984 1985 1986
Cashflow/share 8.3 c 19.3 c 29.6 c
Earnings/share 3.4 c 7.3 c 11.5 c
The broker also points out some blue
sky potential in the stock, which has dis-
appointed followers with its failure to
find significant oil. Recent wells, the
Wilcox and Dixon on WA-28-P, have
identified prospective oil sands. The
forthcoming Montague No 1,10 km
south of the Eaglehawk/Egret discover-
ies, holds immense expectations.
I’ve picked up two contracts, each
for 1000 shares, on the exchange-traded
options market which means that, for
a premium of 18c an option, I may ac-
quire Woodside shares in December
with a strike price of $l. That’s a 12c
premium over a market price ignoring
that Woodside is about to come of age.

Toshiba introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisy wheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. Perfect
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a bit
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you
most of the features of the other two, for less.
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

WILDCAT
The Don still scoring well
SHAREHOLDERS in little-known
Adelaide group Argo Investments Ltd
can approach the stockmarket
downturn less apprehensively than
many fellow equity investors.
Chaired by Sir Donald Bradman,
Argo an investment company with a
diverse selection of stocks has seen
interest in its shares grow in tandem
with the rise of equity trusts as an in-
vestment tool. Argo’s security portfolio
now totals more than $BO million, 70
percent up on two years ago.
The Don’s company has runs on the
board. Anyone who invested $lOOO in
Argo shares in 1971 has seen the invest-
ment grow to $9961 to the end of last
March (Argo’s year end). This assumes
all dividends and proceeds from the sale
of rights issues were reinvested in the
company.
According to Statex’s actuaries a
similar sum invested in 50 leading
stocks for the same period would have
grown, on average, to $4874. If the
$lOOO had grown in line with COL rises
it would have totalled $3475.
Argo’s history is dotted with both
bonus and par issues to shareholders. In
the year to March, when profit in-
creased from $3.7 to $4 million, Argo
made a one-for-four bonus, regretting
that final dividend (applicable to the
new shares) would have to be lowered
from 6.5 to 6 cents. Annual dividend is
12 cents instead of 13 cents a share. At
Argo’s current price of $2.40 for its 35
million ordinary $1 shares this repre-
sents a dividend yield of 5 percent.
Sir Donald, in his recent address at
Argo’s annual meeting, talked variously
about the economy, wages control, Aus-
tralia’s overseas debt, and export earn-
ings, delays in uranium mining and the
need for “vastly increased quotas of mi-
grants.”
Bank ‘raided’
WHEN Warren McCullagh and three
other securities analysts announced
their plans to leave the Commonwealth
Bank for Sydney stockbroker
Lamploughs no one was more disap-
pointed than the bank’s Noel Farmer.
Chief manager of the portfolio man-
agement services division in which
McCullagh had just been appointed in-
vestment adviser, Farmer describes
himself as the “founding patron” of the
portfolio division. He launched it in
1973 with a staff of 10 and has seen it
grow to 36. The Commonwealth has 11
security analysts among them and
“You’re right in a way! I suppose you could call this a tax haven!”
Farmer laments, “These are the first
analysts I’ve lost.”
This week the bank’s staff will be told
of McCullagh’s replacement, a senior
officer from another area of the bank
with four years’ experience as an analyst
with the Commonwealth. The new man
will oversee an existing team of seven
(after the Lamploughs exodus). Farmer
says the bank “will have a well trained
and experienced team.”
He says one analyst is “under train-
ing,” with another to be trained by mid-
July. They have to be, he says, “gradu-
ates with more than a little IQ.”
FIRB philosophical
THE FOREIGN Investment Review
Board (FIRB) is not about to make any
quick changes to regulations after losing
its recent court scrap with Australia’s
largest foreign property owner, Tan Sri
Khoo Teck Puat.
Executive member of the FIRB,
George Pooley, wryly commented to
Wildcat that “there is the problem with
the law that you have to prove things
beyond reasonable doubt.” Charges
over the alleged breach by Savona Pty
Ltd of foreign takeover laws ( Bulletin ,
June 19) were dismissed in the court of
petty sessions in Sydney.
FIRB had charged Savona with con-
traventions of the Foreign Takeover
Act, specifically that a foreigner cannot
control more than 15 percent of a com-
pany without government approval.
Khoo had been alleged to have used
Savona as a shelf company to buy 18
percent of the shares of Grace Bros
Holdings Ltd before Myer Emporium
Ltd’s takeover of GBs in 1982. Joint
shareholders of Savona are Khoo’s two
daughters, Irene Lee and Jennifer Car-
michael. Both have permanent Austra-
lian residential status.
Magistrate Kevin Anderson, con-
cluded there was no basis for the estab-
lishment of a prima facie case against
Savona. It could not be concluded, he
said, that Khoo held a substantial inter-
est in Savona or had control of voting
power in shares.
Pooley claims that the “concept of
control is not an easy matter.” There
may be hope for the FIRB in similar
cases in the future. Pooley says that it
was significant that in delivering his
judgment the magistrate claimed that
costs were not given to the defendant
because “it was proper for the Crown to
have brought the case.”

has proved that a good offer can con-
found the falling market indices.
NCl’s prospectus opened and closed
on the same day last week and Hill
Samuel Australia Ltd, the merchant
banker which advised National Can
and co-underwrote the share issue with
Melbourne brokers Mclntosh Griffin
Hamson Wallace Smith & Co, claims the
offer was strongly oversubscribed. NCI
was floated to buy all the issued shares
of National Can Company Ltd, Austra-
lia’s third-largest can manufacturer.
Funding for NCl’s purchase was
through the issue of 23.1 million NCI
shares and through borrowings by NCI
from National Can of $4 million to
cover a total price of $27.1 million.
As a private company National Can
had an impressive record with after-tax
profit rising from $374,000 in 1970 to
$2.4 million in 1980. In the year just
ended profit is expected to be around
$4.1 million. Based on estimated 1983-
84 earnings of $3.8 million (adjusted for
the NCI loan) earnings a share will be
around 16.4 cents and with the issue
price of $1 it gives NCI a price/
earnings ratio of just 6:1. An initial an-
nual dividend of 7 cents is expected on
the shares.
NCI is one of a number of floats
underwritten by Hill Samuel in the past
couple of years. The merchant bank has
become a major underwriter without the
benefit of being an exchange member.
Hill Samuel’s latest initiative is the float-
ing of the 5 percent stake in the Argyle
diamond venture, recently bought by
the West Australian Government, to the
public. It will take the form of a dia-
mond trust.
Inspired by Hill Samuel, who will be
one of the lead underwriters, the trust is
expected to have tax advantages for
unit holders. The trust will make tax-free
distributions to unitholders. Called the
WA Diamond Trust, the vehicle will
offer 60 million units to investors at $1
each to raise $6O million while the WA
Development Corporation, formed re-
cently by the WA Government as a
commercial enterprise to boost the busi-
ness sector, will retain a further $5 mil-
lion.
Hill Samuel’s other underwriting ac-
tivities include the Queens and Coal
Trust the $lOO million float of a
unit trust with a direct interest in a re-
source project and the Westfield Proper-
ty Trust the biggest public float at the
time when the trust was launched in
1984. □
THE CHARTIST
Niugini Mining -a brave light in a dull market
by Russell hander
FEW STOCKS indeed can boast a cur-
rent share price some five times the level
obtaining one year ago. The broad run
of mining and oil stocks is a scene of
great suffering at present, many being
less than one third of their values at the
end of June 1983.
Niugini is the subject of the 10 cent
reversal point and figure chart set forth
here which traces the stock’s progress
since May 1983.
As a general observation this chart
has been quite a useful guide to
Niugini’s unfolding price action, as pro-
jection from the square lateral patterns
of which point and figure specialists are
so fond have generally been met. This is
illustrated by the compass arcs drawn
on the graph.
To confirm an extension of the pri-
mary uptrend Niugini will need to make
a new high that is, eclipse $5.60 at
which juncture a further upside target of
between $6.25 and $6.50 would be in-
dicated by the lateral dimension of the
trading pattern already in place.
Alternatively, a break below $4.80
would threaten the uptrend line and
characterise this big trading pattern as
being a major terminal top formation.
While it is always easier to pass an
open verdict on the likely course of the
battle between the bulls and bears than
to put one’s neck on the block, the
stock’s strength in a generally desolate
stockmarket terrain suggests that
Niugini is simply catching its breath in
an uncompleted mountaineering adven-
ture.
For the record, Niugini is a minerals
exploration outfit with a 12 percent car-
ried interest in a joint venture with
Kennecott (88 percent) covering nine
minerals exploration prospecting au-
thorities in PNG.
Of these, the focal point of current
interest in the stock is PA 485 (Lihir
Island) where the joint venture has
delineated three large low-grade gold
mineralisation zones extending from
the surface to the limit of drilling, 250 m
below the surface. The dimensions and
grades of these zones have been re-
ported as being:
675 x 200 m (3 gms/tonne gold)
300 x 200 m (3 gms/tonne gold)
350 x 75m (2.7 gms/tonne gold)
300 x 40m (2.7 gms/tonne gold)

THE MODEST FARMER
Don’t quote entitlements
by Bert kelly
LAST WEEK we examined market or
fresh milk and said that the Industries
Assistance Commission estimated that
the present system was causing an in-
come transfer of between $7O million
and $lOO million from consumers to
producers. This week we will look at the
manufacturing milk side of the industry.
By manufacturing milk we mean all
the milk used in making dairy products
except market milk. This is the side of
the industry that is in trouble, not be-
cause dairy farmers are inefficient (they
certainly are not) but because our ex-
port market has almost disappeared ex-
cept at ruinously low prices. This is due
to the stupidity and cupidity of
the European Economic Community
which, with wanton selfishness, has sub-
sidised its farmers to produce more milk
than they need and thus has obliterated
the world dairy market.
The fact is that we are producing
more milk products than we can con-
sume and the surplus has to be exported
at a loss. We produce more than we
need because this is what the market sig-
nals have been telling us to do and these
signals have been distorted by the con-
sumer subsidies that well-meaning gov-
ernments have been giving to the indus-
try. It seems that the assistance given to
the manufacturing sector was last year
worth about $l3O million which, when
divided between the 25,000 dairy farms,
means assistance of about $5500 a farm.
With that kind of encouragement, it is
not surprising that we produce more
milk than we need.
How do we discourage farmers from
doing this? The lAC solution basically
was to lower the rate of assistance from
its present $l3O million to about $B5
million a year or to about $3400 a farm-
er. The industry received this judgment
with a howl of anguish. Powerful state-
ments were made by industry leaders,
all prophesying imminent ruin.
How desperate is the situation in the
dairy industry? The Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics figures in the table sug-
gest that if they are doing badly the rest
of us must be ruined.
We just have to find a way of re-
ducing milk production and there are
only two ways of doing this. One is to
reduce assistance to the industry and
basically this is the lAC solution. The
farmers say this would be too tough on
them. They want to use milk quotas to
limit production. I presume a dairy
farmer would be given the right to prod-
uce a certain quota of milk at the sub-
sidised price and any milk he produced
in excess of this quota would be his own
responsibility. They call these quotas
entitlements because quotas have an
unsavory reputation these days. Ask the
chook people about this.
Quotas may be a smart short-term
answer but I regard it with despair
having seen them in operation else-
where. First, milk quotas will have to be
given to some and denied to others.
Who makes these awkward decisions?
“The industry,” the dairy farmers say.
But industries do not make decisions;
industry leaders do, the people “in the
know.”
If the dairy farmers get what they
want, I warn them grimly what will hap-
pen to them. First, there will soon be a
black market in milk that will make the
wheat black market look pale. Second, a
milk quota will soon become a valuable
piece of paper and the farmers who
have them will fight like fury to make
certain that the system is not changed.
And because milk quotas will become
valuable, it won’t be long before dairy
farmers will be saying: “Look at what
we have had to pay for our milk quotas.
Surely, we are entitled to get the cost of
production through the tariff like sec-
ondary industry?”
Milk prices will continue to go up
and consumption down and we will be
left with the kernel of an industry made
up of dairy farmers “in the know” and
their relatives and friends. □

and water management, pollution control,
biology or national parks.
The winner in each category receives
$4O 000 and the BHP Pursuit of Excellence
trophy.
Chief Adjudicator, Sir Roden Cutler, VC:
"The Awards will identify men and women,
no matter how humble, who, by their
example, will be an inspiration to others."
People may nominate themselves
or be nominated by others.
Applications can be made only on the
form in the booklet: "The BHP Awards for

PIERPONT
Moralists 6, Mercenaries 0
DILIGENT READERS of this literary
journal will have noticed that the latest
two issues were graced by contributions
from Katharine West, Australia’s pret-
tiest intellectual. Come to think of it, the
physical beauty of Australia’s intellec-
tuals is such that Pierpont is paying
Katharine no great compliment but
your correspondent feels sure she will
accept it in the right spirit.
In her essays on the state of Austra-
lian politics, Katharine at one point re-
ferred to Australian materialism as a
myth and said that contrary to the
image we were deeply concerned with
issues of principle.
Having pondered the matter over
several Armagnacs, Pierpont would say
that the majority of Australians are still
happily materialistic but the minority
who are activist in politics are indeed
rabid moralists to whom “pragmatism”
is the most deeply shocking word in the
lexicon.
As an example one might take the
foreign policy being advocated by the
Socialist Left which, if taken to its logi-
cal conclusion, would have Australia (a)
sever the US alliance and (b) declare
war on Indonesia over East Timor.
Pierpont would have thought that
anyone advocating either, let alone
both, of these courses should be kept
safely locked in a padded cell on the
grounds that he, she or it was a menace
to the lives and welfare of the other 16
million inhabitants of this continent.
But we will see these positions or
what amounts to them being ad-
vocated by a group who nearly control a
majority at the conference of the politi-
cal party which governs our nation.
Australia would be demonstrably
safer if it were in the hands of people
who were just trying to make money. To
this end, Pierpont is strongly tempted to
found an Avarice Party which would at
least have the benefit of being the one
party in Australia whose motivations
are accurately understood.
As part of his election policy,
Pierpont might well advocate that in ad-
dition to the cost-of-living index we
should have a cost-of-morality index.
After all, if we measure the cost to the
community of potatoes and rent, we
should also measure the cost of our
moral stances.
When the price of potatoes or rent
rises, the individual suffers an extra
financial burden. Increases in morality
impose an extra financial burden on the
whole community.
This is a matter of no small moment
because Australia starts with a few dis-
advantages, anyway. Our private enter-
prise sector has a relatively small, al-
though affluent, domestic market spread
unevenly around one of the world’s
larger nations. Our labor costs are com-
paratively high, our other costs such as
fixed assets and raw materials are cer-
tainly not cheap and our exports have to
compete in ruthless international mar-
kets.
On top of this, however, we have
imposed further handicaps upon our-
selves mostly connected with issues of
principle.
1. We have limited our uranium ex-
ports. This is one export which could
have boomed for us in the late 1970 s
and early 1980 s. Instead, we have
blocked the development of mines to
the benefit of our competitors. Uranium
is not a peculiarly rare metal. Off-hand,
Pierpont can think of several promising
deposits in Africa and North America.
Canada’s Key Lake deposit was prob-
ably brought on stream by the decision
to block Jabiluka.
2. We are giving Aborigines the
rights to determine whether mining oc-
curs over large tracts of Australia.
The real objection to this is that a
mining company has the additional cost
burden of negotiating with Aborigines
without any offsetting reduction in the
costs of its negotiations with various
arms of government. Getting Aborigi-
nal consent to a mine can include free
equity, cash payments, compensation
for various forms of disturbance, fees to
anthropologists for surveying sacred
sites and invariably delays which are
quite costly.
Considering some flak he has recent-
ly received from the Aboriginal direc-
tion, Pierpont should say that he is not
necessarily opposed to Aboriginal con-
trol of mining rights. Your correspon-
dent would certainly rather try to do a
mining deal with the Northern Land
Council, for instance, than with one of
the more moralistic sections of the
Labor Party.
3. To protect the environment, we
have imposed high costs on some indus-
tries. If proof of this proposition is
needed, just look at the environmental
impact study (EIS) which has to be pre-
pared before any major development
these days. An EIS is a highly expensive
and time-consuming exercise. As we all
love the environment, Pierpont will not
object to EIS requirements. However, a
company should not be required to
undertake one unless it is assured that,
providing it can prove the environment
will be adequately safeguarded, the de-
velopment will be allowed to proceed.
Pancontinental’s EIS on Jabiluka is
seven years old and not a shovelful of
earth has been turned yet.
4. Also under the prodding of con-
servationists, we have just about demol-
ished the mineral sand industry, which


in the 1960 s was one of our better export
earners. In some regions, there might
have been a case for this but the valu-
able bits of sand are the ugly black parts
not the clean, white grains so, over-
all, the sand miners should have been
improving our beaches. Note, inciden-
tally, that this is an example of biparti-
san morality, having been pursued by
both Malcolm Fraser and Neville Wran.
5. Industry is being urged to under-
take an affirmative action program. This
effectively means that employees are to
be hired by some criterion other than
fitness for the job. Pierpont cannot see
how this is going to improve productiv-
ity at any rate in the short term.
6. We have sacrificed a small but lu-
crative market by denying Qantas the
right to fly to Johannesburg. Instead, it
goes to Harare. We make this sacrifice
to establish solidarity with the black
African nations, many of whom have
direct air links as well as significant
trade links with South Africa.
Pierpont will leave off the list there,
as he is developing a strong thirst for
more Armagnac, but readers can doubt-
less think of a few other moral handi-
caps we have imposed upon ourselves
in the international struggle for life. The
actual and proposed bans on cigarette
and liquor advertising come to mind as
another example.
Having written this column, Pierpont
can see his short-term future clearly. He
is going to be deluged with letters of
outrage from every crusader in Austra-
lia. As they will all have purer souls
than your materialistic correspondent,
Pierpont will be fighting them at an
enormous moral disadvantage.
Before this happens, perhaps
Pierpont should make the Avarice
Party’s stand as clear as possible. What
we are after (all one of us) is not a low-
ering of moral standards but a costing
of them. If the moralists are saving our
souls from damnation, it would be nice
to know the price.
CHESS
Learning from Bobby Fischer
by Terrey Sbaw
CONTRARY to popular opinion,
Bobby Fischer was not a chess prodigy
in the usual sense. His first efforts, while
certainly better than those of the av-
erage six-year-old, didn’t reveal that in-
explicable, innate stamp of genius
which Capablanca and Reshevsky pos-
sessed.
His rise to the heights was remark-
ably fast. The fact that he earned the
grandmaster title at 15 speaks for itself.
But his progress was due to hard work
and dedication at least as much as to
natural ability.
Fischer stressed the importance of
four guideposts on his road to the sum-
mit.
1: Concentrate. While you’re playing,
keep your mind on the game. The differ-
ence between winning and losing often
is just a lack of application at a critical
moment. There’s plenty of time after the
game to work out where you’re going to
take your current flame to dinner.
2: Think ahead. Don’t rush your
moves. This idea is expressed neatly by
that old German phrase On der Hans be
Gezitten. Roughly translated, this means
“Don’t make the first move you think
of.”
3: Learn from losing. It is difficult to
over-estimate the value of being able to
analyse objectively the reasons for a
loss. Capablanca used to claim that he
learned only from his losses. As he rare-
ly lost, one can only conclude that he
learnt very little.
4: Study. It’s a shame that one can-
not avoid this one. But studying in-
volves not only poring over books but
also playing against strong opponents.
I hope that playing over the follow-
ing beautiful win by Fischer will inspire
you to try to recreate his artistry in your
own games. However, I suspect that a
reference by Cecil Purdy to an earlier
world champion may be equally applic-
able to Fischer: “Alekhine’s chess is like
a god’s. One can revere but never hope
to emulate.”
The game, against Hungary’s then
top player, was played in the
Piatagorsky Cup at Santa Monica in
1966.

INTELLIGENCER
Entrepreneur’s
unusual suit
THE libel action announced
last week by West Australian
entrepreneur Robert Holmes
a Court against Terry
McCrann, business editor of
The Age, is a little unusual.
Normally, when an ag-
grieved reader sues for libel, it
is the newspaper that cops the
writ. The writer is frequently
joined in the action but if the
victim of an alleged libel is
seeking damages he normally
has a better chance of collect-
ing them from the newspaper.
Very few journalists, after all,
are richer than their news-
papers.
Holmes a Court’s action
has been taken against
McCrann alone. At this point,
Holmes a Court has not sued
any of the newspapers which
published the article ( The Age,
the West Australian and the
Perth Daily News). This indi-
cates that the action has a
more personal flavor than
most libel cases. It also leaves
McCrann in the unpleasant
position of having to mount
his own defence.
The custom in Australia is
that a newspaper almost al-
ways finances the cost of a
writer’s libel defence. In
McCrann’s case, being a
valued employee, The Age
probably will underwrite his
costs although it may not
suit either party to say so.
George’s crowd:
what a whopper!
THE arrival of Boy George at
Sydney airport last week was
a major media event tele-
vision cameras, tape recorders
and notebooks almost out-
numbered fans.
Reports described hysteri-
cal scenes of screaming, cry-
ing teenagers reminiscent of
the arrival of the Beatles 20
years ago.
But the truth is that the
crowds were quite small. Ac-
cording to one seasoned press
photographer, “more turned
out for Princess Anne.”

Passing the buck, with distinction
THE NEW $1 coin appears to
have been well accepted by
the public, according to a poll
taken by leading Sydney coin
dealer Bob Roberts.
A survey sent to his cus-
tomers has yielded 900 replies
of which 78 percent were in
favor of the coin, 18 percent
against and 4 percent uncer-
tain. And people are more
likely to reply to a survey if
opposed to something.
If you have been wonder-
ing, the coin contains no gold.
It is 92 percent copper, 2 per-
cent nickel and 6 percent alu-
minium the last metal being
the one which gives it the
sheen.
The intrinsic value of the
coin is only a few cents and
the total cost of striking it is
about 10 cents. But, as a coin
will last from 20 to 50 years in
usable condition, this repre-
sents good value.
The old dollar notes had a
life of only 12 to 13 weeks. It
is an index of the ravages of
inflation that they had a life of
eight to nine months when
first issued. By the early 1980 s,
the cost of keeping a dollar
note in circulation had risen
to $1 every three years.

Setting Joyce’s
record straight
ALL those earnest students
who ever plodded through
James Joyce’s Ulysses under
the belief that Joyce’s contor-
tions of the English language
were all deeply meaningful
now appear to have been at
least partly deluded.
The publication of Ulysses
was a mess, containing some
errors by the author and many
more by the bemused printers
who had to try to decipher his
crimped scrawl.
An international team of
scholars armed with com-
puters has discovered 5000 er-
rors ranging from punctu-
ation to missing words and
even entire passages.
Joyce wrote it in longhand,
then had it typed by volun-
teers who not only added
punctuation but misspelled
some words and corrected
others that he had misspelled
intentionally. It was then
printed by French typesetters
who apparently did not know
English.
The corrected version has
been printed, on June 16
(Joyce’s Bloomsday).
Together with footnotes, it
costs $2OO.


Oddities in evidence from Gorky on the fate of Sakharov
DR Andrei Sakharov is alive
and well despite his month-
plus hunger strike accord-
ing to the Russians. They
produce as evidence a recent
photograph of the dissident
Soviet scientist who has been
exiled for more than four
years in the closed city of
Gorky.
Authorities say that this
photograph and one of his
wife, Elena, were taken about
a fortnight ago. They were
brought to the west by
Russian journalist Victor
Louis whose contacts with the
Kremlin are legendary and
whose scoops have included
the fall of Kruschev and the
Russian withdrawal from this
year’s Olympics.
Louis said: “I vouch for
the authenticity of these
photos. They were taken on
June 12 and 15.”
Members of Sakharov’s
family in the United States,
having seen the photographs,
concede that they probably
were taken within the past five
weeks but question the date
and the circumstances. They
are also greatly concerned
about the Sakharovs appear-
ance. They look drawn and
much thinner of face than
when most recently seen by a
reliable outsider, just after the
start of the hunger strike
undertaken in protest at
Russian authorities’ refusal to
let Elena go abroad for medi-
cal treatment.
There are other disturbing
oddities about the photo-
graphs. Ruth Bonner, Elena’s
84-year-old mother who went
to live in America in 1980,
points out that Dr Sakharov
seems overdressed for Gorky
in mid-summer.
He is shown walking in a
park while wearing a heavy
woollen sweater bought for
him by Elena in Italy in 1979.
It seems to be a summer’s day
but the photograph may well
have been taken far earlier
than Louis claims perhaps
in May, before the hunger
strike had taken full effect.
Bonner says that Sakharov
would never wear his Italian
sweater to go walking if he
were a free man. “He just
wears it around the apart-
ment. Elena would not let him
go out in it it’s too old.” She
also said he was carrying a
full-length raincoat which he
never wears.
Bonner concludes that
Sakharov was persuaded to
leave his flat at short notice so
that the pictures could be
taken.
One other disturbing clue
is that Sakharov is not carry-
ing the little white bag con-
taining his private papers
which he normally always
takes with him when he leaves
his apartment. Bonner specu-
lates that he is no longer living
in the bleak high-rise apart-
ment on the outskirts of
Gorky and that he must be
separated from Elena.
Bonner finds it odd that the
couple were not pictured
together. Elena also is not
dressed normally and looks
very tense. She has on a
headscarf which “she never
wears.”
Nevertheless, the pictures
were definitely taken in Gorky
and almost certainly within
the past two months. They
must stand, therefore, as the
most recent reliable evidence
available about Russia’s best-
known dissident.

BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
AFTER a few games we all know
what to do with the good opening
rolls. A 3-1 presents no problems;
neither does a 6-5, a 4-2 or a 1-1.
There often is discussion on how
best to play an opener of 3-3, 4-4
or 2-2 but, however they are
played, those rolls are not prob-
lematic.
More often than not, though,
other rolls come out of the cup.
Playing these is not difficult once
you understand the principles
involved. What, for example, do
you do with a 2-1, a 4-1, a 3-2 or a
6-2?
At the beginning of the game
you are doing one of two things
blocking or running. The
strategies involve the back men;
you either run with your own, with
rolls such as 6-5 or 6-4, or block
your opponent’s with rolls such as
6-1 or 3-1. The problem rolls are
those which are not obvious runs
or blocks.
The dotted lines show White
playing a 2-1 from W 6 to W 5 and
812 to Wll. Of course he now has
blots on WU and W 5 but, to hit,
Black must roll a 4 (double fives
don’t hit). White therefore is 9 to 4
against being hit and, if he isn’t
hit, look how well positioned he is
for his next roll.
The solid line play shows
Black moving a 4-1 opener so
much more adventurous than Wl2
to 88. How about using a 6-2 to
bring one man from the mid-point
(12) to your 5 point?
These are open plays but, early
on, the gains far outweigh the
risks. Try these open moves. Don’t
be afraid of leaving a blot early
on, especially if it puts you in a
commanding position if it’s
missed.

Opening lead ten of hearts.
ONE OF the basic laws of the
game is that a player must follow
suit whenever able to do so.
Everybody is familiar with this
rule but not everybody knows how
to take advantage of it.
West led a heart against six no-
trump and dummy’s king lost to
the ace. East returned a heart and
declarer won with the queen.
South had to take the rest of the
tricks to make the slam.
He could count on three
spades, a heart, three diamonds
and four clubs a total of 11
tricks. The only possible chance of
winning a twelfth trick lay in dia-
monds.
Assuming a normal 3-2 break,
the slam was assured. But, since
there was a possibility either de-
fender might have been dealt four
diamonds to the jack, South had
to watch his step.
Four diamond tricks could be
made even against a 4-1 break
provided declarer knew which op-
ponent had the greater diamond
length.
So South immediately cashed
all his spade and club tricks. In the
process he discovered that West
had been dealt exactly five spades
(East failed to follow to the third
spade lead).
Declarer also noted that West
had produced three clubs and two
hearts as these suits were led. Con-
sequently, with 10 cards in three
suits accounted for in West’s
hand, it became impossible for
him to have started with four dia-
monds.
Accordingly, South cashed the
king of diamonds and led a low
diamond to the ace. When West
showed out, the diamond finesse
became marked to succeed.
But if declarer had started the
diamond suit by first leading the
K-Q, he would have gone down.

HOW IT COMES.
HOW IT GOES.
You can’t disguise the truth. One
look at the sleek, streamlined profile of
the Mitsubishi Starion Turbo and you
know this car is more than a superb
sports coupe.
A closer inspection reveals why.
Underthe bonnet, Mitsubishi’s legendary
turbocharged powerpack and electronic
fuel injection give the kind of stunning
performance that make Starion Turbo
one of the fastest Japanese production
cars available in Australia today.
And if that doesn’t make the point,
maybe this will.
This year in a national series of
production car races the Starion Turbos
are proving to be true racing thorough-
breds. Which is, indeed, unfortunate
news for some of the world’s highly rated
sports cars. They’ve failed to live up to
their reputations while at the same time
the Starion Turbos have been out there,
busily building one.
The Mitsubishi Starion Turbo.
For value and high performance it’s a
winner, no matter which way you lookatit.
