THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Clue to popularity
I made up my mind that before I wrote
and told you how much I enjoyed your
centenary souvenir edition of January
29, 1980, I would solve the cryptic
crossword. Well, I’ve done it! It’s driven
me mad and I loved it (the magazine,
too).
Mrs JILL de VAUS
Daisy Hill Qld
On their merits
I was interested to read your report
“Storm over report on affirmative ac-
tion” (B, December 4) as my reactions
on reading the federal government’s
policy discussion paper on that subject
left me with the same sort of feelings
that appear to have been expressed by
Dr Moens in his paper.
The policy discussion paper master-
fully glosses over the central issue of
whether appointments under the
“target” system will be made on the
basis of strict merit or whether reverse
discrimination will be allowed or even
encouraged to occur.
It appears that the culturally-based
discrimination against women as
practised in the past is likely to give way
to legislatively-based discrimination
against men.
Nobody will gain from such a
system. If appointments are made on
any grounds other than those of strict
merit, our corporations and the public
“You don’t mind, do you, Vicar? It’s the only place you can escape
Christmas for a few minutes."
services will lose efficiency, many men
will become embittered and the women
appointed under such a system will
often feel insecure and perhaps even
unworthy in their new positions. The
great tragedy of it all is that, even under
a system of reverse discrimination, most
appointments of women will continue
to be made on the grounds of merit but
the above effects are still likely to be felt
even when this does occur as the sus-
picion of discrimination will always be
present.
In the meantime, the average Aussie
bloke being renowned for his easygo-
ing nature if not for his far-sightedness
is, of course, blissfully unaware of
what’s going to hit him.
But, when he wakes up to it all, there
will be hell to pay.

DISTINCTION.
“In the 760, Volvo has a car that is immediately competitive with
Mercedes and BMW in comfort and ride.”
Alan Kennedy, Australian Business.
“An opulent new luxury sedan... to take on the heavyweights of
the executive-class car market... a lavish specification level that
leaves virtually nothing to be desired.”
Mike Kable, Sydney Daily Mirror.
“The company has the determination to succeed and the car to
match the determination.”
Pedr Davis, National Syndicated Column.
“In Europe, the (Mercedes-Benz) 280 E is a more natural rival for
the 760.” “Volvo looks like it has won again.”
Chris de Fraga, Melbourne Age.
PERFORMANCE.
“• • • Powerful performance with smooth running and a high standard
of passenger comfort.”
Pedr Davis, National Syndicated Column.
“Capable of going around quite nasty corners at somewhere on the
wrong side of ioo km/h.” . „ _. , _, ,
° Stuart Scott, Brisbane Telegraph.
“The car feels like a Volvo; rock solid but capable of a surprising turn
of speed when called on ... it’s a quick car, point to point.”
Bob Jennings, Adelaide Advertiser.
PERSONALITY.
“The aerodynamic flying wedge shape is distinctly different... a
profile that could look handsome for the next 15 years.”
Frank Platell, West Australian.
“The new model combines a superb blend of grace, pace and good
styling with a high level of equipment and comfort.”
Mike Duffy Adelaide Sunday Mail.
“It is an elegant car and its styling flies so much in the face of
convention ... that it always drew a crowd wherever we drove on
our mad dash from Frankfurt to the Paris Motor Show. Yes, it’s an
elegant car all right.”
Brian Woodward, Modern Motor.

COMFORT.
.. Vast cabin space with ... a high degree of comfort. The high-line
boot can take vast amounts of luggage.”
Alan Kennedy, Australian Business.
“A considerable bundle of standard items, including an air condit-
ioning system that could make it snow in summer; the 760 GLE
lacks for very little. Wayne Webster, Sydney Daily Telegraph.
DRIVING PROPERTIES.
“Ride and handling... is very much in Mercedes and BMW league
and by comparison with the Bavarian machine’s manners, remains
constant and predictable...” „ ~ ,
r Doug Hicks, Motor Manual.
.. The V 6 760 is fun to drive... and that is not a word usually applied
to what is known as perhaps the safest production car in the
world... It handles, steers and brakes with the best of sports or
family cars.”
Wayne Gregson, Melbourne Sun News Pictorial.
VOLVO QUALITY.
“The fully imported model matches anything on the market for
quality of engineering and finish.” M ffe Duffy, Adelaide Sunday Mail.
.. Volvo has had an infusion of young staff. New, younger... safety
engineers who don’t lose sight of the fact that modern engineering
means lightweight strength, not add-on bulk.”
Brian Woodward, Modern Motor.
“Driven the equivalent of eighty times around the world in some of
the worst conditions it might be subjected to (including) Australia’s
hot, dusty, bumpy, car-eating interior. Every part passed every test...”
Fia Cumming, Vogue.
“.. .Volvo claims a 15% improvement in fuel consumption... and says
servicing time is less than half that for some other European cars.”

stated his support for “that great and
fundamental principal (which) must be
maintained”.
That principal is that one is “in-
nocent until proven guilty”.
As Australians, we have reason to be
pleased for the Commissioner of Taxa-
tion is going to be told by the Prime
Minister that Australian taxpayers are
not to be found guilty in absentia until
proven innocent. And, furthermore, we
will no longer be sentenced at the same
time. The innocent-until-proven-guilty
principal which Australians and other
free nations hold so dear is to be re-
introduced again.
Isn’t it?

Excellent choice
I returned home on Thursday last and
caught up with my reading. Congratula-
tions on your excellent choice of “Busi-
ness Woman of the Year.”
Beverly Hancock is the sort of
person who should be encouraged and I
am delighted that people of her calibre
are reaching top echelon of business.

Castlecrag NS W
An educated electorate
I will contend that 99.9 percent of voters
took into the polling booths a printed
slip showing how to vote in accordance
with the voter’s wish. That being so, I
ascribe the informals to: (1) Children
showing what they think about having
to spend part of Saturday at a polling
booth instead of at a beach or similar;
(2) Pensioners who, after a lifetime of
voting for the Labor Party, could not
bring themselves to vote Liberal but on
the other hand could not on this occa-
sion vote Labor.
If Mr Hawke still sticks out that
thousands of Labor voters could not
copy from a printed slip, perhaps he
should now see if the educational
standard of such voters can be
improved.
The only flaw in this idea is that they
might thereafter vote Liberal.
A. TURNBULL
Penrith NS W
Informal voting
The Australian Labor Party’s explana-
tion for the higher proportion of in-
formal votes coming from their “safe
seats” is that “the voters could not
understand the ballot papers.”
I tend to agree with Mr Hawke and
his party: most Labor voters that I have
met seem a bit thick.
IAN STILES
Enneaba WA
Liberal motives
Except for one encouragement vote for
the Democrats, I have always voted
Labor. However, in this election I ser-
iously considered voting Liberal
because I believed they had absolutely
no hope of winning and were possibly
in danger of heading for extinction.
In the end, I could not quite bring
myself to vote for our Liberal candidate
but I wonder whether many other
people wanted the government returned
but voted Liberal just out of concern for
the healthy democratic ideal of a
reasonable Opposition.
I have seen no mention by the media
pundits of this possibility. Maybe a
pollster could ask, “Are you happy that
the Labor government has been re-
elected?” If the “yes” answer is
significantly higher than Labor’s per-
centage of the December 1 vote, the
premise might be justified.
JACK de LISSA
Molong NSW
Self-determination
In Australia’s near neighbour New Cal-
edonia, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front (FLNKS), using
standard Leninist recruiting methods,
has been extending its influence among
the Kanak population (approximately
43 percent of the 150,000 total).
Recently, the FLNKS publicly ack-
nowledged receipt of financial support
from Libya and has even admitted that
Libya has been giving military training
to FLNKS members.
As a major step toward self-determi-
nation, elections were held for the
Territorial Assembly on November 18.
The FLNKS, well aware that it could
not win the election, called for a boy-
cott. In a legitimate, free election, the
Rally for Caledonia in the Republic
Party (RPCR) won 34 out of 42 seats
and Dick Ukeiwe, former vice-president

PERFORMANCE
THROUGH!
Today there are more affordable
performance vehicles available than
ever before.
More stress is applied to tyres,
drivetrains, suspensions and, above
all, engines.
The demands made
upon
lubricants are being pushed to the extreme by high
performance vehicles.
So Castrol, as leaders in lubrication technology,
especially in Australian conditions - have done
something about it.
Introducing Castrol FMX. A new
high-technology motor oil that meets
the requirements of modern
performance vehicles by satisfying
what are arguably the most severe
operational demands for any auto-
motive crankcase lubricant - those of
the highly stressed turbocharged petrol engine.
Prolonged high temperature is a major cause of
engine failure.
The heat generated within a turbocharged
engine can be phenomenal. Bearing temperatures of

additives to minimize piston ring sticking and bearing
corrosion and resist the formation of harmful deposits
produced by sustained high-speed operation and
immediate shutdown. This new oil reflects a develop-
ment philosophy common to all Castrol oils. It does
not simply meet the required standards of industry tests
- it exceeds them easily, by significant margins. Some
inferior oils available on the Australian market may
only just meet these modern lubricant requirements.
Castrol FMX is a no compromise' performance
motor oil, offering superior engine protection.
As such it commands a premium price. But we
believe the performance-oriented motorist does not
want compromises when it comes to the thousands of
dollars investment represented by a performance
vehicle.

Extended programming
I really appreciated Ron Saw’s review
of The Last Bastion (not that I’ve seen
it) in The Bulletin (November 27) which
also included an excellent criticism of
commercial overkill during mini-series.
He voiced my (and no doubt
countless other TV viewers’) opinions
exactly.
Every time we watch a mini-series or
classic film I vow to ring up the station
afterwards and complain vehemently
about the incessant commercials. My
excuse has been that they extend the
program so much, it’s almost the small
hours by the time it’s all over. By next
morning, there are more pressing prob-
lems.
The description of “typical” ad-
vertisements was very amusing and the
data on frequency of occurence was
most informative.

Monkey business
Your cartoonist Stonie has rather got

I presume that the “sex transplant”
refers to a penis. But what man would
swap his penis for that of a gorilla? Man
is supreme among the primates for both
the size of his penis and his sexual
prowess (fortunately, we also have very
poor quality sperm and a very low
conception rate), so where is the joke?

Wasted skills
With reference to the article by Willa
McDonald (B, November 20), I would
like to support Norman Hoffman’s
sentiment that job security, racism, con-
servatism and a sometimes justified fear
of incompetence are the main reasons
that so few foreign educational
qualifications are recognised in
Australia.
However, I would like to add that I
believe that Australia retards its own
progress primarily by the refusal of its
industrial companies to recognise the
qualifications of many of its immi-
grants, especially the competent and
highly trained migrants from northern
Europe and other technically advanced
countries.
Surely a country which has spent
millions in assisted passages for these
people cannot afford to waste such a
large investment by not using their skills
skills which were essential for obtain-
ing permanent residency in Australia.
Undoubtedly, the advance of
Australia would be much faster if it was
to utilise the skills of these people rather
than waste valuable financial liquidity
gained from taxation on unemployment

Missing Foley
As an old Bulletin subscriber for the
past 50 years, may I make a plea that
you do not drop your editorial “axe”
too heavily upon the head of that dear
old entertaining writer to your columns
Larry Foley.
This type of literary bird is becoming
rare indeed with his refreshing, breezy
style and his truly Australian expression
makes very pleasant reading in this day
and age. Moreover, he is invariably “on
the ball” with most of the subjects in
which he chooses to indulge and I think
that some of his recent critics are rather
unkind and should show a little toler-
ance (also a rare bird today) or does the
truth hurt sometimes?

Ethiopia’s tragedy
Robert Darroch’s article “Africa the
continent of starvation” (B, November
20) was more perceptive than most
recent articles in that it shows that the
root cause of the famine in Ethiopia is
the social, political (and moral) collapse
of the Ethiopian government. However,
it does not deal with the main reason for
the Ethiopian government’s singular
inability to feed the people. This is due
to the wars of liberation that are being
fought in the northern provinces of
Ethiopia and in Eritrea forcibly
annexed in 1962.
It is the actions of the Ethiopian
government which have laid waste huge
areas of once-fertile land and which
have caused the world’s gravest refugee
problem.
Now that the Australian people and
government have responded so swiftly
and generously to an urgent need for
food, perhaps the government will now
use its new authority as Security Coun-
cil member to support the call of the
liberation movements the EPLF in
Eritrea, the TPLF in Tigre and the
EPDM in Wollo for a ceasefire and
internationally guaranteed negotiations
with the Ethiopian military government.


Unless we take advantage of this
great tragedy, the world will soon forget
Ethiopia and the Soviet-backed armies
of the Derg will once again cause the
death of tens of thousands of civilians.

Arts funding continued
Brian Hoad’s article (B, Dec 11)
wrongly states that the Australia Coun-
cil has totally withdrawn funding for
the 1985 Festival of Perth. In fact, the
opposite is true. The Australia Council
has given a guarantee to David
Blenkinsop, the festival director, that
the funding for the 1985 festival will be
no less than the total provided for the
1984 festival, that is $51,600 plus 6.5
percent indexation, a total of no less
than $54,654 for 1985.
This was decided in November when
council’s inter-board committee, and
council itself, discussed the question of
core funding for major multi-arts festi-
vals. Council considered three options:
funding primarily through the Com-
munity Arts Board (as in recent years),
core funding through a separate alloca-
tion, and project funding through in-
dividual boards. Council agreed to
adopt the last method, which will allow
festivals to apply directly to the relevant
boards for individual festival activities.
They may, if they wish, provide one or
more “consolidated” applications for
submission to the appropriate boards.
Mr Blenkinsop was telephoned by a
senior representative of council im-
mediately after the November 7-9
meeting so that there was no delay in
advising him of council’s decision.

Concerns of the young
Regarding Paul Gardiner’s article about
Peter Garrett and the Nuclear Disarma-
ment Party (B, December 11), I am also
intrigued by the barrage of commentary
relating to the recent election affirming
that nuclear disarmament was an issue
in the community that the pollsters
failed to identify. May I suggest that,
before the major parties dismiss the
NDP vote as an aberration, they investi-
gate the source of NDP support. It is my
contention that this support came pre-
dominately from the young people in
our society who are increasingly more
concerned about nuclear war and as yet
have been unable to have their view of
Australia’s future (their future) heard.
Surprising as it may seem to some,
the combined churches social justice
statement “It’s a Rocky Road”
released in September identified ac-
curately nuclear war as an issue of
immediate concern to young people
aged 15 to 24 (2.6 million Australians!).
As it appears the churches have
identified nuclear war as an issue when
so many others have failed, it is useful
to look at the other areas recognised as
major concerns of young Australians.
These are (1) unemployment and
income security and (2) a need for
loving relationships. The report also
revealed that alienation, while not a
universal experience, is of growing
significance across a wide spectrum of
youth affairs.
A combination of these issues con-
tributed to the remarkable showing of
the NDP whose leading campaigner,
Peter Garrett of Midnight Oil, no doubt
reflects many of the concerns of our
young people.
In an effort to restore the drift of
young Australians away from the
mainstream of society, the churches’
statement proposed seven major
changes to unemployment, education
and training allowances to address the
most serious needs of young people.
These proposals would cost us tax-
payers a lot of money $B5O million
but, even then, these proposals would
still leave young people below the
poverty line.

“At the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital, we found that HP
was the one company which
could satisfy our need to
follow patient progress with
instantaneous, accurate
data.”
Dr. Diana Horvath, Medical Director
of the hospital, refers to the installation
of HP's intensive care patient data
monitoring system and the E.C.G.
Management system.
"We looked at several companies and
chose Hewlett-Packard. HP's systems
provide us with meaningful, readily
accessible information. Now we can
identify things that will cause patient
problems and head off many potential
emergencies.
"The automated monitoring system has
made us much more efficient because the
semi-manual system could not provide us
with essential data so quickly and easily.
"Most importantly, both systems enable
patient care staff to devote more of their
attention to patients rather than tying up
valuable time with clerical functions. We
are more productive and able to spend
more time caring for patients than before.
“HP’s back-up and support has
been excellent. They have readily
adjusted their own timetable to suit
ours and instigated a thorough
training programme which ensured
staff were totally at ease and
confident in the systems.
Consequently, we have built a close
and rewarding relationship with HP.”

Peacock’s cuts
FEDERAL Opposition leader
Andrew Peacock cut his
shadow ministry from 30 to 27
members with former health
spokesman Jim Carlton and
former aviation spokesman
John Spender, of New South
Wales, being the most con-
spicuous casualties. Carlton
was dropped for failing to
respond “adequately” to press
reports during the election
campaign about a possible
leadership challenge. Spender
was sacked for writing an
article in The Bulletin before
the election criticising the
Costigan royal commission.
Former Peacock right-hand
man, South Australian Steele
Hall, refused to serve in the
outer shadow ministry after
Peacock left him out of the 13-
member shadow cabinet.
Three members who were not
in the old parliament were
appointed: West Australian
MP Peter Shack, former Com-
munications minister Victor-
ian Neil Bown, and former
Northern Territory chief
minister Paul Everingham.
Ministry moves
AFTER the federal Labor
caucus had re-endorsed the
entire ministry without hold-
ing a ballot, Prime Minister
Bob Hawke remodelled the
team. In the move, described
as “audacious,” 10 ministers
obtained new jobs; another
seven had changes made to
their portfolios and nine
remained unaffected.
• See page 28.
Murphy trial
AS the Director of Public
Prosecutions, lan Temby, QC,
has announced, High Court
judge Lionel Murphy will face
two charges that he tried to
pervert the course of justice.
Murphy has agreed that the
charges be heard before a
judge and jury in the ACT
Supreme Court. Under the
Commonwealth Crimes Act,
conviction carries a maximum
penalty of two years’ jail or a
$5OOO fine. The charges relate
to allegations by NSW Chief
John Spender: dropped
ROBERT DURAN
Magistrate Clarrie Briese and
NSW District Court judge
Paul Flannery, made before a
Senate Committee, that
Murphy may have attempted
to influence the outcome of a
case against Sydney solicitor
Morgan Ryan. Murphy said:
“I have not committed any
offence ... I welcome the fact
that the allegations will be
tried by a judge and a jury
and not the media.”
Crime checks
JUSTICE Donald Stewart,
chairman of the National
Crime Authority, told its first
public sitting that the author-
ity had rejected the Costigan
commission’s call for special
investigative powers in 20
cases arising from Frank
Costigan’s investigations into
organised crime. Only five of
the criminal matters needed
the powers to compel
witnesses to testify and to
obtain documents. Stewart
said he had received material
on 42 matters from Costigan
and would continue investiga-
tions into 39 of them. But he
would seek the special powers
or “references” from state and
federal governments on only
five matters.
Stamps up
TWO DAYS after the
country’s top employer body,
the Confederation of Aus-
tralian Industry, had com-
plained to the federal govern-
ment about “inadequate”
postal services, Australia Post
announced an increase of the
standard letter rate from 30c
to 33c. Without the increase,
Australia Post would face a
loss of about $3O million in
1984-85.
Qantas chief dies
KEITH Hamilton, 56, direc-
tor and chief executive of
Qantas Airways died
suddenly at his home in
Pymble, NSW. He joined the
organisation as a traffic officer
in 1948 and rose to the top
“by sheer ability.” He was
credited with turning Qantas
from a heavily losing enter-
prise into a profit-making
business. He left a wife and a
daughter.
Back in harmony
THE Australian ambassador
to the Philippines, Roy Fer-
nandez, has apologised to
Filipino orchestra conductor
Redentor Romero for the
“humiliating treatment” he
had received from airport im-
migration officers when he
visited Sydney last October.
We get bigger and better
IN THE first three months, The Bulletin with Newsweek has
recorded a circulation in excess of 125,000, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulations. This figure, covering the period
July-September, represents an increase of more than 30,000 on
the circulation of the former Bulletin.
Unfortunately, costs have gone up as well, so from its next
issue The Bulletin cover price will rise 10c to $1.70.
Temporarily, however, we have pegged subscription rates at
their former levels of $5B for a year (saving $23 on the single
copy price) and $lO5 for two years (saving $5B). These offers
will remain open until March 1.

Unions among losers in
the ministry reshuffle
One of the winners in the new Hawke government is John Dawkins who will put
cutting the number of jobless ahead of extant comfortable employment practices.
With an eye on the future, RICHARD FARMER runs the rule over a revamped ministry.
A MOVE toward reducing minimum
pay rates for juniors and the abolition
of penalty rates is a likely result of the
appointment of John Dawkins as the
federal minister in charge of Youth
Affairs. Prime Minister Bob Hawke
might have wanted Dawkins because he
is, at 37, one of Labor’s youngest
ministers but the union movement will
soon find that there is a ruthlessness
behind the boyish good looks.
Getting the young unemployed into
work is Dawkins’ top priority: he sees
breaking down comfortable employ-
ment practices which unions have
erected around those already in jobs as
an important way of achieving his aim.
Hawke himself had a little taste in
the 10 days after the election of the no-
nonsense Dawkins style. Hawke initi-
ally wanted Dawkins simply to take
over Youth Affairs and con-
tinue as Finance minister.
Dawkins refused. Another
prime ministerial suggestion
was that Youth Affairs be
combined with the employ-
ment part of the department
of Employment and In-
dustrial Relations. Dawkins
again said no. The prospect
of being minister for the
unemployed without any
power to effect the economic
conditions which will deter-
mine the unemployment
rate did not appeal to him at all.
Dawkins is a man of considerable
political ambition whom Treasurer Paul
Keating sees as his greatest rival to
becoming Hawke’s eventual successor.
Dawkins refused to be put in a position
John Dawkins
where he would attract the
criticism for a high un-
employment rate. He sug-
gested that employment
be combined with Trade
to form another strong
economic department,
along with Treasury and
Industry and Commerce.
Then he would take the
job.
Hawke’s first reaction
was to refuse but others in
the ministry with the
prime ministerial ear saw
other attractions in Dawkins becoming
at least Trade minister.

EXPLORATION
Drillers, miners
hope to reach
Evans’ bunker
By DAVID BARNETT
WHAT BOTHERS the mining and oil
industry about the appointment of
Senator Gareth Evans as minister for
Resources and Energy is his
despondency.
Evans went into a bunker and
declined to be interviewed on the day
Prime Minister Bob Hawke announced
his reshuffle. Evans’ staff handed out
copies of an old speech in which he
listed his achievements as Attorney-
General.
To the irritation of Foreign Minister
Bill Hayden, Evans issued a statement
that he saw his primary political task as
being to explain and defend the govern-
ment’s position on uranium, disarma-
ment and related issues. Evans also was
made minister assisting the Foreign
Minister but Hayden thought that
Evans making it his primary task was an
excess of enthusiasm.
Evans was still cast down in gloom
when the dawn broke on what should
have been the beginning of a new life
with a new portfolio.
“But he’s in charge of 40 percent of
Australia’s exports,” said one miner
(who wishes to remain anonymous, for
obvious reasons).
The mining and oil industry both
face problems, some derived from
Australia’s high costs and the difficult
world commodity markets and others
from government policies which date
back to the days when Treasurer Paul
Keating was Opposition spokesman in
this area. Evans will have to grapple
with an array of issues which could
make him or break him. If he continues
to feel sacked, kicked and humiliated by
being given one of the government’s
biggest jobs, the chances are that they
will break him.
The resources rent tax is due to go
through parliament in the autumn. The
oil industry still considers aspects of it
to be unacceptable. It also objects to
proposals to allocate oil exploration
permits by means of cash tendering.
The industry is encouraged by the
way in which the West Australian
government is dealing with Aboriginal
land rights but nevertheless remains
concerned about the subject. So far, oil
exploration is in reasonable shape.
Forty-five offshore wells were com-
pleted over the past year, compared
with 49 the year before, and 220 onshore
wells compared with some 160 the year
before. But seismic work is down by
about one third on the peak years
between 1978 and 1982 and the number
of drilling vessels is down from 10 to
four because two are laid up and four
have left.
The outgoing minister, Senator Peter
Walsh, has managed to avoid what
happened under Labor’s Whitlam
government when drilling ceased
almost completely. But the warning
signs exist.


interfere with plans for restructuring
industry in a way that involves lower
protection. Bowen agreed to go only on
the condition that he became Attorney-
General.
Hawke’s dilemma was that he had to
sacrifice his friend Senator Gareth
Evans as Attorney-General to make
way for Bowen.
Hawke was considerably reluctant to
embarrass an ally. The Prime Minister
realises that many of the decisions that
have made Evans so unpopular within
the Australian Labor Party were taken
at Hawke’s instigation. But a radio
interview by Evans on the ABC current
affairs program PM soon after the elec-
tion of December 1 provided the anti-
Evans forces with new ammunition to
claim that he was too accident-prone to
remain Attorney-General.
The combination of Dawkins
pushing for a substantial role for him-
self, Button wanting Bowen moved and
almost everyone in the party gunning
for Evans finally proved irresistible.
Dawkins became Trade minister and
minister assisting the Prime Minister for
Youth Affairs, Bowen Attorney-General
and Evans minister for Resources and
Energy.
Dawkins and Button have a close
personal relationship. Together, they
will be making fundamental changes in
the way in which industry policy is
determined. Much closer co-operation
between their departments is certain.
Trade is bound to concentrate far more
on secondary industry than ever before.
Button has strengthened his role in
the government but not only because he
has seen his principal adversary
removed. He has taken over as well the
administration of government schemes
to promote technological change in
industry. Science minister Barry Jones
was the main loser there.
Like Dawkins, Button is no greal
admirer of the role that trade unions
have played in the Australian economy,
These two men will try to give the
second Hawke government
enough spine to resist the
sectional, selfish claims of in-
dividual unions.
Rates of pay for juniors
and penalty rates for weekend
and shift work will be among
the first battles to be fought.
On both questions, consider-
able evidence suggests that the
changes envisioned would
result in more jobs. In both
cases, Labor like its con-
servative coalition pre-
decessors has been too
scared to act.
Button and Dawkins will
not be fobbed off so easily
from doing what they believe
is right. The second Hawke
government just might be pre-
pared to de-regulate in
practice what Liberal deputy
leader John Howard talks
about but could not do in
office.
If Dawkins and Button are
big winners in the ministerial shake-up,
it is easy to pick some losers. Evans is
the most noticeable but not the only
one. Jones is now the minister for Very
Little. It probably serves him right for
criticising the amount of money given
to his department in the last budget and
actively encouraging scientists to make
their hurt feelings public.
Special minister of State Mick
Young has seen his portfolio stripped of
the responsibility for government
The miners are looking to
the government to deal with
export controls, de-regula-
tion, costs, declining in-
ternational competitiveness,
commonwealth charges and
taxation.
The mining industry has
been seen as one which
federal and state governments
can milk with impunity. The
miners say that those days
have passed.
The government’s position
is that the resources rent tax
should be extended from the
oil industry to mining. The
miners say that they are in no
position to deal with extra
taxation.
Uranium is for the Aust-
ralian Labor Party an issue
beyond the control of any single
minister, even the one with its
ministerial carriage.
Walsh impressed the industry with
his courtesy and with his eagerness to
learn. He made an overseas study tour
and returned convinced that uranium
should be mined and that safeguards
could be made adequate. His views
stood no chance at the ALP conference
last July. The policy of preventing
mines development in the Northern
Territory has been costing the nation
export revenue and NT Aboriginals
tens of millions of dollars in royalties. It
is even costing the ALP votes.
Former Northern Territory Chief
Minister Paul Everingham won one
Aboriginal booth and received nearly
half the votes in two others.
Evans seems to have been caught up
in a move designed to replace Deputy
Prime Minister Lionel Bowen in Trade
to provide Industry minister Senator
John Button with a colleague with
whom he can work more easily.
The Opposition’s shadow to Evans
in the last parliament, Senator Peter
Durack, was quickly out with a com-
ment that Evans had been moved
because he was an embarrassment.
Evans’ new constituents in the mining
and oil industries would rather see him
as a senior minister moved to a senior
portfolio. But, sunk in despondency,
Evans’ initial reaction has been to listen
to his critics. □


publicity. He is virtually minister for
police and electoral reform. The new
chief of propaganda is Sports minister
John Brown.
Health minister Neal Blewett retains
control of Medicare but has lost the
administrative battle which has gone on
for more than a year to determine who
should be in charge of care for the aged.
Senator Don Grimes has had his plans
for the distribution of functions ac-
cepted in total. His new department of
Community Services takes over the
chief health and welfare policy role,
including care for the aged. The depart-
ments of Health and Social Security
become administrative agents.
Much has been written about the left
strengthening its position by getting an
extra person into cabinet. But that
victory does not really amount to much.
The promoted Brian Howe has been
given the minor Social Security post
where he will get the blame if pensions
do not reach the level of 25 percent of
average weekly earnings promised in
party policy.
The left’s Stewart West has lost
Immigration for the relatively minor
post of minister for Housing. Senator
Arthur Gietzelt remains at Veterans’
Affairs. Tom Uren has lost half his
responsibilities those dealing with the
Australian Capital Territory and
becomes the minister for virtually
nothing. The Local Government in his
departmental title is unlikely to amount
to anything, given the spending con-
straints the government feels obliged to
keep. Uren is the only minister, appar-
ently, whom Hawke wanted out of his
government. Not being able to achieve
that because of deals by the faction
bosses, it seems that Hawke has done
what he considers to be the next-best
thing.
Those faction chiefs the right’s
Graham Richardson, the left’s Gerry
Hand, the centre left’s Peter Cook and
Button of the Victorian independents
can congratulate themselves on the suc-
cess of the transition from the first to the
second Hawke government. Persuading
caucus to return the complete ministry
unopposed was quite an achievement.
Yet the task was made easier by the
general expectation that the next year
will see more ministers appointed. All
four faction leaders agree that the
ministry should be expanded. Only the
need for the Ministers of State Act to be
amended to authorise more than the
existing 27 ministers prevented Hawke
being pushed on the issue last week. The
argument that there was no point elect-
ing people who could not take up their
duties until the necessary legislation was
passed carried the day.
The main issue to be thrashed out by
the faction leaders with the Prime
Minister is how many ministerial jobs to
create. Before the election, the left and
the centre left favored seven and the
right wanted 10.
Now that Labor has been returned
with more backbenchers than before the
poll but without the massive majority
expected, all three of these factions plus
the independent group from Victoria
probably will settle for a smaller
number.
The new jobs will have a full
ministerial salary and come with all the
perks of office but probably will carry
the title Deputy Minister. The deputy
ministers will in practice be assistants to
cabinet ministers with large portfolios.
The reason for not having assistant
ministers on some lesser salary scale is
the problem of Section 64 of the Con-
stitution which allows the Governor-
General to appoint officers to
administer such departments of state as
the Governor-General in Council may
establish.
Taken in conjunction with the
Ministers of State Act which provides
for a specified number of members of
parliament to be ministers, successive
governments have interpreted Section
64 as meaning that any politician, other
than a minister, who was paid for
government work would be under threat
of losing his parliamentary seat for
holding an office of profit under the
Crown.
Faction leaders have given consider-
able thought to the way around this
constitutional problem.
The planned deputy ministers would
have portfolios created for them by
subdivision within the departments of
the full-scale ministers they were to
assist. Each deputy would have a de-
partment of state with the adminis-
trative arrangements order specifying
that the duties of that department were,
within policies approved by the senior
minister, to administer and manage
such matters as were specified by the
senior minister.
While Section 25 (2) of the Public
Service Act refers to the departmental
secretary advising the minister in all
matters relating to the department, there
is nothing to prevent one person on one
salary holding two jobs as departmental
head. This is what would happen under
the plan. To give substance to each
department, deputy ministers would
have a small number of public servants
employed by their department.
Hawke initially was not in favor of
the deputy minister proposal. Keating
probably was an influence on him.
Keating apparently is concerned that
creating more ministerial jobs does not
lie well with a government commitment
to curbing expenditure. But, for a Labor
prime minister who must always run the
gauntlet of securing caucus approval for
the actions of cabinet, there are other
considerations.
The sweetheart deal which resulted
in the ministry being re-elected un-
opposed undoubtedly annoyed many
party members. Those with ministerial
aspirations were naturally disappointed
at having to wait.
The best way of letting off that steam
is to provide a promotion for some of
the most talented members kept out of
the ministry by last week’s decisions.
The faction leaders had even gone as
far, before polling day, as to consider
whom these talented people were.
The right and the centre apparently
agreed that Hand and Senator Nick
Bolkus from South Australia were the
best of the left’s prospects. Richardson
and Hawke both thought that Wendy
Fatin, the member for Canning in
Western Australia, would be alright as
well. Cook was not so sure.
The short list from the centre left
includes Cook, Bob Brown from New
South Wales, Gordon Bilney from
South Australia, Senator Michael Tate
from Tasmania and Senator Rosemary
Crowley from South Australia.
Tate, who chaired a Senate com-
mittee which inquired into the conduct
of High Court judge Lionel Murphy,
would encounter strong opposition
from both left and right. His chances of
promotion must be slight.
Crowley was considered to be an
outsider while the right had not really
considered Bilney at all. When the
name was mentioned, it was apparently
conceded that he had ability.

for Canberra.
Richardson himself is a most reluct-
ant candidate, for personal reasons.
Perhaps it is too much fun being a
numbers man outside the ministry.
Robert Ray from Victoria is the senator
most favored to become a deputy

A peculiar problem that all the
factions recognise is the need to have an
additional minister from Queensland.
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden is the

of the country so often that he is of
limited help to a party machine
desperately in need of the kind of

Darling is unacceptable to the right.
Humphries is seen as a possibility but
the man the right would like to see
up is Brisbane’s Manfred Cross. □

COMPENSATION
Life expectancy
hit in more
ways than one
By DAVID ARMSTRONG
BRUCE LOKER, the first Australian to
contract AIDS from a blood transfu-
sion, is pioneering uncharted legal terri-
tory by suing the blood bank which
supplied the contaminated fluid and the
hospital which administered it.
Loker, 53, married with two children,
is claiming unspecified damages from
Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital and the
New South Wales division of the
Australian Red Cross Society.
The hospital is being sued for breach
of contract and negligence. The Red
Cross blood transfusion service is being
sued for negligence.
A statement of claim in the name of
Colin Bruce Loker was filed in the NSW
Supreme Court last week by his sol-
icitors, Walsh James.
The statement was served on the
hospital and blood bank at the same
time. Both institutions are covered by
the one insurance company, the NSW
Government Insurance Office. Accord-
ing to the statement, Loker was
admitted to the hospital for treatment
for Legionnaires Disease on July 11,
1983. On July 19 and 20 he was given, as
part of the treatment, transfusions of
four units of blood. “One of the units of
blood ... was contaminated and as a
result ... the plaintiff suffered injury by
means of his contracting the
condition of Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syn-
drome.”
The hospital, it says,
agreed to treat Loker for
payment. An implied condi-
tion of the agreement was that
hospital staff would exercise
due care, skill and diligence.
The statement says the hospi-
tal failed to exercise such care.
Moreover, the statement
says, the hospital had a gener-
al duty of care for Loker’s
safety but failed to take
reasonable care.
The Red Cross also had a
duty of care to exercise due
care, skill and diligence in
taking blood from donors,
handling, treating and
classifying it and supplying it
to hospitals.
The statement alleges the
society failed to fulfill this
obligation. It says the blood
bank did not take adequate
steps to screen donors or the blood
Loker received, it failed to ensure the
blood sent to the hospital was free from
contamination and it exposed Loker to
unnecessary risk.
According to the statement, Loker
contracted Legionnaires Disease in July
1983, which made him totally in-
capacitated for work until January and
partially incapacitated after that. He
had expected to have been cured of that
disease by July 1984.
Because he had contracted AIDS, he
had not been able to work since July 2
and would not be able to work again.
Loker has negotiated one legal
battle, a worker’s compensation case,
relating both to the Legionnaires Dis-
ease and to AIDS. The case was settled
out of court last month but in hearings
before the State Worker’s Compensa-
tion Commission it was not disputed
that he contracted Legionnaires from
water in the cooling system where he
worked.
Loker is believed to have accepted
less than $50,000 in settlement of that
compensation claim, of which more
than half would probably have been
paid out in medical and other costs.
A cruel irony of the system was that
contracting AIDS actually slashed the
compensation he could expect. The
amount he received was based on loss of
earning ability for the rest of his ex-
pected working life. The syndrome has
cut his life expectancy and thus his
expected working life to about two
years.
Damages actions similar to that
Loker has launched can take up to
two years to get to court. His lawyers
will apply for an early hearing. □

The cup spawns
a determined
menagerie
America II: shrouded in the customary secrecy
BRUCE STANNARD
By BRUCE STANNARD
THE AMERICA’S Cup is still two years
distant but already Fremantle is reeling
under the sledgehammer subtlety of
opposition hype. When John S. Griffith,
chairman of California’s Eagle syndi-
cate flew into town last week he took
great pleasure in distributing free, a
beautifully crafted tie-tack which
featured a soaring Golden Eagle clutch-
ing in its talons the dull, grey corpse of a
boxing kangaroo. The eagle clutched
the unfortunate kangaroo
firmly by the scrotum.
Over in the New York
Yacht Club’s America II syn-
dicate home, a splendidly
reconditioned apartment
block in East Fremantle, one
wall of the gymnasium is
decorated with a fiendish car-
icature of Ornithodoros
Gurneyi, a tick said to
inflict a particularly painful
death on kangaroos, boxing
gloves or no.
“Y’see,” said Arthur
Wullschleger, America IT s
project director, “we Yanks
got our ass kicked pretty good
over this cup thing. Ameri-
cans who’d never even heard
of the cup, let alone a 12-
metre yacht, suddenly said,
‘Hey, wait a minute. We can’t
let the Aussies get away with
that. We gotta go get it back
and to hell with the cost.’
That’s why we’re here right
now. When we g’home we’d
sure like to take the thing with
us.”
Already American buffiper
stickers are starting to appear
around town. “The America’s
Cup,” they say. “Don’t leave
Perth without it!”
Certainly, if money, time,
expertise and sheer go-get-’em
energy count for anything, the
America II syndicate is way
out in front of the 23 other
challengers. The indefatigable
Wullschleger, who has taken
three years off from running
his textile empire, is making
sure of that. Standing in one
of three 10-metre containers
(insulated and air-condi-
tioned, of course) we were
surrounded by more than a
quarter of a million dollars’ worth of
machine tools, donated by American
sponsors. Outside hummed the power-
ful transformer which transforms local
voltage to the 220 and 120 volts Ameri-
can equipment requires. America 11, the
first of the syndicate’s three 12-metre
yachts, is moored securely in the con-
crete pens especially constructed on
reclaimed land at the Fremantle
Boatlifters site at the very heart of the
Fishermen’s Harbor.
Although their boat has fairly con-
ventional lines the Americans are wary
about showing the Australians her
underbody. When they haul it out, it
tends to be close to midnight when they
have presumed all good little boxing
kangaroos are safely tucked up in bed.
That has been a mistake. Sitting on the

John Kolius, the 33-year-old skipper
of what will be, far and away, the most
costly of all the cup challenges, told me
he had drawn up a precisely detailed
campaign blueprint, a battle-plan that
included columns of costs sufficient to
make even J. P. Morgan wince.
“They (the syndicate) didn’t bat an
eye,” Kolius said. “They’re backing me
right down the line.
“It’s costly being here early like this.
But we figure it’s the only way to go. We
want to iron our technical bugs out now
instead of wasting vital race-time later.
Right now we’re in a shake-down
mode.” That little lapse into NASA
space jargon was appropriate since
Kolius had just come from a meeting
with Doug Cook, a fellow-Texan who
also happens to be the aeronautical
whizz who designed all the re-entry
programs for the Space Shuttle and is
now working towards a US cup re-
entry.
Azzurra, the challenger from the Aga
Khan’s Yacht Club Costa Smeralda will
be the second foreign 12 metre in
Fremantle when she arrives on
December 20. Azzurra and America II
will begin trial races together in
January.
Meanwhile Australia 11, beautifully
repainted and overhauled, was recondi-
tioned in November and now serves as
a training platform for both Australia
111 candidates and the South Australian
syndicate whose Ben Lexcen-designed
boat is nearing completion in nearby
Cottesloe.
In a spacious waterfront shed at
North Fremantle, the enormous upside-
down hull of the as yet unnamed
Taskforce 1987 Defence syndicate’s
boat is very close to final plating.
Designed by 28-year-old John
Swarbrick in conjunction with her
skipper, five-times world 18-footer
champion and current World Etchells
champion lain Murray, the new twelve
is said to be about two metres
longer than Australia 11.
Murray confirmed that his
boat, which will be launched
early in February, will have a
winged keel.
“We went through all the
tank-testing programs in
Wageningen (Holland),” he
said, “and the data proves that
we have a boat which is at
least as fast as Australia II in
light air and demonstrably
faster in medium to heavy air.
“We are quietly confident
that we’re right on the money
with this one although we do
have plans to build a second
boat, based on our experience
of learning with this one.” □


VICTORIA
Bold move by
Cain to woo
business sector
By TIM DUNCAN
ONLY THREE months before a state
election, the Cain government has made
an audacious pitch for the support of
the Victorian business community.
Surprisingly, Cain seems to have
achieved some success with precisely
the sort of move that business most fears
of Labor governments a state
takeover of a field occupied by private
enterprise.
The government intends to take
workers’ compensation insurance from
the private insurance industry and it is
testimony to the feelings of most
employers toward the private insurers
that the government has been told to go
right ahead.
The government is holding out to
employers a carrot worth $6OO million a
year the savings that will accrue to
employers should a proposed govern-
ment-run, single-fund workers’ com-
pensation insurance scheme come into
operation in July next year.
With a new emphasis upon
industrial safety and
rehabilitation, together
with means for collecting
premiums that are being
evaded, the government is
promising that it will be
able to offer premiums at
nearly half the current
levels and still fund
benefits to workers at
current rates without
recourse to other income.
Negotiating with im-
pressive political footwork, the govern-
ment was able to drive a wedge between
employers and the insurance industry
and then between employer repres-
entatives and individual companies.
Aware that workers’ compensation pre-
miums were looming larger than wage
rises, Cain and Treasurer Rob Jolly
cajoled and threatened the business
community to get its support for the
new scheme before the election.
That agreement was given, mainly
through the channel of the Business
Council of Australia. Triumphant, the
government waved around the names of
its new-found friends including Bill
Dix, of Ford; Chuck Chapman, of GM-
H; Geoff Allen, of the Business Coun-
cil; Sir Roderick Carnegie, of CRA.
Geoffrey Allen
Allen was private
secretary and adviser to
former Liberal Federal
Opposition leader Billy
Snedden. Business had
been told that, if it did not
accept the idea of a
government takeover of
the workers’ compensation
industry, it could forget the
prospect of reforms to the
system and thus premium
relief.
The Business Council
held out on the principle
that it could not agree to a government
monopoly. But, after a series of
meetings five major consultations
between the government and the Busi-
ness Council in the first week of
December the government put up a
face-saver that allowed private insurers
to tender for the administrative business
of the new monopoly,
The main players on the Business
Council accepted the idea, even though
the face-saver still removes the private
insurance industry from the competitive
provision of workers’ compensation in-
surance. The government won round
one and it was left to Victorian Opposi-
tion leader Jeff Kennett to accuse the
Business Council of having failed in its
first big test of principle and for the

insurers to accuse the big business
players of having almost exactly
repeated the toadying performance that
brought them into so much disrepute in
wider business circles during the federal
economic summit last year.
But the package that has attracted
the support of the big companies is still
very much in its infancy. The holes in it
are so large and so obvious that the
government risks paying a high price
for the support of some unreliable new
friends. For there is no guarantee that
the government will be able to get its
scheme into operation. If it does not,
after proclaiming that long-term
economic strategy depends upon
making some headway in the vital
workers’ compensation area, its credi-
bility as economic manager will be at
risk.
The new scheme is projected to be
fully funded over 10 years. According to
Richard Cumpston, consulting actuary
for E. S. Knight and Co, it will be only
partially funded for the first five years.
This means that the government will set
the premiums too low to fund the
benefits to injured workers fully.
The Bulletin asked the government’s
consulting actuary, David Orford, of
Financial Synergy, about the problems
in projecting into the second five years,
when the institutional reforms involving
Ford’s Bill Dix
CRA’s Sir Roderick Carnegie
industrial safety and rehabilitation
could be expected to produce lower
levels of claims. He replied: “The
greatest problem is assessing the
relationship between inflation and the
level of benefits.”
This is where the unions come in (or,
more aptly, perhaps, where the unions
do not come in). The business
representatives contacted by The
Bulletin all said that they had negotiated
with the government on the assumption
that the government had a solid basis of
understanding with the unions. Such an
understanding is implied in the wording
of the government package documents
and it seems manifest in the govern-
ment’s consistent statements to the effect
that it does not consider the current
level of benefits to be excessive.
.there’s nothing milder than Ransom
RA2CSB
CC622/81


GM-H’s Chuck Chapman
Yet central to the package is the
government’s commitment to move the
system away from lump sum claims for
compensation determined through
common law settlement. The lump sum
is sacred in union circles - even though
most injured workers would be better
oflf accepting periodic, pension-style
payments. But determining the lump
sum is a lengthy process and it puts a
great deal of money into the pockets of
lawyers and doctors involved in the
legal ceremonies. It should follow that
doing away with the lump sum would
limit the involvement of the middle-
men, thus making the system cheaper
for employers and providing more
security for injured workers.
However, the package does not pro-
perly cost, nor anywhere explain, the
result of moving the bulk of the system
to periodic payments.
Take the case of an injured worker
with a wife and two children who can
expect the statutory limit of $265 a week
or its lump sum equivalent of around
$130,000 under the current system. The
new package does not address the pro-
blem of the setting of his new weekly
payment. But it is understood that, in
return for giving up workers’ common
law rights to initiate proceedings for a
lump sum equivalent, the Trades Hall
Council wants the abolition of the
statutory ceiling together with the pro-
cedures for the adjudication of payment
levels removed from the political arena.
The council is pushing hard for a
periodic payment after injury at 100
percent of a worker’s wage. At average
weekly earnings of $385 a week, the
system may produce an increase in
benefits. Since the council still wants to
retain common law rights for lump sum
payments in compensation for pain and
since there will be no controls over
court awards, it is quite possible that
lump sums will quickly inflate as well.
It seems that much of the key
negotiation is still to come. Business
circles, for instance, have assumed that
periodic payments will be set at 75
percent of a worker’s previous wage.
With opposing views such as these, it is
not clear how the determination of
payment levels can be removed from
the political process. Less clear is how
workers can be shunted through the
system. The new package has not ad-
dressed procedures for medical adjudi-
cation, nor how a worker fit for work
again can be tempted back to the daily
grind when he or she gets a high
percentage of his wage for being
injured.
The system is predicated on reduc-
tion of claims by 10 percent over 10
years and on holding down the cost of
each claim through rehabilitation
measures. Critics point to the recent
record of public sector rehabilitation in
New South Wales, which has managed
to return to the work-force fewer than
50 of about 6800 referrals in 1982-83.
As for accident and claims preven-
tion, this also seems to be open-ended.
If the new scheme increases benefits as a
result of high periodic payments and

the pain won’t

inadequate termination procedures,
every clause of the proposed Industrial
Health and Safety Act may be required
to stem the potential flow of eager new
clients.
When Cain introduced the package
to a packed meeting of metal trades
industrialists last week, he said that it
marked his government as one yet again
prepared to make the tough decisions to
bring Victoria back to life. Yet, over the
past three years of the Cain govern-
ment, the average cost of claims has
almost trebled.
The government itself has been
directly responsible for much of this rise
through such moves as doubling lump
sum benefits for maiming and then
indexing them and through defining
partial incapacity as total if suitable
employment cannot be provided.
The business community, having at
first agreed to play the game and to
sacrifice private insurance is ready for
the five years of promised low pre-
miums. But there is the feeling that,
without some further tough decisions
this time involving the unions the low
premiums will not last.
Already there are signs of confusion
in employer ranks. There are murmurs
from members of the Business Council
of Australia to the effect that its
negotiators provided in-principle agree-
ment to a package that has yet to be
proved viable.
Meanwhile, other states are watch-
ing. If Cain does produce an agreement
with the union movement that
employers find acceptable, South
Australia and New South Wales will
move to displace the private insurance
industry from their workers’ compensa-
tion schemes. □
A SOUND thrashing may be endorsed
by the older school as a chastening
(even an enlightening) experience,
thoroughly beneficial to the recipient.
But when should the punishment stop?
Have these West Indian cricketers not
taught us an adequate lesson? Is not this
Caribbean dictatorship of Clive Lloyd
and his breathtaking brethren altogether
too much? Is not their dominance
threatening the very existence of Test
cricket?
Lloyd, super cricketer and super
diplomat, replies in three words: “No
way, man.”
The “Groover” has played a straight
bat to the first delivery and is ready to
score: “Do you think Martina
Navratilova and John McEnroe are bad
for tennis? Were Bjorn Borg and Chris
Evert-Lloyd? And what about
Muhammad Ali? It could hardly be said
he was bad for boxing.”
Lloyd is a very convincing man, on
and off the field, but by drawing such
analogies he is tacitly admitting -
knowingly or otherwise - that time will
be the leveller. Certainly, Navratilova
and McEnroe are valid superstars. But
Borg has departed, Evert-Lloyd was
dethroned years ago, and Ali ran his
race to an unhappy end.
Time - and the rest of the cricketing
world will catch up with the
West Indies, too, eventually.
It is a matter of cycles, say
some of our cricketing
notables...
Dennis Lillee describes as
“very difficult but not imposs-
ible” the assignment of
overcoming the Windies’
might. He said: “Teams come
and go, as will this current
West Indies dominance. But
other countries can’t just sit
back and wait for it to
happen. The job has to be
tackled and tackled now.
“Other teams must fight it
out on the immediate in-
ternational front and, at the
same time, be planning
thoroughly and deeply a
resurgence at their own
national level. For example, I
know that in New Zealand
they are encouraging fast
bowlers at the grassroots level
by introducing top in-
ternational coaches to assist their young
quicks.
“It has come time for the Australian
Cricket Board to employ specialists in
every field of cricket.
“From my experience, coaching in
Australia has been largely on a hit-and-
miss basis.”
Rodney Marsh, Lillee’s long-time
“accomplice,” says history is all against
one nation dominating international
cricket in the long term.
Marsh said: “The human factor is
most important in this discussion. While
it’s tantamount to cheating, I’m sure
that on future tours the Windies will
find more and more wickets being
prepared to suit batting and spin rather
than fast bowling. These tactics have
been used before and there’s no reason
why it shouldn’t happen again.
“In the end, the West Indies fast
bowler is going to get pretty sick and
tired of finding that the only place he
can extract real life from a wicket is at
home and perhaps at the WACA
ground in Perth.
“At the moment, the Windies have a
brilliant bloke at the helm but they’re
about to lose him. They may also lose
Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Gor-
don Greenidge in the near future.
“I think another point to remember
is the multi-racial composition of the
West Indies as a country. I’ve toured
there and I’m aware of the in-fighting,
on the cricket scene and elsewhere.
“The cool diplomacy of Lloyd has
kept the lid on that and the harmony he
has insisted on within the team is largely
responsible for their outstanding suc-
cess.”
Former Test batsman Norm O’Neill
said: “No team can dominate forever


and in time things will change. But
meanwhile, all other cricketing nations
should be doing everything in their
power to overcome a mighty side.
“The general public to this stage
have been tolerant but they are not
going to be turning up in their
thousands to see an Australian side
repeatedly thrashed.
“To think that Australia and
England will fight out an Ashes series in
England next year which is virtually for
second place grates a bit. In this Ashes
series, the two sides will virtually be
fighting for the right to say they are the
second-best team in international
cricket.
“It’s really time Australia and
England started to mount a
serious challenge to the,West
Indian supremacy.”
John Benaud, former Test
batsman, said: “It is certainly
true that the West Indies are
the best and most powerful
professional cricket team in
the world at the moment. In
fact, they are so professional
that at times I’m not so certain
they play within the spirit of
the game.
“Certainly, they play
within the framework of the
rules. But watch them when
they get into trouble. They
slow the game down. Overs
take longer to get through.
There are constant field
changes. Players are also too
often leaving the field.
“Then there’s all this short-
pitched bowling. I’m not
squealing on behalf of the
Australians but to bowl
bouncers to guys like Robert
Holland and Terry Alderman
really shouldn’t be on.
“I think the treatment
Malcolm Marshall dished out to Aider-
man on the final day of the Brisbane
Test was spiteful in the extreme. Here
was a guy who really can’t bat much,
who had been hit a sickening blow in
the ribs the night before when he was
sent in as a night watchman hit again in
the same place very first ball the next
morning.
“Yes, all in the framework of the
rules but...
“The problem for the other nations is
not so much the West Indies’ strength as
their own weakness. Like everything
else, this will change.”
Richie Benaud: “I think it’s
ridiculous to say the West Indies are
ruining Test cricket. You could say they
are ruining the reputations of opposi-
tion players and dominating Test
cricket but that is what all teams try to
do. It is just that the West Indies do it
better at the moment.
“I have a tremendous regard for their
ability and demeanor. It is up to the
cricketers of all other countries to come
up with a way of beating them.
“Their technique is to make their
runs fast and to bowl either short or in
the blockhole at great pace. Good luck
to them for having found tactics to
dominate the game in the same way as
other captains and players have
dominated it over the years.
“They are not unbeatable but they
play with enormous confidence in their
own ability and they are magnificent
cricketers.
“Throughout cricket history, when
one team has dominated the game,
others have found a way to combat
The Windies strike again and Graeme Wood heads for the pavilion
them and in the end defeat them. That
will happen again but we must not
forget that this is one of the greatest
possibly the greatest team we have
seen.
“The one area in which I disagree
with them and vehemently so is in
their repeated statements that the very
slow over rates which go with their
cricket and that of other modern-day
Test nations are not harming the game.
It is doing so much harm that Test
cricket is in danger of losing public
support other than in countries where
grounds are so small that a full house is
always assured.”
West Indian writer-commentator
Tony Cozier is thoroughly enjoying his
country’s spectacular supremacy and he
predicts life much life for the
Windies after Lloyd.
“It’s only natural that West Indians
should be concerned about Lloyd’s
retirement,” he said,
“He has established this team as his
own. He is leader, father figure,
nursemaid, headmaster to his players!
They not only admire and respect him -
they love him.
“Viv Richards is his obvious suc-
cessor, as dominant a personality as he
is a player. But his style of leadership
will be different in many ways. His
temperament is more volatile, more
typically West Indian,
“West Indies cricket may go through
a period of transition but the Lloyd era
has created a legacy which has set high
standards for future generations,
“The evidence is that the quality of
our cricket and our cricketers will not
diminish now.”
Lloyd compromises not at all on the
cricket field and concedes very little
when he discusses what lies ahead.
“We may or may not be the greatest
team ever,” he says. “That will always
be debated. But we reached that point
through hard training, dedication and a
will to win. We got there because of our
magnificent batting and fielding, not
just because we have four fast bowlers.”
And, if things really do go in cycles,
when will the West Indies’ reign end?
The “Groover” turns that one neatly
off his pads: “Well, people said when
some senior stars left the side in the 70s
that we would falter. They were wrong.
New, talented players got their op-
portunity. They came into a winning
combination and wanted to be part of it.
“I suppose there will come a time
when we are not as strong. But I don’t
know when.” □


AVIATION
TAA determined
to defeat the
flight engineers
Travellers stranded at Sydney’s TAA terminal by the flight engineers’ dispute
ERNIE McQUILLAN
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
FLIGHT engineers who halted most of
TAA’s flights last week will not be
allowed to win.
The government-owned airline’s
management is prepared to go to the
wire on the issue of whether aircraft
should have two or three crew members
on the flight deck, for one simple
reason: their ability to manage the
airline is at stake.
The engineers’ stoppage, which
halted TAA’s Boeing 727 s and Airbus
A3oos, overshadowed the action of the
mainly female members of the flight
attendants’ association who declared
guerilla warfare not only on TAA but
also on Ansett.
The actions of both unions isolated
them from the mainstream of the union
movement by popular standards their
members are fat cats and hardly
overworked.
Even though last week the Aviation
portfolio was in the process of being
transferred from Kim Beazley to Peter
Morris, there was no comfort for the
strikers from the government. Beazley
slammed the engineers and Morris, who
has faced problems of technology in
other sectors of the transport industry,
endorsed Beazley’s action.
Finally, the flight engineers received
a tongue-lashing from the normally
mild-mannered chairman of the Flight
Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal,
Justice Peter Coldham, a wartime (and
decorated) pilot and former academic.
Coldham dismissed any pretensions
the engineers had a case with the
scathing cut that they represented
“double-think” and the “darker side of
industrial unionism in Australia today.”
The basic issue the future of flight
engineers on automated aircraft, was a
management prerogative and not
negotiable, Coldham told them.
TAA general manager Captain
Frank Ball took a swipe at his opposite
number, Ansett boss Sir Peter Abeles.
Ball said a letter from Abeles to the
engineers pledging that Ansett would
use them on any bigger aircraft had
helped lead to the strike against TAA.
The existence of the letter was first
reported in The Bulletin.
Flight engineers are trained and
licensed engineers who began as ground
crew and who monitor systems on many
older airliners. The work they do lends
itself to automation. For new aircraft
apart from the Boeing 747 every
airliner being built or on the drawing
boards has dropped them in favor of a
two-pilot crew with computers handling
the monitoring that human engineers
did.
The problem came to a head in the
twin-engined, twin-aisle Boeing 767
which carries about 200 passengers.
Ansett bowed to pressure and agreed
to modify its five 7675, at considerable
cost, to include engineers in the crew.
Qantas refused to do this for the ones it
has on order and stared down the
engineers’ threats.
TAA is lookng at a replacement for
its DC9s and probably its Boeing 727 s
as well. The four types under considera-
tion all have been built for two-man
crews and do not come with a feather
bed for a third.
In any case, as Ball reminded the
rebel engineers last week, a selection
has not been made and the aircraft are
still about three years off being put into
service.
The action of the engineers seeking
to force a cast-iron agreement out of
TAA now means that the engineers are
seeking to put a spoke into the freedom
of TAA’s management and the airline’s
board, the commission, to choose the
equipment they want.
Last week, TAA was maintaining a
truncated schedule by flying its DC9s
and Fokker Friendships which do not
have engineers in their crews. However,
the airline was losing an estimated $4
million revenue a week.
Unless the strikers go back, TAA will
have to start standing down employees
who would include pilots in the A3OO
and 727 fleets as well as attendants and
ground crews who cannot adequately be
employed.
Ball indicated last week that TAA
would not be deterred from this action
if the need arose, although other in-
dustry unions predicted that stand-
downs would halt the entire airline. □
THE LAW
New deal for
de facto couples
on the way
By WILLA McDONALD
MANY DE FACTO couples will get
property and financial rights similar to
those of married people under unique
legislation to take effect in New South
Wales in 1985. The new laws also will
give maintenance for parents of the
children of de facto relationships in
some circumstances.
The De Facto Relationships Act,
together with five amending Acts, fol-
lows almost exactly the recommenda-
tions of the NSW Law Reform Commis-
sion in its 1983 report on de facto
relationships. That report said that state
laws lagged behind the growing inci-
dence and acceptance of de facto
relationships in society relationships
which fall outside the jurisdiction of the
Family Law Act.
In 1982, 4.7 percent of all couples in
Australia were living in de facto
relationships. About 116,200 such
couples lived in NSW. The number of
these relationships had grown markedly

What, you may ask, has a Chameleon got to do with
Toyota Tercel?
Quite a lot actually.
You see, the Chameleon is an amazingly versatile reptile
that has the remarkable ability to adapt to its environment.
So does the Tercel.
It's smart enough to be seen at some of the best places,
and tough enough to handle some of the worst roads.
With nifty front-wheel-drive that easily
changes to all-wheel-drive, while still moving.
All combined with Toyota Suspension Tuning.
Tercel has style and comfort, and is rugged and reliable.
With a surprising amount of passenger and luggage room.
To prove how versatile it is, Tercel has won praise from
around the world. From desert to snow.

Oh what a feeling!


since 1976. More than 40 percent of
people living in a de facto relationship
were over 30 years of age. Almost 60
percent of the relationships had lasted
for at least two years and more than one
in three de facto couples had dependent
children.
But these people could not rely on
NSW judges to find ways around
antiquated statutes.
As Professor Ron Sackville, chair-
man of the Law Reform Commission,
put it, disputes between de facto couples
were treated in some areas as if they
were between strangers.
The lack of objections to the new Act
is the result of Sackville’s efforts. He
approached all the groups likely to have
strong views on or objections to the
legislation and notified them of the
proposed reforms, asking for comments
and suggestions.
The Act’s acceptance was con-
ditional, with both politicians and lobby
groups, on preserving a clear distinction
between marriage and de facto
relationships.
For this reason, the Act confines the
court’s power to determine property
rights to:
■ De facto relationships of at least
two years or
■ Where the couple has a child or
■ Where the applicant has made
John Wade: blurred distinction
substantial contributions, directly or
indirectly financial or otherwise to
the couple’s property or
■ Where there is a child, the applic-
ant has made a substantial contribution
to the family as homemaker or parent
■ And where failure of the court to
ma k e a n order would result in serious
injustice to the applicant.
The Act provides for maintenance by
one de facto partner for another but
only in very limited circumstances
where he or she is in need and:
■ The union has produced a child
under 12 years of age or a handicapped
child under 16 and looking after the
child prevents the parent from working
or
■ Where the relationship has affected
the applicant’s ability to earn an income
and maintenance would help him or her
undertake a re-training course (but here
the payments are available for a maxi-
mum of three years).
According to John Wade, senior
lecturer in Law at Sydney University,
the distinction between marriage and de
facto relationships - particularly con-
cerning maintenance will be blurred
in practice, not because of the wording
of the Act (which does set different
criteria for the court to take into ac-
count) but because the Family Court
has also been applying the provisions of
the Family Law Act on the basis that
dependence of one spouse on the other
should not be encouraged.
Defining when a de facto relation-
ship exists or begins may prove
challenging for the courts but
administrators in areas such as social

Every year we blend the best from the three best wine-growing regions and


security already face such questions
daily.
The Act and accompanying, amend-
ing legislation also allow de facto
couples:
■ Who have lived together for at
least three years to adopt a child related
by blood to one of them,
■ To claim for mental and nervous
shock on the injury or death of a
partner,
■ To have “nearest relative” rights if
a spouse needs medical help and
■ For personal protection, for one de
facto partner to obtain an injunction
against the other barring him or her
from entering specified places including
the home.
One of the most important reforms
allows the survivor of a de facto
relationship to claim the same share of
the estate as a married person could
where his or her spouse died intestate.
Further, where the deceased was still
married at the time of death but had
lived with his or her de facto partner for
the previous two years, the de facto
partner becomes entitled to claim on the
estate instead of the legal spouse.
Previously, where a man left his wife to
move in with another woman but died
five years later without leaving a will,
his widow would inherit a share of his
estate automatically and his de facto
Ron Sackville: groundwork
partner would have to apply to the court
for her share. That situation is being
reversed.
One important omission from the
Act relates to guardianship, custody and
maintenance of children. The High
Court decided recently that the Family
court does not have the jurisdiction to
deal with children born outside of a
marriage, despite recent amendments to
try to overcome that problem. Ex-
nuptial children remain under state
jurisdiction.
The decision merely confirmed the
disastrous situation which has existed
for years whereby one family might
have children who had to be dealt with
in different courts.
The commission refused to consider
new state legislation in the area, on the
basis that the commonwealth eventually
would take over powers in respect of
these children.
Victoria, NSW and South Australia
are expected to agree to such a transfer
but not Queensland. Which way Tas-
mania will swing is not clear.
Western Australia is in the unusual
situation where its state courts
administer the Family Law Act, having
come to that arrangement with the
federal government when the law was
introduced.
It has always been understood that
the federal government will accept the
reference of powers individually from
the states without needing to wait for all
of them to agree a necessary step
toward reform begun by the NSW
parliament. □

THE ARTS
Women in love with art
paint a tough picture
Women are playing an increasingly dominant role in the uncertain business of art sales.
But , as LENORE NICKLINfinds out, they sometimes boast an advantage denied
their male counterparts a rich husband.
WHILE Christie’s auctioneer Susan
Hewitt was knocking down a Conrad
Martens watercolor to Robert Holmes a
Court for a record $lOO,OOO, Shirley
Wagner of Wagner Galleries was in
Tokyo arguing with Japanese customs
over whether or not an Arthur Boyd
etching was obscene. Roslyn Oxley of
the Roslyn Oxley Galleries was packing
her bags for New York where five of her
artists are having an exhibition at the
Guggenheim Museum.
Eileen Chanin of the Macquarie
Galleries was selling a Bill Brown to a
Sydney collector and Celia Winter-
Irving, who runs Australia’s only com-
mercial sculpture gallery, was chasing
out of the sculpture garden the neigh-
borhood drunk who likes to recite
Henry Lawson.
Ann Lewis was lying on a beach at
Vanuatu. A former chairman of the Vis-
ual Arts Board, Lewis ran Gallery A for
nearly 20 years before closing it down
last year. She has bought a loft in New
York and after a year off plans to return
to the visual arts scene next year.
Fifteen years ago Rudy Komon,
Kym Bonython and Barry Stern were
the names that dominated Sydney's art-
dealing world. Increasingly women
have taken over. Since Komon’s death
in 1982 Gwen Frolich has run his
Paddington gallery, which was recently
bought by Brisbane dealer Ray Hughes;
Bonython has returned to Adelaide and
only Stern survives.
Susan Hewitt was the first woman
auctioneer for Christie’s anywhere in
the world. She joined the company in
1969, took over the running of the Aus-
tralian office in 1975 and conducted her
first auction in 1976. Christie’s now has
women auctioneers in America, but
none in Britain. Hewitt had no formal
training for her job. She worked for
Lady Casey when he was Governor-
General. Lady Casey was both artist
and collector and Lord Casey was
godfather to Major William Spowers, a
Christie’s director and auctioneer.
Hewitt conducts a sale in a brisk, no-
nonsense fashion. There is no coaxing.
Susan Hewitt: brisk, no-nonsense selling
JOHN ELLIOTT
“The English style is that the people at-
tending the auction have done their
homework, they have made their own
assessment of the work,” she said.
“They have a catalogue. They can see. It
is an Australian style to talk about ‘the
lovely gold frame’. ” The important
thing, she says, is to keep the pace going
if the gaps are too long, the
auctioneer loses control.
In the last four years she has seen the
work of colonial and turn-of-the-cen-
tury Australian artists double in price.
“Everything jumped from $50,000 to
$lOO,OOO there was never any creep-
ing up,” she said. “It was most extra-
ordinary. A Fred McCubbin that
Christie’s sold in 1969 for $5OOO sold for
$40,000 in 1974 and last year was sold
again for more than double that.”
The recent auction of the Raven col-
lection - which included the $lOO,OOO
Conrad Martens - was the first since
1978 when Christie’s discontinued reg-
ular sales of Australian paintings be-
cause of “a lack of quantity in quality
pictures.” Hewitt’s main job is sending
material overseas for auction in London
and New York nearly $3 million
worth so far this year.
Eileen Chanin and Roslyn Oxley are
among the most aggressive of the new
gallery dealers. Chanin, vivacious and
high-chic, majored in both fine arts and
archaeology at Sydney University.
When she turned up at her first dig
wearing a bikini and ballroom gloves,
some of her colleagues felt she had no
serious future as an archaeologist.
She ended up agreeing with them
and on graduating, got a job with the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney’s oldest
commercial gallery. After some months
of stamp-licking and coffee-making she
quit, only to be invited back as a
partner. Five years later, in 1978, she
took over. Two years ago she moved the
gallery from King Street to glossy new
split-level premises in Clarence Street.
She has kept the best of the old Mac-
quarie artists, among them Lloyd Rees,
Brian Dunlop and H. F. Weaver Haw-
kins, introduced interesting young ones
such as Idris Murphy, Bernard Ollis,
Trevor Weekes and Bo Jones and at-
tracted established artists such as Colin
Lanceley, Fred Cress, Bill Brown and
Alun Leach-Jones
Chanin, who is married to Sydney
lawyer Adrian Morris, has a staff of two
and puts on 12 to 16 exhibitions a year.
As many as 200 to 300 people attend an
opening. However, she says, 80 percent
of the people who visit a gallery are
“just looking.” Her customers are pri-
vate collectors and public galleries.
Apart from exhibitions she does a lot of
selling from a well-stocked back room,
which in any month will contain a
$35,000 Lloyd Rees, a $24,000 Colin
Lanceley, a $12,000 Alun Leach-Jones
or a $15,000 Salvatore Zofrea.
Like most dealers, she charges a 40
percent commission. “Buying the gal-
lery was probably the bravest thing I
ever did - nobody in their right mind
runs a gallery,” she said. “I don’t have
any private capital and I bought it on
the assumption that if it was run proper-
ly and the artists were good, there was


Eileen Chanin: 'Nobody in their right mind runs a gallery’
DAVID WALLACE
no reason why it shouldn’t be a success-
ful proposition.”
Frequently however the red “sold”
stickers are few and far between. Fewer
than half the exhibitions show a profit.
“So often the work you are showing is a
step ahead of the public,” said Chanin.
“It’s just not a profit-making business.”
The work at the Roslyn Oxley Gal-
lery is often two steps ahead of the pub-
lic. Two years ago, an exhibition of
paintings by Juan Davila so upset that
well-known guardian of morals, the Rev
Fred Nile, that the gallery received a
visit from the Vice Squad. Oxley, dis-
tinguished by a mane of red hair, is the
daughter of the Sydney retailer Sir John
Walton and is married to Tony Oxley, a
member of the family which founded
Bushells. (In New York, women who
run galleries tend to have extremely
wealthy lovers, in Sydney they tend to
have wealthy husbands.)
Oxley worked as an interior designer
in Sydney and New York before open-
ing her gallery in March, 1982. She is
extremely hard-working and ambitious
there is nothing of the dilettante
about her. The gallery occupies the
ground floor of a former tobacco store
and is one of the largest in Australia.
(The owners of the building are artists
Tony Coleing and Ma Grounds, who
live in the loft areas above.)
Oxley studied design at the East Syd-
ney Technical College and painted for
eight years, “but I was a much better
designer than painter.” She and her hus-
band have lived in New York, Paris and
India.
“I’ve always been interested in art
and in the last 20 years I’ve been to all
the Biennales around the world and all
the big exhibitions. My main interest
has always been very contemporary art.
I always felt I had quite a good eye for
young artists. I think I’ve only ever
bought one art work by an established
artist. I’m not just interested in young
artists but in watching their develop-
ment, the way they mature.
“Young artists are not drinking, not
smoking dope, not dropping out and
are very together in the head. They are a
clean, ambitious bunch who work very
hard.
“I don’t run the gallery like a shop -
I couldn’t bear it to be just a shop - and
I make it difficult for myself because I
show a lot of difficult imagery." The gal-
lery is not yet making a profit but, says
Oxley, “it’s going to we’re busting our
guts to make a profit.” (It is an attitude
that sometimes loses her friends among
artists.) Like Chanin she charges 40 per-
cent commission.
She has a staff of one and puts on 15
three-week exhibitions a year, some of
them one-man shows, some showing the
work of four or five artists. She is proud
of the fact that 10 of the 18 Australian
artists whose work was shown at the
Museum of Modern Art in Paris last
year were hers and Oxley artists are
again to the fore in the current show at
the Guggenheim.
Dale Frank, Jenny Watson, Mandy
Martin, Mike Parr and Ken Unsworth
are among the artists who show their
work at her gallery.
Oxley scoffed at the idea that the
ownership of an art gallery is a quick
trip to fame and prestige. “Maybe it’s a
quick trip to fame but you’d have to be
an idiot to want it that way,” she said.
“It’s amazingly hard work.”
Celia Winter-Irving’s sculpture gal-
lery is in the inner Sydney suburb of
Glebe. It occupies the ground floor and
gardens of a large Victorian mansion,
National Trust classified, which is also
her home. Her husband, Philip Thomp-
son, is a partner in the gallery.
“The visual arts market is highly
competitive and selling sculpture is like
selling refrigerators to Eskimos,” she
says.
Winter-Irving is also a practising
sculptor and works in welded metal.
She discovered sculpture during four
years as director of public relations at
the Power Institute of Contemporary
Art at Sydney University. One day she
wandered over to the welding sheds at
the university, where the sculptor Ma
Grounds was working, and minutes
later was wearing a helmet and
brandishing a welding iron. She opened
the Irving Sculpture Gallery in 1982.
Roslyn Oxley: difficult imagery means It's not always profitable
ERNIE McOUILLAN


Celia Winter-Irving: No need to feed or water sculptures
Shirley Wagner: obscenity a problem in Japan
She puts on eight shows a year, each
show lasting five weeks. Sculpture exhi-
bitions take a lot of setting up. Most of
her exhibitors teach sculpture. Clem
Meadmore, who has been living in Am-
erica for 20 years, was the only sculptor
she could think of to make a living out
of sculpture.
Prices range from $3OO to $lO,OOO
and the work includes large free-stand-
ing sculptures, small table and wall
pieces, prints, drawings and collages.
Last year Winter-Irving launched the
Rent-a-Sculpture scheme which she sees
as a painless way of getting people to
live with and love sculpture. She would
like to see the greenery in so many
institutional foyers replaced by sculp-
ture.
“The great thing about sculpture is
that you never have to feed it or water it
and you never have to call in the vet,”
she says.
Her most successful sculptors in-
clude Michael LeGrand and Jan King,
who both work in welded metal and
Lyn Moore who works with a chain saw
to produce large Easter-Island-like
totems. (In a recent group show, seven
of the nine sculptors were women.)
Winter-Irving runs the gallery with a
staff of one, Ben McKay, the son of
sculptor lan McKay. “There needs to be
a great sense of vocation,” she says, with
considerable feeling.
Gisella Scheinberg has been running
the Holdsworth Galleries for 15 years.
Asked if the gallery made a profit she
laughed and said in her thick
Hungarian accent, “You’re joking I
can only afford it because my husband
is looking after me.” (Her husband,
Albert Scheinberg, co-founder of Stocks
Gisella Scheinberg: “expensive exercise”
and Holdings, has extensive property,
retail and manufacturing interests.)
Scheinberg says she runs the gallery
because she loves it. Its aim is to intro-
duce artists to the market. “But it is a
very, very expensive exercise. The mar-
ket is so uneven. Even if you have a
successful exhibition one month, the
next one wipes it out.” She had her best
year three years ago and says you need
10 years to establish yourself.
Her artists include Robert Dicker-
son, Sali Hermann and Ray Crooke.
She charges 33 percent commission
“You build up hostility from the artist if
you charge more.” She puts on 30 exhi-
bitions a year, works seven days a week
and does not give herself a salary. How
much had the gallery lost over 15 years?
“Ask my husband,” she said.
In 1976, Shirley Wagner of the Wag-
ner Gallery in Paddington, took an
exhibition of Pro Hart paintings to
Hong Kong. Of the 35 paintings, all but
nine sold and Wagner has since or-
ganised exhibitions by David Boyd,
Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd in
Hong Kong and by Pro Hart, Charles
Blackman and Arthur Boyd in Tokyo.
She travels overseas two or three times a
year and has established a connection
with a gallery in New York.
The current Arthur Boyd exhibition
in Japan is minus an etching which
Japanese customs officers decided was
obscene.
At first they wanted to confiscate five
of the Boyd etchings which are based on
the Narcissus myth, but after Wagner
explained who both Narcissus and
Arthur Boyd were, they agreed to
release four of them. Several of the S400
etchings and three of the paintings —
one for $15,000 — have since been sold.
Wagner opened her first gallery, The
Barefoot Gallery, in the northern Syd-
ney beach suburb of Avalon in 1969 and
moved to less casual premises in Pad-
dington in 1978. She studied drawing
and painting with Francis Lymburner
and completed a fine arts course at
Swinbourne College in Melbourne. She
charges 33 percent commission and says
the gallery has always made a profit,
despite its ups and downs.
“It’s a very unstable business,” she
says, “but I show paintings that are very
saleable.” Most are figurative and a cur-
rent mixed exhibition includes work by
Nolan, Blackman, Norman Lindsay,
Ray Crooke, Robert Dickerson and the
lesser known Peter Moller, Susan Sheri-
dan and Bernd Heinrich. □

FILMS
Becalmed
in a sea
of quality
By SANDRA HALL
THE MOST artistically respectable ad-
jectives can rightly be applied to
Desmond Davis’ new film of Edna
O’Brien’s 1960 novel The Country Girls.
It is sensitive, lyrical and done with a
proper concern for the story’s essential
Irishness. Yet, this sense of artistic
propriety means that it fails to catch the
quirky spiritedness of O’Brien’s prose.
This was the book which made her
name as a novelist. She was 28 years of
age when she wrote it and the novel
made an immediate impression with its
perfectly pitched blend of wholesome-
ness and acuteness of observation and
with the vitality of its characters Kate
and Baba, the convent girls
from County Clare who are
eager to grow up and take on
the world - or, at least, as
much of it as they can get their
hands on.
Davis and O’Brien have
brought these two to the
screen before in their 1963
film The Girl with Green Eyes
(from the sequel to The
Country Girls), with Rita
Tushingham as the dreamy
Kate and Lynn Redgrave as
the bossy daredevil Baba.
While the presence of two
such distinctive English ac-
tresses inevitably meant that
the story was stripped of
much of its Irishness, it also
lent the film the sort of verve
and humor that this new effort
lacks for all its well regulated
charm.
However, it certainly looks
and sounds right. Done on
location in County Wicklow,
it has settings which suggest
both the beauty and the
claustrophobia of O’Brien’s
Ireland while its two talented
unknowns - Jill Doyle and
Maeve Germaine (who looks
like a younger Jane Asher)
are never less than interesting
as Baba and Kate.
Also present is Sam Neill,
in a cool and bloodless reprise
of his performance in the
television series Reilly, Ace of
Spies, as Kate’s calculating lover Mr
Gentleman.
Kate is clever, Baba is spoiled and
strongwilled and indulged by easy-
going parents who take on Kate as well
after her mother dies in a drowning
accident. Her drunken father does not
much like this but cannot pull himself
together to do anything about it, so the
girls go off to a convent boarding school
which Kate tolerates in the hope of
learning something until Baba succeeds
in getting them both expelled.
Abandoning her ambitions for an
education, Kate then settles for life in a
Dublin boarding house with Baba and a
job as a shop assistant while the preda-
tory Mr Gentleman continues to hover,
offering dinners out and a holiday in
Vienna.
It is a slight story strung together
anecdotally with a strong feeling for
subsidiary characters and a fine eye and
ear for the nuances of Irish village life.
But the film leaves you feeling rather
like one of its characters becalmed
and as if all the action were going on
elsewhere.
IN HIS LAST film, the elegantly dis-
cursive La Nuit de Varennes, Ettore
Sam Nelli and Maeve Germaine in The Country Girls
Scola used a particular incident in
history Louis XlV’s and Marie
Antoinette’s abortive flight from Paris
in 1792 to draw parallels between past
and present and make observations
about the nature of political change.
Similar parallels are in his new film,
Le Bal, but he has abandoned the
sophisticated literate style which served
him so well before to make a film
entirely without dialogue.
Le Bal is a sort of political pageant
played out in song and dance in swiftly
changing scenes from half a century in
the life of a Parisian dance hall.
Adapted from a stage work by the
Theatre du Campagnol in Paris, it uses
popular music not so much nostalgic-
ally as historically and satirically to
evoke the political flavor of each era
beginning in the 30s with the rise of
fascism and its French antithesis the
Popular Front, moving through the war
years and the Occupation and on to
post-war Americanisation and the
student riots of 1968.
As solemn as all that may sound, it is
not. One of Scola’s great gifts is his
lightness of touch and Le Bal skims
along in an allusive and irreverent way,
theatricality offset by the worldliness of
the humor.
The first few moments set
the tone as the dance hall
gradually fills with patrons,
each sweeping up to the
mirror for reassurances about
the quality of the image about
to be presented to the world.
Their attitude is combative
and tentative all at once. They
are about to compete in a
ritual which mimics, in spirit,
the larger and bloodier con-
tests in the world outside.
The music comes from
everywhere. As well as songs
by Charles Aznavour, Gilbert
Becaud and Charles Trenet,
along with the obligatory ac-
cordion music, there is Irving
Berlin, Glenn Miller, Count
Basie and on to The Beatles.
The dancers foxtrot, rhumba,
tango, jive and boogie and
each of the dances contains a
vignette mimed with such
verve by Scola’s cast of actor-
dancers (some of them from
the Theatre du Campagnot)
that the absence of dialogue is
never an issue. Le Bal is as
witty as it is spectacular.
The Country Girls: in Sydney
at the Academy, Paddington;
in Melbourne at the Brighton
Bay; in Canberra at the
Electric Shadows.
Le Bal: in Melbourne at the
Longford. Soon for other states.


PRESENTING THE 1984 GRAND
PRIX WINNER. NIKON FA.
In Japan, there are probably more camera critics and experts per capita than
anywhere else in the world.
And recently, some of the most demanding of those critics got together to judge
over 60 of Japan’s newest cameras.
They mercilessly - and objectively - judged each camera for design. For
performance. For reliability. And for ease of operation.
And when it was all over, the first-ever Grand Prix Camera Award went to the
Nikon FA. But although this was the first-ever Grand Prix award, it wasn’t the first ever
award for the FA.
Because in Great Britain, it also was recently named “Practical Photography’s
Camera of the Year,” and garnered “Camera Weekly’s Award for Innovation.”
In selecting the Nikon FA for these honours, we think the judges confirmed
something professional photographers have
known all along.
Nikon is the only choice.

BOOKS
Stocking up
from humor
to superstition
By PATRICIA ROLFE
AT THIS time of year, small or smallish
books appear everywhere in bookshops
to tempt the adventurous or give succor
to the desperate gift buyer. They are
snapped up for many reasons.
One reason may be that we do not
care much if the gift is unwelcome to the
receiver as long as it is not dismissed as
boring by the rest of the gathering.
Another is that often we have no clear
idea of the tastes of even close friends
and family. The Royal Shopping Guide
may go to someone who once wore a
Princess Di frilly blouse, The Book of
Runes to someone once foolish enough
to ask you your birth sign and Cots\yold
Privies to someone who says that he
admires British institutions.
The Royal Shopping Guide, from Pan
at $16.95, is a guided tour of more than
300 British firms which have royal
warrants from those who repair the
crown jewels to those who supply ken-
nels for corgis. At this season of good-
will, it is worth noting that suppliers of
what are called Better Presents get a
warrant but not those who supply
cheaper ones.
Superstition sells. The Book of
Runes, from Angus and Robertson at
$19.95, comes in a plastic case with its
own 25 small stones the runes by
which you increase self-wisdom and
powers of divination - and is described
as a handbook for the use of an ancient
oracle: the Viking Runes. The book is
from California, the preface by
someone at the University of Hawaii
and the runes are made in Hong Kong
by Mandarin Offset International, so
the Viking connection seems slender.
Cotswold Privies is from the reput-
able Chatto and Windus at $15.95. It is
a slice of English life that authors
Mollie Harris and Sue Chapman
wanted to carve off before it vanished
(given the general English attitude to
plumbing, they need not have hurried).
It is a subject which has been well
covered here, particularly by Hal Mis-
singham with his photographs, and for
architectural variety it is not chauvinist
to back the Australian dunny against
the English privy any time.
A large supply of Christmas joke
books comes from Australian branches
of British publishers. These publishers
wear a serious face for 11 months of the
year, offering new South American
novelists, solid biographies, all grist to
the reviewer’s busy mill. Then, in early
December, the joke books rather like
the mythical uncle at the Christmas
dinner who wears funny hats and tells
unfunny jokes turn up.
Patrick Gallagher and John Ire-
monger at Allen and Unwin will just
have settled their academic list for next
year and got the Vogel literary award
out of the way when out bursts the
Graffiti Gift Set, four paperbacks in a
slipcase and shrinkwrapped at $17.95,
giving you more graffiti than you could
find in a lifetime of visits to public
lavatories, and A Year of Boobs and
Blunders at $9.95 - both by Nigel Rees.
The busy Rees has The Joy of Cliches
from Macdonald Futura at $14.95. John
Cleese may be the other identity of
Wing-Commander Muriel Volestrang-
ler FRHS and Bar. A clue is that he
has copyright on The Golden Skits of
Volestrangler (Methuen, $11.95).
The titles of many of these books
take you back to an era of British
comedy long vanished, except when
Spike Milligan turns up at Woy Woy or
you hear ghostly voices relaying The
Goon Show on ABC radio at midday
Saturday.
Michael Joseph/Nelson have More
Spike Milligan Letters (% 19.95) and what
Milligan calls “another omnibus but not
consisting of two decks, an engine, four
wheels and sixty seats” A Potboiling
Dustbin Full of Bits, also $19.95.
Milligan is perennially popular. So is
Ronald Searle. Macmillan have his Big
Fat Cat Book in paperback at $9.95. The
hardcover sold out rapidly - 3000
in a fortnight - when it
appeared in the middle of
the year.
Angus and Robertson have
a series of imported joke
books which could be ex-
panded and the contents
reshuffled indefinitely: The
World’s Best Dirty Jokes,
More of the World’s Best Dirty
Jokes, The World’s Best Doc-
tor Jokes, The World's Best
Jewish Jokes, The World’s Best
Irish Jokes, The World’s Best
Limericks. All $4.95.
Thames and Hudson are
the last publishers from whom
you would expect jokey
books. Jessica Strang was so
taken with the übiquity and
variety of the female form
used to perform incongruous
tasks - from holding a tonne
of stones on her head for 2500
years on the Acropolis to
supporting a candle, clock or
a golf ball - that she put
together Working Women (paperback
$14.95).
The Hawaiian Shirt as an object is
something on which many people have
mixed feelings. Thomas Steele traces its
history and outlines its styles in The
Hawaiian Shirt ($23.95).
Quite devastating as a direct state-
ment is Raymond Briggs’ picture book
The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old
Iron Woman, the Falklands war relived.
Do not make a mistake and give it to the
children (but perhaps, if we want a
different world, you should). Hamish
John Cleese as Wing Commander Muriel
Volestrangler FRHS & Bar
The Old Iron Woman in Raymond Briggs’ picture book The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman


The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman
From Vanishing Vistas: A Salute to the Cocky Farmer
Hamilton, $10.95 hardcover and $5.95
soft.
Australia does its best to hold back
the flood of imported laughter. Patrick
Cook (this year: Hot and Wet, Allen
and Unwin. $6.95; More Favorite
Names for Boys and Girls, Allen and
Unwin, $4.95; and The Great Australian
Song Book, Angus and Robertson,
$19.95) could do it single-handed.
Victoria Roberts has The Book of
Meaningful Relationships (Penguin,
$5.95) cartoons, which cover any tract
of Australian territory which Cook may
have overlooked. Vanishing Vistas: A
Salute to the Cocky Farmer (Hutchin-
son, $18.95) has text and engaging
illustrations by Melbourne artist
Dougal Ramsay.
Experienced practitioner Cyril Pearl
has combined with Alan Benjamin for a
book of Limericks Down Under (Hutch-
inson, $9.95), illustrated by Tanner. As
they proclaim:
The limerick planted Down Under
Roots in a new world of wonder
Where the drink's a curse
And the vice is verse
And the dawn comes up like chunder.
John Meredith has done Learn to
Talk Old Jack Lang, A Handbook of
Australian Rhyming Slang for Kanga-
roo Press ($5.95). Meredith says that
rhyming slang did not come
with convicts or from the Lon-
don slums of the 19th century.
He accepts S. J. Baker’s idea
that it was a fad in the early
20th century. That it is alive
and growing is suggested by
mentions of Germaine Greer,
Roberta Flack and Adrian
Quist (you may find your own
rhymes).
Quaffing Quotes and Wine
Facts from the Watermark
Press came to this office with
its own bottle of red. From it:
In Spain, that land of
monks and apes,
The thing called wine doth
come from grapes;
But on the noble river Rhine
The thing called gripes doth
come from wine.
That’s Coleridge.
In Anxiety: Th£ User's
Guide (Allen and Unwin,
$7.95), Joan Flanagan has
cheery advice for every situation, in-
cluding when to worry: “It is not good
to go through life worrying about things
that may never happen ... neither is it
good to spend a major portion of your
life in intensive care.”
Flanagan’s light-hearted advice on
nuclear attack might not appeal to the
serious but who will be around after-
ward to complain? She suggests that if
you cannot avoid prime targets, move in
next to one. She lives within 50 metres
of Victoria Barracks and, she says,
judging by the hash-up of her television
reception every time they turn on their
photocopier, it would take only two
photocopiers plus the pencil sharpener
to deflect a whole squadron of enemy
missiles.
Among Better Presents (as the royals
would call them) are Hit and Ms, the
bright and clever writer Kathy Lette
linked with the bright and clever il-
lustrator Jenny Coopes (Penguin,
$5.95); the second volume of the ABC’s
Q and A, based on Margaret Throsby’s
radio program in which people find out
things they did not know or did not
even know that they didn’t know ($8.95)
and Keith Willey’s You Might As Well
Laugh, Mate, a look at where our
humor comes from mainly from hard
times, it seems (Macmillan, $22.50).
The Complete Yes Minister: Diaries of
a Cabinet Minister by the Right Hon.
James Hacker MP comes up very well,
thanks to hard work by editors
Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Jay who
have transferred the BBC TV scripts
to say nothing of acting nuances, pauses
and glances to the page. From
BBC/Pitman, $24.95.
The Duchess of Devonshire's Ball
(Sidgwick and Jackson, $34.95) recalls a


splendid occasion in London in 1897.
Author Sophia Murphy is a daughter of
the present Duke and Duchess. Almost
every guest was photographed, so we
can see what people looked like making
fools of themselves.
The Countess of Westmorland had a
huge stuffed eagle on one shoulder; one
American heiress had electric lights
woven into her hair so they would light
up the lyre she carried as Muse of
Music. The old, fat Duchess was carried
into the ballroom on a palanquin by
stout bearers.
So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,
by Douglas Adams (Pan, $4.95), is the
fourth book of what he thought was to
be a trilogy The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy.
As you could guarantee that more
people will be playing Trivial Pursuit
than singing carols this Christmas, the
small books likely to sell fastest are
Winning at Trivial Pursuit by Jeff Rovin
(Greenhouse, $3.95) and The Great
Australian Trivia Quiz Book by Vincent
Smith (Penguin, $4.95). □
MORE TIME TO LODGE
SUBMISSIONS ON ALCOHOL
ADVERTISING
The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has
extended the time available for people to
lodge submissions commenting on pro-
posed changes to standards for advertis-
ing alcohol on television.
The new closing date is now 21 January
1985.
The extension of time was agreed following
requests from various groups who wanted
to undertake research related to the pro-
posal.
Under the proposal, advertising for alcohol
would be restricted to between 8.30 pm
and 5.00 am every night of the week, and
between 12.00 mid-day and 3.00 pm on
school days - that is, it would be
restricted to the times when television
stations may show programs designed for
an adult audience.
The standards would allow corporate
sponsorship announcements - that is, not
directly promoting the product - at all
times, except during specific children’s
viewing times, in the ‘C’ hour - 4.00 to 5.00
pm Monday to Friday, and in pre-school
children’s viewing time.
To help people prepare submissions, the
Tribunal has provided relevant information
at its office in each State capital city.
Submissions must be sent to:

BOOK BULLETIN
Pop-ups from Popayan
by Patricia Rolfe
IF YOU get one of the
proliferating pop-up books
in your Christmas stock-
ing, chances are that
nimble fingers attached to
probably underpaid hands
in South America’s Col-
ombia did the tedious
gluing-in and assembly.
Almost every publisher
has something in that line
this year: Leonardo da
Vinci (Hutchinson); 77jc
Kama Sutra (Aidan Ellis)
don’t rush this one; The Roaring
Twenties (Collins); The Royal Family
(Deans); Sailing Ships and Watch It
Work: The Car (Penguin) and The Facts
of Life (Jonathan Cape). Penguin have
Playmates and Yum Yum, slot books by
British writers Janet and Allan Ahlberg,
two of their most popular and prolific
writers for children.
Designing and producing this sort of
book pop-up, slot and daisy chain are
some styles is called paper engineer-
ing. It is by no means a new thing: the
Victorians did wonderful things with
paper, from books to elaborate multi-set
theatres.
Jonathan Miller’s The Facts of Life is
in a different category and is intended
as an educational tool. Cape have
published Miller’s The Human Body. It
sold about 20,000 here and Cape expect
to double that figure with The Facts of
Life, at $17.95.
Many of these books are man-
ufactured by Inter-Visual of California.
Much of the preliminary work for The
Facts of Life was done by an origami
specialist who spent nearly 500 hours on
it. Inter-Visual are specialists in
“nesting” laying out the printed sheet
to achieve maximum “burst” in each
pop-up with the minimum number of
glue points.
The books are assembled in
Popayan, Colombia. There, the first
50,000 of any run are regarded as
dummies so that final modifications can
be made in production.
NELSON are delighted to have a new
adult novel from Ruth Park, living in
Sydney again after a long spell on
Norfolk Island. They plan to publish
Missus about the middle of the year,
with a hardback print run of at least
20,000. The book takes some of the
characters from Park’s Harp in the
South and Poor Man's Orange and deals
with their lives before the events of
The pop-up Da Vinci
those books, so it runs
from the turn of the cen-
tury to the Depression of
the 30s. “It’s what the Am-
ericans call a prequel
a dreadful word,” said
publishing director Bob
Sessions.
Harp in the South and
Poor Man ’s Orange are
constantly in print in Pen-
guin paperback, selling
around 8000 a year. Park,
according to Nelson, is
working on another adult novel and a
sequel to her highly successful young
adult’s book Playing Beatie Bow. The
South Australian Film Corporation be-
gins filming Beatie Bow in April.
AS A TRIBUTE to Australian journal-
ist Richard Hughes, for many years
based in Hong Kong, the Far Eastern
Economic Review has just published
Barefoot Reporter containing the best of
his columns in that magazine between
1971 and 1983. It will be on sale in
Australian bookshops.
PUBLICITY officers here who can
spend a couple of weeks and cover
several states in day-by-day contact
with an author on tour report that
“minders,” called publicity escorts,
have taken over the job in the United
States. In the US, only top authors ever
got anyone of consequence from their
publishers to tour with them; others
were left to fend for themselves or given
a salesman (often with unflattering com-
ments to pass about the author’s sales
potential) to do the job.
Susan Jacoby, who recently went
through the process of being minded
after publication of Wild Justice: The
Evolution of Revenge, got her own back
by recounting her experiences in
Publishers Weekly. Most of the minders,
she wrote, were from the “vast ranks
of underemployed, college-educated,
middle-aged women, never trained for
specific jobs.” Most, she found, were far
too curious about her personal life and
far too eager to talk about their own.
Minders were quite likely to aban-
don an author if a more interesting or
important one happened to be in town
at the same time.
In Detroit, she found someone laid
off at Chrysler - who was turning the
job into a profession, buying a suitable
car and passing on useful information
to the publisher in New York. □

larger than

Bette Davis in London to star in a film
on Florence Nightingale indignantly
told of her recent experience on a
United States chat show hosted by Dick
Cavett. “When exactly did you cease
being a virgin?” he asked the venerable
Bette. “When I was 26,” she rasped in
reply. “It was hell waiting.”
It had been alleged by nothing less
than the Wall Street Journal that the
next actor off the rank in the US
Presidential Stakes would be veteran
Charlton Heston. A Californian Senate
seat would be found, it was reported.
No, said Heston. “I’ve already been
president twice” (in two movies as
Andrew Jackson), “so why would I
need to run for office?”
T
Really, it’s about time somebody told
Australia the truth about those Easter
Island stone statues. They did not al-
ways look like Malcolm Fraser. The
man who discovered this scientific fact
is Sergio Rapu Haoa, Easter Island’s
governor, now visiting Sydney and
Canberra. Rapu happens to be a pro-
fessional anthropologist who was
curator of Easter Island’s museum in
1978 (as he still is) when, during a local
dig, pieces of white coral were dis-
covered which formed almond-shaped
eyes when fitted together. With them
were red lava disks. Rapu puzzled over
all this until he inserted the disks into
the centre of the coral eyes and found
that they formed “pupils” and that the
eyes and pupils fitted into the eye
sockets of broken statues that were also
unearthed in the dig. So Easter Island’s
statues did not always display that
familiar, flat stony-faced expression so
reminiscent of our former leader. The
charming Rapu is the first Easter
Islander to be appointed governor.
For some of us, the writings of Richard
Hughes will never lose their shine; not
so much because Hughes, the Hong
Kong correspondent for half the
newspapers that matter, wrote so well;
not so much because he was big,
booming and benevolent and a full,
Falstaffian figure of a fellow as because
he, his writing, his very existence were
larger and more entertaining than life.
Both lan Fleming and John Le Carre
used Hughes as a model for novel
characters and have never once needed
to reach into hyperbole. And that is why
Barefoot Reporter: The Best of Richard
Hughes’ Columns, 1971-83 (Far Eastern
Economic Review, about $10) will be not
so much a posthumous anthology as it
will be Dick’s Latest Book.


In 1970 when she was but a girl of 24
and still wearing her baby fat, actress
Suzanne Somers posed for a series of
nude pictures for Playboy. She did not
like 'them. “I’d had a baby and I was
fat,” she said. “To have these be the
only nude pictures of me was terrible.”
This month, Playboy publishes another
series of Somers in the buff and: “I
figured, as long as there were already
nude pictures of me out there, I’d rather
have them done right. I’ve spent six
years on the road staying in shape and
I’ve never looked better.”
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher is taking no chances on her up-

be Moriartys, beware.
With Melbourne probably the fourth
Greek city on Earth after Athens,
New York and London the average
Olympic Airways passenger list out of
Australia had more syllables than the
Trojan Wars. All of that was immensely
cheering to the Greek minister for
Transport, John Papadouikolakis, and
Olympic’s Australian office boss, Peter
Joannides. Yet for seven years the twice-
weekly service had stopped. It started
up again last week, with the minister
kissing a cross at a special launching
ceremony conducted by the minister
this time, the polysyllabic priest
Militiades Chrisavgis.
Ellie Saw, the wife of the above-
mentioned compiler, was at large in
Woollahra and ever keen to heap pelf
on the trading bourgoisie was pricing
a Victorian mourning bracelet in the
shop of antique dealer John Williams. It
seemed to be of creamy string,
exquisitely plaited, and a golden name-
plate said “Sorella.” Provenance, said
Williams, showed that it had been in
memory of a cat of that name. And the
string, or hair, was ... ? Well, neither
string nor hair, said Williams: the late
Sorella undoubtedly had been stuffed
and his or her intestines literally cat-
gut had been put to a lasting use.
There was no sale. We have become

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Victoria’s great cycle crusade
PEOPLE DID it for various reasons.
Some were genuine bike nuts,
passionate about bicycling. Some did it
because they were led to it as a
challenge. Like jogging they felt if they
suffered with sufficient terrible agony
somehow it would be good for the soul.
Some thought it would give them new
figures and return their youth. Maybe a
great number figured it was a joyous
way to get out of a monotonous city for
nine days.
I have vivid memories of a Benalla
woman in her 40s, who looked at me
bitterly three-quarters of the way up a
long, long hill and said, “I’d like to take
every column you ever wrote about
bicycling and stuff them down your
throat.” Yet she didn’t give up. She was
still there at the finish.
The Great Victorian Bike Ride has
been described as the biggest mass
migration across Victoria since the Gold
Rush. Sponsored by Caltex and the
Melbourne Sun it was one of the events
for Victoria’s 150th birthday. It went for
850 km on a twisted course from
Wodonga to Melbourne and more than
3100 bicyclists took part, including 70
schools and 700 school children.
The course was very carefully
charted along safe roads, but there were
so many bikes sometimes it looked like
the great locust plague heading south.
Every night they camped on local
football or showgrounds. You can
imagine the strain on local showers and
lavatories. Very early it won the title,
The Great Victorian Bike Queue.
The sights were unbelievable. It is a
modern trend that cyclists are totally
uninhibited in what they wear. We have
moved into the era of brilliantly colored
spandex. It comes in all colors from
black to puce to bright green and yellow
stripes, and it reveals all subtle rolls and
knobs in the anatomy. Some truly enor-
mous bums pushed their way to
Beechworth, to Benalla, to Rushworth,
to Bendigo, Maryborough, Ballarat,
Sunbury ... And those bums frequently
shrieked with pain.
Many people heroically carried their
kids on their bikes. There were a
remarkable number of middle-aged
ladies who just pedalled their way
round on their own. I remember par-
ticularly Margaret Wells, of Aspendale
who admitted to being “not far off 70.”
She said she got sick and tired of three
sons talking about “poor old Mum,” so
she decided it was time to change her
image and she bought a bicycle.
“Wow! Now THAT’S a head wind!"
Margaret said, “They told me I was
out of my mind and I’d get killed. So I
rode my bicycle to Brisbane. Then I
went to China and I rode it out to the
Gobi Desert.” Next she took up wind
surfing and she admitted she spent more
time under water than above, but she
certainly altered her Mum image. Now
there she was battling across Victoria on
a battered lady’s five speed.
The riders averaged 80km a day with
two more than 100 km. The weather,
mercifully, was cool, but the winds at
times were almost gale force. It is a
curious thing when riding a bike the
winds operate entirely in opposition to
the laws of physics. No matter which
way you turn they blow straight into
your face.
So there’s only one thing to do, you
draught. You huddle right in behind
somebody else, your front wheel only
30cm from his. On the road to
Maryborough we were pushing our
tandem when we found a very tall
bearded character who rode very erect.
Marvellous shelter.
All was fine for 25km when he rose
up in his saddle, and there was an
appalling eruption. As they say, he let
one go. The result was devastating and
it all came our way.
As we fell back 50 metres, slain, my
wife said: “You got exactly what you
deserved.”
Actually the show was very well
organised. There was a drama group of
three, called the Mixed Company, who
specialised in street theatre. There they
would do little cameo scenes designed
to startle. I think the best of them was
the day outside Maldon when Mike
Bishop and Fiona Syme did the
wedding scene. They were, the full bit,
bride and bridegroom, sitting at a table
out in a paddock drinking champagne.
One cyclist shouted; “Wouldn’t you
know? The bloody Housing Commis-
sion hasn’t delivered your house.”
Another time Gilly Farrelly dressed
in gear circa 1910, was pedalling an
exercise bike; in one hand she was
holding a parasol and with the other she
had a crocodile on a string.
The school kids were amazing. Some
of them were as young as seven years’
old but they pedalled all the way. At
night there was entertainment in the
camps, quiz shows and rock bands.
The route for the ride was beautiful,
wild flowers beside the road, golden
wheat ready for harvest, hay being
rolled into stacks, earthly smells coming
from the paddocks. Police ex-
traordinarily patient shepherded the
cavalcade through every difficult in-
tersection.
It all finished on the Sunday, the
cyclists who had built in numbers to
more than 5000 gathered in a park.
Then at noon the police closed off the
Tullamarine Freeway. For the first time
in history it was ours. We had this
marvellous track to ourselves. The cav-
alcade poured into the city and down
Swanston Street to be greeted by the
Premier also on a bicycle.
The Great Victorian Bike Ride was
such a success almost certainly it will
become an annual event. □

The perils of Otis interruptus
PHILLIP ADAMS
THE ASCENT of Man, by elevator or
lift, the unnatural contraption blending
architecture and the projectile that tries
to masticate you in its rubber jaws, that
means enforced intimacy with groups of
total strangers, that gives you the oddest
feeling in the stomach’s pit, began
around 236 BC. They’d become quite
common 200 years later when Vitruvius,
a Roman architect, described a variety
of devices powered by man, animals
and water.
By the early 1800 s, Europeans were
going up and down like yo-yos, thanks
to the magic of hydraulics. I’ve a
distinct memory of one of these vener-
able, vertical velocipedes surviving in
Melbourne’s Rialto building in the
19605, which one used when visiting
Hector Crawford. To visit Hector, you
had to tug at a rope, just like the
hangman at Pentridge. Perhaps that’s
where Hector got his obsession with
crime.
However the elevator didn’t really
reach lift-off until it was elecrified in
1889. Given the chauvinistic, phallic
preoccupations of Manhattan archi-
tects, erections were becoming in-
creasingly perpendicular. As it said in
the song ... “They’ve gone and built a
skyscraper seven storeys high, about as
high as a building ought to go. ”
So Mr Elisha Graves Otis combined
a driven drum with worm-and-gear
reduction, hoist ropes and a counter
weight to allow people to explore the
lofty heights of the Haughett depart-
ment store. Suddenly the cream of New
York society could rise fully five storeys
in one minute in contrast to a modern
Manhattan express which soars 600
metres in the same time.
Soon these people pistons had pro-
liferated across the planet, giving the
illusion of powering buildings. Just as a
little car has four cylinders and a Ferrari
might have 12, you could judge the
potency of a corporate HQ by the
number of elevators it had pumping
away. An anthropologist from outer
space, gazing down on a modern
skyscraper, might even deduce the
people queuing for the elevators were
the fuel, blood-sacrifices to capitalism.
I mention lifts because of a distress-
ing experience I had in Auckland
recently while trying to safeguard de-
mocracy. It was the latest in a long
line of incidents involving me and lifts
that has produced an understandable
level of paranoia.
Auckland has the very latest in
elevator technology. I discovered this
when arriving at a brand new
skyscraper to cast my absentee vote. It
was Saturday, so the rest of the building
was locked off. But the caretaker was on
duty to direct us Australians to the
eighth floor. I climbed into the lift,
pressed the appropriate button, and was
surprised to be addressed by a com-
puter-generated voice with a distinct
American accent.
“This elevator is leaving shortly,” it
said in its Texan-Dalek-IBM-Cape
Canaveral-Space Odyssey tones.
Whereupon the door closed with the
silky smooth ssss, and we began to rise.
“One, two, three,” intoned the machine
with its Pentagon tonsils, until finally I
was told that we’d reached our destina-
tion.
Somewhat unnerved, I cast one of
the only Labor votes for Kooyong,
putting it in a receptable that looked
eerily like a document shredder, and
summoned the contraption again.
Once again, the doors opened, and I
was invited to enter the high-tech
decorated, Muzak’d interior. But when I
pressed the One button (being an Am-
erican lift, it profferred no
“G”) something went wrong.
The doors closed with a
certain aggression, and all the
lights went out. All the lights,
even the little glows behind
the knobs indicating the floors
and the emergency bell.
1 cleared my throat politely
and asked the lift to take me
down. There was no response,
no reply. Even the Musak, a
sound so übiquitous that one
fears it will be played for all
eternity in heaven, had
ceased. Groping around, I
was able to feel the control
panel in the tomb-like dark-
ness and pressed every button
at least twice. No response.
It’s one thing for David
Lange to keep nuclear ships
out of New Zealand. But
what’s the point, if he lets in
American lifts? I continued
to speak to the machine as
reasonably as possible, but
receiving no response became
increasingly terse. After a
while I was pounding the
walls and using expletives that
were probably outside its sil-
iconed vocabulary.
Nothing happened. Not a
sausage. To make matters worse I
realised that nature was calling.
To some extent, this comes from
subconscious confusion. Every time I
enter a telephone booth or a lift, my
brain confuses it with the WCs they so
closely resemble. It’s an autonomic
response, like wanting to pee when
you’re near a fountain.
Refusing to respond to either abuse
or grovelling, the lift kept me in sus-
pended animation for some consider-
able time. While it was probably no
more than five or 10 minutes, in the
absolute darkness it felt like a life
sentence. If not a death sentence. And I
wondered whether it mightn’t be a good
idea to offer the lift my confession, so as
to expiate my guilts.
Whereupon the lift got bored with
me and slowly opened its jaws in a
massive yawn. I stumbled out into a
floor full of Australians who, having
voted, were queuing to escape.
As I headed for the stairs I said,
“Don’t go in there if you’re a Labor
voter.” And when I saw them crowding
in, I knew the polls were wrong and that
Bob Hawke was in trouble. □


When a dog’s gotta go...
RON SAW
PEOPLE in the eastern suburbs of
Sydney are planning to march on the
Mayor of Woollahra demanding that it
be enacted that those walking dogs be
equipped with pooper-scoopers.
Dogs, they say, must be embarrassed
not only by the steaming piles they leave
behind to be trodden on by ratepayers
but also by the very act of leaving such
piles.
I feel my reason slipping, steadied
only by the thought that councils and
other forms of government deserve to
be maddened by such demands and
reasoning.
Whatever happened to that master-
plan for public lavatories for dogs in
Canberra? No, seriously, there was such
a plan. It was moved by a Mr R. P.
Greenish, a member of the Australian
Capital Territory Advisory Council,
but, as far as I know, it came to nothing.
Why?
Before I go any further, I would like
to say that I do not become very wound
up on the subject of dogs’ Arrange-
ments. It is not that I do not care; it’s
more that I never saw a dog looking as
if it cared.
But at such times as this when we
have been bored rigid by the pro-
fessional stuffed shirts of our national
capital from R. J. Hawke to the press
gallery to the Third Party Insurance
Premium Advisory Committee, the
Poker Machine Advisory Board and,
God help us, the Electoral Commission
when the Woollahra Council no
doubt is ponderously planning the next
shirt-stuffing, it’s time that people were
asked to answer questions that really
matter. And if R. J. Hawke, A. Peacock,
P. Keating, I. Sinclair, Old Uncle T.
Uren and all really believe that a poor
little doggie with a bursting bladder
does not matter, let them say so
publicly.
What really matters, what tends to
put Canberra and the Canberrans on
the correct shelf, is that Greenish called
for the construction of “sand pits built
at strategic positions, surrounded by
small walls for the sake of privacy, and
well equipped with trees.”
And there I was forced to carp anew:
not only have I never seen a dog who
looked worried about finding some-
where to Go, I have never seen one that
seemed to care a damn who watched.
But Greenish, as I recall, felt contrari-
wise and he assured his colleagues (and
bear in mind that we were paying people
to struggle with such matters) that dogs
would be grateful if we gave them what
he called “canine comfort stations.”
Just about every other city in the
world had them, he said. But in the
concrete jungle of the business centre
which Canberra calls Civic which is
not unlike calling it Public or Suburban
or Tribal there was not a single dogs’
dunny.
Well, there you are. I’ve never really
spent long enough in the Big Apple to
become aware of its lavatory arrange-
ments for dogs but I have lived both in
London and in Montreal and I have
worked in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Rome, Naples, Genoa, Paris, Cairo,
Alexandria, Denpasar, Jakarta and
Singapore and not one dogs’ dunny
have I seen. What have I been missing?
While I no doubt was squandering
my sightseeing time in some Fleet Street
tavern, Lord Beaverbrook with some
great, hairy Newfoundland was pro-
bably waiting patiently in a queue
outside a walled pissoir in Shoe Lane
and Young Chiller or one of the Palace
footmen was politely asking the royal
corgis to take their ease and comfort on
some swansdown seat in The Mall.
Seat? There’s another question:
If I take our two schnauzer bitches
for a walk in Canberra and they decide
they want to Go, what on Earth do I do?
How do I know whether the wretched
dunny is a His or a Hers? Surely
Greenish would not want the sexes to
mingle.
There would have to be, every few
blocks, a brace of little Comfort
Stations called Dogs and Bitches
which would be immediately inviting to
the patrons of suburban pubs who,
accustomed to such signs as Guys and
Dolls, Damen and Herren, Roosters and
Hens and Standers and Sitters, would
hurry in unzipping or hoisting to be
marked for life by the screams of
sensitive canines.
And, quite frankly, I do not want my
bitches peeing in the same pot (so to
speak) as Bob Hawke and, worse, the
Governor-General.
But let us suppose that the Canine
Comfort Stations idea came good. Why
just canines? Other pet-fanciers would
nag. What about horses or goats? What
about owls?
The racing industry seems to get
along quite comfortably because horses
keep to Randwick and Flemington and
so on but other horses create a frightful
mess.
There was a tall, gloomy old lady
who used to clean up the corners at Pitt
and Market after the Sydney mounted
cops had made a mummery of control-
ling the lunchtime pedestrian traffic.
Almost certainly, she would ask that the
Sydney Hilton and Centrepoint be torn
down to make Comfort Paddocks for
uncomfortable horsies.
I used to know a man who kept a
brace of goats in his back garden and
complained that he could never take
them for a walk, on a bit of string or
whatever you use to walk goats, without
being nagged by fastidious health in-
spectors.
He certainly would want a Nannies
and a Billies. And, while I’m reluctant
to get into some ridiculous argument
about it, I do not believe that the
average goat a vulgar beast at the best
of times would care about it any more
than would one of the dogs which
Greenish was trying to comfort.
Anyway, nothing came of his idea
and I am ready to bet that not much
comes of the pooper-scooper idea in
Woollahra. In any case, at this time of
the year, there must be more edifying
things to talk about. □


A haven for people and wild life
DAVID McNICOLL
I HAD heard such varying opinions
that I was not sure what to expect from
Hamilton Island.
Having spent the weekend there for
the official opening, I am happy to
predict that it is going to be a thumping
success and deserves to be. It is a
magnificent, though perhaps overlarge,
concept and the extraordinary feature is
that it is all in very good taste unusual
for a resort.
The big thing going for it is the direct
flight from Sydney to a strip not a mile
away from the action: No fuss, no
immigration, no passports, no insect
sprays. In my book, this gives the place
a walk-up start.
You are not long on Hamilton before
you realise how many very-well-heeled
people there must be in Australia. The
units in the condominium blocks go off
as soon as they are built (and many
before the concrete is poured) at prices
ranging from $140,000 to $250,000.
Keith Williams, the genius behind the
whole affair (with Ansett), estimates that
the final cost of Hamilton will be $2OO
million when the second resort complex
is built.
Don’t get the idea the buildings will
ruin the environment. More than three-
quarters of the island will be untouched,
a haven for the deer, roos and wallabies,
wandering peacocks and the throbbing
bird life.
THE OPENING was done in a pretty
lavish way. Peter Allen was flown in
from New York, with various
musicians. Politicians and business
potentates, travel chiefs and journalists
attended.
There was never a dull moment
nor even a moment to admire the view.
Fashion parades on a catwalk over the
pool were carried out by lissom girls
who may or may not have been wearing
bathing costumes (there is so little of
them these days that it is hard to tell).
Then the island’s chopper fleet circled
up to 2000 metres and disgorged a
dozen skydivers who glided down, skil-
fully avoiding Barry Hempel who was
conducting some superb aerobatics in a
plane last used by Baron von
Richthofen. Then on to a “Fruit
Cocktail” party; a pause to give people
time to change and then the evening’s
dinner and entertainment.
Allen might have been the main
event but Premier Joh was the star. The
roar that went up as he mounted the
stage to open the resort officially was
Premier Joh meets Henry, the cockatoo
probably reported by people monitor-
ing the Muroroa Atoll.
George Harrison of Beatles fame, a
pleasant character normally, made
some asinine interjections during
Allen’s performance and was put down
by Peter in classic fashion.
There are four restaurants at Hamil-
ton and at lunch I had a chat to Joh and
Flo. Joh was very intrigued by Henry,
one of the resident cockatoos.
“Where do you live on this island?” I
asked Williams. He grinned as he
pointed to a palace taking shape on one
of the hillsides.
“He even has a pistol-shooting range
built under the house,” one of the
workers told me. “It’s how he handles
staff incentive.”
I was happy that I did not join the
dawn patrol who raged and danced to
the music provided by Harrison and the
stars of the Allen band. On the plane
coming home to Sydney on Sunday
were some faces which did not look as
though they had been on holiday.
IT IS FASHIONABLE with many of
the young, so I am told, to be gloomy
about the future. The world is soon to
end, so why try?
The problem of this gloom was
handled magnificently in a Speech Day
address at Sydney High School given by
Frank Meaney, leader of the Commun-
ity Relations Unit of the Education
department of New South Wales. He
found it disturbing that a climate of
despair was emerging among the young.
“It seems to be encouraged by those
pursuing political ideologies of the most
doctrinaire,” said Meaney. “In discus-
sion, it is not uncommon to hear young
women maintain that the world is far
too awful for children to be born into;
that there is no point in not abusing
one’s body with nicotine and alcohol
because ‘we will all be dead soon
anyway’; and, if that is not sufficient,
‘nuclear war is inevitable’.”
These views, Meaney said, were not
even supported by a fair reading of the
history of man on Earth. He recalled the
situation when he left school in 1950 a
crippling coal strike, the Korean War
about to start, a polio epidemic, atomic
bomb explosions only four years before.
“Yet, in the subsequent 34 years, no
more atomic bombs have been exploded
in anger; polio is a thing of the past;
only minor wars have occurred and
dependence on coal is going.”
I would like to see Frank Meaney’s
full speech made available to every
youngster in Australia.
A FEW WEEKS AGO, the Australian
Cape Horners held their annual general
meeting. The who? Who are the Cape
Horners?
They are members of one of the
world’s most exclusive and dwindling
groups people who have rounded the
Horn in merchant sailing ships. (A
recent variation to the articles allows
yachting members - but only those who
have not used auxiliary engines.)
The Cape Horners will come into
their own in Sydney in 1988 when a
world congress is scheduled from
January 24 to 27, with visiting tall
sailing ships moored all over Sydney
Harbor.
Australia has 125 Cape Horner
members. The Australian president,
Keith McCoy, is an airline pilot and
also a junior vice-president of the
parent body in Saint Malo. McCoy
rounded the Horn in 1949, on the four-
masted barque Pamir, one of the
youngest men to have done so.
The 1988 congress will bring 250
Cape Horners from 14 different
countries and planning committee
chairman Bob Russell already has a big
program lined up.
The Cape Horners produce a journal
crammed with anecdotes about the
Horn and guaranteed to make the most
dedicated landlubber yearn for the
ocean wave. □

ism and class privilege, the 1985 Range
Rover, is now awaiting orders.
While on the surface you may have
difficulty telling it apart from its worthy
predecessors, the 1985 Range Rover is
in fact a monument to revisionists.
Open the door (with new wind-
cheating mirrors but without wind-
whistling quarterlights) and you’ll see
a Range Rover you’ve never seen before
One with a new fascia and
instrumentation.
New front seats which adjust every
which way
New seat upholstery and door trim.
“ft was tike nobody had ever seen a Range Rover before.”

the old tailgate was not everybody’s

A hard decision, but one which

THE WORLD
Hope at the end of
a year of ‘middling nastiness’
Nineteen eighty-four brought worsening relations between
the super-powers but ended with the chance of a new
detente. EMERY BARCS reviews the year internationally.
MEASURED BY the dim-
inishing standards of in-
ternational behaviour to
which humanity has become
conditioned since the begin-
ning of this century, 1984
could be ranked as a year of
middling nastiness. For while
it started on a rough tone an
exchange of tongue lashings
between US Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko at the 35-nation
European security conference
in Stockholm in January it
expired on a friendlier chord
after the two men agreed in
November to meet in Geneva
on January 7 and 8 to discuss
what they could do to turn the
Earth into a safer planet.
After all, outer space is still no
alternative.
One may rightly admire
the three Soviet cosmonauts
who returned to their
Kazakhstan base in October
after spending a record-break-
ing 237 days in their crammed
Soyuz T-ll space capsule.
And there may be plenty of
volunteers ready to try to do even
better. But no sane person would vol-
unteer to settle in the Great Nothing
even if this were possible. It seems that,
the further humans venture into space
and the longer they stay there, the more
obvious it becomes that they must learn
to agree to live with each other on
Earth.
There was little evidence of this
learning process during most of the
year. East-west controversies and their
complex outcrops once again dom-
inated the political scene, occasionally
threatening mankind with the possibil-
ity of all-out nuclear war. No new “little
wars” (“little” because they are fought
on the peripheries) erupted during the
year but none of the carry-overs ended.
The armament race further escalated,
costing about $970 billion - $44 billion
Konstantin Chernenko took power in the Soviet Union
NOVOSTI-GAMMA
more than the arms bill of the previous
year.
Business in the free-market-economy
countries picked up, mainly on account
of the American economy’s better per-
formance. In June, a communique
issued at the end of the 10th summit
conference of the seven industrially
most advanced powers (the US, Britain,
Japan, West Germany, France, Italy
and Canada) confidently asserted that
the economic recovery was “more
soundly based than previously es-
timated.” But the upswing was uneven
and provided little respite to mainly
commodity-producing, debt-ridden
third world nations. To avoid a collapse
of the capitalist world’s financial
system, several of these bankrupt states
had to be injected with new loans to
enable them to service the old ones. In
January, Brazil obtained a
new loan of $6.5 billion from
some 600 western banks. “Re-
scheduled” foreign loans
during the rest of the year
included $48.5 billion for
Mexico, $20.75 billion for
Venezuela, $1046 million for
Peru and a World Bank loan
of $1.6 billion for Argentina.
How all the colossal loans
were spent or, as some in-
ternational finance experts
asserted, were squandered
remained something of a mys-
tery. While at the end of June,
1 1 Latin American foreign
and finance ministers met in
Colombia to work out a
scheme to repay more slowly
their combined debt of $357
billion to creditor nations, the
Bank of International Settle-
ments of Basle reported that
Latin Americans had
transferred about $55 billion
abroad during the six years
ending in 1983.
Despite reduced op-
portunities to earn a reason-
able living, the world’s
population in 1984 continued
to grow - by about 130 million mostly
hungry mouths - to a global 4750
million. And while food producers
throughout the economically advanced
part of the world complained about
excessive output, shrinking markets and
low prices, the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
predicted that 10 million people would
die from lack of food this year and
another 500 million would go hungry.
As the year was nearing its end, the
terrible famine in Ethiopia and else-
where in the third world fully justified
FAO’s tragic predictions.
The most powerful jobs in the world,
the US presidency and the general-sec-
retaryship of the Soviet Communist
Party were at issue this year. By the end
of January, it was an open secret in the
Soviet Union that the Number One,


Yuri Andropov not seen in public
since August was gravely ill and
would have to be replaced soon. And
President Ronald Reagan started the
last year of his four-year term in the US.
So, in the same year, each of the world’s
mightiest nations could have been
under new management.
Whether leaders make history or
history makes leaders has been in-
conclusively debated for many years. Be
that as it may, the far-reaching powers
bestowed by the American constitution
on the president enable him to take
personal charge of the direction of
internal and external policy. And Soviet
practice since Stalin has done the same
for the Communist Party’s
number one who (whatever
additional offices he may
hold) is the general-secretary.
Hence, both are potential his-
tory-makers and the present
and (at least short-term) fu-
ture not only of their own
peoples but of humanity at
large depends a great deal on
what sort of people they are.
The issue of succession was
speedily solved in the Soviet
Union. Andropov died on
February 9. Four days later,
the Soviet Communist Party’s
central committee announced
that at the proposal of its
politburo it had elected
Konstantin Chernenko, 72, to
succeed Andropov. Chern-
enko, had reached the apex of
power by working all his adult
life in the party ad-
ministration. Kremlin experts
described him as little more
than a grey party bureaucrat
and a temporary place-filler but, 10
months later, he is said to have gained
an unexpectedly firm hold on the four
key institutions of the Soviet establish-
ment: the party organisation, the
administration bureaucracy, the politi-
cal police and the armed forces. He is
suffering from various ailments and his
tenure of office may be short. But he
does not look like being a mere figure-
head.
Reagan became the Kremlin’s bete
noir because he aimed at and, up to a
point, succeeded in equalising the
Soviet bloc’s huge nuclear and con-
ventional arms build-up which by 1980
had tilted the military balance in favor
of the Warsaw Pact alliance. During
Reagan’s first term, the American
armed forces had been revamped and
tnore or less brought up to date. Uncle
Sam’s NATO allies were pressured to
increase their defence spending and to
agree to the deployment of medium-
range American Pershing II and cruise
missiles on their territories.
As the Soviet leadership saw in
Reagan the embodiment of unyielding
western resistance to a Pax Sovietica, it
decided to do as much as possible to
prevent him from gaining a second
four-year term in November. Until that
issue had been settled, nothing was to be
done that could assist Reagan’s re-
election.
On the contrary, the entire in-
ternational network of communist or-
ganisations and front-organisations was
mobilised to denounce the president as
a warmonger. The cold war days
seemed to have returned.
Out of the limelight, US-Soviet dip-
lomatic discussions about easing
mounting east-west tensions continued
The Gulf war between Iran and Iraq moved into its fifth year with continuing heavy losses
but without success. But on June 10 the
Americans announced that an ex-
perimental US army missile fired
from Kawajalwin Island in the Pacific
had hit, 180 km above the Earth, a
dummy warhead carried by a Minute-
man missile shot from Vandenberg air
force base on the Californian coast.
According to US Defence department
officials, it was the first successful in-
terception of an oncoming ballistic mis-
sile. The Russians were impressed. On
June 29, the Soviet government
proposed “negotiations for the preven-
tion of the militarisation of outer space”
to be held in Vienna in September.
Washington accepted the invitation
and expressed its wish to include
nuclear disarmament in the discussions.
White House National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane added that Ameri-
can negotiators were willing to bargain
with the Soviets any time, anywhere,
regardless whether the problems of
nuclear disarmament were included or
not. However, another Soviet somer-
sault followed. Tass news agency
reported that the US was “raising pre-
conditions” for taking part at talks on
space weapons and rejected any link
between them and nuclear issues. On
August 1, Moscow confirmed that
Washington’s “negative attitude” had
made it impossible to hold negotiations.
As American public opinion polls
continued to report persistent majority
support for Reagan against his
Democratic challenger, Walter
Mondale, the Soviet rejections of the
US proposals for talks became less
categorical. On September 27, Gromyko
still assailed the US in a speech to the
United Nations General Assembly but
no longer rejected direct discussions
between the two countries. He travelled
to Washington on the 28th to talk, at
length, with the President (it was
Reagan’s first personal contact with a
top-ranking Soviet leader) and the fol-
lowing day had discussions with Shultz.
There were no breakthroughs. On
October 13, Moscow announced that
the Soviet Union had begun to install
long-range nuclear missiles in bombers
and submarines and that the previous
month it had deployed about 100 SS-22
missiles (with a 1000 km range) in East
Germany and Czechoslovakia. A
fortnight later, in his second TV debate
with Mondale, Reagan offered to share
“Star Wars” anti-missile technology
with the Soviets. Silence was the
Kremlin’s answer.
On November 6, Reagan was
returned for a second term in one of the
biggest landslides in US history. Shortly
after the results had been announced,
Reagan suggested it was time for a
summit with Chernenko.
The Soviet pragmatists seemed to
agree. Short of some catastrophe,


Reagan would be master of the White
House for another four years and if the
Kremlin wanted to get on with the US it
had to get on with Reagan. Suddenly
everything was open to discussion.
Shultz and Gromyko agreed to meet in
Geneva to see where the superpowers
could go from there.
While the US and the Soviet Union
were fighting their mini-cold-war the
hot “little-wars” continued relentlessly.
At the beginning of the year, the
situation in Lebanon crippled by nine
years of civil war and foreign oc-
cupations (Syrian in the north, Israeli in
the south) looked as hopeless as ever.
At year’s end it looked just a little better.
Sikhs defended their Golden Temple in India and Mrs Gandhi was murdered
In March, leaders of nine Lebanese
political factions met in Lausanne,
Switzerland, for a conference of
national reconciliation. It managed to
produce two weak recommendations:
one was to form a government of
national unity, the other to reform the
constitution.
The following month a veteran
politician, Rashid Karami, 62, a Sunni
Moslem, became prime minister
designate and succeeded in assembling
a coalition government of sorts. A new
parliament voted it into power in June.
By year’s end, it had made some pro-
gress in reconciling the Lebanese
factions but practically none in ridding
the country of its foreign occupiers.
In Afghanistan, the war between
the Soviet-supported quasi-communist
government and the opposition forces
entered its sixth year. It started in
December 1979 when the Soviets dis-
patched an army of about 80,000 troops
into the country, believing that the
invasion would be a walkover. Now
there are an estimated 120,000 to
150,000 Russian soldiers in Afghanistan
and the end of the campaign is not in
sight.
Thousands of Afghans, soldiers,
guerillas and civilians and thousands of
Soviet troops have died in it. Of course,
without outside aid, resistance to the
Kabul regime and its Soviet masters
would have crumbled long ago. But
help has been forthcoming. The New
York Times reported in November that
the US had earmarked $327 million in
covert aid to the Afghan insurgents for
this financial year, raising total Ameri-
can financial support since the begin-
ning of hostilities to $730 million. An-
other $ll6 million had been provided
by Saudi Arabia, other Arab countries,
China and Israel.
The Gulf war between Iran and Iraq
which started with an Iraqi attack in
September 1980 moved into its fifth
year. According to international es-
timates, it had caused between 500,000
and 600,000 military and civilian deaths
up to the middle of this year. Iran alone
assessed its material losses as a result of
the conflict at the equivalent of $l6O
billion. Yet the war went on with both
sides claiming spectacular victories.
Since the beginning of this year, Iran
has been threatening to launch a
monstrous “final offensive” which has
yet failed to materialise. In March, Iran
charged that Iraq was using lethal
chemical weapons in the struggle.
Despite Bagdad’s denials, experts who
had seen corpses of Iranian soldiers
said Tehran’s accusations were well
founded. Both sides were attacking non-
military targets as well as neutral ship-
ping in the Gulf. To cool the danger of
the conflict spreading, the US and the
Soviet Union let each other know in
May that neither would actively in-
tervene in it.
Other ongoing “little wars” during
the year included those in Africa
(Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Som-
alia, Namibia, Chad) and in South-east
Asia (Kampuchea). In January, the bi-
partisan US presidential commission on
Central America, headed by Dr Henry
Kissinger, published its report. It con-
cluded that none of the six states of the
region (El Salvador, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica and
Panama) was free of war or its threat.
Five of the six governments were fight-
ing Cuban and Soviet bloc-backed left-
ist insurgents; the sixth, Nicaragua’s
leftist Sandinista regime, was
struggling against internal
and external rightist forces
helped by the US. However,
the Sandinistas’ charge that
Reagan had set a date for a
US invasion of their country
in support of the opposition
has so far looked groundless.
But Washington kept a wary
eye on the steady flow of
Soviet bloc weapons into
Nicaragua, a flow which “has
exceeded what was needed for
legitimate defence purposes
both in quantity and quality.”
In November, Nicaraguans
went to the polls to elect a
president and parliament. The
major opposition parties boy-
cotted the proceedings on the
grounds that the results would
be faked anyway. As foreseen,
the Sandinistas won the elec-
tion and their leader Daniel
Ortega, 38, a former guerilla
commander who spent seven
years in jail for robbing banks to
finance the Sandinista movement was
chosen as President. After his victory,
Ortega offered to meet Reagan “at any
time to discuss the conflict between the
two countries.” He seems still to be
waiting for a reply.
A wide variety of terrorists were at
work again in 1984, claiming some
“high ideal” as the motive for their
murderous activities. Here are some
notable examples:
■ On April 17, a “routine” demon-
stration by anti-Gaddafi Libyans in
front of the Libyan People’s Bureau
(embassy) in London’s St James’s
Square was transformed into a first-rate
international crisis when an unknown
gunman in the bureau opened fire at the
crowd outside. A young policewoman,
Constable Yvonne Fletcher, was killed
and about a dozen people were injured.
Britain severed diplomatic relations
with Libya.
■ In September, a car filled with at
least 500 kg of explosives crashed into
the US embassy annexe in East Beirut


killing about 23 people mainly
Lebanese waiting for visas to enter the
US and wounding scores of others.
■ In October, the Irish Republican
Army claimed responsibility for the
bomb explosion at the Grand Hotel in
Brighton, England, during the Con-
servative Party convention. The blast
killed four people, injured about 30. But
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the
probable target of the outrage, who was
staying at the hotel, escaped unharmed.
■ On October 31, Indian Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, 66, was shot
dead by two Sikh members of her own
security guard near her home. The
murder was committed in revenge for
Mrs Gandhi’s order to the
army in June to storm the
Sikhs’ holiest place of worship
the Golden Temple in
Amritsar which Sikhs
demanding autonomy for the
Punjab had transformed into
a fortress. In the battle, 800
Sikh fighters including their
leader, Sant Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, 38 were
killed. About 200 soldiers
died in the attack.
■ On December 4, four
terrorists hijacked a Kuwait
Airways A-300 airbus en route
from Kuwait to Karachi with
161 passengers and crew on
board and forced the pilot to
land at Tehran. They
demanded the release of 17
terrorists from a Kuwaiti jail.
Two Americans on board,
officials of the Agency for
International Development,
and another passenger were
murdered. Negotiations con-
tinued for five days during which most
of the hostages were freed. On the sixth
day, Irani security men, disguised as a
doctor and cleaners, entered the aircraft
and overpowered the terrorists.
Other events which made the front
pages and “prime times” of the printed
and electronic media:
■ Britain’s Royal Trustees headed
by Prime Minister Thatcher recom-
mended in January a 4 percent increase
in the $8 million state allowance
package paid to the Queen and other
members of the royal family. The
Princess of Wales gave birth to a second
son in September. He is called Henry
Charles Albert David, nicknamed
Harry, and is third in line to the throne.
■ British coal miners went on strike
on March 12 over the decision of the
National Coal Board to shut down 20
unprofitable nationalised pits, causing
the loss of 20,000 jobs. Police interven-
tion against National Union of
Mineworkers pickets trying to prevent
strike breakers from reaching the pits
led to clashes with scores of arrests and
to injuries on both sides. A taxi driver
taking a miner to work was killed when
a concrete slab was dropped on him
from an overhead bridge. At the time of
going to press, the strike was still on but
about 65,000 of the country’s 180,000
coal-miners had returned to work.
■ Canada’s Liberal prime minister,
Pierre Trudeau, 64, who had been in
power (with a brief interruption) for 16
years, resigned in March. The country
went to the polls on September 4. In the
contest for control of the 282-member
House of Commons the Conservatives
won 211 seats, the Liberals won 40 and
the New Democrats 30. A lone in-
dependent was also elected. Con-
The Pope at Mt Hagen, Papua New Guinea: one of many overseas visits in 1984
servative leader Brian Mulroney
became the new prime minister.
■ At the beginning of May, Pope
John Paul spent 11 days in South
Korea, Papua New Guinea, the Sol-
omon Islands and Thailand. It was his
21st tour. In September, he visited
Canada and in October the Dominican
Republic and Puerto Rico.
■ British and Chinese representatives
initialled the accord on Hong Kong in
Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on
September 25. The agreement provided
for a transfer of British sovereignty over
the colony to China on July 1, 1997. But
the socialist system and socialist
policies applied in mainland China will
not be extended to the Special
Administrative Region (of Hong Kong)
and the city’s capitalist system is to
remain unchanged for 50 years.
■ In October, Indonesia and Papua
New Guinea initialled a new five-year
border agreement to replace the one
signed in 1979. The new document was
aimed at improving relations between
the two countries which were strained
by Port Moresby’s allegations that
troops and jets from neighboring Irian
Jaya had crossed the border into PNG
and by the infiltration of almost 10,000
Irian Jaya refugees into Papua New
Guinea.
■ Political and economic crises
dominated life in Israel during much of
the year. Parliamentary elections on
July 23 gave no party a majority. An
agreement on national unity was signed
in September between Labor leader
Shimon Peres, the right-wing Likud
party of Itzhak Shamir and seven
smaller parties. The new coalition con-
trolled 97 votes in the 120-member
parliament. Peres became Prime
Minister for the first two years, to be
replaced by Shamir for two more years.
Fighting a 400 percent inflation rate,
dwindling foreign currency reserves
and a catastrophic foreign debt of $23
billion, the new government decreed in
October what amounted to an economic
state of emergency.
■ Sir Robert Muldoon’s National
Party which had governed New
Zealand for the past nine years suffered
a crushing defeat at the general election
in July. Victory went to the Labor Party
led by David Lange, 41, a lawyer. In the
95-seat parliament, Labor won 56 seats,
the Nationals 37 and Social Credit 2.
The new government adhered to
Labor’s platform and excluded nuclear-
powered ships and ships carrying
nuclear weapons from calling at New
Zealand ports.
■ President Reagan opened the
Olympic Games at Los Angeles on July
28. A record 140 nations participated
but the Soviet Union and 13 other,
mainly communist, countries boycotted
the Games. America won 174 gold,


silver and bronze medals
more than three times as
many as the runner-up,
Romania (53). Australia came
14th on the unofficial list,
winning 24 medals.
■ The conquest of outer
space continued. In July,
Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana
Savitskaya, 35, became the
first woman to walk in space
she did so for three hours 35
minutes. Another “first” was
established by the crew of the
American space shuttle Dis-
covery in November: they
managed to salvage two com-
munication satellites from
“useless orbits.”
■ Probably the greatest in-
dustrial disaster on record
occurred in the Indian city of
Bhopal on the night of
December 3 when, apparently
because of some “complex
interaction of technical
malfunctions and human error” large
amounts of toxic gas escaped from a
pesticide factory half-owned by the
American Union Carbide company.
More than 2500 people died and tens of
thousands were injured in the
castastrophe which left many of the
victims blinded for life.
Famine kept taking its toil in Ethiopia
BENDIT GYSEMBERGH/CAMERA PRESS
■ Time, as always, took its toll. Those
who died during the year included: in
January, Catalan semi-abstract painter
Juan Miro, 90; in February, American
cancer pioneer Henry Kaplan, 61,
whose research changed Hodgkin’s Dis-
ease from hopeless to curable, and
Nobel Prize-winning (1965) Soviet
writer Mikhail Sholokhov; in
March, Tito Gobbi, 68, one of
the greatest operatic baritones
of this century; in April, US
General Mark Clark, 87, com-
mander of Allied ground
forces in Italy in World War
II; in May, American
playwright, novelist and
short-story writer Irwin Shaw,

pare the ground for a second attempt at
a genuine detente. And a mini-cold-
peace in 1985 would still be preferable
to the mini-cold-war we have had for
most of this year of “middling
nastiness.” □

In its infancy, the success of
a business is usually due to the
entrepreneurial, or specialist skills
of the principals involved.
But as the business starts to
grow, many other factors in running
it successfully come into play.
Like raising finance, juggling
with cash flows, debtors, stocks,
taxation, government regulations
and so on.
Too few businesses manage
to keep their act together in all
these areas.
Which is a pity, because if the
ball is dropped in any one of them,
the rest can come tumbling down.
And this is where Price
Waterhouse and over 110 years
experience can come in handy.
Experience in business and
financial planning, including how

NEIGHBORHOOD
Indonesia accused of rape,
repression in Irian Jaya
Interviews by a group of Australian investigators of refugees from Irian Jaya have
led to serious allegations being made against Indonesia. Tony Abbott looks
at the investigators’ disturbing report.
MURDER, rape, assault and the
destruction of property are part of the
“pacification” campaign Indonesian
troops are waging in the troubled pro-
vince of Irian Jaya.
Evidence of this is contained in a 68-
page report issued last week by the
Australian section of the International
Commission of Jurists, a body of
lawyers which monitors human rights
violations and which has “consultative
status” with the United Nations.
In September, the commission sent a
team to the tense border region of
Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. The
mission included former NSW Liberal
leader John Dowd, Professor Garth
Nettheim, of the University of New
South Wales iaw school, and Father L.
Van Der Bergn who has spent more
than 30 years as a missionary in Irian
Jaya.
Extensive interviewing in border re-
fugee camps, which now hold more than
10,000 fugitives, produced what the
mission refers to as “clear evidence of
human rights violations by Indonesian
authorities against local villagers.”
The worst allegation is the claim of
one man to have witnessed the killing
and mass burial of about 60 people in
1972.
Indonesian forces are trying to crush
the Free Papua Movement (OPM)
which has been in sporadic rebellion
ever since the Indonesian take-over of
the former Dutch colony in 1963 and
which commands wide support amongst
the refugees who have arrived in PNG.
According to Dowd, the Melanesian
inhabitants of Irian Jaya were not
allowed to make “a meaningful act of
free choice” when the Dutch left.
Moreover, the arrival of more than
100,000 Javanese immigrants in the past
few years - with 700,000 planned by
1989 - threatened to destroy the
Melanesian culture and economy.
Educated refugees who had left good
jobs under the Indonesian administra-
tion told the mission that Melanesian
grievances included widespread abuse
of human rights, economic exploitation
West Irians in the Vanimo refugee camp just in Papua New Guinea: tales of horror
and the denial of self-determination.
Dowd said that, whle the OPM was
undoubtedly fomenting trouble, the re-
fugee problem was a symptom of the
way Indonesia was running the pro-
vince.
The current influx of refugees was
sparked by shootings in the provincial
capital of Jayapura, in February, when
a planned Melanesian uprising was
aborted.
One man who earlier had fled from
Irian Jaya said he had been jailed and
beaten constantly on his return. Two
villagers claimed that the Indonesians
had killed eight of their people after
others in the village had fled. Another
said that two had been killed in his
village after most of the others had fled.
One man said that his people first
had been harassed by Indonesian
troops in 1978. The team’s report said:
“He was a village leader and therefore
suspect in the eyes of the Indonesian
military. When troops were damaging
houses he attempted to stop them. In
consequence, he was held in the guard-
house for six months, during which time
he was beaten. When he was released,
he left with his family and, indeed, the
entire village. They had lived in the
bush since that time. Early in 1984
Indonesian helicopters came looking
for them. Indonesian soldiers pursued
them and shot dead four people.”
Another villager told the commission
team that his people had first gone into
hiding in 1978. The report said: “There
had been a history of dissatisfaction
with the Indonesian military soldiers
would claim people’s land and all that
was on it on payment of an unfairly
small sum. But the particular trigger for
the 1978 exodus appeared to have been
the disappearance of public servants in
the area. They had lived in the bush
since 1978 but crossed into PNG in
March 1984, when Indonesian soldiers
chased them. There had been shooting
and some people had been hit, but he
did not know if any had been killed.”
Other refugees had similar stories.
One said that his brother, an OPM
member, had been caught by soldiers,
trussed to a pole like a pig, and shot.
The Indonesians seem to be paying
special attention to the potential leaders
of the Melanesian people. A teacher
claims that several of his colleagues had
been killed during the 70s and that an

attempt on his life in 1978 had forced
him into hiding. A teacher, Donatus
Ayam, was one of the first Melanesians
killed in the current round of repression
and his widow was interviewed in a
camp in PNG.
Two refugees spoke to the mission
about Arnol Ap. curator of the
University Museum in Jayapura, who
was leading attempts to preserve
Melanesian culture and who died in
detention this year. One, who saw Ap’s
body, said that Ap’s arms had been
broken and he had bayonet wounds in
his sides and stomach.
Dowd has little doubt about the
credibility of the refugees’ claims. He
said that the mission has been able to
“cross-reference” the fugitives’ stories
with reports of others familiar with the
situation such as church officials and aid
workers. □

A bagful of
crises for
David Lange
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALAND Prime Minister
David Lange bounced into a press
conference the other day, and reported
that there was a “considerable degree”
of bouyancy within caucus. Cynics
suggested that Lange was merely
showing relief that the caucus for the
first time since the budget last month
had not given him a hard time. Lange’s
credibility has been dented by some of
the measures implemented in the budget
such as the surtax on superannuation
which contradicted specific pre-elec-
tion pledges.
There have been other mini-disasters
for the government, notably the hideous
drunken rioting in Auckland’s Queen
Street. Whatever the cause of those
riots, it cast a shadow on the revival in
the country’s morale which had been
triggered when the new government
shook off the controls which the pre-
vious administration had used to chain
down the economy.
The Lange government has
astonished both its followers and its
critics by the enthusiasm with which it
has unleashed market forces from the
shackles imposed by the previous
government.
The New Zealand economy is hardly
any less fragile than it was when Labor
took office. And unleashing market
forces may have pleased the business
community, but it has also created fresh

headaches in what is essentially a
narrow-based economy. Theoretically
the government wants to create an
environment where resources flow
rapidly into productive sectors to maxi-
mise current growth potential and thus
create the base to implement policies to
income redistribution and achieve
social justice. But in utilising an
effective public debt policy at market
rates to control monetary and credit
expansion, interest rates have been
pushed up to a level where huge flows of
capital have been attracted into New
Zealand.
Instead of funds flowing into pro-
ductive investment, where the rate of
return might be a decent 10 percent,
they are being drawn into government
stock at 17 percent. No other country
offers such gilt-edged securities.
Overseas spectators are betting on a
revaluation of the New Zealand dollar
as the country’s reserves which earlier in
the year were hovering about $1 billion
are moving up towards $5 bullion.
New Zealand’s monetarists are now
chasing their own tail as they seek to
absorb massive capital flows without
letting the liquidity spilll over into
internal demand.
Lange tells his troops that his
government is taking the hard road of
economic reality. The previous national
administration, he says, squandered
resources, mortgaged the future, and
borrowed as if there were no tomorrow.
But that kind of rhetoric is sounding
increasingly hollow when his own
government is sucking in capital flows
that make the previous borrowing seem
like a child’s pocket money. It is not
surprising that party activists are
becoming nervous.
Already militant trade unions are
mounting several major challenges to
the goverment on the waterfront, in
the dairy industry, and at the Marsden
point refinery expansion.
Early settlements in the wage round
after the government had urged a
guideline of between 4 and 5 percent
have been around the 6.5 percent level.
It seemed that the round would proceed
without too much disruption. However
the danger is that the return to free wage
bargaining following the protracted
wage freeze is now starting another
inflationary spiral to add to the impact
of sharply rising costs flowing through
from devaluation and high interest
rates.
The government had clearly hopfed
that in compressing the wage negotia-
tions beginning in November unions
would be disinclined to take industrial
action at Christmas. It may be that the
government can still navigate its way
through this dangerous passage, but
unless the line is held on wages, then its
economic strategy will collapse. □

AVIATION
Qantas maps out
revolutionary
operational plan
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
and
STUART INDER
IN THE PAST couple of months, a
team of Qantas executives including
pilots and engineers has been casing
remote airports throughout the Pacific
region as part of the airline’s plans to
introduce twin-engined Boeing 767 s
next year.
They have been compiling data on
ports to which the smaller, 210-
passenger aircraft might be operating
and also some remote islands which
767 s might have to use as diversionary
alternates.
The surveys are laying the founda-
tion for what is for Qantas a re-
volutionary operational pattern of long-
distance operations, often over water,
for the new aircraft.
This is one example of the
meticulous planning Qantas uses and
helped frame part of its proposed
strategy for Air Pacific, the troubled
Fijian airline which the Australian air-
line will manage.
In reportedly a split decision, the
Fijian cabinet decided late last week to
confirm Qantas as the operator to get
Air Pacific back on its feet.
Although a strong element in Fiji
favored the selection of Ansett Airlines
as the new manager, the Air Pacific
board frightened of their airline’s
desperate financial situation said they
would not accept any proposal but that
of Qantas, which promised immediate
financial injections.
Qantas will also make aircraft avail-
able to Air Pacific and train crews to
work on big Qantas aeroplanes, such as
its 7475, to maintain the airline’s identi-
ty in the reorganisational period.
Qantas has also promised to preserve
existing jobs.
The airline’s new manager will be
one of the young Qantas marketing
stars, John Schaap, formerly based in
Sydney.
The joint operational strategy in the
Pacific and into South-east Asia will
become apparent when the second wave
of new 767 s (out of the six Qantas has
on order) arrives late in 1985.
The Pacific survey was necessary
because twin-engined aircraft capable
of ranges of 9000 km are barred from
flying more than 90 minutes’ flight time
distant from an airport to which they
can divert if one of the engines has to be
shut down. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Stock selectors choose
their favorites for 1985
For investors, 1984 was a tough year, as The Bulletin’s team of 10
stock selectors found. MICHAEL MEAGHER looks at their
performances and reviews the new team’s forecasts for 1985
TIM PHILLIPS had reason to be well
satisfied with himself in 1984. Six stocks
that the equities manager at Australian
Fixed Trusts selected for The Bulletin a
year ago have shown an overall im-
provement of 37.6 percent since.
In a year when the All Ordinaries
Index was off around 7 percent, from
775 points to the 720 mark, Phillips’
effort was all the more commendable.
As the accompanying scorecard shows,
Phillips nudged out Clayton Robard
Management Ltd’s investment manager,
Ross Smyth-Kirk, for first place with
daylight to a group of six tipsters led by
broker Roach, Tilley Grice’s research
partner, Peter Quinton. Conspicuous at
the rear were two from the broking
fraternity Ross Murdoch, a partner in
J. B. Were and Co, whose stocks were
more than 20 percent down, and Rob
Thomas, research partner at Potter
Partners, nearly 17 percent down over
the year. The Sydney Stock Exchange
research unit, STATEX, provided price
comparisons.
The year was a difficult one for our
selectors. After starting bullishly, reach-
ing an all-time high of 787.9 points on
January 9, the All Ords cooled its heels
through the bulk of the year, went as
high as 782.5 in early November and
has lost some 60 points since.
Industrials enjoyed pride of place in
the market, with the All Industrials
Index also hitting a high of 1128 in early
November after coming from a June
low of 898.5. Since, however, it has
fallen to around 1065. The new year
looks a bigger challenge for the fund
managers and brokers. The wild card in
the bunch, Brisbane’s astute private
investor Charles Viertel, whose maxim
is that “No one can judge a market,” is
anxious to improve on his 1984 choices,
which performed moderately.
Viertel, who said he had “done
fabulously well” in 1984, picking up
around $5 million profit from selling his
stake in LNC Industries Ltd to the
Melbourne Liberman family, said 1985
was a hard market to pick. He
Ross Smyth-Kirk, of Clayton Robard: he
expects the 1985 market to be volatile
suggested: “The shot is to hold your
cash and be selective.” He still vol-
unteered six tips. One of the most
esteemed fund managers in the country,
BT Australia’s Olev Rahn, will not take
his place in the field this year.
Most apprehensive about the future
of stocks, he is content to warm the
benches. He will hold his cash and put it
into fixed interest securities, at least in
the short term. Rahn’s reasoning is that
1985 will see increased wage costs which
companies will find difficult not to pass
on in price increases. He feels company
profits will be hurt as a result.
Ross Smyth-Kirk believes the market
will be volatile. Clayton Robard feel
that “as soon as we see a crack in the US
dollar, we should see some improve-
ment in commodity prices and a
resurgence in the resource sector.”
Laurance Freedman, who helps manage
around $175 million in the Growthlink
and Worldlink trusts for Equitilink with
co-director Brian Sherman, thinks, “If
you can pick what is happening with the
US economy, then you’ll get it right. We
think the sharemarket is going through a
transition phase from strong to slower
growth.” Like Viertel and Rahn, Freed-
man belives it’s time for caution and he
qualifies his selections with: “I wouldn’t
go out investing in these stocks
tomorrow morning. You’ll want to be
very selective. It may pay to sit back and
wait for more positive signs in the
market. Now the signs coming from the
US market are dead even - 50 percent
positive and 50 percent negative.”
Nevertheless our selectors have
chanced their hands. Holding a stock
for a year may be very inflexible for a
fund manager but it is one of the rules
of The Bulletin’s tipping exercise. We
acknowledge Freedman’s comment that
he has sold out of many of the stocks he
tipped last year, as dictated by the
market. But the same rules apply to all.
The tipping line-up includes Phillips,
Quinton, Smyth-Kirk, Murdoch,
Thomas, Freedman, Viertel and
Michael Wilson, who has changed hats
this year from group portfolio manager,
Westpac Investment Management Pty
Ltd, to portfolio manager with Barclays
Australia Investment Services Ltd, part
of Barclays bank. Murdoch and
Thomas have been given notice that
they will need a sharp improvement in
form to stay in the team.
To put pressure on the incumbents
four new faces wre invited to select.
They are: Nigel Weaver, funds manager
at City Mutual Life Assurance Society
and formerly of Zurich Australian In-
surance Ltd; Simon Cooper, invest-
ments manager at Pittsburgh National


Tim Phillips, of AFT: plumping for stocks that did well for him in 1984
Bank; Don Stammer, chief economist
and recently appointed head of broker
Bain & Co’s equities; and finally, a wild
card to join Viertel, FAI Insurances
chief Larry Adler.
TIM Phillips, now guiding some $230
million in equities for AFT, is again
plumping for stocks that carried him
home in 1984. Among them are Vestcorp
Ltd; the reconstructed Filmco Ltd, the
investment vehicle headed by former
lEL Ltd employee Geoff Pickles;
Ariadne Ltd, managed by Bruce Judge
who Phillips says is in the Ron Brierley
mould; and Latec Investments, a grow-
ing oil group.
Phillips expects Ariadne, whose
share price was more than 60 percent up
in 1984, to continue on a strong growth
path. Of Latec, he says: “Through the
Flinders Petroleum takeover the com-
pany has virtually taken over Moonie
Oil’s previously dominant position in
the Amadeus basin, just as the cash flow
is about to start.” His other picks are:
■ lEL, “a company with consistent
growth. The shares have been under
pressure from the recent rights issue,
presenting a good buying opportunity.”
■ Consolidated Exploration Ltd,
whose Lady Bountiful prospect is
shaping up as one of the important new
goldfields in Western Australia.
■ Santos, Australia’s top onshore oil
producer and explorer. Recent mark-
downs in its price have over-com-
pensated for the weakness in the oil
price.
ROSS Smyth-Kirk, like Phillips, tips
Latec which he sees as an undervalued
asset play. He has also elected to stay
with the star of his 1984 tips, Niugini
Mining Ltd, which leapt some 250 per-
cent to $B.lO after news of a huge gold
strike on Lihir Island near Rabaul, in
Papua New Guinea. He is still very keen
on the stock where “reserves are con-
stantly being upgraded.”
He also likes Howard Smith, un-
fashionable as a coal miner, but with
“strong underlying assets” attractive to
takeover predators. In industrials he
goes for Wormald International Ltd,
which hasn’t performed and “either
performs or will be taken over” and
News Corporation Ltd, which, with a
price/earnings ratio of under six times
and a market perception clouded by the
company’s recent heavy exchange rate
losses, looks undervalued.
His last pick is Australian Agricul-
tural Company Ltd, “a pastoralist whose
cattle and sheep numbers alone equate
to the current net tangible asset backing
without the company’s land hold-
ings.”
ROB Thomas, on his 1984 performance,
proclaimed: “Even Don Bradman had a
duck.” His selections are:
■ Woolworths Ltd: Strong productiv-
ity gains are likely and the stock is
undervalued.
■ McPhersons Ltd: Here Thomas
says there is fundamental value with a
recent takeover loss “overdone by the
market.” There is also takeover appeal.
■ ANZ: The banker is one of the
cheaper stocks in Potter’s Focus analysis
of the market and has great potential
internationally.
The banking sector generally is a
popular pick this year with the experts
believing that the financiers are general-
ly operating at very cheap price/
earnings ratios. Thomas’s other picks
are the Bell Group Ltd, “historically
cheap with excellent entrepreneurial
management,” “heavy metal” in the
shape of Bougainville Copper Ltd, and a
lighter spec, Australian Diamond Ex-
ploration NL where he recommends the
1 cent options. The last stock is a “very
exciting exploration prospect.”
ROSS Murdoch likes the National
Australia Bank, “where profit margins
should be maintained on an increasing
level of business.” He also likes Boral
Ltd, which is “well managed and will
continue to benefit through 1984-85
from the buoyant housing market” and
Pioneer Concrete Ltd, offering “a grow-
ing profit and cash flow base from
traditional concrete activities combined
with potential for strong gain from
widespread oil exploration interests.” A
fourth industrial he favors is Comalco
Ltd, the recent purchaser of aluminium
production and processing operations
in the US at good prices.
Murdoch adds some resource stocks
in Minerals, Mining and Metallurgy Ltd,
“currently the only profitable Broken
Hill mine and a large producer of zinc,”
Hunter Resources Ltd the West
Australian gold explorer, and Minora
Resources which he describes as “a well
run, well funded diversified petroleum
explorer with the best exposure through
options.”
LAURANCE Freedman, like some of
his co-selectors, is a student of lEL’s
long history of growth and tips the


stock, but his leader is Lend Lease which
he says has “dynamic management and
increasing income from the property
side of operations through association
with the General Property Trust and
other activities.”
He believes the service sector will
provide winners in the next few years
and in the finance area plumps for New
Zealand Insurance Corporation Ltd and
FAI Insurances.
His other picks are: forestry group
Softwood Holdings Ltd and two recently
floated technology companies, Sarich
Technologies Trust and Laser Lab Ltd,
whose technology is lasers that cut and
form metals.
LARRY Adler naturally put FAI at the
top of his list. Of an improvement of
more than 70 percept to well over $8 a
share for FAI in 1984 he quipped:
“Mate, you ain’t seen nothing yet.” His
other picks are Vamgas Ltd, Offshore
Oil NL, Bond Corporation Ltd, BHP
Ltd, “still undervalued,” and Valinda
Properties Ltd, a small property investor
and developer.
CHARLES Viertel, reluctantly in to bat,
gave The Bulletin a few stocks in which
he has recently taken an interest. They
are ANI Ltd, Adelaide
Steamship (options), the
ANZ, timber and board
group Carricks Ltd as a
recovery stock, North
Queensland Telecasters
and an exchange star
near the end of the year,
the plastics technology
company, Hitek.
PETER Quinton, who
daringly expects the All
Ords to reach 900 in
calendar 1985, has shot
for industrials with TNT
Ltd on a “substantial 148 percent profit
increase in 1984-85 due to an
anticipated recovery in overseas
operations.” He also goes for Myer
Emporium Ltd, which also has recovery
potential; Rheem Australia Ltd, “ex-
pected to report a 70 percent profit lift
in 1984-85” Ralph Mackay Ltd, the rural
machinery group and Dunlop Olympic
Ltd which “deserves a re-rating.” The
lone energy stock is Aberfoyle Ltd
which has a “bright future with impend-
ing plans for Hellyer, and a probable
gold development at Bardoc in WA.”
DON Stammer goes for the banks as his
anchor bet selecting Westpac Banking
Corporation Ltd and the ANZ. He then
picks clothing group Bonds Coats Paton
Ltd which has “a low price earnings
ratio, strong balance sheet, understated
assets and good management” and
heavyweight miners in CRA Ltd, Con-
Larry Adler of FIA: his own
company tops his list
solidated Rutile and Central Norseman
Gold Corp Ltd. Stammer feels commod-
ity prices should be on the way up in the
second half of next
year.
MICHAEL Wilson
considers 1985 a tough
year for investors and
advocates a “lower than
normal equity weight-
ing” in portfolios. He
advises investors to
look for attractive
yields and price
earnings multiples. He
tips: Westpac,
Woolworths, Pioneer
Concrete with “a high
level of offshore earnings which will be
attractive in a weak Australian dollar
environment, coupled with a price
earnings ratio of 6.5 and yield of 7
percent,” and Bartlett Property Trust,
“sold down in the market after some
poor reviews.”
In resources he goes for the
Queensland Coal Trust with a “high
yield of 11.7 percent projected” and
Mietana Minerals NL, a “well-managed
gold miner making good profits at
today’s low gold price and scheduled to
significantly lift production over the
next 12 months.”
NIGEL Weaver sees the All Ords
gradually fluctuating downwards in
1985 to around 660 to 680 points, but
not a major shake-out. He thinks
mining shares will be affected worse
than industrials as resources stocks find
more realistic levels.
He leads off with Myer, which has
“situational appeal and should benefit
from the eventual resurgence of pent-up
consumer demand.”
His other stocks are TNT, BHP, the
ANZ and the newly listed Technomin,
which has two highly promising mining
processes.
Weaver’s final stock is Elders IXL
Ltd, which, in dramatic understatement,
he says, “has situational appeal, strong
assets and cash flow and good quality
management. One way or the other it
will pay.”
SIMON Cooper, predicting an improv-
ing US economy in 1985, believes in-
terest rates will fall and the US market
will rise in the new year.
The local market should follow, al-
though there will be some volatility
caused by the domestic economic out-
look.
His picks are all industrials, led by
Adsteam and the textile group Entrad
Corporation Ltd - the transformed
Bradmill Industries.
He also tips the diverse investor
General Investments Australia Ltd
“whose spectacular earnings growth
over five years should continue,” and
the Southern Farmers Group, which is 62
percent owned by lEL and has recently
completed several acquisitions which
should produce substantial growth in
earnings.”
His final choices are the Terrace
Property Trust and Vapocure Ltd, the
stock that alerted the stock exchanges to
the promise of high technology stocks
with its room-temperature paint curing
process. □

With a parent company like BHP, we
learnt one thing quickly.
How to move materials in bulk.
Whether it's oil, coal, iron ore, steel
or gold, we got them all up and moving,
and we've been moving them for years.
We provide engineering studies,
survey, design and project management
for many of BHP's rail systems.
We also do the same for Government
Rail Authorities.
The handling of bulk materials is just
one service we provide for BHP, private
industry, and Governments both here
and abroad.
So if you need mountains moved,
you now know who
you should be calling.

WILDCAT
Big Australian to flex its biceps
IF THE market needs any more alerting
to the potential of The Broken Hill
Proprietary Co Ltd, a strong
recommendation from Sydney brokers
Meares & Philips Ltd might stir
Australia’s premier stock from its rut of
just over $5 on national markets.
Analyst Dr lan Story, who prepared
the report when BHP was clocking
about $5.25 claims BHP is a good buy
up to $11.50.
The Meares & Philips report bases
the optimism and the description of
BHP as “the most undervalued stock on
the market” partly on its plan to
invest abroad, largely in the United
States, but also on its existing Bass
Strait interests and high hopes for the
Timor Sea drilling program.
With 12 percent of its assets already
in the US (following the Utah and other
acquisitions, BHP could pour up to
$6OO million a year from cash flow into
US projects so that by 1995 half its
assets would be outside this country.
Other strong recommendations from
Meares are Bridge Oil Ltd, at up to
$2.70; Santos, at up to $6.50; and Beach,
to 90c. In last week’s listless market,
these were at $2.40, $5.76 and 59c
respectively.
His overview of the oil and gas
industry is for a possible $1.50 fall in the
benchmark Saudi light crude price at
the next Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meeting, which
should stabilise erratic spot prices. So
far the northern winter has been
relatively mild, and Story sees this as
pointing to a likely stability for prices at
around $U527.50 a barrel for two or
three years.
This should result in a miniscule fall
in the Australian import parity price
that takes effect January 1 from $35.36
to $35.22 because the reduction will be
cancelled out by the strong US dollar in
relation to Australian currency.
Story’s comments on other oil
stocks:
Bridge: “The market has not yet
appreciated that Bridge’s earnings will
more than triple in 1984-85. The effect
of equity accounting 15 percent of
Santos may not have been well received
by the market, but the reality is that
Cooper Basin earnings will quadruple
from $9 million in 1984 to $3B million in
1985.”
Santos: “Downward pressures on
world spot oil prices
have been mirrored in
Santos’s share price
despite good explora-
tion news at Talisman
and Gidgealpa.”
Beach: “The current
weakness in Beach’s
share price reflects the
lack of success in ATP
267 P. The stock is sub-
stantially undervalued
relative to its asset back-
ing. The Bodalla South
oilfield should be in
production by late 1985
or early 86, providing
Beach with a substantial
cash flow to underwrite
future exploration.”
Hartogen (last week selling at $2.45):
“An exciting opportunity to participate
in an extremely broad-ranging explora-
tion program.”
Bell Resources Ltd ($4.40): “Success
of the Challis Well has helped build
investor confidence and remind us that
the company still has interests in two of
the most profitable projects in Australia,
Bass Strait and Utah ... We estimate
earnings at a sustainable rate of $32
million a year placing the stock on a
primary P/E of just 9.”
Bligh (75c): “. . . undervalued ... an
excellent interest in some of the best
exploration acreage in the Eromanga
Basin.”
Moonie ($2.70): “.. . a prime can-
didate for rationalisation ... 25 percent
undervalued.”
Broking carousel
THE merry-go-round continues in
Sydney broking circles with well known
stockbrokers still changing firms.
John Buckley, a stalwart of
Lamploughs for 13 years, has switched
to Roach Tilley Grice & Co. Elsewhere
around the rialto, Peter Wearnes has left
Hattersley & Maxwell Noall & Co. to
join Bain & Co.
Cheer from Keating
IF A WINK is as good as a nod,
Treasurer Keating gave a broad one
when he opened the Nevoria gold mine
in Western Australia last week to indi-
cate that income from gold production
would remain tax-exempt.
The $6 million Nevoria mine
development operated by Southern
Goldfields Ltd (40 percent) and Jingellic
Minerals (60 percent) will produce
27,000 ounces to 30,000 ounces a year
from a projected resource of 500,000
ounces.
Keating who flew from Canberra to
the mine site at Marvel Loch 45
kilometres south-east of Southern Cross
to perform the opening, said that he
was often asked about the future of
existing tax concessions granted to gold
mining companies and added: “Let me
make it abundantly clear the govern-
ment has no proposals before it to
withdraw the existing exemption from
tax for profits from gold mining. As I
have said, the government has
undertaken to review the tax system in
1985. In that context, it has adopted a
general policy of not ruling in or out
particular tax options.” Keating said
that there was no good reason for the
tax exemption on gold income in terms
of equity but added that equity was not
all-important.
“We have so far resisted proposals to
withdraw the existing tax exemptions
for gold through the last two budgets
when the government was scavenging
for revenue in times of recession,”
Keating told his anxious audience. “Let
me assure you we are aware of the
contribution made by the gold mining
industry in bringing new life, jobs and
investment to many remote areas
particularly in Western Australia. Much
of this would not have happened had
there been a tax on gold.”
An event of even greater significance
to the Goldfields was celebrated that
night in Kalgoorlie, 200 km east of
Southern Cross, with a dinner to mark
completion of the $7O million Cassidy
shaft which will open up large ore
reserves on the Mount Charlotte leases
of the Golden Mile. □

THE CHARTIST
Wormald shares in arduous recovery
by Russell Lander
THE accompanying Bridge Data charts
show Wormald International on a
weekly basis since the end of 1982 and
on a 10-year monthly close plotted in
dots against a year-on-year Coppock
Indicator measuring momentum.
A number of points of interest stand
out from these graphs.
Firstly, Wormald has been a very
sluggish stock over the past four years in
that the current level was first reached in
1980, adjusted for issues. In the five
years to 1980 Wormald had been a
moderate growth stock doubling in
price between 1975 and 1980.
Secondly, since June the stock has
emerged from a sharp intermediate
downtrend in the first half of 1984 and
has been attracting comparatively heavy
turnovers since September.
Thirdly, the Coppock Indicator
which is essentially a weighted average
rate-of-change line, has turned up from
negative readings. This has been a
surprisingly faithful guide to buying
opportunities in Wormald over the last
decade as illustrated by the chart.
The Coppock Indicator is simply
highlighting that from the end of Sep-
tember 1984 the downward momentum
in Wormald’s share price began to
decline. This could be a pointer to either
an improvement in the group’s earnings
outlook for 1984-85 or perhaps some
strategic buying by a party yet to show
its face on the share register.
Wormald has found the going tough
since earnings per share peaked at 44
cents in 1980-81 - 1983-84 EPS disap-
pointed at only 28 / 2 cents. The group is
a worldwide operator in fire protection
and detection and security services and
has apparently been suffering from a
slow-down in capital investment in the
major economies.
Back to the charts: substantial
overhead resistance which lies in the
range $3 to $3.30 will have to be
neutralised before the stock can reach
the target of $3.50 indicated by a linear
reading of the mid-year reversal pattern.

THE MODEST FARMER
Thoughts on how to kill dinosaurs
by Bert Kelly
ECCLES is a sad sod and he likes being
like that. When I told him about the
public opinion poll which showed that
most Australians wanted our wage
fixing machinery left unaltered - thus
leaving Bruce, our industrial relations
dinosaur, eating his head off while the
exporters in the Rough Cruel World
had to feed him I expected Eccles to
burst into tears. But he just smiled
benignly and said: “Don’t worry, Bert;
economic laws will win in the end as
they always do. We might have to wait a
long while and suffer needlessly but
nothing is more certain than that our
present centralised wage system will
have to be altered radically. I have been
proved right about tariffs and I will be
proved right about poor old Bruce.
Being right is what makes me so
unpopular.”
Then Eccles gave me one of his long
lectures. He says that if wage costs
continue to rise as they do now with the
cost of living, instead of with productiv-
ity as they should, then the share of the
economic cake going to management
will fall as the share going to wages
rises. Then less money will be invested,
so the economy will slow down; un-
employment will rise and this will force
down the real value of wages until they
are in line again with productivity.
I suppose this sounds logical but it
hardly seems fair that owners of capital
should have the right to say whether
they should invest it or not. Indeed, I
toyed with the idea of asking the
government to pass laws to make them
invest their money where the govern-
ment thought best but Eccles warned me
that capital is funny fluid stuff and if it
does not find a happy home here it will
just quietly melt away and go to other
places where returns are greater. You
may say that this is unfair, that capital
should do what it is told. You may be
right, too, but capital will continue to go
where its return is safest and greatest.
Eccles then put the lid on his argu-
ment by saying that it was once usual to
compensate secondary industry for un-
economic wage rises by giving them
tariff increases. Indeed, I have a letter
before me written on November 7 to a
company that makes heavy earth-
moving machinery, which asks them to
join in a campaign to persuade the
government to come to the rescue of the
“We might have to ...
suffer needlessly but ...
our centralised wage
system will have to be
altered radically’
industry. The letter is from the chair-
man of the Machinery and Metal
Engineering Council none other than
John Halfpenny who last year was a
powerful official in the metal workers
union which bullied the metal
employers into giving in to wage
demands that made it inevitable that the
industry would need help. He says:
“The Council has sought emergency
assistance from the government to
maintain a viable engineering industry
in Australia.” This is pretty rich, coming
from one who had more than anyone
else to do with making it unviable.
Giving tariff increases to compensate
for wage rises once was the usual way to
behave but everyone knows that ex-
porters can no longer carry increased
tariff burdens. The Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics tells us that farmers’
incomes will be down by 29 percent this
financial year, the miners are slipping
further behind all the time and most
secondary industry exporters are in
trouble. They say that nothing clarifies a
man’s mind like the knowledge that he
is to be hung in the morning. Well, the
exporters are in that position and the
government knows this at last so
tariffs can no longer be used to com-
pensate for wage rises.
Eccles then said something that I
found strange, coming from such a cold
fish. He says that the good young
leaders in the unions particularly
those in the Australian Council of Trade
Unions because they are well
educated and sensible must know that a
gradual movement toward a more flex-
ible wages system that is responsive to
economic forces is inevitable in the end,
so we ought to help them explain this to
the community in general and to their
unions in particular.
Because I was once a member of
parliament, I can understand that argu-
ment. When I addressed apathetic Lib-
eral Party audiences, I lost marks if I
was not giving the unions a bit of stick;
people feared that I might be getting
soft on the unions. The young Labor
leaders (who are often under suspicion,
anyway, because many of them have not
been through the painful union mangle
from the shop floor up) must feel
threatened that they may lose their
influence even their positions if
thought to be going soft on the bosses, if
they were to cease beating the class
warfare drum and so on. So Eccles says
we ought to try to understand the bind
they are in and help them if we can.
I realise that Eccles is a know-all but
because he is certain that economic laws
will win the wages argument in the end
he is going round like a cat that has
been at the cream. He knows that
Bruce’s time is quietly slipping by but,
after all, that is the common fate of
dinosaurs. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Parry’s Pelsart holds promise
WESTERN Australia has produced
more than its fair share of millionaires
and retailer-developer Kevin Parry
ranks high on the list.
With a 57 percent interest in $5O
million of shareholders’ funds in his
principal company, Parry would rank in
riches behind Robert Holmes a Court,
iron ore millionaires Lang Hancock and
Peter Wright, builder John Roberts
(Multiplex) and publicity shy developer
Stan Perron.
His fortune in retailing, property
development and television (Newcastle,
Rockhampton and now Papua New
Guinea) was founded on a modest
furniture factory once operated by his
father Frank. More than 20 years ago,
one of the factory’s major customers a
furniture shop went broke. Most of
the wardrobes and bedsteads on the
shop floor belonged to Parry and, so the
story goes, Frank said to Kevin: “Well
son, it looks like we’re in retailing.”
Kevin Parry has since become one of
Perth’s leading discount homewares
retailers. His headquarters is in a “no
frills” conglomeration of old ware-
houses on 5 hectares of prime real estate
on the northern fringe of the Perth city
centre.
Quite apart from the retailing and
the group’s widespread property
development, Parry and his men are
talking about their thrust into “hi-tech”
operations ... building satellite com-
munications receiver dishes from the
company’s new plant in Darwin, com-
puter applications in agriculture and
investment in a Los Angeles company
which produces a video-disc informa-
tion storage and retrieval system.
From all that it may be understood
that the Parry Corporation Ltd is a busy
animal. Much of the company’s profit-
able activity, however, is offset by new
asset development yet to produce
earnings, so in the year to June 30,
despite profitable retailing and media
operations, pre-tax profit for the group
was only $3.13 million and after ex-
traordinaries, a net loss of $1.34 million
resulted.
But of more interest to the
Speculator was the company below
Parry Corporation the 50 percent-
owned Pelsart Resources NL, whose
121.3 million 20c fully-paid shares are
now trading at 15c, equivalent to a
market capitalisation of $18.2 million.
Pelsart raised more than $1 million
in two three-for-five share issues in the
year to June 30, but most of that was
invested in buying a 5 percent overrid-
ing royalty interest in 15 petroleum
permits throughout Australia. Several of
those are certain revenue producers.
The company has also a 6.0241
percent interest in the successful Harriet
oilfield discovery on the offshore Car-
narvon Basin (WA-192-P) which will go
into production early in 1986.
But, according to Parry, Pelsart’s
operations in Indonesia are likely to
eclipse his entire business in Australia
in 1985.
At the end of November, the In-
donesian Government approved four
contracts of work to Pelsart and other
joint venture partners, granting them
rights over 10,000 sq km in central and
western Kalimantan (Borneo) on major
gold prospects.
The potential of these prospects is
yet to be comprehended by outsiders,
but on the so-called Sampit area (Pelsart
10 percent; BP International 65 percent)
a palee (alluvial) channel 65 km long
with gravels 7m to 14m deep has been
outlined. Possible gravel reserves ex-
ceed 650 million cubic metres much
of it gold bearing. Within this area, I
understand a zone called Sori Hill
includes 15 million tonnes running
ounces to the tonne.
Pelsart has traded down from 27c to
a low of 1 lc this year and now stands at
15c. If 1985 is to be its big year, we may
well buy some after we balance the
books and start afresh in the next
edition.

ANSWERS
1. (c) He excelled at all the sports named
and also at billiards, gymnastics, lacrosse and
hurdling but he was a great ruck-rover and
half-forward for Norwood and South
Australia.
2. (a) As a young signwriter in Perth, Bond
painted a big wall sign for Dingo Flour.
3. (b) Pitt introduced income tax in 1799
as a temporary expedient to pay off the
Napoleonic wars. It was repealed, amid
general acclamation, in 1816 and not
reintroduced until 1842. Sir Robert Peel was
the guilty party.


4. (b) False. Hancock discovered extensive
iron ore deposits in the Pilbara, but Tom
Price was discovered by the Rio Tinto Zinc
mapping team who walked for weeks through
the ranges before reaching it.
5. (c) Onassis did all the things mentioned,
but he got his real start in business making
cigarettes in Buenos Aires in 1925. Almost his
first move was to pirate the brand name of
Bis, Argentina’s largest selling cigarette of the
day.
6. (c) Burns and Philp began as partners in
retailing, with their major operation in
Townsville being set up in 1872. They vertic-
ally integrated into shipping soon after.
7. (c) Pancontinental first reported
uranium values from Jabiluka in March 1971.
They actually had better prospects of getting
a mine started then than they do 13 years
later.
8. (a) As a 20-year-old journalist in 1825,
Disraeli wrote a lot of “puffing” pamphlets
promoting shares in which he had invested,
notably the Anglo-Mexican Mining Company.
He borrowed £4OOO to buy in but the mines
were so poor that the shares could not be
sustained even by Disraeli’s prose. He was
nearly ruined in the collapse.
9. All of them.
10. (a) The cedi is the Ghanaian unit of
currency, the kwacha the Zambian, the sylis
the Guinean and the lilangeni gets spent in
Swaziland (and nowhere else, Pierpont would
think).
11. (a) Henry Ford. Early in the 19205, the
scorers made the fundamental error of wangl-
ing themselves larger office space and
worse doing it through Henry’s son Edsel.
The day after Henry found out, the account-
ants came in to work and found that their
office had been stripped bare. They learned
later that they had all been fired, although
Edsel quietly re-hired them.
12. (b) Korman’s idea was widely praised
as visionary.
13. (0 He was born in South Africa, of
English parentage, and educated in New
Zealand.
14. (b) North West Oil & Minerals NL
announced the discovery at Rudall River
near Marble Bar in January 1971. Oddly, it
has never been mined in the 13 intervening
years so there’s a hot tip for 1985.
Pierpont wishes his readers a pros-
perous Christmas and tax-free New
Year. □
CHESS
A Greek gift from Australia
by Terrey Shaw
WITH KARPOV and Kasparov locked
in their seemingly interminable struggle
for the world championship in Moscow,
pundits were predicting that the 26th
chess Olympics in Thessaloniki, Greece,
would be a wide open event.
One of the English supporters con-
fided to me that she was expecting an
English victory, especially with newly
crowned grandmaster Murray Chandler
in such deadly form. The Hungarians
were walking around looking quietly
confident and that the United States
federation had promised its players a
money bonus for each win was an open
secret.
In the jvent, despite fielding what
was almost their reserve team, the
Soviets proved far too good. At the
closing ceremony on December 5, the
familiar Hammer and Sickle rose to the
masthead once again followed by the
Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
The USSR had clinched victory with a
round to spare.
Our team of Johansen, Rogers,
Hjorth, Solomon, Shaw and Ferris put
in a solid performance despite the
distraction of many attractive Greek
spectators. Seeded 27th, we finished
equal 21st in the 88-nation event. Our
best result was a totally unexpected 3'A
to V 2 win in round eight against an all-
grandmaster Israeli side.
Australia went a step closer to
achieving its first grandmaster when
international master lan Rogers scored
7 out of 9, his first grandmaster result.
He need only achieve a similar score
over 15 more games to earn the title. He
has spent the past six months as a chess
professional in Europe and won the
prestigious Belgrade Open just before
arriving in Thessaloniki.
The Greeks were generous with their
hospitality. Unfortunately we portrayed
ourselves as ungrateful guests when we
beat the home side 3!4 to !4 in round six.
The following win was the most
spectacular of that match. Playing like a
Trojan, Rogers won from the diagram
position by offering his opponent a
horse which turned out to be a Greek
gift.

We meant business when we developed the
impressive new Cressida.
So much so, that the new Cressida has been im-
proved in every department.
More style, more luxury, and greatly improved
handling and performance.
And new Cressida has been designed exclusively
and specifically as a luxury/performance car. Unlike
other cars in its class which are basically optioned-up
versions of a basic model.
6 CYLINDER WITH ELECTRONIC FUEL INJECTION
New Cressida has the power to lead rather than
follow.
SUPER RESPONSIVE
Featuring Toyota's powerful
6-cylinder ( overhead cam, alloy head,
Super Responsive engine. With the
modern efficiency of Electronic Fuel Injection.
So, it will get you from zero to 100 Ks very quickly,
and very comfortably.
FULLY INDEPENDENT SUSPENSION SMOOTHS THE
ROAD TO THE TOP
New Fully Independent Suspension, a feature
normally associated with European executive cars, has
added a new dimension to the handling and ride of
new Cressida.

A VERY COMFORTABLE SEAT OF POWER.
New Cressida is not only fully imported, it is full of
luxury features that are built-in... not added on!
Power windows, power door locks, tilt steering,
plush moquette seats, electrically operated external
mirrors, a superb stereo - the list goes on - are all
standard. It's a powerfully exclusive package.
You can see the exciting new Cressida now at your
nearest Toyota Dealer. But a test drive is essential to see
how easy it can be to handle a position of power.
It clearly proves that, even in executive circles,
there's no such thing as equality of the sixes!

Reef still a thorny subject
FOLLOWING the Bulletin
cover story by Robert
Raymond last week outlining
the destruction being wrought
to the Great Barrier Reef by
the Crown of Thorns starfish,
the Minister for Arts, Heritage
and the Environment, Barry
Cohen, issued a press state-
ment.
He said survey work by the
Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park Authority contradicted
Raymond’s claim that
widespread destruction of
coral had occurred
throughout the northern half
of the reef. There was almost
no evidence of large popula-
tions of the starfish north of
Princess Charlotte Bay, where
a recent survey had found
only 45 starfish on 32 reefs.
That may be so, but
Princess Charlotte Bay is well
north of Cooktown and so the
authority was surveying only
the northern quarter of the
reef, where tourists rarely go.
As Raymond points out, the
area being devastated is the
middle third of the reef. As
Cohen acknowledged, the
authority’s Crown of Thorns
Advisory Committee has
recommended a com-
prehensive research program
into the infestation.
What Raymond believes is
that the authority is not treat-
ing the problem with enough
urgency.
That there may be grounds
for concern is apparent from
the minister’s previous press
statement on the subject,
issued on November 18.
That statement, issued in
conjunction with the ministers
for Science and Industrial
Relations, Barry Jones and
Ralph Willis, announced that
the Australian Institute of
Marine Science at Cape Fer-
guson was to receive a
$1,016,000 grant under the
Community Employment
program to reopen studies on
the Crown of Thorns starfish.
A total of 55 jobs would be
created around Townsville by
the program. “It is possible
that the starfish may pose a
serious threat to the delicate
ecosystems of the Great
Barrier Reef,” the ministers
said then.
As Raymond has
demonstrated, it is not only
possible, it is highly probable.
We hope the project goes
ahead without delay.

BIG-TIME punter and
former merchant banker lan
Murray made a dramatic
return from a fishing trip last
week to reverse his evidence
in the Fine Cotton case. He
had actually got away from it
all and was in his tent by a
remote Tasmanian lake when
the chief steward of the
Australian Jockey Club, John
Schreck, tracked him down
and persuaded him to return
and tell all.
Schreck may not have
known, but Murray had taken
the trip on orders from his
wife Judy. lan had been so
depressed after being outed
for his participation in the
betting on Fine Cotton that
Judy said: “Oh, for God’s
sake, go fishing.”
lan, a keen trout fisherman
(his Paddington terrace is
stocked with rods), duly went.
So he was ordered to Tassie
by his wife and persuaded to
return by the chief steward. A
man not short of advisers, eh?

Alas, it was actually the

later. “It makes me feel at

Without
prejudice
ANNOUNCING that Mr
Justice Lionel Murphy would
stand trial on a charge of
having tried to pervert the
course of justice, the Federal/
Director of Public Pro-
secutions lan Temby said:
“Now a decision has been
made to prosecute, it is my
earnest desire and hope that
there will be no press specula-
tion about the outcome of the
proceedings.”
The Age, running the story
over most of its front page,
added comments from Op-
position MPs and a comment
piece by its political
correspondent Michelle
Grattan. Grattan said that if
Murphy was guilty the issue
“obviously disappears” but if
he was found not guilty
“political brawling would
continue.”
The Age also ran stories on
the High Court judge all over
page 16, giving background to
the case, opinions of two
former senior judges and an-
other story headed “Bowen is
biased: Opposition.”
For good measure The Age
then threw in an editorial
canvassing the opinion that
even if Murphy is found not
guilty that may not settle the
matter because parliament
could still take action against
him.
Who needs a director of
public prosecutions when we
have The Age?

ONE STORY that was very
hard to find in the Sydney

the case of Thomas Douglas
Watkins, accounting man-
ager, who appeared in
Newtown Court of Petty Ses-
sions on December 13.
Watkins is charged with
having, on or about August
29, stolen $34,930, the pro-
perty of John Fairfax and
Sons. He was then an em-
ployee of Fairfax. The case
was adjourned until January
10.
The charge was first heard
at Parramatta Court on
November 24, where the
police said it was likely
further charges would be re-
ferred.
The amount involved was
not disclosed but bail has
been set at $lOO,OOO.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
THIS WEEK’S column is in
response to a reader’s request.
Some years ago I wrote about the
single exception to the rule
regarding bearing off when only
two men remain in your home
board.
Players make countless mis-
takes when bearing off and it
seems that few are aware of
numerous “rules” regarding the
correct process. Beginners often
ask, “Should one move down or
bear off?” As a general principle,
if you can bear off a man then do
so that’s the quickest route to
clearing your board. This situation
with only two men left occurs only
once the illustration shows it.
If Black doesn’t throw a
winning double on his next roll
then White will have one more roll
to clear his board. White has just
thrown a 5-2; what’s the play? The
normal rule: “Bear off a man if
possible,” doesn’t apply here.
White could move W 6 to W 4 for
the 2, then one man off for the 5.
This is the wrong move.
The correct play is to move
both men as per the arrows W 6
to W 1 and W 4 to W 2. If this is
done no roll will fail to clear
White next throw. Played the
other way, White would have one
man remaining on the 4 point in
that position a roll of 2-1 doesn’t
clear.
This is the sole exception when
there are only two men left to bear
off, but there are others when
three, four or five men are left to
bear off. Work them out for
yourselves.

Final contract - Six Clubs.
Opening lead nine of clubs.
Dear Mr Becker,
To me, bridge is a very relax-
ing game, especially when I’m
asleep! You see, Mr Becker, I am
one of those people who dream
about bridge and find themselves
performing heroic feats which
they could not possibly ac-
complish at the bridge table in real
life.
For example, take this
delicious morsel which arises
quite often while 1 am deeply
ensconced in the Land of Nod. I
can’t tell you how or why I always
get to this abominable contract of
six clubs. But the fact is that I do
and, besides, West always leads a
trump. You’d think he’d occasion-
ally vary his opening lead, but
obviously he hasn’t learned his
lesson yet.
1 play the queen from dummy,
overtaking it with the king, and
draw the missing trumps with the
A-J-10. At the same time, I discard
the A-K-Q of spades from
dummy!
Now I cash the J-10-9 of
spades and exit from my hand
with the deuce of spades. Having
discarded all four hearts from
dummy as the four rounds of
spades were played, there is now
nothing left in dummy but A-K-J-
-9-7 of diamonds.
Poor East, after winning the
fourth round of spades, finds that
all he has in his hand at this stage
are the five diamonds he started
with. He is consequently forced to
return one of them. When he does,
it allows me to score the last five
tricks with the A-K-J-9-7 of dia-
monds, and as a result I wind up
making the slam.
1 don’t know whether there’s
anything instructive about this
hand for your readers, but it
certainly represents an infinite
source of pleasure to me. I only
wish I could play this way when
I’m awake.
Pleasant dreams, Mr Becker.
Cordially yours, Ananias
Jones.


THE BULLETIN'S
family of
genius
The artistic Lindsays are
legend in Australia.
Norman, Lionel, Ruby,
Percy and Daryl all had
close links with The
Bulletin. In these pages we
look back fondly,
reproducing a selection of
the astonishing volume and
quality of their
contributions, and writer

traces the fortunes of a
unique and often eccentric
family.

ALL THE LINDSAYS who
drew worked sooner or later
for the Bulletin, as Patricia
Rolfe noted in her history of
the magazine The Journalis-
tic Javelin. And 70 years ago
three of them Norman,
Lionel and Ruby were in
full cry in the Bulletin’s
columns, to be followed a few
years later by Percy and
Daryl.
But of them all, though
not the eldest (born in 1879,
he was the fifth child and the
third son of the famous
family of Dr Robert Lindsay
of Creswick in Victoria),
Norman Lindsay is the best-
known as a Bulletin il-
lustrator. He drew for it from
1901, when legendary editor
J.F. Archibald offered him £6
a week as a staff artist, until
1958 when his formal con-
tract ended. There were two
breaks when Lindsay went
to London from 1909-11 and
when he withdrew to con-
centrate on other work in his
Blue Mountains home at
Springwood, New South
Wales, from 1923-32.
But in the other years his
output of cartoons, illustra-
tions and joke-blocks was
staggering. His tally of
drawings over nearly 50
years sometimes he con-
tributed three or four an
issue must have run into
many thousands and
whether there was such a
record of journalistic il-
lustration anywhere else in
the world is doubtful.
Lindsay made it to the top
team of the Bulletin’s black-
and-white artists. Phil May
left at about the time Lindsay
arrived. Livingstone Hopkins
(“Hop”) was in full flight in
the early 1900 s and yielded
Norman Lindsay 1879-1969
his place as the Bulletin’s
leading illustrator to
Norman Lindsay only on the
latter’s return from London.
David Low arrived at about
this time and made a great
duo with Lindsay until Low
went on to London and in-
ternational fame as a car-
toonist in 1919.
Archibald knew that
Norman’s rich and idiosyn-
cratic talent offered out-
standing promise toward the
Bulletin’s black-and-white
tradition. Years later, he told
a friend: “Though they were
all great, Norman Lindsay
was the real genius of them
all.” If you add Ted Scorfield
of later years to these
Bulletin top-rankers and con-
cede that Low was probably
more talented and effective
than any of them, purely as a
cartoonist, there is still little
doubt that Archibald’s as-
sessment was correct. For his
all-round versatility as an
illustrator, Norman Lindsay
was king.
Lindsay took to Archibald
from their first meeting.
What linked them closely
was their Australianism;
Archibald’s faith in
Australia and its intellectual
possibilities never faltered
and Lindsay became his en-
thusiastic disciple. They
became life-long friends and
Lindsay never regretted his
years of journalism with the
Bulletin. “I owe to them,” he
wrote “what faculty I
acquired with the pen and
also they gave me a pro-
longed exercise in the
principle of composition, as
roughly as that may be
practised in the political car-
toon. Moreover, one could
feel some self-esteem as a


THE WAR GOD OF EUROPE STRIKES HIS GONG.


member of the staff of that
journal to which this country
owes whatever sound literary
tradition it possesses.”
Lindsay’s versatility was
amazing. He produced his
social or political pro-
paganda drawings, year after
year sometimes inspired by
Archibald’s deep emotions on
certain issues. One of
Lindsay’s first drawings to
put him in the public eye was
his famous Sanger cartoon
on October 25, 1902. A Mrs
Sanger had been convicted in
Victoria of her husband’s
murder and condemned to
death. The woman was preg-
nant and the legal quandary
was whether to hang her
before or after the child was
born. The latter was eventu-
ally decided. Archibald was
outraged at “the legal ghouls
prepared to drag that woman
out of a bed of childbirth and
throw her to the hangman.”
The cartoon eventually
devised by Lindsay showed
how powerfully he could
draw. The condemned woman
in her bed, hideous terror in
her face, sought despairingly
to reach her baby; a harsh-
faced nurse stood beside the
bed and the hangman loomed
over them with his rope. At
its foot stood Irvine, the
Victorian premier, watch in
hand, waiting for the fatal
hour to strike. It was because
of this cartoon that Mrs
Sanger’s death sentence was
commuted to life imprison-
ment. Irvine admitted that he
could not get out of his mind
the cartoon’s implication of
his inhumanity.
World Wars I and II gave
Lindsay tremendous scope
for his propaganda cartoons.
One of them, at the begin-
ning of World War I, earned
him international fame it
was re-published by mag-
azines and journals all over
the world. It was titled “The
War God of Europe Strikes
Again” and some Lindsay
admirers have rated it his
greatest political cartoon.
But I think that others equal
or even better it, such as his
World War II cartoon “At the
Anti-Comintern ‘Confer-
AT THE ANTICOMINTERN “CONFERENCE.”
“With these m[?] I Chee wed,"
ence’,” which depicted Hitler
shackling a beaten-down
woman (Europe) to a
repulsively simian nazi war-
god and had horrifying
overtones of rape and bestial-
ity. Many others were just as
brutal hammer-blows of
naked propaganda.
Lindsay turned these out
in peacetime, too just as
powerful in their exposure of
social and political issues, as
the editorial line of the
Bulletin dictated. But eventu-
ally he wrote to the editor in
the early 1950 s that he did
not want to do any more
political cartoons. “From the
age of 20,” he wrote, “I’ve
been japing at relays of
politicians till the wretched
creatures have no more sub-
stance or reality than astral
spooks which they pro-
bably are. The monotony of
such a job becomes unbear-
able.”
He obviously got more fun
out of his joke-blocks and, as
you look at them from over
50 years or so, you marvel at
their unfailing fertility of in-
vention and originality. It is
not surprising that he kept a
notebook in his vest pocket
and jotted down ideas
whenever they occurred to
him on boats, trains or
trams; in the midst of talk
with a friend; even in the
small hours of the morning.
His chief targets were
wowsers (especially clergy-
men and elderly spinsters)
and corpulent businessmen.
He showed a great affection
for the Irish, a good-humored

compassion for drunks and
an abiding sympathy for the
battlers of the outback and
he loved drawing small boys.
He would sit for hours watch-
ing children at play; their
rompings were special
material for his drawings. As
his biographer John Het-
herington, wrote: “His small
boys were greedy, lawless,
selfish, graceless profane but
true to life; little monsters
perhaps, but fearsomely
authentic.”
When he chose to turn his
hand to it, he could get inside
the spirit of other people’s
writing and illustrate it
superbly as he did with
some of the Bulletin’s early
Selection stories of Steele
Rudd and, many years later,
with The Letters of Rachel
Henning when they were ser-
ialised early in the 19505.
But always most loved of
all were his bird and animal
cartoons ducks, cats, dogs,
kookaburras and especially
his favorite native bears (he
would not use the term “ko


ala.”) Through them, he
ironically and sometimes less
than gently lampooned the
follies and foibles of his
fellow men. Only Scorfield,
could use animal drawings so
effectively.
In a sense, Lindsay was a
black-and-white Orwell in his
use of animals to satirise and
even ridicule human pre-
tentiousness and foolishness
especially in public life. A
classical example of this was
his drawing of the opening of
parliament in 1911 with
nothing but native bears.
Lindsay at his best, in
drawings such as these, was
a joy to millions of Bulletin
readers down the years. As
Douglas Stewart his great
friend of his later years
once observed, there was in
Norman Lindsay a good deal
of the saint, mixed with the
saving grace of humor. •

PERCY, born in 1870, was
the oldest of the Lindsays. If
he was not the best artist in
the family, he was certainly
by all accounts its most
lovable member.
Here, from his auto-
biography, was Lionel
Lindsay’s dispassionate
summing up of his oldest
brother: “He was less of a
snob than any man I have
known; yet he had one grave
fault he suffered any fool
gladly, so that the most
crapulous of knaves became
in his eyes ‘an awfully decent
chap.’ Such was my eldest
brother, an ever cheerful
and wisely selfish nature,
who never allowed anything
to interfere with his
comfort...”
Percy decided while a
teenager at Creswick on a life
in art. When Frederick
Sheldon, a former pupil of
Rosa Bonheur, arrived there
to hang out his shingle as an
art teacher, Percy became his
star pupil. Percy went on to
study at Melbourne’s
National Gallery for a couple
of years before returning to
Creswick.
Here, the lifestyle suited
him admirably. Living was
easy, the girls were friendly,
board cost nothing, meals
were regular and beds soft.
And, above all, landscape
subjects were limitless.
Landscape became his
special love and he was
happy enough wandering
around the bush with easel
and stool, pursuing his favor-
ite problems of painting into
the light and reproducing the
delicacy of tone at the edges
of trees.
Percy Lindsay 1870-1952
In his early 20s he was
turning out delightful small
canvases which, as time went
on, were to earn him a niche
among the painters of
Australian landscape. (Only
recently, several of his early
paintings sold at auction for
prices up to $18,000.)
In his late 20s, he went to
Melbourne to join his
brothers. Lionel had been
drawing for The Hawklet, a
scurrilous rag which
specialised in police court
news and local scandal, as
well as serials with titles
such as “Dimples, a Daugh-
ter of Vice.” When Lionel
went abroad, he got the 16-
year-old Norman down from
Creswick to “ghost” for him.
And when Norman went off
to Sydney to work for The
Bulletin, he handed the
Hawklet job over to Percy
and sister Ruby who worked
on it for £2 a week.
PERCY (though the pencil
never pleased him as much as
did the brush) developed into
an excellent black-and-white
artist with a turn for quiet
and popular humor. These
qualities served him well
when he moved to Sydney in
1917 and settled in the North
Shore area around Roseville.
He found a ready market for
his drawings with The
Bulletin, and contributed to
it regularly for the next 20
years or so. As well, he was
much in demand as a book
illustrator including
children’s books and novels
by Steele Rudd, Randolph
Bedford and others.
All this gave him a useful
income to allow him to

wander around the North
Shore then a bush area
painting his landscapes and
to live a convivial social life
with a coterie of Bulletin
cronies including Will
Lawson, Adam McKay, Unk
White and Les Such who
made his home a merry
meeting-place.
His Bulletin drawings
grow on one for their quiet
wit and they got better and
better as time went on. They
show a sensitive appreciation
of the Australian ethos and
of its laconic attitudes and
reflect the droll sense of
humor of one who so in-
dulgently loved life and its
characters worthy and
unworthy. Stewart tells the
wonderful story of how, after
Percy had visited one of his
colorful friends incarcerated
in Long Bay jail, he returned
to tell the Stewarts with his
usual cheerfulness: “Jolly
nice place; view of the sea,
plenty of fresh air, nice clean
cell ...”
“Slop bomb -Watching for a while, Dave, and come an' have your dinner."


“This’ll be one bit of information the Japs Won't get!”
“ You 're overdoin' the topdressin ', mum.'
I always think of two
things about Percy Lindsay
that Elioth Gruner once
confided to Leon Gellert that
though he respected the
work of Norman and Lionel,
the small landscapes of Percy
had more appeal. The other
is that when Percy died in
1952 the assembly of
mourners at his funeral, it
was said, would have done
credit to a deceased
monarch. And, as Norman
wrote: “As the cortege passed
forth, Unk White shouted
‘Three cheers for old Perce!’
and three hearty cheers were
given. I never go to funerals
but one who was at Perce’s
told me it was quite a gay
affair.”
As a happy postscript,
Percy’s son Peter H. Lindsay
also became an accomplished
artist and graced The
Bulletin with many fine
drawings capturing much of
the impish humor of his
father.


t&Lo/ie/
LIONEL Lindsay (he was
knighted in 1941), born in
1874, was the third-born and
the third son of the Lindsay
family. Like Norman, he was
an extraordinarily versatile
artist but his finest work was
as an etcher and wood-
engraver and he is probably
Australia’s only print-maker
to achieve an international
reputation. His decorative
wood-engravings of birds and
animals will, according to
most art critics, outlive
anything else that he did.
He was at the same time a
painter, illustrator, photog-
rapher (one of our pioneers
in color), art historian and
book designer. He wrote
books and verse and was a
prolific letter writer. And, as
his work over many years for
The Bulletin showed, he was
a splendid black-and-white
artist.
He taught himself to draw
by studying the work of the
English artist Charles Keene
(about whom he wrote a
book) but went to Melbourne
in the mid-1890s he went to
Melbourne to study painting
under George Coates. With
Norman, Lionel eked out an
existence in those depressed
years by drawing for various
periodicals; they also had a
contract to draw Sunday
school pictorial texts
which was abruptly ter-
minated when they in-
troduced some humorous
touches such as Moses carry-
ing a carpetbag and the dis-
ciples dressed in morning
coats with spats and
monocles.
Lionel then went to
Europe where he fell in love
Sir Lionel Lindsay 1874-1961
with Spain he revisited it
several times during his
lifetime and it was the back-
ground for some of his best
landscape paintings. Back in
Australia, in 1904 he became
the cartoonist for the Sydney
Evening News under ‘Banjo’
Paterson’s editorship. Lionel
also got to know Henry
Lawson but always felt that
Paterson knew much more
about the outback than did
Lawson. Yet, curiously,
Lawson preferred Lionel to
Norman as an illustrator.
The writer remarked that
Norman did not know
enough about country life.
Lionel also illustrated
some of Steele Rudd’s Selec-
tion books and collections of
Paterson’s verses.
He began drawing for The
Bulletin in the years before
World War I. Like Norman,
he conceived a great regard
for Archibald; he believed
that Australia would never
have had the great writers of
the period had it not been for
the Bulletin and Archibald’s
leadership and guidance.
Years later, Lionel wrote of
Archibald’s fountain:
“Nothing approaching it
exists south of the line and I
never contemplate its grace
and formal unity but I bless
the giver.”
He sometimes did the
backgrounds for brother
Norman’s political cartoons,
but is best remembered for
his Chunder Loo drawings.
These were full-page car-
toons advertising “Cobra”
boot polish; they had been
started by Norman around
1909, featuring a turbanned
Indian and various animal

friends. Lionel gave them a
new look; he had Chunder
Loo with a koala bear and a
dog and delightful rhymes by
Ernest O’Ferrall who wrote
as “Kodak” a humorous
short-story writer of the day
whose Sydney boarding-
house stories are classics of
our literature.
One of the best of the
series of Chunder Loo
drawings ran in the early
years of World War I, with
the adventures of the hero on
a visit via Italy and Spain to
London and then to the
battlefront. They were later
reproduced in book form,
nowadays a treasured col-
lectors’ item.
Lionel recalled that on
one occasion he found that
other Bulletin cartoonists
were getting £5 a page
whereas he was only making
£2 for Chunder Loo. He told
the editor that he would not
be sweated and demanded
more money. There was con-
sternation in The Bulletin
since, according to Lindsay,
the ‘Cobra’ advertisements
were regarded as its
Children’s Page (he recalled
that he often met people who
said they didn’t like the
Bulletin but had to bring it
home because of their
children’s love of Chunder
Loo). In the end, he agreed to
take £4 provided that
Kodak’s pay for his verses
was raised from five to 10
shillings.
Lionel got to know other
Bulletin personalities includ-
ing Hop whom he described
as “addicted to whisky, bowls
and making cellos and so
puritanical that he never
recognised my brother
Norman except as a source of
evil.” But Hop and Lionel
often had a chat and a
whisky at Pfahlert’s Hotel
and, on one occasion when
Hop went on holidays, Lionel
agreed to do his Bulletin car-
toons. Since Lionel was still
the Evening News cartoonist,
he used the pseudonym

When Hop returned, he
cut Lionel dead on the stairs.
Lionel found out that Hop
alleged himself to have been
deeply offended by the
“Skip” but also found out
that some of Hop’s fellow
club-members had compli-
mented him on the quality of
the cartoons during his ab-
sence. Still, as Lionel also
recalled, Hop got the last
word by signing one of his
cartoons “Jump.”
As well, Lionel did many
joke-blocks for The Bulletin
up till about 1917. All
revealed the Lindsay sense of
humor. One of his pet aver-
sions was evangelical
Christianity. He once
described Billy Graham as
“that go-getting commercial
traveller for J C Ltd.” Con-
sequently, some of Lionel’s
most amusing cartoons are
those ironical, though gently
so, of religion.
R. G. Menzies, a good
friend with whom Lionel
corresponded at length in his
later years, wrote of him that
. he was one of the last of
the great race of letter-
writers and he was a mag-
nificent conversationalist.
Above all, he was a fascinat-
ing, generous, affectionate
man who yet found time for a
certain amount of hearty in-
tolerance and well-selected
hatreds.”
Certainly, Lionel pre-
served his great wit and
sense of humor to the very
end. Just before his death, in
reply to a congratulatory
telegram on his 86th birth-
day, he wrote:
Now at the age of 86
The Time draws near to

Charon, I have my obol

So make the crossing swift
and steady.
As befitted a man of such
culture and catholicity of
taste, he died a little later

under his pillow. •

RUBY, the third Lindsay
daughter and seventh in the
family, was born at Creswick
in 1887 and went to the local
state school. According to
her brother Daryl, she was
“... a reserved, rather shut-
in child with only one in-
terest in life to learn to
draw.” He remembered her
in her teens making sketches
of members of the family as
they sat around the fire on
winters’ evenings.
They all encouraged her
Lionel, Norman and Percy
on their visits home; the
result was that everything,
whether boyfriends, social
engagements or other hob-
bies, took second place to her
ambition to be a black-and-
white artist. There was great
excitement at Creswick when
she got her first cheque for
an illustration in the Lone
Hand; after that, nothing
would hold her.
She went at 17 to
Melbourne where, sharing
an old house with Percy, she
worked single-mindedly at
her art. She lived on next-to-
nothing (her sister Mary sent
her a pound a week), making
her own clothes and attend-
ing the National Gallery
School at night. She did oc-
casional drawings for weekly
papers and for advertise-
ments and posters.
She developed into a most
attractive girl and, through
Percy and gallery friends,
was drawn into
a circle of intellectual
Bohemians which included
the McCubbin family and the
Dysons (Ted, Ambrose and
Will), the theatrical Tait
brothers, other artists and

here she met Jack (later, Sir
John) Latham who later
described her as one of the
most ravishing young women
he had ever seen.
But it was Dyson, the
brilliant caricaturist whose
drawings were a feature of
The Bulletin in those years,
with whom she fell in love
and whom she married in
1910. They went back to
Creswick to be married in the
church next-door and friends
remembered that she took
fright when she looked over
the gate to see half of
Creswick’s population
waiting for her to arrive,
jumped the back fence in her
wedding frock and made her
entry through the vestry.
In 1911, the Dysons sailed
for Europe (Norman Lindsay
went with them) and in Lon-
don Dyson achieved great
fame as a cartoonist for
leading newspapers (G.K.
Chesterton described him as
“probably the most original
cartoonist of our time”) and
later as Australia’s official
war artist with the AIF in
France.
But Ruby by now had
achieved her ambition, too.
She was much-sought-after
as a book and magazine il-
lustrator, with a fine
decorative line in the art
nouveau style. During 1912-
15, as ‘Ruby Lind’, she sent
back many drawings to The
Bulletin. Her elegant, sweep-
ing style was in some ways
similar to that of David
Souter. She could be paid no


MONEY TALES.
Betty: “So you are
engaged? However
did Anderson man-
age it? He is the
most silent man I have ever met."
PEGGY : “Nonsense, my dear! He has nearly
a million."
ON THE QUI VIVE.
Mr. B.: “I've just met your husband. He
said he was keeping a sharp look out fox
you."
MRS. C.: "The wretch! What was she
like?"
higher compliment because,
for nearly 40 years, from the
1890 s to the 19305, Souter
with his Bulletin drawings
was a talented and diverting
chronicler of fashions —•
from the naughty 90s and art
nouveau to art deco and the
flapper age.
Ruby’s cartoon forte was
her brittle, witty and often
ironical evaluation of the
languid social set of the day
probably more related
to the English than to
the Australian scene.
Nevertheless, her graceful
and finely-detailed Bulletin
drawings remain as a fitting
memorial to her talent.
She died of Spanish In-
fluenza in Chelsea in 1919,
during an epidemic which
swept the world. Her brother
Daryl, who had taken her on
a visit to Dublin and Belfast
just before her death, later
wrote: “If it was possible, she
had become with maturity
more beautiful than ever. It
was the kind of loveliness
that had the innocent
freshness of a child.”
Charles Bean, the Aust
ralian official war
correspondent of World War
I, wrote: “There are few
women in the world in whom
pure loveliness, goodness
and brilliance are combined
and Ruby was one of them.”
And the eminent Henry
Tonks, the director of Lon-
don’s Slade School, who
admired the Dysons’ work,
said at the time: “It seems so
wrong that she should have
been picked to go. She was
the most beautiful creature I
have ever looked at.”
Dyson never recovered
from her death, depressed as
he was also by his war ex-
periences. He wrote to his
brother Ted soon after that it
was Ruby for whom he had
worked and that now life
held nothing for him. His
grief, he said, was “like being
torn by the teeth of dogs.” He


found some consolation,
however, in producing a book
of verse entitled Poems in
Memory of a Wife and a com-
memorative volume of her
art, The Drawings of Ruby
Lind, for which he wrote an
emotional preface. “Her
going had a tragedy and a
poignancy above other
deaths ... it was as though
war, before departing utterly
from us, had added her
death.”
They had one child, Betty,
herself a well-known artist,
who died during World
War 11. •

S<f)arpl
DARYL Lindsay (1890-1976;
he was knighted in 1956) was
the youngest of the family
who drew for The Bulletin
he was the ninth of the 10
children and the youngest
son.
His biography, The Leafy
Tree, is among the most en-
tertaining of all the Lindsay
writings and a modest ac-
count of his very consider-
able achievements.
He began life as a
jackaroo, with little thought
of a career in art, and roamed
northern NSW, the Gulf
Country of Queensland and
eventually the NSW Riverina
where, at Hay, he finished up
as Boss of the Board.
He enlisted in the AIF in
1915 and served with great
distinction in the thick of the
fighting on the Western
Front. There he met Bean
(whom he later described as
“a brave man who didn’t see
the war from a comfortable
chair at headquarters”) and
Dyson whom Daryl greatly
admired. Dyson encouraged
him to draw as a pastime in
the trenches. Lindsay began
with drawings of diggers,
stretcher-bearers and tanks
so successfully that, while
still at the front, he
published The Diggers’ Book.
These attracted the atten-
tion of John Masefield and
Philip Gibbs, whom he met;
they suggested he send some
of his drawings to London,
where they were published in
the Illustrated London News
and The Sphere.
Sir Daryl Lindsay 1890-1976
At the end of the war, he
was employed by a leading
London hospital to do surgi-
cal drawings and came under
the notice of Henry Tonks
who threw up a brilliant
career as a surgeon to
become an artist and later
head of the Slade School
where Daryl studied.
He returned to Australia
at the end of 1919 and
became a full-time painter
best known for his landscape
and dance subjects and es-
pecially as an equestrian
painter, for which his early
love of horses and his later
anatomical studies fitted him
so well.
Daryl did not do nearly as
much work for The Bulletin
as did the other Lindsays.
However, in the early 1920 s
he drew celebrities for The
Bulletin’s “Personal Items”
column including
sportsmen, musicians and
theatrical figures. In these he
held his own with such dis-
tinguished fellow cartoonists
at the time as Bancks, Arthur
Mailey and Kirwan
Macgraith.
But quite his best work
for The Bulletin was his il-
lustrating of the serialisation
of Vance Palmer’s Bulletin
prize-winning novel Men Are
Human, in the early 1930 s
a story of the outback where
Daryl Lindsay’s pictures,
beautifully executed, showed
especially his magnificent
capacity for the horse and
horsemanship as subjects of
his art. •

THE
DEFENCE DIARIES
OF
W. Morgan Petty
In February 1983, W. Morgan Petty, a stout Kentish patriot, with his faithful part-
ner Roger, decided to set an example to the world by declaring his house and
garden at Cherry Drive a Nuclear Free Zone. A ware of the immense significance
of this move, he set out to inform other powers and being no pacifist to ask for
help, advice and cut-price weaponry to defend his territory. This diary is a record
of his incredible campaign.
Sunday, 13 February 1983
A cold bright day. Roger, who
comes in to help with the
garden, has picked two
pounds of firm round sprouts.
They do taste so much better
with a frost on them. Over
coffee, he tells me of a very
interesting interview he has
heard with an American gen-
eral. According to Roger, this
general had every confidence
that a nuclear war could be
confined to a small area. I
must say I find this very com-
forting, as neither Roger nor
myself has any argument with
the Super Powers.
Tuesday, 15 February
Roger has put up a sign at the
end of the garden. It reads:
“NUCLEAR WAR - KEEP
OUT.” It is intended, so he
tells me, to denote the point at
which our garden begins and
protagonists in a nuclear war
should cease hostilities. I must
say that I have reservations
about the position of the sign
vis-a-vis the privet hedge. I
think it makes the hedge’s
position ambiguous. Further-
more, it is not a very big sign
and I have doubts whether it
could be seen by a reconnaiss-
ance aircraft. I was going to
mention these points to
Roger, but he had broken the
handle on his hedge clippers
earlier and was in a bit of a
mood so I stayed silent. I did,
however, point out that the
text “NUCLEAR WAR -
KEEP OUT” could have an
unsettling effect on the
neighbors, who might think
we were planning to have one
in the garden. On reflection I
realise this was a mistake, as
Roger pulled up the sign, put
down his spade and went off
in a huff.
Tuesday, 22 February
We have now tried various
ways of denoting our per-
imeters but to no avail. Even
what I thought was Roger’s
brilliant idea of painting the
trees with luminous paint so
that combatants would still be
aware of our borders at night
was not a great success.
Furthermore, he backed into a
tree in the dark and now has
paint on his new anorak.
After much thought, Roger
and I agree that it would
probably be much easier to
formally declare 3 Cherry
Drive a Nuclear Free Zone.
Unfortunately I cannot write
to Mrs Thatcher and Mr
Andropov this evening as
Roger has used the last of the
envelopes for storing his
brassica seed.
Wednesday, 23 February
The big day. I have posted off
a letter to Mr Andropov, the
Soviet leader, explaining my
decision to declare my house
and garden a Nuclear Free
Zone and enclosing a
diagram. I have requested that
Mr Andropov pass this
diagram on to whoever is
responsible for destroying this
part of Kent, asking them to
be very careful to avoid us. I
have further suggested that he
might like to formalise our
state of non-aggression by
means of a treaty, and that we
talk it over one weekend when
he’s not busy. I have also
contacted Mrs Thatcher,
making her aware of our
situation.
Monday, 28 February
Five whole days since our
declaration and no invasion.
Some time ago I saw Mr
Heseltine, the Secretary of
State for Defence, on televi-
sion. He made the point that,
but for the nuclear deterrent,
the Soviet Union would
overrun the West. I must say
that this has not been our
experience. Perhaps to-
morrow I will wake up and
find the garden full of Russian
soldiers but, up to now,
everything has been very
quiet. Tonight I shall drop Mr
Heseltine a line; no doubt,
given his television state-
ments, he will be very in-
terested to monitor the situa-
tion here. Roger has mean


while been sorting through
our weapons of conventional
defence and informs me that
they consist of one nearly new
garden fork and a bayonet his
grandfather brought back
from the 1914-18 war which
has recently been used for
splitting logs. Not much to
hold the Red Army back with
I will admit. I have asked
Roger to dig a shelter when
the weather improves.
Tuesday, 1 March
Roger comes in to tell me that
he will need some money to
put a new handle on the
second of our garden forks.
This he says will increase our
defence capability by some
fifty per cent. On opening up
our Defence Fund, I discover
that it contains only twenty-
eight pounds. Fortunately, it
looks as though we have been
saved by coincidence. Letitia,
one of the Odette sisters,
dropped in for a seed box
Roger had promised her. Over
a cup of tea, I explained that
we had declared the house
and garden a Nuclear Free
Zone. I said that it was pro-
ving expensive and would
doubtless continue to do so.
Letitia says they were discuss-
ing arms expenditure at her
knitting circle only last week
and that Mrs Porter, who does
the fastest plain and purl she’s
ever seen, told her that it costs
the United States government
six hundred pounds per year
to protect every man, woman
and child in Western Europe.
If this is the case, then by
taking over our own in-
ternational security we are
saving the American govern-
ment some twelve hundred
pounds a year. I shall drop a
line to the Secretary of the
United States Treasury and
ask if they would be prepared
to donate half of this saving to
help us over our cash-flow
problem. Roger says that if I
mention mending the garden
fork I should refer to it as “an
implement used in horti-
cultural activity situations
which also forms an integral
part of our conventional
defence equipment,” as this is
the sort of language they
understand. I just'hope they
don’t send us the cash in
dollars as I am not sure they
accept these at the hardware
shop.
Thursday, 3 March
This morning I received a
most welcome postcard from
the Ministry of Defence in-
forming me that the principal
private secretary to the
Secretary of State, Mr
Heseltine, acknowledges
receipt of my letter and that it
is being accorded the most
serious attention. Things are
moving at last, not before time.
Friday, 4 March
Rain. Roger, who had hoped
to fork over some of the veget-
able patch and lay out the
area for the anti-tank ditch
behind the rhododendrons,
spent the morning instead on
the draft letter to the United
States Strategic Air Com-
mand. At lunchtime he
showed it to me and I must
admit to being very im-
pressed. I knew I was right to
ask him to do it. I did, how-
ever, express the view that the
diagram might not give the
USAF enough detail to enable
them to distinguish our gar-
den from the others. However,
according to Roger, military
satellites are capable of read-
ing the print on newspapers
from three miles up. If that is
the case, then they should
have no difficulty in recognis-
ing my garden. It has the only
pond in Cherry Drive with
two Koi carp in it, something
I shall point out in the
finished letter. I shall also ask,
without Roger’s knowledge,
that when they are going to
take the pictures they give us a
few days’ notice as I know
Roger would like to be in
them and how he always likes
to dress up for the camera.
I am disappointed that we
have not yet heard from Mr
Andropov but doubtless he
will want to discuss our pro-
posals with Mr Gromyko,
who, according to Roger, is
still in Western Germany. I
am a little concerned about
protocol for Mr Andropov’s
visit here. I resolve to contact
Her Majesty the Queen; the
last thing I want to do is cause
a diplomatic incident.
Saturday, 5 March
Today we hold our first
parade, Roger in his overalls
with garden fork at the ready.
I must confess my eyes
moisten with pride at the sight
of him standing there pre-
pared to face the enemy
hordes. It was a pity that when
I called him to attention he
slammed the fork down with
such force that the handle
broke off. What we really need
is better equipment, but we
have still not received our six
hundred pounds from the
United States and, after
buying two sun hats, which we
have dyed khaki, there is only
nine pounds and some change
left in our defence fund.
Wednesday, 9 March
No bed until 4.00 am for the
defenders of 3 Cherry Drive.
A night-time exercise in which
Roger and myself test our
“flexible response” strategy,
maintaining a front-line post
down by the compost heap
until overrun and then falling
back to a secondary position
behind the hyacinths. Un-
fortunately, between these
two battle lines lies the pond,
and in his eagerness to retreat
Roger lost his footing and
splashed in, causing the can-
cellation of the exercise. The
Koi carp look no worse for
the experience but Roger was
soaked through and spent two
hours sitting in the kitchen
wrapped in a blanket and
drinking Lemsip. I have a
nasty suspicion he may be
developing a cold, and this at
the busiest time of the year in
the garden. I was just thinking
nothing else could go wrong
when Mr Oliver, a friend of
Roger’s from the Camera
Club, delivered the Guardian.
Now it appears that the new
American Pershing II missiles
have problems with their
guidance systems and are not
landing quite where they
should. This is just the sort of
day when, if the United States
fired off a missile, intending to
demolish Vladivostok, it
would land in the middle of
our garden, and this after all
the hard work Roger has put
in on the seed beds. I shall
have to seek urgent clarifica-
tion on this.
Thursday, 10 March
I am sometimes driven to
wonder who poses the biggest
danger to us here, the Super
Powers or ill-considered
remarks by ministers in


Whitehall? Someone I’ve
never heard of, called Peter
Blaker, who is, it seems, quite
junior at the Ministry of
Defence, described those in
favour of unilateral disarma-
ment as “woolly minds in
woolly hats.” I suppose he
thought he was being clever.
However, his remarks have
caused problems here in
Cherry Drive. He could not
have known, I suppose, that
Roger wears a red and white
balaclava in cold weather.
The result is that, already
showing signs of flu, he has
taken the remark very much
to heart and has gone off in a
sulk. I have come to the con-
clusion that what we need is
some sound military advice
and, as a consequence, have
approached Field Marshal
Lord Carver for his assess-
ment of our military position,
especially as I suspect the
ground between the rasp-
berries and strawberries to be
wide open to an attack by
fast-moving armor.
Monday, 14 March
A letter arrives from Field
Marshal Lord Carver. Now
that’s what I call military
efficiency. Unfortunately he
tells me that he cannot spare
the time for a personal
reconnaissance of our posi-
tion, but he provides very
useful logistical information
about warning devices, the
positioning of anti-tank
weapons, etc. He also recom-
mends preparation for a gas
attack (we still have not heard
from NATO headquarters
about Roger’s “noddy suit”)
and suggests a rota for sentry
duty. It is easy to see how he
became a Field Marshal.
Friday, 25 March
B.ooam. And so ends another
night exercise. We had
intended to try out our new
pincer movement, trapping a
frontal assault from behind
the greenhouse, between the
hyacinths and the laurel bush.
I am fairly confident that once
checked at the laurel bush we
could regroup and push the
enemy back. Roger has
delivered an explosive device
using baked bean tins and
weedkiller (a trick taught him
by Mr Bridger, a local tree-
pruner), and the original idea
was to test this device on the
lily pond as a deterrent to
amphibious attacks. However,
the goldfish and frogs have
spawned early and, in the
interests of conservation,
these tests will have to wait. I
wonder whether they have a
course for people like us at
Sandhurst? It would need to
be a sandwich course because
of Roger’s commitments in
the garden. Maybe they could
supply a prospectus and scale
of fees?
Sunday, 27 March
Today when I take Roger his
mid-morning cup of coffee I
find him not, as I expected,
sowing the first of the early
peas, but asleep under some
sacking in the shed. I was
tempted to wake him, but
reflected on the fact that he
had not finished sentry duty
until three this morning. It
should also not be forgotten
that he spent the 24 hours
before that stringing twine
and baked bean tins around
our perimeter what he, now
that he uses the American
language in defence matters,
calls “an enemy warning an-
nouncement system.” I must
confess that I am feeling the
strain myself, what with the


endless hours over the map
table trying to find a defensive
posture that would stop a
frontal assault securing the
greenhouse. I think that be-
fore we both collapse with
exhaustion we should look for
some help.
Wednesday, 13 April
In the post this morning is a
letter from the headquarters
of the Royal Ordnance
Factory. It seems that the cost
of a new Challenger tank is
greater than I had anticipated
depressing, because there is
less than a pound in the
Defence Fund. Neither do
they do easy terms. Instead,
they suggest that I negotiate a
loan with my bank manager
difficult, in that I do not have
one. Still, it does seem that we
can have the color we want.
Roger thinks blue would be
nice, but I favor maroon. All
we have to do now is raise one
and a half million pounds.
Thursday, 14 April
A note to the Prime Minister.
I am afraid I have to tell her
that we have not, as yet, heard
from Mr Andropov. I am sure
that he intends to reply and
am comforted when Roger
tells me he read in the Daily
Mail that the postal system in
the Soviet Union is as bad as
in the W 1 district of London.
I am sure that she will be
pleased to hear that we have
not suffered an invasion since
we acquired nuclear free
status, and even more pleased
to learn of our intention to
buy British, in the form of a
Challenger tank, rather than
go abroad for our military
hardware. I have taken the
liberty of asking her for a little
something for our White
Elephant Stall.
Friday, 15 April
Roger presents me with a plan
for strengthening our air
defence, showing me an
article in one of the Sunday
magazines about the United
States F-11l aircraft. The
technical data, in between the
advertisements for after din-
ner mints and ski-ing hol-
idays, does look very im-
pressive. The problem is, as
usual, finance, and we still
have not received help from
the federal government in
Washington. On the question
of a pilot, Roger is very keen
to have a go himself. I do
recall a piece in Tomorrow’s
World in which an RAF type
said that, with all the
sophisticated technology
available in fighter aircraft
these days, an idiot could fly
them, and Roger is certainly
not that. He passed his driving
test at the first attempt after
only six lessons in a Morris
Minor. It seems that most of
the flying done by fighter air-
craft is at low level to avoid
radar detection. It would
seem good economics in our
case, therefore, if our F- 111
could be adapted to spray the
vegetable patch whilst on
exercise. I shall write to the
Commanding Officer at the
USAF base, Lakenheath, to
see if such a modification is
possible.
Tuesday, 19 April
A disappointing reply from
the Atomic Weapons Re-
search Establishment at
Aldermaston, about convert-
ing our microwave oven to a
missile deflector. They say
they are unable to give any
assurance that it would be
effective. If they can’t give any
assurance, who can? Still, I
shall let Roger loose with the
screwdriver; we don’t use the
oven much anyway, and it
will soon be the season for
salad. Today I have drawn up,
with Roger’s help, a list of
people we are going to ap-
proach for items for the White
Elephant Stall. Fund-raising
has grown more urgent since
we decided to have the
Challenger modified to
double as a hedge-trimmer.
Top of my list is Winston
Churchill, MP, who was a
junior minister at the Depart-
ment of Defence until some
time recently. Roger says he’s
not too keen on non-nuclear
defence, but he will no doubt
applaud our ‘bulldog’ spirit
and sort out some little item
from his wardrobe. Maybe he
will have a momento as-
sociated with his grandfather
a siren suit, or one of those
long cigars.
Thursday, 21 April
Good news. It seems that a
group called “Defence Begins
at Home” has been set up.
Roger tells me that one of its
sponsors is Admiral of the
Fleet Lord Hill-Norton. I
wrote straight away, as this
sounds just like the sort of
organisation we should con-
tact.


Monday, 25 April
A reply arrives from Lord
Hill-Norton. The efficiency of
these military men is a const-
ant source of wonderment to
me. Not only efficient, but
with an offer of further
military hardware a scythe
with a curved steel blade four
foot long. Roger is cock-a-
hoop. Not only will it help
defend our borders but also
clear out an awkward corner
of couch grass near the
strawberries.
Tuesday, 26 April
A note from Winston
Churchill, MP. That was
quick. I wonder if he too is a
military man. I was expecting
a package with his donation
but when I saw the envelope I
thought a cheque would do
just as well. Unfortunately, he
has sent neither, but suggests
that we safeguard our peace
and freedom by playing a full
part in NATO. I must say
Roger and I had not thought
of that. If we joined NATO,
we might get a few perks
discount on equipment, etc. I
shall write at once to Dr Josef
Luns who runs it, asking for a
brochure for potential
members and an application
form.
Thursday, 5 May
A bad day. I am afraid that
Roger and myself have had
words. I casually mentioned
that as we had not had a reply
from the USAF to our letter
concerning the possible hire
of an F-l 11 aircraft, given our
other commitments we should
abandon the idea for the time
being. I now realise my mis-
take; with the pigeons having
attacked his early peas (we
used the netting to camouflage
the slit trench), Roger was in
no mood to suffer another
disappointment. I had no idea
his desire to be a fighter pilot
was so strong. Perhaps I
should have been warned by
the small silk scarf he took to
wearing after seeing that film
about Douglas Bader. In the
event, I hurriedly withdrew
the suggestion and agreed in-
stead to ask British Aerospace
how much a Hawker Harrier
costs to buy. I suppose the
Harrier does have the ad-
vantage of vertical take-off,
and we could thus do without
the tedious business of build-
ing a runway, something that
would involve moving the
gladioli. Heaven knows how
we’ll pay for it. Perhaps they
will give us a discount for
buying British.
Friday, 6 May
In the Command Bunker/
dining room, here at Cherry
Drive, I am reading Erwin
Rommel’s book on tank
warfare, and deciding how to
make best use of our
Challenger. At 13.40 military
time there is tremendous in-
terference on the portable
radio. With manoeuvres at
night we have taken to listen-
ing to the repeat broadcasts of
The Archers in the afternoon.
This disruption greatly
annoys Roger, who I know is
very worried about the
Grundys.
I understand from Roger
that the USAF intends
stationing EF-111A aircraft at
Upper Heyford, somewhere
in Oxfordshire. Although
neither of us understands all
the technicalities of this new
aeroplane, from what Roger
has read, its purpose seems to
be to jam communications
prior to an attack by other US
aircraft.
What I am very concerned
about, however, is the effect
these EF-111A aircraft’s
jamming may have on Radio
Four.
I shall drop a line to the
USAF at Upper Heyford and
ask them if, as well as black-
ing out Soviet radar, it will
interfere with Gardeners’
Question Time or The Archers
and, if they do have to
retaliate (or dare I suggest
strike first), could they please
avoid doing it on Sundays
between 2.00 and 2.30 pm, or
weekdays between 7.05 and
7.20 pm.
Saturday, 7 May
Last week I settled down with
Roger to watch a program
narrated by Ludovic
Kennedy, called A Guide to
Armageddon. I must confess
that neither Roger nor myself
had any idea where
Armageddon was, and we
couldn’t find it in the atlas.
Roger said he thought it was
one of the Greek islands.
Imagine our shock when we


settled back with our cocoa,
expecting to hear Mr
Kennedy take us on an ex-
ploration of Hellenic glories,
only to find ourselves watch-
ing St Paul’s Cathedral being
blown up by a one-megaton
bomb and assorted couples
trying to live in makeshift
shelters. Whilst I anticipate
that, in the event of a
thermonuclear conflagration,
we shall remain safe behind
our privet hedges, this televi-
sion program has raised the
question of what we shall do
for water and sewerage ser-
vices if the area outside our
zone, which we rely on for
their provision, is destroyed?
Curtailment could present us
with a hygiene problem. I am
already concerned about the
effects of Mr Bridger’s gift of
manure, which Roger has left
piled near the greenhouse. If
we had to suffer a similar odor
for any length of time after a
nuclear attack, it would be
most distressing. Roger
suggests I drop a note to Tom
King, who is the Secretary of
State in charge of sewage at
the Department of the
Environment. I just hope he
replies soon. This is urgent.
Monday, 9 May
A reply from Sir Austin
Pearce, the Chairman of
British Aerospace. He thinks
the down-thrust of the
Harrier’s exhaust would
damage the gladioli and the
paintwork on the house.
Saturday, 28 May
Two letters today. The first is
from a major in the Parachute
Regiment. He suggests that we
buy a record: Get Fighting Fit
With 2 PARA. I must admit to
finding it all a little dis-
illusioning. I had visions of
men being trained by wiry PT
instructors with muscles of
iron. It now seems that they
all get together in the barrack
square and put on a seventy-
eight. Still, I shall send for the
record. Maybe there’s a good
battle song on it somewhere.
The second letter is from the
Royal Air Lorce. It seems that
they have taken to answering
the USAL’s mail as well now.
At least its content is
encouraging and confirms
that the USAL will not under
any circumstances interfere
with Radio Pour. I must say
that’s a great deal off my
mind.
Wednesday, 1 June
A letter from the Greater Lon-
don Council. I must admit
that I suspect the writer, Mr
Simon Turney, to be not en-
tirely serious in his reply.
However, it certainly cheers
up what is another black day.
On the question of the pur-
chase money for the Chal-
lenger, the Royal Ordnance
Lactory suggested applying
for a bank overdraft. Not
having an account, it is pro-
bably better to start negotia-
tions at the top. Consequently
some days ago I approached
Lord Boardman, the Chair-
man of the National West-
minster Bank. I have ex-
plained the position here and
that our immediate problem is
one of finance. I do not
anticipate needing the whole
of the £1.5 million as a loan if
we receive enough items for
the White Elephant Stall; if
the weather is kind to us, this
should raise four hundred
pounds, leaving us with what
I think is called, in bankers’
parlance, “a considerable
shortfall.” I have therefore
asked Lord Boardman
whether the National West-
minster Bank would be able to
meet this shortfall, some one
million, four hundred and
ninety-nine thousand, six
hundred pounds, in the form
of an unsecured loan. When I
discussed this matter with
Roger he was very sceptical of
the bank’s willingness to lend
so much without security but,
as I pointed out to him, many
banks, including I understand
the Nat West, have made
loans of a much shakier
nature to countries like Brazil,
Mexico and Poland.
Saturday, 4 June
A letter from the United
States. At first 1 thought, from
its bulk, that it was our six
hundred pounds. We could
use it. Instead it is from a
Joseph D. Lehman replying
for Ambassador Adelman in
Geneva. He thanks us for our
offer of help, from which I


assume that they do not want
Roger to go to Switzerland.
He will be so disappointed.
Enclosed with Mr Lehman’s
letter is a copy of what I think
is now known as President
Reagan’s “Star Wars” speech.
On reading the full text, both
Roger and myself are disap-
pointed that there is no
mention of converting
microwave ovens. Also in the
post is a note from Sir
Michael Tippett. It seems he is
too busy to consider writing a
battle song especially for us
and suggests we try, like Ivor
Emmanuel in the film, Men oj
Harlech. I have therefore
planned a rehearsal for
tomorrow evening and have
asked Viola Odette, providing
her legs are not playing her up
too much, to accompany us
on the piano. If the rehearsal
goes well, I shall consider this
as being our offering for the
purpose of cultural ex-
changes. On that front, I have
suggested to Mr Popov, the
Soviet Ambassador, that we
could perhaps arrange such
an exchange with the USSR. I
wonder if the Bolshoi Ballet
are very busy in the autumn?
Monday, 6 June
Roger has taken to blowing
reveille in the morning. I must
confess that his trumpet-
playing is not very good and
Mr Bridger, hearing it for the
first time, thought it was an
alarm and rang the fire
brigade. The second post
brings two letters. The first is
from Lord Boardman at the
National Westminster Bank.
Unfortunately, he cannot loan
us the full one and a half
million pounds because he
says it does not add up to a
“viable banking proposition.”
However, he does say that if
we raise the first £1,499,600
then the Nat West will see if it
can manage the last four hun-
dred. It’s a start, I suppose.
The second letter is from
Marconi Space and Defence.
My inquiry to Marconi was
for something that would
warn us long enough for
Roger to sprint from the
greenhouse and take off in
time to confront the enemy. It
would also be helpful if it
could give us notice of the
impending arrival of starlings
and wood pigeons which,
despite the netting, are
making a terrible mess of the
early peas. The reply, signed
by General Sir Harry Tuzo,
tells us that we have come to
the right place.
Saturday, 10 September
There are some days when,
despite the threat of invasion
by hostile forces, I think I
should have stayed in bed.
Operation Clematis (so called
because it involved a great
deal of climbing) was a disas-
ter. The object was to test our,
or rather Roger’s, prowess at
crossing a mined area. Not
having any actual mines, we
denoted the danger zone with
the lids of coffee jars, thought
to make it more realistic.
Roger did put up a sign with a
skull and crossbones on it and
I found a thunderflash left
over from last year when we
had the Odette sisters around
for bonfire night. All was
going quite well, with Roger
spreadeagled across the rope
bridge, pulling himself along
by his hands. It was at this
point that I threw the
thunderflash. I had not told
Roger of its existence, as I
wanted to test his reaction to
sudden explosions. I think
this was a mistake as, with the
bang, he jerked up and down
on the rope bridge before one
end gave way and he fell
rather awkwardly on to the
newly erected sign. Fortun-
ately he is not badly injured,
but when I took him a cup of
tea and some aspirin he was
rather sharp, saying “some-
body had not been practising
their reef knots.” In this kind
of mood I have found it is
always better to leave him on
his own. I wonder if that’s the
approach they adopt in the
SAS?
Wednesday, 14 September
In the light of our experiences
yesterday, I reflect again on
the necessity for some formal
military training. The reply to
our request for details of a
sandwich course at Sandhurst
seems to have gone astray in
the post, or maybe they are
full up. Roger says we should
try somewhere else. The
French Military Academy is


the nearest, but still far
enough away for us to have to
board. I must admit that I am
not too keen on the Ecole
Militaire as, though Roger has
an O-level in the language, I
have barely a dozen words
a handicap which once led
me, on a day trip to Boulogne,
into ordering three uncooked
cauliflowers and the waiter’s
left shoe for lunch. I think in
the circumstances we had
better stick to the mother
tongue, which leaves us with
the United States Military
Academy at West Point.
Together we compose a letter
explaining our position and
giving details of our recent
manoeuvres.
Friday, 2 December
A letter arrives from Mr
Winston Churchill. I wrote
him a little while ago explain-
ing that we had followed his
advice and made inquiries to
join NATO but that we had
not received a reply. I know
that Dr Luns is a busy man,
adding up all the Soviet tanks
and aeroplanes, or whatever
else it is he does, but seven
months does seem a long
delay. I therefore thought Mr
Churchill might know the
Secretary General personally
and could put in a quiet word
to speed things up. It seems
that Dr Luns is soon to retire,
and Mr Churchill suggests in-
stead that we contact an or-
ganization called “Peace
Through NATO.” I shall do
this tonight. I wonder if the
perks of belonging to this are
as good.
Friday, 9 December
A letter arrives from
Buckingham Palace. Un-
fortunately the Prince of
Wales will not be able to join
us for our musical evening as
it seems his program for the
first six months of next year
has already been arranged.
That is very disappointing.
Wednesday, 8 February
Two disappointing missives
arrive today. The first is from
the Charity Commission. Un-
fortunately we do not appear
to come within their terms of
reference and cannot
therefore claim charitable
status. This will greatly disap-
point Roger who has, in
anticipation, already made a
number of collecting boxes
and a flag cushion. The
second is from the Liberal
leader, David Steel. He, too, is
the bearer of bad news. It
appears that as leader of his
party he can only recommend
honors for people with service
in politics. Roger did once go
to the hustings, for the council
elections, on a really blustery
and wet night, but I suppose
that doesn’t count.
Friday, 10 February
A letter arrives from Professor
Freedman at King’s College,
which I read to Roger and Mr
Bridger whilst they are pre-
paring the shallots for sowing.
It seems the purpose of this
War Studies course is to ex-
plore war as a phenomenon.
Blank looks all round. He also
somewhat chastises us for
what he describes as a “sexist”
presumption that females are
better for nothing more than
“tea and sandwiches.” Oh
dear, we do seem to have got
off on the wrong foot. Perhaps
I should drop him a short note
explaining about the “help”
we have been getting from a
feminist friend. I just hope
that if we do eventually
undertake his course he won’t
hold this little misunderstand-
ing against us and give us
detention.
Wednesday, 15 February
Excitement mounts as we ap-
proach the celebrations for
our first anniversary. I have
not heard from Mrs Thatcher
yet, nor Mr Reagan, who I
also invited to attend. This
merriment overshadows the
bad news we have had from
the Parachute Regiment who,
it seems, are not in a position
to sell us a secondhand par-
achute and suggest we try the
RAF instead.
Tuesday, 21 Febuary
I have received a letter from
the Ministry of Defence,


which offers me the use of an
airship and protection by a
Trident submarine. Having
read it all I suspect the hand
of a forger, although the
notepaper and envelope look
genuine enough. I tell Roger
that it is in extremely poor
taste.
Wednesday, 22 February
Away in the distance, Mr
Bridger’s bonfire is glowing
brightly against the winter sky
and the Odette sisters are
baking potatoes in foil at its
base. Can it really only be a
year since our momentous
declaration? We have
struggled against such odds
and come through. Especially
Roger, who only this
morning, putting up the bunt-
ing, hit his thumb with the
hammer and had to be rushed
to hospital to have the nail off.
However, I think I can safely
say that we have set down a
solid base from which to
march onward. We still have
the Challenger to look
forward to. □


CHRISTMAS GAMES
by DONEGAN
of Punch
“Good God! You’re not still playing
games by hand, are you?"
“Don’t be childish, Leslie! You can’t be the
Murderer every time."

plays - and he always plays to win."
“Who’s for a quick game of Monopoly while
Clive is carving the turkey?”


MAILER MEETS HIS MACHO
When Clint Eastwood met Norman Mailer, the masculine'mSy
BACK IN 1967, I was trying to
cast The Deer Park for Off-
Broadway and needed a tall,
young, clean-cut American to
play the hero. Only you
could not find talented actors in
New York with such looks
they were all on the West Coast.
One day, drinking a gloomy beer,
I happened to glance at an old
black-and-white TV set which
had been muttering in the corner
all afternoon and noticed a man
on a horse. “There’s the guy,” I
cried it was much like a scene
out of films one used to see
“that’s the man we want. There’s
our Sergius O’Shaughnessy.
The director’s name was Leo
Garen and he looked at me in
pity. “Yes,” he said, “he’d be
wonderful. But we can’t afford
him.”
“Why?” I asked. “It’s a soap opera.
He’s probably dying to get into a play.”
“No,” said Garen, “this is an old
rerun of Rawhide. The actor you’re
looking at i§ the hottest thing around
right now.”
That was my introduction to Clint
Eastwood. Now, looking back on his
years of starring in films which return
prodigious profits, it is obvious that he
satisfies some notion in hordes of
people of how an American hero ought
to look.


ILLUSTRATION BY MICHAEL TERRY
and the masculine intellect hit it off very well


Norman Mailer: I’ve seen an awful lot of
presidential candidates and you’re one of
the few people who could go far that way.
Clint Eastwood: ( laughs )
Mailer: I’m not kidding. There’s one guy
in 500 who’s got a presidential face and
usually nothing else.
Eastwood: If I’ve got the presidential
face, I’m lacking in a lot of other areas.
Mailer: Well, all lack it.
Eastwood: I don’t feel I could get up and
say a lot of things that I know I couldn’t
perform on. Yet, they have to do that to
win. The ones that are honest about what
they can or can’t do don’t have a chance.
LET US ASSUME that we are strangers
and searching about for a topic of
conversation at dinner. We discover
that we are both interested in Clint
Eastwood.
Yes, I admit, I happen to know him.
Immediately, your mood improves.
Well, I say, I don’t know him very well
but he’s an interesting man. He’s hard,
however, to understand.
Do you like him?
You have to. On first meeting, he’s
one of the nicest people you ever met.
But I can’t say I know him well. We
talked a couple of times and had a meal
together. I liked him. I think you’d have
to be around for a year before you saw
his ugly side, assuming he has one.
It would take that long?
Well, he’s very laid-back. If you
don’t bother him, he will never bother
you. In that sense, he is like the
characters he plays in his films.
I begin to expatiate. I describe
Eastwood on our first meeting. I talk
about his tall presence, which is ex-
ceptional exactly as one would wish it
to be in a movie star. He certainly has
the lean, self-contained body that you
see only in the best dancers, rock
climbers, competition skiers and
tightrope walkers. His face has the same
disconcerting purity. You could be
looking at a murderer or a saint... Men
who have been in prison for 20 years
sometimes have such a look and you
can see it on monks and certain
acrobats with fine and tragic faces.
He’s marvellously friendly. Just
saying hello. He has no fear of others.
At least, he shows none. I tell you, it was
splendid. I rarely liked a man so much
on first meeting.
Good Lord. What did you talk
about?
Well, Eastwood said right off: “Do
you know I tried to get into The Naked
And The Dead back when they were
making a movie of it years ago but they
didn’t want me?”
“That’s fair,” I told him. “We tried to
get you for The Executioner’s Song. I
wanted you to play Gary Gilmore.”
Clint only answered: “What would
you say Gilmore was like?”
Rawhide star Clint Eastwood shows wife Maggie the ropes
“Oh,” I said, “he was a funny man,
Gilmore. Very spiritual on the one hand
with a real mean streak on the other.”
Eastwood gave a happy grin.
“Sounds as if he would have been just
right for me.”
That conversation took place outside
a shabby Spanish-style stucco motel
near the beach in Santa Cruz, Cal-
ifornia. Eastwood was on location
making Sudden Impact and the small
crowd watching us stood outside the
company barrier.
They had been hanging around for
hours in the hope that they would get a
look at him. In the background, you
could smell boardwalk popcorn and
hear the downrush of the roller coaster
after a long clanking up the first rise.
Some kids with orange hair were stand-
ing next to a black girl outside the
movie company rope and a couple of
old ginks with slits in their sneakers and
patience in their eyes were waiting
beside the rope, never getting bored.
Once in a while, Eastwood walked in
and out of the movie trailer trucks or
mobile dressing rooms parked along the
side street off the motel and it was then
that they would have their glimpse of
him. He might even offer a line as he
went by. “Still with us?” he would ask.
“Oh, yeah, Clint,” they would reply.
Merely by standing behind this rope,
they felt glamorous.
One fellow tall, not bad-looking,
with a dark suntan to set off his dark
goatee was brought up to Eastwood
by one of the company people. “Clint,
this fellow has a gift for you.”
It was a short leather cape of the sort
Eastwood used to wear in Sergio Leone
westerns 20 years ago when Clint
played the cowboy who had no name,
rarely spoke and walked about with the
stub of a pencil-thin cigar in his mouth.
A killer stared back at you then the
stills taken from those spaghetti
westerns certainly made him famous in
Italy, then all Europe, then the world.
Now, Clint Eastwood said softly to the
man bearing him the gift: “You keep
this.”
“I want you to have it, Clint.”
“Better not. You might change your
mind in time to come.”
“I never wear it,” protested the man
with the goatee. “This cape is right for
you.”
Eastwood, however, was accepting
no gifts he would cast away. That could
leave a bruise on the mood. “No,” he
said softly. “I really don’t need it; I
have a number of capes already.”
You make him sound good, my
partner remarked.
Since we were warmed up, I went on
about commanders in forward com-
panies during World War II and how
you could tell at once if they were
respected from the mood that came off
the first gun trained on your approach.
Forward companies in Luzon lived
on outposts in the hills and sometimes
had no visitors for a week at a time. To
drop in on them was a little like
boarding a ship. You never had a guess
about morale. The mood told you im-
mediately how the men felt.
If the company commander was


Director Eastwood on the set of Civil War drama, Beguiled
well-liked, morale was as high as the
greeting you get from a large, happy,
impressive, slightly crazy family. Every-
body feels manic in the wealth of their
people. The same, I suggested, could be
said of movie sets.
They are able to offer great morale,
awful morale or anything in between.
Eastwood might be renowned for bring-
ing in pictures ahead of schedule and
under budget but he was also most
popular with his crew. That was appar-
ent. They adored him.
Of course, not everyone might wish
to be adored by a movie crew. They
have a great sense of humor for jokes
that go with a few beers but little
tolerance for a fancy mix. They are
good enough trade unionists to suspect
that art is phoney and would never trust
any male who could not lift his own
weight in movie equipment.
A TALENTED author once remarked
that he discovered the truth at the point
of his pencil in the act of writing. It
occurred to me that I usually came
across the truth while talking. I would
say things and, by the tone of my voice,
they would seem true or not.
When I said that Clint Eastwood was
an artist, I liked the ring. It was true. It
might also be true that he was a timid
artist.
That made a nice paradox. For, by
any physical terms, he was a brave man.
Once, after a plane crashed at sea, he
saved his life by swimming five
kilometres to shore.
He did some of his own stunts in
movies and learned to rock-climb for
The Eiger Sanction. The film was
embarrassing, a prodigiously multi-
colored plot equal to ice cream on
turnips, but Eastwood’s rock-climbing
was good.
He rode a horse well. He did car
racing. He even looked, on the basis of
Every Which Way But Loose and Any
Which Way You Can, as if he might
make some kind of boxer. He had a
quick left jab with good weight behind
it. He could certainly draw a gun.
If it came to great box-office movie
stars competing in a decathlon, East-
wood would hold his own.
He was also capable of fine acting.
With a few exceptions, he under-
stood his role and did a good deal with
the smallest moves. Critics had been
attacking him for years over how little
he did on-screen but Eastwood may
have known something which they did
not.
The plot of a film works, after all, for
the star. The more emotion that a story
will stir in an audience, the more will
the audience read such feeling into the
star’s motionless face. The facial action
of the movie star sometimes might offer
no more movement than a river bank,
yet there is nothing passive about such
work. A river bank must brace itself to
support the rush around a bend.
I ALWAYS WAS a different kind of
person, even when I started acting. I
guess I finally got to a point where I had
enough nerve to do nothing ... My first
film with Sergio Leone had a script with
tons of dialogue, tremendously exposi-
tory, and I just cut it all down. Leone
thought I was crazy. Italians are used to
much more vocalising and I was playing
this guy who didn’t say much of anything.
I cut it all down. Leone didn’t speak any
English, so he didn't know what the hell I
was doing but he got so he liked it after a
while.
THERE IS a moment in Play Misty for
Me when Eastwood’s character, an
easy-going disc jockey, realises that he
has got himself into an affair with a
hopelessly psychotic woman.
As the camera moves in, his stare is
as still as the eyes of a trapped animal.
Yet his expression is luminous with
horror.
He is one actor who can put his soul
into his eyes.
The real question might have little to
do, however, with how much of an actor
he could be. What separated Eastwood
from other box-office stars was that his
films (especially since he had begun to
direct them) had come to speak more
and more of his vision of life in
America. One was encountering a hard-
working, everyday, subtle American
philosophy in film.
Burt Reynolds’ films also give us a
vision of the taste of life in America but
it is not so much a philosophy as a
premise. Eat high on the hog, they
suggest. The best way to get through life
is drunk.
Since it’s possible that half the male
population of America under 40 also
believes this, Reynolds is endlessly reli-
able. Of course, like many a happy
drinking man before him, the Reynolds
character takes no real chances just
falls and smacko collisions. The car gets
totalled but Burt is too loaded to be
hurt. He leaps to his feet, pulls the
fender off his neck with a sorry look and
we laugh. The best way to get through
life is drunk.
Eastwood is saying more.
If you discount his two worst films in
these past 10 years Firefox and The
Eiger Sanction if you bypass Dirty
Harry, Magnum Force and The Enforcer
as movies made to manipulate audi-
ences and satisfy producers, you are
also left with High Plans Drifter, The
Outlaw Josey Wales, Every Which Way
But Loose, Bronco Billy and Honkytonk
Man.
A protagonist in each of these five
films stands near to his creator.
Eastwood has made five cinematic
relatives. They are spread over more
than 100 years, from the Civil War to
the present, and the action is in different
places west of the Mississippi from
Missouri to California.
They are Okies and outlaws,
truckers, rodeo entertainers and country
and western singers but they come out


of the odd, wild, hard, dry sad, sour
redneck wisdom of smalltown life in the
South-west. All of Eastwood’s knowl-
edge is in them, a sardonic and
unsentimenal set of values that is equal
to art for it would grapple with the roots
of life itself.
“When things get bad,” says the
outlaw Josey Wales, “and it looks like
you’re not going to make it, then you
got to get mean I mean, plain plumb
dog mean because, if you lose your
head then, you neither live nor win.
That’s just the way it is.”
One has to think of the depression
years of Eastwood’s childhood when his
father was looking for work and taking
the family up and down the San
Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, out
there with a respectable family in a mix
of Okies also wandering up and down
California searching for work.
Those Okies are in Eastwood’s films,
as must be the gritty knowledge he
gained over the seven years he worked
on Rawhide.
How many bit players and cowboy
stunt men passing through Rawhide’s
weekly episodes were also a part of that
migrating country culture which was yet
going to present itself to us by way of
CBs and pick-up trucks and western
music?
“You’ve got to outlast yourself’ was
the only way to talk of overcoming
fatigue. The words happen to be
Eastwood’s but the language was shared
with his characters, brothers in the same
family, ready to share a family humor:
It is that a proper orangutan will not
miss a good opportunity to defecate on
the front seat of a police cruiser, as it
did in Every Which Way But Loose.
Smalltown humor but, in Honkytonk
Man, his last film before the one he was
shooting now, it became art.
Mailer: How did you feel about
Honkytonk Man before it came out?
Eastwood: I thought it was good, as
good as I could do it. I did it in five weeks
—five weeks of shooting and I felt good
about it. I felt it might find a small
audience somewhere that might enjoy it. I
wasn't looking for a big film. I just
figured, sometimes you have to do some
things that you want to do and be selfish
about it.
HONKYTONK MAN starts in the
Oklahoma dust-bowl of the 30s and
follows a drunk, all-but-destroyed,
country singer named Red Stovall on
his car trip east to Nashville. He has
been given an invitation to audition at
the Grand Ole Opry and it is the most
important event of his life. Red Stovall
has very little left: ravaged good looks,
a guitar and a small voice reduced to a
whisper by his consumptive cough. He’s
a sour, cantankerous, mean-spirited
Action with Jessica Walter in Play Misty for Me
country singer who smokes too much,
drinks too much and has brought little
happiness to man or woman a sorry
hero but still a hero.
On stage at the Grand Ole Opry, out
front before the producers, there in the
middle of singing his best, he has to
cough. Worse: He is so stifled with
phlegm that he must stagger off the
stage. The picture is about to end in
disaster. Still, he is given a reprieve.
A man who makes records is also at
the audition. He has liked Red’s voice
and comes forward with a proposal.
Red, given the treachery of his throat,
can hardly perform before an audience
but maybe he can do a record session.
They can lay the track between the
coughs. So he is able to sing on the last
day of his life and makes one record
before he dies. His whispery voice, close
to extinction, clings to the heart of the
film.
It is as if every economy Eastwood
has picked up in acting and directing
found its way into the film.
Something of the steely compassion
that is back of all the best country
singing is in the movie and the harsh,
yearning belly of rural America is also
there used to making out with next-to-
nothing but hard concerns and the
spark of a dream that will never give up.
Honkytonk Man was the finest movie
made about country plains life since
The Last Picture Show and it stood up to
that comparison because of what
Eastwood did with the role. A subtle
man was brought to life with minimal
strokes, a complex protagonist full of
memories of old cunning deeds and
weary sham. It was one of the saddest
movies seen in a long time yet, on
reflection, terrific. One felt a tenderness
for America while looking at it.
The miracle seemed to happen now
and again. Once in a great while, movie
stars become artists and that always has
been moving. It gave a little hope. We
are not supposed to get better once we
are very successful.
Mailer: Those must have been incredibly
tough years for you when you were
scuffling as an actor.
Eastwood: Oh, I hated it, absolutely
hated it. I tell people, if you really want to
do it, then, you must be willing to study it
and stick with it through all opposition
and having to deal with some of the most
no-talent people in the world passing
judgment on you. They're going to pick
the worst aspects of you or of anybody
else that they cast. If you can take all that
and keep grinding until some part comes
along that fits you and your feelings,
sometimes the odds will come up for you.
Mailer: How did you handle the rude-
ness?
Eastwood: I hated it. I wanted to pull
people out of their seats and say, “Don’t
talk to me that way. ”
Mailer: I just realised that, in a lot of the
Dirty Harry movies, you’ve got a deep
well of anger to dip into.
Eastwood: (laughs) Oh, yeah, it’s easy.
People think I play the anger well. All you
have to do is have a good memory.
IT WOULD be agreeable to end right


A more recent cinema success in Firefox
here. Not every movie star pays his
dues, takes his bad years, becomes an
artist, does it his way and leaves us with
an on-going inclination for the dry
wisdom of his stuff.
Eastwood, however, has another
side. If his best movies come out of a
real need to comprehend his part of our
American roots, there is another
category of film he makes most
skilfully which is full of manipula-
tion. He also knows how to press the
secret buttons in his audiences.
Art is democratic. It is the hope that
you may arrive at a truth with your
audience. Something happens in the
heart of the ticket-buyer exactly because
there wasn’t a calculated attempt to
twitch his feelings like reflexes. Art is
thereby made difficult and so it rarely
works as well as manipulation.
The reviews for Honkytonk Man
the most quietly daring film Eastwood
has made were, for the most part,
cruel. Reviews usually came in bad for
Eastwood films but it did not matter:
They could bring in large box-office
with the worst reviews. Honkytonk Man,
however, did not. It was a disaster
critically and financially.
Eastwood once said: “I was never a
discovery of the Press” and the remark
is crucial. He had been discovered by
the box-office. He could forgo favorable
reviews but not good box-office.
After the jolting failure of Honkytonk
Man, pressure had mounted from all
sides to do another film about “Dirty
Harry” Callahan.
Of the five movies bringing in
Eastwood’s greatest profits, three had
been about Callahan an outlaw cop
who did things on his own.
Callahan broke villains in two with
his Magnum. Audiences cheered.
Eastwood had tired of making profit-
able movies about Dirty Harry Cal-
lahan. After filming three between 1971
and 1976, he had shot none since. But
now he accepted. He would act in and
direct Sudden Impact.
The original script showed three men
fatally shot in the groin by a woman. It
is in retaliation for being raped by them.
Dirty Harry knocks off eight sleazos
himself. There are also six flashbacks to
the rape.
It is a Dirty Harry Film. But for the
emphasis on woman’s rights (which
moves Callahan to allow the girl to go
free at the end), there are no new
elements. The script gives us 40 killings,
rapes, fights and other condiments. It is
as full of ingredients as the first Dirty
Harry.
Mailer: Does the question of moral
responsibility weigh on you ?
Eastwood: How do you mean?
Mailer: You can have arguments whether
Dirty Harry reforms more criminals than
he stimulates.
Eastwood: I never feel any moral prob-
lems with these pictures. I felt they’re
fantasy.
Mailer: Come on. In Sudden Impact,
three men are shot in the groin by a
woman. It's possible that some man or
woman out there who never thought of
doing that may now.
Eastwood: I don’t think my movies are
that stimulating. People in the audience
just sit there and say, “1 admire the
independence. I'd like to have the nerve
to tell the boss off or have that control
over my wife." In the society we live in,
everything is kind of controlled for us. We
just grow up and everything’s kind of
done. A lot of people are drawn to an
original like Dirty Harry. The general
public interpreted it on that level, a man
concerned with a victim he'd never met.
Like everybody says, "Boy, if I was a
victim of violent crime, I’d sure like to
have someone like that on my side. ’’ And
I think a lot of people believe that there
isn 7 anybody who's willing to expend that
kind of effort if they were in that situa-
tion.
Mailer: There may not be.
Eastwood: There may not be. Right.
Tliat may be the fantasy that there
might be someone interested in my prob-
lem if I was ever in that spot. That preys
on people’s minds these days with crime
in America, in the world: Jesus, is there
somebody there, is there anybody there?
I LET IT GO. He was making a film and
I did not know that I had the right to
argue with a fellow artist when he was at
work. Professionalism, in the absence of
other certainties, becomes your guide.
Besides, I was not sure how I felt.
Violence in films might have no more
impact on future deeds than violence in
dreams. Who could separate the safety
valve from the trigger spring?
I let it go. I liked Clint Eastwood.
Kin to him, I trusted my instincts.
What if several hundred bodies were
strewn across the 30 films he had made?
It did not matter. In his movie gun-
fights, those bodies flew around like
bowling pins. The violence happened so
quickly that an audience was more
likely to feel the kinetic satisfactions of
a good strike in a bowling alley than to
savor the blood. Besides, nobody of
virtue was ever killed by Eastwood.
Perhaps he was right. Perhaps it was
fantasy. How else account for the confi-
dent sense of duty in his person, his
character and his deeds?
What an American was Clint
Eastwood! Maybe there was no one
more American than he. What an in-
teresting artist.
He portrayed psychopaths who acted
with all the silence, certainty and
gravity of saints. Or would it be closer
to say that he played saints who killed
like psychopaths?
Not all questions have quick
answers. Sometimes it is worth more to
dwell with the enigma.
In the interim, he is living proof of
the maxim that the best way to get
through life is cool. □

WEIRD WORLD OF
SPORTS
On and off the field, the
world of sport abounds
with fascinating
background glimpses of its
champions - as JOHN
BYRELL shows
It has always been the nature of the
wonderful and wide world of sport,
through its events and the doings of its
participants, to provide followers with an
endless flow of off-beat stories some oj
them quaint, some amazing, some sad,
silly, funny, serious which the average
sports fan either stumbles upon or just
never hears about.
WHEN BILLIARDS magician Walter
Lindrum was born (he was so good and
set so many records top break 4137
which were and still are virtually
unreachable that he almost as-
sassinated his own sport), his father
Fred and the distinguished operatic
tenor Wallace Brownlow Were getting
blotto in Fred’s pub in Kalgoorlie and
trying to work out a name for the new
arrival. It was the singer who downed
his ninth middy of Swan and pointed
out to Fred, as his son was a true-blue
Western Australian, why not make his
initials W.A.
And so it was that Fred Lindrum’s
second son became Walter Albert
Lindrum
AUSTRALIAN swimmer Murray Rose
had a mother who was a health food
fanatic and one of the dishes she used to
make for him was a type of seaweed
jelly. She travelled all over with her
youngster making the stuff.
Two big American universities which
battled to get Rose on a sports
scholarship waged a “seaweed war,”
each claiming that it had the best
seaweed in the United States.
In the end, Murray chose a univers-
ity in Los Angeles - because his chief
aim in life was to be a film star.
ROCKY MARCIANO, perhaps the
greatest biffer of them all, got his first
real taste of pugilism when he was in
England during World War II as a
private with the 150th Combat
Engineers and did not like the way a
bully-boy colleague was attacking his
mates and taking their money. So
Marciano challenged the pug, thrashed
him and went on to become services
champ on his road to the world
heavyweight title.
A CERTAIN county cricketer in
England was being pasted by the
thunderbolts of Dennis Lillie - first the
head, then the elbow, then the groin, the
head again, the groin. As Lillee was on
his run-up for the next delivery, the
poor bruised Pom put up a hand and
yelled: “Stop!”
The umpire asked what for. The
batsman replied: “I’d like the sight
screen moved.” The umpire said
certainly and where to?
The reply: “To the middle of the
pitch, please.”
PRIDE cost jockey Neville Sellwood
his life. He had been offered the ride on
the Melbourne Cup favorite of 1962 and
had accepted it and made arrangements
to come home. Then he realised that he
was in a good position to take out the
French jockey’s championship for that
season.
Sellwood changed his plans and
decided to stay put. He was killed in a
tumble on a French track on November
7 in the seventh race on the card on a
horse called Lucky Seven.
THE LEGENDARY Australian grey-
hound Chief Havoc was lucky to have
lived let alone develop into arguably
the greatest of racing dogs.
Jack Millerd, with a mate, was
driving along the Werris Creek road
after a workout session with a string of
young greyhounds in 1944, when his
friend looked into the back of the truck
and said: “Jack, one of your dogs is
missing. We’d better go back and look
for him.” Millerd said: “No use, Roy.
It’s dark now. And he wouldn’t have
survived the fall anyway.”
Two days later, a neighbor _ rang
Millerd and said: “Hey, Jack,' this
morning I found this poor battered
greyhound pup by the side of the road.
You’re the only greyhound trainer for
miles. Reckon he’s yours. Want to fetch
him? He’s nearly dead, though.”
Millerd fetched him and Chief
Havoc went on to win 26 from 36 races
and set many records.

greatest lightweights in boxing history,

THE MIGHTY American pacer Dan
Patch was the first of his kind to clock
under two minutes for the mile a feat
which even these days is rated as
exceptional. At Memphis, Tennessee, in
1904, Dan Patch clocked 1 min 56%sec.
The following year he clocked, at St
Paul, Minnesota, lmin 55sec flat and
that record stood for 32 years.

The accidental owner, Dan M6s&ner,

JUAN FANGIO, the Argentinian
world champion racing driver, was such
a good soccer player in his teens that
merchants from his home town Balcarce
passed the hat around and collected
enough money to buy the young ap-
prentice mechanic a small garage to
keep him local.
Fangio became interested in cars.
JIM FERRIER, the golfer from Manly
who settled in the US, notched an
astonishing seven holes-in-one. In 1946,
in the San Francisco Open, he holed in
one twice and, even then, did not win
the tournament.
AT MEREWETHER Beach in New-
castle in 1898, a seven-year-old girl was
swept out into the surf and was on the
point of drowning when a big dog swam
out and grabbed her and held her above
the waves until she was rescued. Her
name was Fanny Durack and she would
become one of Australia’s greatest
swimmers.
IN THE 1898 winter, a Sydney rugby
union side was being ferried to Hunters
Hill for a first-grade game. The
“skipper” of the vessel was a chunky,
barefoot 15-year-old called Dally
Messenger.
The team’s captain suddenly dis-
covered that they were a player short.
He asked young Messenger about
making up the 15, as stand-in.
By halfway through the match the
bootless lad had scored so many tries
that the game had become lopsided and
many of the spectators were going
home. So the two captains got together
and made a rule that Messenger was not
to run past halfway. He did not. But he
then proceeded to win the match with
field goals.
WHEN THE remarkable English speed
ace John Surtees still the only man to
take out world titles on both two and
four wheels turned 12, his father (who
ran a motorbike shop and was a
champion motor-bike rider who took
his son to see his first dirt track event
when the boy was two) presented him
with an old two-stroke Wolf.
“But, son,” instructed John Surtees
Snr, by then well aware that he had
sired a true chip off the old block,
“you’re not going to ride it - not until
you can take it apart and put it together
again as fast as I can.”
WHEN he was 18 for reasons doctors
could not explain the incomparable
rugby league centre three-quarter Dave
Brown lost every hair on his body. They
just inexplicably fell out in the space of
two months.
Brown covered some of his
embarrassment with a thick wig. Then,
during the trip to England for the 1933-
34 Kangaroo tour, an over-exubrant
colleague swiped the hairpiece and
tossed it through a porthole.

by Dally Messenger in 1911 never put
on a wig again.
TY COBB, the highest-scoring batter in
baseball history, was universally hated
by public and players alike.
One of his little tricks consisted of
filing the spikes of his baseball boots to
needle sharpness so that he could inflict
painful and sometimes serious injury on
basemen when he made his “slides.”
ONE FOUL night in the Yarmouth
winter of 1849, an 18-year-old part-
gypsy lad stood outside a pub playing
his violin in an effort to make a few
pence. He was set upon by three sailors
who smashed his fiddle.
The lad broke one of the tars’ jaws
with a short right and flattened another
with a left hook and the third attacker
took off on the double.
Someone who saw the incident
advised the boy that he could make a lot
more money with his fists. He took that
advice and the career of Jem Mace
last of the bare-knuckle British
champions was under way.
TOP Australian racehorse trainer, the
ultra-shrewd T. J. Smith found himself
in a bit of a bind. He had just been to
the 1955 New Zealand yearling sales
and returned with more than a dozen
thoroughbreds all but one of which he
had been able to sell to stable clients.
Just when he thought that he was
stuck with the small, swayback, plain-
looking bay colt by Khorassan out of
Florida, Smith remembered an 80-year-
old Bathurst grazier E. A. Haley
who had an interest in horses. Smith
made a deal with him and received a
cheque for $2200.
After that, Tulloch went on to win
what was than a record $220,247 in
stakemoney.
FOR downright nastiness in the annals
of boxing, it is hard to go past the deeds
of one-time American world welter-
weight champ Kid McCoy.
One regular ploy the Kid adopted
was suddenly to say to a younger
opponent: “Son, why is it you’re not
wearing regulation boot laces?” His
opponent would glance down in-
stinctively and the Kid would go whack.
When the old-style tights were
replaced by shorts, around the turn of
the century (at a time when most things
went in a professional stoush), the Kid
would go into a clinch and reef his
opponents’ tights down to his knees.
While the red-faced rival was frantically
trying to pull them back up, the Kid
would once more go whack.
THE Melbourne Cup suburb of
Flemington started out as a small village
on the banks of what was the Saltwater
River. When the hamlet was becoming
established, the residents cast about for
a name and decided to honor their
popular butcher Bob Fleming. Before
that, the racetrack which was well estab-
lished before the township was called
the Saltwater Course.
GREAT American Negro baritone Paul
Robeson in 1915 when he was 17
won a scholarship to Rutgers University
where he proved to be not only a fine
student but also a magnificent athlete
who excelled at basketball, football,
baseball and track and field events. He
made such an impact on American
football that after Rutgers he made
enough money out of playing to finance
another university course in Law.
And he was such a good boxer that
two big promoters wanted him to train
to fight Jack Dempsey for the world
heavyweight crown. Robeson turned
them down and stuck to his Law studies.
WHEN 19-year-old Neil Harvey
walked out to the crease at Headingley
on the morning of July 24, 1948, to
shape up for his first Test match against
England in the fourth match of the
series, the Australians were in terrible
strife.
With great batsmen such as Morris,
Hassett and Bradman already back in
the pavilion and the score at 3-68 you
would not have blamed the youngster
for being scared stiff.
Instead, when he reached the wicket,
he said to partner Keith Miller: “What’s
going on out here? Let’s get stuck into
them.” Harvey proceeded to knock up a
flawless 112 and set Australia on the
way to a win. □

Bhopal: Who Was to Blame?
Fearful survivors struggle to get on a train leaving town: Illness, panic and wild desperation to escape from a stricken city
Investigators raise troubling questions about Union Carbide’s safety procedures.
Like mop-up troops swooping into a war
zone, planeloads of doctors, scientists
and lawyers descended on Bhopal last week.
They were hunting for reasons behind the
worst industrial accident in history—a poi-
son-gas leak from a Union Carbide plant
that killed more than 2,500 people in and
around the central Indian city. But instead
of answers, the visitors found only despair
and panic. Thousands of the city’s residents
were sick, some were dying. Bhopal’s bus
depot, railway and gas stations
teemed with people desperate
to get out of town. Those who
stayed were still on edge. When
a fire-engine siren started wail-
ing one night, scores of people
ran through the streets in ter-
ror. “Right now Bhopal is in
terrible shape,” said Mayor R.
K. Bisarya. “People .. . are
very agitated, very angry and
not willing to believe anyone.”
While the city struggled
through the aftermath of the
tragedy, disturbing new ques-
tions arose about safety condi-
tions at the Union Carbide
plant. Officials at the com-
pany’s headquarters in Dan-
bury, Conn., released a 1982
inspection report citing 10 major safety vio-
lations in the Bhopal factory. Spokesmen
said the problems were later corrected. But
discrepancies in their disclosures, and evi-
dence of overzealous cost-cutting by the
plant’s local managers, suggested that over-
sights may have continued—and may have
contributed to the accident. Five teams of
American lawyers filed negligence suits
against Union Carbide in various U.S.
courts on behalf of the gas-leak victims

(box). And in an editorial, The Times of
India accused the company of the “crime”
of “having attached greater importance to
production and profits than to proper
maintenance.”
Union Carbide released the 1982 “Oper-
ational Safety Survey” after the Los An-
geles Times acquired a copy from an Indian
journalist who had covered the Bhopal
plant. The company refused, however, to
allow the three inspectors who produced
the survey to meet with report-
ers. The New York Times did
report that one of the inspec-
tors, C. S. Tyson, said that
standards at the factory had
not been up to those at a similar
Union Carbide plant in Insti-
tute, W.Va., which was shut
down after the Bhopal acci-
dent. But a Union Carbide
spokesman said that Tyson’s
alleged statement “did not
match with the information
that the company has.”
‘Concerns’: In all, the 1982
report cited 21 pages’ worth of
problems, including 10 “major
concerns” that increased the
“potential for a serious inci-
dent or more serious conse-


quences should an incident occur.” The
inspectors specified the risk of a release of
toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas—the
chemical involved in the Bhopal disaster.
They noted the absence of a water-spray
system to control gas leaks; they also count-
ed numerous deficient safety valves and
instruments. Spokesmen said that the fac-
tory directors later sent an “action plan” to
experts in West Virginia, and that the fac-
tory manager wrote a letter stating that
most of the recommendations had been car-
ried out. But there was never a follow-up
inspection.
While Union Carbide headquarters was
handling the release of the inspection re-
port, members of the House Subcommittee
on Health and the Environment flew to
Institute to meet with the company’s top
brass. Union Carbide chairman Warren
Anderson —who had been briefly arrested
by Indian police when he tried to inspect the
Bhopal plant himself four days after the
accident—surprised some of the congress-
men by calling for tighter federal regulation
of the chemical industry. “I’m on your
side,” he insisted.
Justifiable Demands: But most of the com-
mittee was skeptical. Its chairman, Rep.
Henry Waxman, Democrat of California,
pointed out that Union Carbide had op-
posed new safety legislation in the past.
And Rep. Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of
Maryland, asked why the company had
not drawn up an evacuation plan that
could have prevented the “chemical Hiro-
shima” in India. A more hopeful note was
sounded by Gus Speth, president of the
Washington, D.C.-based World Resources
Institute, who testified on the Bhopal trag-
edy’s implications before the House Sub-
committee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
“It is likely,” he said, “that Bhopal will
become the chemical industry’s Three

Mile Island,” a reference to the near-disas-
trous nuclear reactor incident in Pennsyl-
vania five years ago. ‘‘Just as TMI spurred
a thorough assessment of the safety of
nuclear power, Bhopal will bring justifi-
able demands [for measures to insure that
nothing like it] can ever happen again.”
In Bhopal, workers for Union Carbide
charged that over the past few years, the
plant’s managers had taken drastic —and
imprudent —measures to cut costs in an
effort to offset poor sales of its “Sevin” and
“Temik” insecticides. (The company’s own
records show that the Bhopal plant had
never been operated at more than half its
5,000-ton annual capacity.) In 1982, plant
officials began trying to lay off workers,
offering $2,450 to anyone who would re-
sign. In 1983 the number of operators in the
MIC production unit was cut from 12 to 5.
Last month the maintenance engineer on
each shift was eliminated. There were also
frequent personnel changes. Gori Shankar,
one of the supervisors on the MIC unit
during the disaster, had arrived in Bhopal
only two months before from a Union Car-
bide battery-division facility in Calcutta. At
least three key supervisors, including one
trained in West Virginia, were transferred
over the past two years to other Union
Carbide plants.
There had in fact been public protests
about the potential dangers, both from fac-
tory workers and from concerned local resi-

dents. In 1982, a group that included J.P.
Gupta, one of the operators on the MIC
unit, put up warning posters around the
plant and in Bhopal itself. “Due to poison-
ous gas,” the posters read, “thousands of
people’s and workers’ lives may be in danger
.. . There are hundreds of accidents due to
incomplete safety rules and regulations.”
Mayor Bisarya says he too was concerned,
but that he also was reluctant to risk losing a
plant that provided so many jobs to city
residents. “We never seriously tried to close
the plant,” he said last week. “We just
couldn’t take away the bread and butter of
two to three thousand people.”
Whether or not the early warnings were
heeded, it was clear that numerous safety
hazards did exist at the time of the accident.
Two of the plant’s three MIC storage tanks
had been overfilled. The “vent scrubber,” a
device used to neutralize gas in case of a
leak, was under repair. An 80-foot flare
tower, designed as a “failsafe” to burn off
any gas that missed the scrubber, had been
shut down for two weeks. A cooling system
inside the storage tanks had been out of
order for months. Workers charged that
when a government inspector visited each
month, he rarely set foot outside the plant
manager’s office.
Precautions: Although local authorities
still planned to shut down the Bhopal fac-
tory, they first had to dispose of 15 remain-
ing tons of MIC. Arjun Singh, the chief
minister of Madhya Pradesh state, an-
nounced that the gas would be turned into
pesticide inside the plant, rather than at-
tempting to transfer it elsewhere or break it
down chemically into less toxic compo-
nents. The minister insisted that every pre-
caution would be taken: the operation
would take place only during daylight
hours, a helicopter hovering overhead
would spray water to dissolve any escaping
gas and families would be allowed to evacu-
ate to the city’s schools. Singh would be
present in the plant, along with the team of
Indian scientists and a Union Carbide ex-
pert who are overseeing the clean-up.
But the people of Bhopal weren’t con-
vinced. Four hundred buses that had ar-
rived for standby use from around the state
last week were quickly packed with families
seeking to get away. The night of Singh’s
announcement, more than 5,000 people
jammed the city’s railway station; at least
one man was killed when the surging mob
pushed him into the path of an arriving
locomotive. Officials say that it will take
about five days for the remaining gas to
finally be dispersed, after which most of
those who have fled are expected to return
to begin trying to put their lives back togeth-
er. Even those who escaped unscathed,
however, will not forget Bhopal’s terrible
night of death —or easily lose their fear.

A Lawyer’s Game of Chicken
Belli in Bhopal: Raising the ante —and angling for an out-of-court settlement
In the aftermath of disaster, he made
a familiar sight: an American, dressed
in blue jeans and a sport shirt, moving
slowly through Bhopal’s sad slums with
his assistant. He paused at the sagging
shacks and, through interpreters, ex-
pressed condolences for the deadly Un-
ion Carbide accident. But instead of dis-
pensing food, painkillers or heavenly
salvation, John P. Coale was collecting
signatures on a freshly minted retainer —
thoughtfully printed in English and Hin-
di. Claiming more than 7,000 new cli-
ents, Coale was gearing up to sue the
chemical company back in the United
States for negligence, demanding a ma-
harajah’s ransom in damages.
Even as Coale worked the streets, the
Los Angeles firm of Gould and Sayre was
trying to set up a legal-action commit-
tee with Indian lawyers. Publicity-con-
scious Melvin Belli lingered in New Del-
hi, holding press conferences and seeking
the government’s cooperation. “We’re
just humanitarians —capitalist style,”
said Ted Dickenson, Coale’s assistant.
Their real aim, said Jay D. Gould, who
flew in from Los Angeles, was to force
multinational corporations to clean up
their operations in the Third World.
Without such high-minded inten-
tions, the descent of the lawyers might
seem to be long-distance ambulance
chasing. But all of them appear to have
had some sort of contact with actual
Indians before setting off. Coale says he
was approached by Indian lawyers
working in Washington. Belli was called
by a Florida lawyer born in India who
asked for help; four days following the
accident, after two injured Bhopal resi-
dents had been found, Belli filed the first
suit, a $l5 billion class action. “It’s im-
portant to be first,” said Belli’s associate
Richard Brown. “It gets the advantage
of attracting other cases.”
Tort: While their stratagems vary, all
of the lawyers agree that the cases must
be brought in the United States and not
India. Their reasoning: American juries
are more likely to award huge damages;
American tort law may hold Union Car-
bide “strictly liable” for the gas leak, and
finally, American law permits lawyers
to work on contingent fees, taking up to
roughly one-third of any damage award
as their payment. By contrast Indian law
requires plaintiffs to pay stiff fees when
they first file their cases, forbids contin-
gent-fee arrangements and is so slow that
it makes the cumbersome U.S. system
look positively streamlined,
Beneath all the maneuvering is a high-
stakes game of chicken. None of the
lawyers believe that these cases will ever
come to trial. Instead, all sides will seek
to jack up the ante until settlement talks
can begin in earnest. One alternative
might be a deal between Union Carbide
and the Indian government, creating an
enormous damages pool out of which
victims could be paid. But that system,
too, would probably be challenged in a
court somewhere.

Rajiv Gandhi’s First Test
In the twin shadows of the Bhopal gas-
leak tragedy and Indira Gandhi’s assas-
sination, India is now heading into a nation-
al election campaign. That has never been a
peaceful event: goon-squad violence, rhe-
torical mudslinging and bribery remain as
much a part of electioneering in India as are
the millions of garish posters plastered up
along crowded city streets. The current
campaign that will end next week is no
different. But for Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi, his late mother’s son and succes-
sor, it could be a crucial test.
Gandhi and his Congress (I) Party are
virtually certain to retain their heavy major-
ity in Parliament. Prior to Indira Gandhi’s
murder by two of her own Sikh bodyguards,
there had been a string of embarrassing
losses in important state-level contests.
Those defeats gave rise to questions about
how many of India’s 390 million eligible
voters would support the party. But now
Rajiv Gandhi will certainly be able to capi-
talize on a heavy sympathy vote. His moth-
er’s legacy will be his greatest asset. In
addition, despite a widespread reputation
for corruption and misgovernment, Con-
gress (I) remains overwhelmingly the coun-
try’s largest and richest political group.
And with an average of 10 candidates run-
ning for each seat in Parliament, the myriad
other parties seem virtually certain to spoil
their chances for success.
What is primarily at stake in this election
is Rajiv Gandhi’s personal command of
Indian politics. By reputation he is a reluc-
tant leader at best, a former airline pilot who
only acceded to his mother’s dynastic wish-
es when his brother Sanjay died in a flying
accident four years ago. Now he is being
called to the test: will he be able to demon-
strate that he is capable of governing India?
It was no accident that Gandhi focused
his campaigning last week on Uttar Pra-
desh, his family’s home state and the heart
of the so-called Hindi belt—the six
northern states that fill 40 percent of
the seats in Parliament. Driving from
town to town, accompanied by his
Italian-born wife, Sonia, he delivered
brief speeches in a measured voice
that hammered away at the key
themes of the ruling party’s cam-
paign: the ineptitude of the fractured
opposition, the perils of regional or
religious separatism and the unity
provided by his mother’s Congress (I)
party. He has not shied from invoking
the theory—so far, totally unpro-
ven—that Indira Gandhi was mur-
dered as part of a larger conspiracy.
“Her assassins didn’t just want to
remove her,” he told one rural audi-
ence. “They wanted, by killing her, to
dismember India.”
Prescient: There has, in fact, been
nothing subtle about the campaign
for a sympathy vote. Throughout the
country, 20 million poster-portraits
of the slain prime minister have been
pasted up, with the eerily prescient words
she spoke only a day before she was killed:
“If I die today, every drop of my blood will
reinvigorate the nation.”
Indira Gandhi’s murder has clearly de-
railed the once strong effort by Sanjay’s
widow, Meneka, to oust Rajiv from his
parliamentary seat at Amethi, a sprawling
rural constituency in Uttar Pradesh. That
bitter race —from which all other would-be
contenders have wisely stood aside —has
been transformed by the events of the past
two months from an attempt by Meneka to
attack Indira Gandhi’s dynastic preten-
tions into an effort to unseat an incumbent
prime minister. Meneka showed no signs
of letting up, even as Rajiv toured the area.
But the prime minister’s supporters now
wield a powerful message—the obvious
advantages of having India’s new leader
Meneka campaigning: Indira Gandhi’s death has made her uphill battle even tougher
Rajiv in Uttar Pradesh: Can he govern India?
as Amethi’s own man in New Delhi.
Rajiv’s men also missed no chance to
emphasize the likely consequences if he
lost. “Get it removed,” one local Congress
(I) boss angrily told a shopkeeper in
Amethi who had a Meneka slogan on one
of his walls. “I’ll be back.” Such thinly
veiled warnings have found an unsettling
echo in the violence that has flavored the
national campaign so far. In Gwalior, op-
position candidate A.B. Vajpaynee was
hospitalized after being set upon by thugs.
And near Allahabad, a veteran opposition
leader, H.N. Bahuguna, narrowly escaped
injury when a truck drove straight at his
election motorcade. In Uttar Pradesh, one
opposition party worker was burned to
death, allegedly by Congress (I) Party
hoodlums.
The inevitable danger in it all is that the
combination of the ruling party’s
muscle, the opposition divisions and
the sympathy voting will once again
give the ruling party parliamentary
power out of proportion to its actual
support. (In fact, even Nehru himself
never won an absolute majority of the
popular vote.) Rajiv’s real test may
come at the state level, where Con-
gress (I) cannot so easily bring its
influence to bear —and where the
three main opposition groups have
far greater power. If Indira Gandhi
had been in danger of any kind of
political setback, it would have been
over her attempts to tighten the
reigns on restive local administra-
tions, especially in the volatile south.
Her son, if he is not to run the same
risks, will have to try to heal wounds
as well as govern.

Will the Mines Be
Closed Permanently?
Aftermath: Removing the dead from Haishan
TAIWAN
The bystanders called it a miracle. Four
days after an explosion buried him in the
depths of the Haishan coal mine in Sanh-
sia, Taiwan, Chou Tsung-lu was alive.
After the blast, Chou managed to inch his
way toward the mine entrance, crawling
between chunks of rock and the bodies of
some of his 90 fallen comrades. He made
painfully slow but steady progress until the
third day, when he was overcome by hun-
ger. “I couldn’t stand it any longer,” said a
tearful Chou. “I carved some flesh from
the calf of a dead body.” Hearing that
pathetic and gruesome news last week,
Hsu Li-teh, Taiwan’s economics minister,
decided that enough was enough. “The
only way to stop disasters,” he said
in a report to Parliament, “is to close all
the mines.”
Depleted: That will not be a step that
Taipei undertakes lightly. After decades of
exploitation, Taiwan’s coal deposits have
been virtually depleted; last year they
yielded a mere 2.3 million tons, just 4.3
percent of the country’s total energy de-
mand. But since coal is Taiwan’s only
major domestic source of energy, the gov-
ernment has always insisted that it is a vital
link in the country’s national security. The
domestic mines have thus been protect-
ed —and kept profitable —through a sys-
tem of substantial price supports and ac-
cess to preferred markets.
Taiwan’s mines were especially deadly
during 1984. Last June a coal-dust explo-
sion in a Taipei County mine killed 74 men;
in a nearby mine just three weeks later, 103
workers died in a fire, the worst mining
catastrophe in the country’s history. In the
last six months alone, at least 269 miners
have been killed. After the two huge disas-
ters this summer, the government called for
a strict new round of mine inspections and
then ordered that 36 mines be shut down.
To make up for the coal-production short-
fall, Taipei announced a new, liberalized
coal-import policy. Now large consumers
will be able to buy coal directly from foreign
producers without first obtaining a govern-
ment license.
That, of course, will be a devastating blow
for Taiwan’s coal industry, which has bare-
ly been limping along for the last 15 years.
Without the government supports, most
mines would have gone under long ago.
Since 1969 the ranks of miners have
dropped from 59,000 to just 16,000, and the
number of working mines has dwindled
from 322 to 130. Many mines are simply too
small to be efficient —or to afford the neces-
sary safety equipment.
Ironically, however, the latest disaster
occurred at a model mine. Authorities had
repeatedly applauded Haishan for its rec-
ord; last July a group of visiting Japanese
mining experts rated its safety features on a
par with their own country’s mines. And
just 10 days before the explosion, the Hai-
shan mine received an award for technical
excellence. Even so, the mine at Haishan
was old and dangerously deep. Last sum-
mer a team of six South African experts
concluded that most Taiwanese mines of
its age and depth were too dangerous to
work —hardly worth the risk, given the
thin and widely scattered deposits they
yielded.
Closed: Late last week the government
temporarily closed all the country’s mines
for new inspections. Even before the Hai-
shan disaster, the government had pro-
posed a tax of one-half of 1 percent on all of
the country’s energy imports, which would
go into a special fund to help retrain miners
for new careers or pay pensions for those
who want to retire. Now the measure will
probably pass quickly. Once it does, Chou,
55, will probably be at the head of the line of
those seeking early retirement. After more
than 10 years in the mines, last week he was
asked if he ever wanted to go underground
again. His reply: “Not anymore.”

Time for a Rude Awakening
Chinese government workers —and in
the collectivist monolith that means
practically everybody—are in for a rude
awakening. Come the first of the year,
the time-honored two-hour lunch break
will be cut in half. The move, part of
Deng Xiaoping’s campaign for in-
creased productivity, is intended to
boost efficiency among the generally le-
thargic ranks of state workers. So far,
Deng’s reforms have been well received.
But meddling with the constitutionally
guaranteed midday snooze is about as
popular as insomnia.
Virtually every segment of Chinese
urban society recognizes the sanctity of
the lunch break. Workers at banks, air-
lines and government offices routinely
shut their doors promptly at noon and
retire to cots and mattresses convenient-
ly provided in their offices. So devoted
are the Chinese to their right to rest that
tourists are usually frustrated in their
attempts to book airline tickets, hail
cabs—or do much, if anything, else —
during that time,
The abbreviated lunch break may
cause some difficulties for the tens of
thousands of workers who bicycle home
at noon to eat with their families. As one
Chinese worker lamented: “If our lunch-
time is shortened, parents can’t go home
to look after their children. If parents
can’t go home to look after their chil-
dren, how will the children be awakened
from their naps to return to school?”
To calm the potential uproar, Peking
municipal officials have promised to
open more fast-food restaurants, an al-
ternative that most Chinese find un-
palatable. Not to worry, though. As a
sweetener for the shortened lunch break,
workers will be allowed to go home an
hour earlier.

A War for Independence
Pisani (left) arriving in Noumea: ‘The challenge will be not to go too far, too fast ’
NEW CALEDONIA
For the past month, the once tranquil
South Pacific island of New Caledonia, 750
miles east of Australia, has been racked by
violence as militant Melanesians, known as
Kanaks, have agitated for independence
from France. Hundreds of French settlers in
the countryside have been held hostage or
forced to flee. The violence has presented
French President Francois Mitterrand with
yet another foreign-policy headache. Last
week News week’s Carl Robinson visited
the island and filed this report:
The rebels finally lifted their three-
week blockade of Thio, a nickel-
mining town of 3,000 people on New
Caledonia’s east coast. They took their
shotguns and went back to their villages.
But the remnants of their occupation—
half-dismantled roadblocks, pro-inde-
pendence graffiti, looted or burned
buildings—littered the town. At the de-
serted town hall, the flag of the inde-
pendence movement still fluttered in the
tropical breeze. The streets were empty.
The French gendarmes were still barri-
caded in their headquarters, but most of
the Europeans and non-Kanaks had fled
to the capital, Noumea.
Those few who remained sat or stood
at the doors of their shuttered homes.
Sylvain Blum, a third-generation cal-
doche (French settler), spoke of how the
Kanaks held sway over the town, sys-
tematically searching each home for
weapons, and confiscating his collection
of shotguns and pistols. “After this,
things can never be the same for us
again,” he said. “We want to leave, but
we have nowhere to go. This is our home.”
New Caledonia is locked in a struggle
between those who want independence and
those who want to remain an “overseas
territory” of France. What happened in
Thio has been happening in numerous other
settlements on the island as Kanak militants
try to put an end to the French colonial
presence. The confrontation is reminiscent
of so many other battles that have been
fought in developing lands. Many towns
and settlements outside the capital have
been abandoned by the settlers. True, the
A Kanak rebel: A pervasive tension
residents of Noumea still patronize chic
boutiques, sit at open-air cafes and dine at
the best restaurants. Tourists, including
planeloads of Japanese honeymooners, con-
tinue to pour in, and along the city’s fash-
ionable beaches, Australian and New Zea-
land visitors mingle with topless French
sunbathers. But the tension on the island
cannot be ignored.
Heavy colonization in the late 1950 s and
early ’6os left the Kanaks a minority in their
own country —60,000 out of a total popula-
tion of 145,000. Earlier this year, when the
French government proposed a gradual
five-year plan for independence starting
with elections for a territorial government,
the increasingly militant Kanaks openly re-
belled. They boycotted and disrupted last
month’s elections, isolated the capital with
barricades and declared a provisional gov-
ernment. Some of the more militant rebels
looted and burned homes in areas under
their control.
Two weeks ago, a group of militants was
ambushed by settlers at a roadblock and 10
Kanaks were killed. Calls for a Melanesian
“payback” to avenge the murdered Kanaks
were defused when eight mixed-blood set-
tlers were arrested and charged with the
crime. But sporadic incidents of lootings
and burnings continue to shatter the is-
land’s calm.
Militancy: France’s special envoy, Ed-
gard Pisani, is seeking to find common
ground between the two diametrically op-
posed factions in New Caledonia. It will not
be an easy task. Both sides toughened their
positions in the negotiations that began late
last week. The anti-independence side,
dominated by right-wing Gaullists, has re-
newed its call for Paris to dismantle the
provisional government. It also charges
that granting New Caledonia independence
would violate the French Constitution.
Fear of a growing militancy among the
Gaullists is now being fueled by rumors of
an imminent right-wing Putsch. Kanak
leaders are equally strident in their de-
mands, but they are approaching the negoti-
ations cautiously. They are pushing for
Kanak independence from France, as dis-
tinguished from the multiracial autonomy
that most other pro-independence support-
ers favor. Though the Kanaks say that the
French could play some role in the island’s
future, perhaps running the economy, for
example, many French settlers fear that an
independent state under the Kanaks’ terms
will mean exile for them.
Pisani is determined to find a solution
within two months. He has pledged to re-
port to the population of New Caledonia by
early January and to the French National
Assembly one month later. There is a grow-
ing risk of an anti-independence backlash if
France plays too easily into the hands of
those seeking sovereignty. As one diplomat
commented, “The biggest challenge will be
not to go too far, too fast.”

For some, low- to mid-range
power is most important. The

the stop-and-go demands of city

speed. And of course, the engine
must be fuel efficient. But never
at the expense of driving fun.

ITS AIMS BOTH THAN R HAS TOOL
The power of deep breathing.
Since all fuel-injected engines
are capable of delivering good
high-rev performance, Mazda felt
that further boosting top speed
would be merely redundant. What
was needed was an engine with
the kind of power that does not
require you to change down when
accelerating from 140 to 150 km/h.
For this, mid- to high-range
torque had to be improved, which
meant building the new 929’s
2.0 i FE engine with the
capability to breathe as much
air as possible.
Internal aerodynamics.
During intake, the inertia and
pulsating motion of the air being
drawn into the combustion
chamber help determine the ideal
bore and length of the manifold
according to revving. This in turn
aids breathing efficiency. The result:
a naturally designed manifold that
is considerably longer than usual.
To further enhance breathing,
special attention was also paid to
the exhaust pipe. Enlarging the size
of the silencer reduced exhaust
resistance for smoother intake of air
to each cylinder.
The control factor.
The advent of microelectronics
has made control of engine dynam-
ics easier. More information means
more precision. For example,
sensors monitor throttle position
and engine revolutions, adjusting
the fuel supply in accordance with
engine performance.
But with the new 929’s 2.0 i FE
engine, Mazda not only wanted
greater performance, but more
accurate response to overall
operating conditions. This meant
additional sensors in the air-
conditioner, to alleviate the effects

of sudden compressor drag. And in
the brakes, to more adequately
control the fuel supply in accor-
dance with braking pressure.
The heart of the matter.
At Mazda, “fun to drive” is an
integral element in all our cars. To
this end, we fine-tuned the new
929’s chassis, front stabilizer bar,
springs and dampers, and added
high performance tyres for greater
stability. Mazda’s original Auto
Adjusting Suspension was adopted
to prevent squatting, diving and roll
during sudden acceleration, braking
or lane changing at high speeds or
on winding roads. Sporty, yet
comfortable, it’s a ride that is
smooth, sure and right on target.
The soft side of technology.
Although microelectronic
hardware has simplified the science
of engine and suspension control, a
car’s characteristics are just as attrib-
utable to the thinking and sensibility
of the people behind its creation.
At Mazda, we put the most
advanced technology in the hands
of true car enthusiasts in a con-
tinuing effort to meet the demands
of today’s drivers by always building
cars better than they have to be.

WORLD AFFAIRS
An airport honor guard for the two dead Americans: Retaliation for their killing was tempting—but not very practical
A Chamber of Horrors
A skyjacking trial by terror finally comes to an end at the airport in Teheran.
The last passengers aboard Kuwait Air-
ways Flight 221 waited in agony. New York
businessman John Costa and Charles Ka-
par, an auditor for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, sat tied togeth-
er with the plane's British pilot. Behind
them an Iranian medic was treating four
Kuwaitis who were similarly bound. With-
out warning, the medic suddenly grabbed a
hand grenade held by one of the hijackers.
The terrorist wrestled to get it back as a
second hijacker rushed to his aid. There was
a bright flash of light, and the stench of tear
gas fdled the plane.
Pilot Harry Clark struggled to free him-
self and the Americans from the rope that
bound them to their seats, and he pulled with
his teeth at the rope around his wrists; then he
urged the pair to their feet. They fled for the
open door in the front, the Americans still
bound together at their chests and wrists. A
trailing rope caught in a seat, and as they
struggled to pull free, a man rushed at them
with a knife. He was a rescuer, not a captor,
and he cut the Americans loose. Costa and
Kapar pounded down the stairs to the tarmac
of Teheran's Mehrabad Airport. There they
joined Clark and the four Kuwaitis. Iranian
commandos had freed the last of the hostages
and they would soon head home alive.
Two other Americans were not so lucky.
Last week Vice President George Bush
waited at Andrews Air Force Base as mili-
tary pallbearers carried their flag-draped
coffins to the white hearses on the tarmac.
Charles Hegna and William Stanford, the
AID officials murdered by the hijackers,
were back for burial in Arlington National
Costa, Kapar: An unrelenting torment
PHOTOS BY ANNA CLOPET
Cemetery. “We shall know their murderers
with the long memories of those who believe
in patient but certain justice,” Bush vowed.
“Wanton murder of the innocent is terror-
ism that no amount of incantation can
disguise.”
Arriving in Kuwait from Teheran, the
seven rescued hostages described an ordeal
of unbroken horror. It had begun a week
earlier, only 14 minutes after the Kuwait
Airways Airbus left Dubai en route to Ka-
rachi, Pakistan. As Flight 221 neared the
top of its climb, the first-class stewardess
saw the plane’s security guard being beaten
by two passengers. Seconds later, the two-
man flight-deck crew heard a series of loud
bangs that they later realized were gun-
shots. The door to the cockpit burst open
and a man with a pistol shoved the copilot
into his seat. A second man pressed a hand
grenade against Captain Clark’s neck, and
the pilot altered course for Teheran.
Cigarette burns: Once on the ground in
Iran, the terrorists gradually released most
of the plane’s 161 passengers. But for those
who remained, the torment was unrelent-
ing. The hijackers turned the curtained-off


section between the first- and economy-
class sections into what the survivors called
“the chamber of horrors.” It was there that
the American passengers were tortured. “It
was 140 hours of hell,” recalled Kapar, his
eyes blackened and his hands swollen and
covered with cigarette burns. “I thought I
was going to die every day.” But it was
Costa who probably suffered the worst.
After identifying himself as an American,
he was forced to lie in the aisle on his
stomach while one of the hijackers stood on
him, stamping and shouting diatribes
against American imperialism. Later,
pointing to the cigarette burns on his face,
Costa insisted that “you don’t do this to
someone unless you like it.”
The terrorists did not physically harm
Captain Clark, presumably because they
wanted him to be able to fly the plane. But
he was forced to endure psychological tor-
ture. At one point he was forced to view two
Kuwaiti passengers sprawled out on the
floor. “I didn’t know real blood looked so
much like tomato ketchup,” he recalls
thinking. But it was tomato ketchup. The
hijackers had forced the two Kuwaitis to lie
perfectly still and then doused the
“corpses” like hot dogs. Clark was never
informed that it was a hoax. Later in Ku-
wait, when offered a light for his cigarette,
Clark recoiled. “Ugh!” he exclaimed. “I
hate to think of the way my lighter was used
by them after they took it from me.”
Smuggled Equipment: The hijackers ap-
peared to be armed with two small-caliber
automatic pistols, two or three other hand-
guns, a few grenades and some wire and
nylon cord. How they managed to smuggle
the equipment aboard remained a mystery,
although two Pakistanis, who were released
in Iran by the hijackers, claimed that much
of that equipment materialized only after
the plane had landed at Mehrabad. Accord-
ing to the copilot, the Iranian authorities
did provide rope, but only after the terror-
ists added threats to their demands for it.
“The Iranians wouldn’t let us land until I
lied and told them we had fuel for only ten
more minutes,” says Clark. But despite the
insistence of the seven final hostages that
there was no evidence of Iranian complicity,
American officials were not so sure.
While stopping short of accusing the
Iranians of outright collusion, the White
House did suggest that Teheran’s behavior
encouraged the atrocity. “Many aspects of
the Iranian government’s handling of the
situation raise profound and disturbing
questions,” said press spokesman Larry
Speakes.“The fact of the matter is that two
passengers were murdered by the hijackers,
more were tortured and many were brutal-
ized for an extended period of time without
any effective measures being taken by the
government of Iran.” American officials
noted that the hijackers had demanded the
release of 17 Shiite fundamentalists jailed in
Kuwait for the bombing of the American

Embassy and other targets there a year ago.
The embassy bombers are widely believed
to have operated with Iranian support, a
suspicion that grew deeper when Iran indi-
cated that it would not extradite the high-
jackers to Kuwait. Speakes also questioned
whv the hijackers were allowed to broadcast
wny we mjacKers were allowed to oroaacast
their demands, and why they allowed pho-
tographers to record the carnage
inside the plane. Said one U.S. offi-
cial, “A lot of the things they did
and allowed to be done were weird
as hell.”
Innocent Civilians: As Ameri-
can indignation grew, Secretary
of State George Shultz reiterated
his earlier calls for retaliation and
pre-emptive strikes against ter-
rorists. But traveling with Shultz
to a NATO meeting in Brussels,
even senior State Department of-
ficials questioned whether such
actions were either practical or
desirable; since Shultz began urg-
ing retaliation last spring, the
officials said, terrorists in Beirut
and Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley—
the suspected base of the hijack-
ers—have scattered themselves
among innocent civilians, making
it almost impossible to attack
without killing more bystanders
than terrorists. “Ironically,” said
one Shultz colleague, “talking
about military action has made
military action more difficult. It
would be hard to catch anybody
by surprise after all the talking
we’ve done.” At Andrews Air
Force Base last week, Vice Presi-
dent Bush demanded that the hi-
jackers be brought to justice
“swiftly and surely,” but he was
clearly talking about extradition or trial in
Iran. The best defense against terrorism,
most officials still seemed to agree, is a
combination of vigilance, intelligence—
and stoicism,

A Flood of Counterfeit Goods
Taiwanese worker assembling knockoff computers: As long as there are fortunes to be made, the copycats will continue to prosper
Forged products plague the market —and many of them are downright dangerous.
On a recent sales trip to Kuwait, some
Toyota executives happened proudly upon a
shop advertising “Genuine Toyota Parts. ”
But when they took a close look at the mer-
chandise, their delight turned to horror. The
shiny new “Toyota ”oil fdterson display were
anything but genuine. They had been fash-
ioned out of discarded fruit juice cans, and
could easily ruin a car's engine.
In the global marketplace, the watchword
is buyer beware. Counterfeiters around
the world are producing fakes of every sort,
from ripoffs of Louis Vuitton luggage to
knockoffs of Apple computers. This year
U.S. Customs agents seized $4O million in
counterfeit products, and that was only a
small fraction of theamount coming into the
country. Worldwide, trafficking of bogus
goods by the underground industry may
now account for as much as 2 percent of all
trade —fully $4O billion, according to the
International Chamber of Commerce. Says
James Bikoff, president of the San Fran-
cisco-based International Anticounterfeit-
ing Coalition (IAC): “There is no business
that’s not being hit by this problem.”
But it is the consumer who is frequently
most at risk. While replicas of such brand-
name items as Levi’s jeans and Rolex watch-
es still comprise the bulk of ersatz products,
counterfeiters are increasingly turning out
phony goods that are a real threat to public
safety. Fake —and faulty—aircraft parts
have turned up in assembly plants and main-
tenance facilities for the European Airbus,
Japan Air Lines and Lockheed Aircraft.
Pseudo birth-control pills have been found
in the United States and Taiwan. And dan-
gerous, counterfeit brake linings that can
wear out in weeks are sold thoughout the
Middle East and Asia.
Concerned with the growing danger, and
with the economic harm that counterfeiting
does to legitimate businesses, governments
are beginning to confront the problem head-
on. This autumn, President Reagan signed
into law legislatibn making it a federal crime
knowingly to possess, distribute or sell
counterfeit products. The measure levies
stiff fines of up to $250,000 for individuals
and $1 million for corporations, plus as
much as five years in jail for those involved.
France is toughening its patent and trade-
mark laws to allow customs officials to con-
fiscate suspected phony goods. Italy, itself
home to a healthy number of counterfeiters,
is taking action against small-time copycats
and outdoor markets that stock and sell
counterfeit goods. And last year even
Taiwan, the largest source of fake goods,
responded to international pressure by en-
acting its first trademark law in 20 years.
Priorities: Even so, there is only so much
that can be done. Customs agents inspect
only about 5 percent of all goods brought
into the United States to check for fakes.
“It’s not our No. 1 priority,” admits U.S.
Customs official Patrick O’Brien. In fact,
it’s No. 4—behind crackdowns on illicit
narcotics, high-technology exports and il-
legal arms. So for the most part, the burden
of policing the market for counterfeits falls
on the companies that are cheated out of
sales and profits, and whose good names are
damaged by cheap imitations of their prod-
ucts. Some 200 firms from around the world
have joined the lAC, which monitors coun-
terfeiting activity and lobbies governments
to take stronger action. Next month, the
Paris-based International Chamber of


Commerce is launching a similar opera-
tion, to forward counterfeiting intelli-
gence to companies as well as law en-
forcement agencies.
Many firms take the initiative them-
selves by hiring lawyers and private in-
vestigators to smoke out the fakes. Last
year Louis Vuitton spent $500,000 on
an anticounterfeiting sting operation.
America’s Blue Bell Co., the maker of
Wrangler jeans, has hired a Hong-Kong
investigator to watch for ripoffs. And
Cartier, which in 1981 drew attention to
the problem by having a steamroller run
over 4,000 copies of its famous Tank
watch, says it spends $3 million a year on
the counterfight. But the task is never
ending. A successful lawsuit tends to
discourage counterfeiters only tempo-
rarily, says New York trademark lawyer
Ronald Lehrman: “If you don’t [soon]
have another successful lawsuit, people
think you’re looking in the other direc-
tion and it starts up again.”
The battle against fakery spans the
globe. But most of the copycats can be
found in Asia, working in backroom
sweatshops and in modern factories as
well. Taiwanese fabricators use sophisti-
cated techniques to duplicate everything
from toys such as popular Cabbage Patch
dolls to industrial chemicals. In some coun-
tries, the underground manufacturers spe-
cialize in bogus cassette and videotapes (as
in Singapore) or textiles and phony designer
clothes (Hong Kong).
For the most part, however, counterfeit-
ers will produce whatever they can sell.
Forgers in Mexico turn out fake Cointreau
liqueur, Napoleon cognac, Paco Rabanne
cologne and Chanel perfume by the gallon.
In Italy, small factories around Florence
produce copies of designer leather goods,
some for export and others for sale at home
to unsuspecting tourists. Authorities in
New York arrested an auto-parts distribu-
tor who exported whole fake General Mo-
tors auto engines fashioned out of badly

worn parts that had been cleaned and paint-
ed to look like new. The engines were assem-
bled in Dallas and shipped through the port
of Houston. It wasn’t until they turned up in
Saudi Arabia that an alert GM dealer there
notified the company.
Only in recent years has the trafficking in
bogus goods aroused the concern of legiti-
mate manufacturers in the West. During the
’6os and ’7os, the trade blossomed across
Asia, primarily because many companies
viewed the region as an unpromising market
for luxury products and did not bother to
protect their trademarks there. But as Asia
developed economically and started export-
ing fakes to the West, the companies saw the
threat. Counterfeiters were not only making
replicas of well-known consumer items to
pass for the originals, but were also sell-
ing knockoff products that borrow heav-
ily on the basic technology and design of
a product, but carry a different brand
name in an attempt to skirt copyright and
trademark laws.
IBM is going after the manufacturers
it suspects of producing knockoffs of its
best-selling personal computer. The
American computer giant has filed a
lawsuit in Taiwan against Leonard Tsai,
22, whose Pole Star model, according to
IBM, bears more than a casual resem-
blance to the PC. Tsai acknowledges that
he has sold more than 400 of the ma-
chines since April—7o percent of them
for export —but denies that they are il-
legal copies. Tsai predicts he will win his
case, and says that it is easy to explain his
success. “It’s business competition,” he
says. “We’re selling at a very low price.”
Duty Free: Where they can, Western
governments, particularly the United
States, are trying to pressure developing
countries into battling the counterfeit-
ers. Two U.S. congressional delegations
visited Taiwan this year and tried to
persuade the country’s leaders to take
stronger action against counterfeiters.
And last July, Secretary of State George
Shultz discussed the problem with Singa-
pore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Shultz
reportedly asked Singapore to crack down
on the traffic in illegally copied “intellectual
property,” such as copyrighted music and
books, as well as computer hardware and
software. Unless the government acted,
Shultz warned, Washington might revoke
Singapore’s “favored nation” status, which
allows Singapore to ship some products into
the United States duty free. Lee told Shultz
the problem was “under study.” But Rose-
mary Yeo, the secretary to the Singaporean
committee that is reviewing the laws, told
Newsweek that members of the panel
were concerned “that a strong copyright
law would make the acquisition of knowl-
edge and information and the enjoyment of
TRACKING THE TRAIL OF A BOGUS PRODUCT

manufacturer to produce a
shoddy oil filter that is a look-
alike for a name-brand filter.
2 The Taiwanese manu-

feit products into crates ge-
nerically labeled "oil filters"
and they pass undetected
through U.S. Customs.

the filters in boxes that
are replicas of the name-
brand manufacturer’s. He
then sells them as “over-
stock" to a legitimate
wholesale distributor—who
is unaware of the scheme.

fake products to reputable
retail outlets: car dealers, re-
pair shops, gas stations and
even chain discounters.

ers buy the phony filters—

Counterfeits on the left, genuine articles on the right: Fakes are often flimsy, but they sell

musical works even more expensive for the
general public.”
Several Asian nations have responded to
the pressure, however, and are taking steps
against the copycats. Hong Kong customs
agents now average two raids a day on
suspect manufacturers, distributors and re-
tailers, and this year have seized some $4
million worth of bogus goods. Partly as a
result of the tougher enforcement, the colo-
ny’s stores contain fewer fakes today than
they did a few years ago. But that hasn’t
stopped the abuses: officials now estimate
that 85 percent of Hong Kong’s bogus goods
are shipped overseas, often to
Third World markets.
There is powerful pressure
on Third World governments
to look the other way in the
fight against counterfeiting. In
some developing countries, the
copycat underworld is a vital
part of the economy, providing
thousands of jobs where there
might not be any. As a result,
penalties are frequently light,
enforcement is often nonexist-
ent, and judicial roadblocks are
everywhere. “We have been
trying for years to clean up the
situation in Morocco,” says
Louis Vuitton attorney Robert
Brunot. “We take all the fakers
to court, and we win all the
trials. But no judge has yet
dared to execute the judg-
ment.” In Mexico City, it took
Cartier more than 10 years of
legal wrangling before it won
an agreement in 1981 to shut
whole stores that bore the
Cartier name and sold bogus
Cartier ripoffs. Phony Gucci
shops still operate openly
there; designer Aldo Gucci has
apparently decided that Mexi-
co’s loophole-riddled trade-
mark codes make it too difficult
to close them down.
But reform is possible. Thir-
ty years ago Japan was the
world’s leading copier of Western merchan-
dise. Then in 1959, under pressure from the
United States, Tokyo passed strict anti-
counterfeiting laws covering nearly 70 cate-
gories of exports and requiring that all of
them be certified as original before being
sent abroad. Even so, a thriving domestic
counterfeiting industry survives. Last
spring, a Japanese court sentenced the presi-
dent of a handbag company and the presi-
dent of an accessory maker to one-year jail
terms for selling fake Louis Vuitton bags
and other products under false Dunhill,
Cartier and Chanel brand names.

Whatever they are —hand-
bags or aircraft parts —coun-
terfeit goods are almost aways
inferior to the genuine article.
The results can be tragic. A
recent U.S. Federal Trade
Commission study found that
phony “high strength” fasten-
ing bolts, in wide use around
the world, are far more likely
than properly made ones to
give way under stress. Investi-
gators blamed a fatal helicopter
crash near Los Angeles on fake
parts in the rotor assembly.
And a counterfeit fastener on
the landing gear of a U.S. Navy
jet fighter caused it to crash on
the deck of an aircraft carrier.
When Delta Airlines bought a batch of
electronic tubes for the navigation systems
on its jetliners, it was confident that the
General Electric parts were top quality. But
the tubes proved to be duds, and Delta
returned the lot. A concerned GE quickly
discovered that they were useless discards,
replated and stamped with GE’s logo. The
tubes were traced to a Los Angeles distribu-
tor, and when U.S. marshalls raided the firm
last May, they found a cache of phony
parts —and equipment that could duplicate
the logos of RCA, Sylvania, Telefunken and
16 other companies.
Lost Sales: Probably no in-
dustry is harder hit by coun-
terfeiters than automobile
manufacturers. Japanese auto
companies suspect that more
than half of the car parts sold
in parts of Southeast Asia and
the Middle East are copies.
Britain’s Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders
estimates its lost sales at
more than $l2O million a
year—mostly in Third-World
export markets. All told,
American automakers esti-
mate that phony auto parts
cost them as much as $3 bil-
lion a year in lost sales.

be far greater. Auto industry

and Accessories Association in Detroit.
A more recent, and no less dangerous,
development is the counterfeiting of health
care products. Bottles of bogus Listerine
mouthwash, Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup
and other over-the-counter pharmaceuti-
cals have begun showing up on the shelves
of drugstores in Asia. Worse, last year au-
thorities uncovered a Bangkok factory
making look-alike antibiotics packaged just
like those produced by the British manufac-
turer Wellcome.
Hazardous Trend: American consumers
received a scare last month when the drug
manufacturer G.D. Searle had to recall
more than 1 million of its Ovulen-21 birth-
control pills after sharp-eyed pharmacists
spotted irregularities in some shipments
they had received. The pills turned out to be
counterfeit —and less than effective —
though they contained no harmful sub-
stances. So far, the counterfeiters have not
been caught, but investigators with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration have traced
the bogus shipments back to three Ameri-
can wholesale drug distributors who re-
ceived more than 2,000 boxes of the fake
contraceptives from a Panama-based export
company. So far, there have been no reports
of injury or pregnancy as a result of the
counterfeit pills, but Searle worries that the
episode may be only the beginning of a very
hazardous trend. “Fake blue jeans is one
thing, but tampering with a drug is an-
other,” says Searle vice president Mark
Brand. “This is a new and frightening phe-
nomenon that makes us all vulnerable.”
Many companies are trying to make it
more difficult to duplicate their products by
having them “fingerprinted” with unique
fiber patterns that can be read by special
scanners. Even so, advances in technology
seem to favor the counterfeiters, making
their job easier and helping them stay ahead
of the law. Copycats now can clone virtually
anything by using sophisticated machine
tools that “read” the dimensions of the orig-
inal and turn out duplicates. “Every time we
think we’ve built a roadblock, they find a
way around it,” says Jim Doran, a member
of a special U.S. Customs enforcement team
in Chicago.
A case in point was an American effort to
detect knockoffs of Apple computers. Cus-
toms agents thought they had found a fool-
proof way to spot the fakes. The key to
copying an Apple is to repro-
duce the microchip containing
the computer’s vital operating
system —the only part that can
be copyrighted. Agents would
test the programs from suspect
computers to compare them
with the progam on a real Ap-
ple. If 70 percent or more of the
programs matched up, they
had found an illegal copy. But it
didn’t take counterfeiters long
to catch on, and soon the ma-
chines began arriving in the
United States in parts, or with a
“nonsense” operating program
that would pass the Customs
test. Once inside the country,
the illegally copied memory
chip could be installed safely.
As a result of this dodge, thou-
sands of phony Apples are still
being sold through classified
ads for as little as two-thirds the
price of the real thing.
So far, the counterfeiters are
winning the war. And there is
little chance that government
and industry will soon turn the
tide. “We can never eliminate
it,” says Cartier President Alain-Domi-
nique Perrin. “At best we can control it.”
But to do so will require greater effort than
government and industry are exerting to-
day. Customs agents continue to inspect
only a small number of imports, and many
companies fail even to register trademark
data to protect their good names. As long as
there are few risks involved and easy for-
tunes to be made, the copycats will continue
to prosper.

Mitterrand’s Chad Strategy
At the summit in Bujumbura: Many African leaders regarded the French government’s new scenario as a de facto partition of Chad
To save face in Africa, the president outlines a new ‘understanding’ with Libya.
By FRED COLEMAN
Paris Bureau Chief
The late Sen. George Aiken once gave
Richard Nixon some cynical advice on
how to settle the Vietnam War: “Declare
you have won—and go home.” That is pre-
cisely what French President Frangois
Mitterrand is trying to do now with Chad.
After being stung by Libya’s refusal to hon-
or a mutual troop withdrawal from the war-
torn African nation—while French forces
pulled out —Mitterrand is now saying that
his soldiers stopped a Libyan advance in
Chad, and then left with honor.
That strategy, Newsweek has learned,
is based on an informal understanding with
Libya to divide Chad roughly into two parts
at the 16th parallel, while talks about a
Libyan evacuation continue. According to
what French officials describe as “an ex-
change of decisions” with Libya, French
forces will not return to Chad to drive out
the Libyans north of that line. But if Libya
moves south of the 16th parallel, France is
prepared to send thousands of troops back
to Chad. As Mitterrand put it last week:
“France is ready to take risks, but not use-
less risks.”
The French president outlined his strate-
gy at the annual French-African summit,
which was held last week in Bujumbura,
the capital of Burundi. “Talking drums”
boomed out the news of Mitterrand’s arrival
and bare-chested warriors performed fren-
zied cartwheels in welcome, but the two-day
summit party had already been spoiled. Five
leaders from the 20 French-speaking Afri-
can countries invited chose to stay away as a
signal of their displeasure over the French
Greeting the president: Family affairs
withdrawal from Chad. The absentees in-
cluded Felix Houphouet-Boigny, president
of the Ivory Coast and Seyni Kountche,
president of Niger, who chose instead to
visit Washington to talk with Ronald Rea-
gan about prospects for a wider U.S. role in
French West Africa.
Many African leaders who did attend the
meeting—including Chad’s president, His-
sene Habre —were not pleased with Mitter-
rand’s new scenario. They regarded it as a de
facto partition of Chad and said they would
prefer more French aid on the ground to
help Habre’s forces take the north. Mitter-
rand testily responded to such criticism,
declaring: “I will never accept the partition
of Chad.” But while he may oppose parti-
tion in principle, he seemed to have ac-
knowledged it in fact.
The “victory” that Mitterrand claimed in
Chad was real enough for the time being—
but it was only half a loaf. After 3,500
French troops drew a “red line” at the
16th parallel, they were able to dissuade the
Libyans and their Chad rebel allies from
advancing south to the capital of N’Dja-
mena thereby saving Habre’s shaky govern-
ment. According to one of Mitterrand’s
senior advisers, the French decided not to
attack the Libyans in northern Chad. As
this adviser put it, the French president was


unwilling to risk a long, incon-
clusive war with Libya that
“could tear apart the social fab-
ric of France.”
Then came the accord with
Kaddafi. Many of Mitterrand’s
top advisers had viewed the
deal as a risk —and it was. The
French were humiliated when
more than 3,000 Libyan sol-
diers remained in northern
Chad after the French troops
left. The problem Mitterrand
faces now is to hold the red line
in order to save face in Africa.
He is not without resources.
There are still at least 2,000
French troops based at Bouar
in the neighboring Central Af-
rican Republic, with 20 Tran-
sall transport planes to get
them back to Chad in two
hours. There are also 6,000
French troops elsewhere in Af-
rica, and more than 100 French
military advisers still in Chad.
“The Libyans were told they
must not cross south of the 16th parallel,”
says the Mitterrand adviser, “and that they
should remember we are still present in the
region.” This account of the informal un-
derstanding with Libya, Newsweek has
learned, was also relayed to the Reagan
administration in early December.
As further elements in his strategy, Mit-
terrand believes that Chad’s full territorial
integrity can be restored by a combination
of carrot-and-stick policies. The carrot side,
favored by his new foreign minister, Roland
Dumas, includes a French willingness to
resume arms sales to Kaddafi once all Lib-
yan troops have left Chad. The Libyan lead-
er is said to be anxious to lessen his depend-
ence on Soviet arms, but the French have
refused to consider his shopping list while
Chad is in turmoil. In addition, the French
are continuing to put pressure on Habre to
negotiate a government of national recon-
ciliation in Chad. That could end the civil
war by bringing the Libyan-backed rebel
leaders into a ruling coalition. Neither ap-
proach has yet been successful, and Habre
insists the French pressure should be placed
on Kaddafi rather than on him. As Habre
said in Bujumbura: “It is the Libyan pres-
ence that makes reconciliation impossible.”
Option: The stick side of Mitterrand’s
strategy looks more like a twig to his
critics. The most that Mitterrand’s top ad-
visers have said is that “the military option
has not been excluded.” If the Libyans cross
the 16th parallel, French troops might go
back into Chad. But as one Western diplo-
mat says, “There is no definite commitment
that the French will return.”
France’s continuing effort to talk Kad-
dafi out of Chad is not promising either.
Even if Paris were to take a tougher stand,
Kaddafi would have ample incentive to
French troops withdrawing from Chad: ‘France is ready to take risks, but not useless risks’
keep his troops in Chad. Without the Lib-
yans, there would be nothing to stop Habre
from moving north and defeating the Chad
rebels led by Goukouni Oueddei, a Libyan
ally. Not only is Kaddafi therefore almost
certain to stay in Chad, but he is also likely
to test France’s intentions. Among the
many unanswered questions is whether the
French would return to Chad if, for exam-
pie, Libyan reconnaissance planes were to
fly south of the 16th parallel, or only if
ground troops were to march into the south,
The stakes that Mitterrand is playing for
With Mireille Kolingba: In a buoyant mood
go far beyond Chad. Black Africa is the only
place on the world stage where France still
plays a dominant role. And now, because of
its humiliation in Chad, French credibility
as a guarantor of the security of other Black
African nations is on the line. Still, France
remains the leading source of aid, trade and
military security in Francophone Africa.
However much the Africans themselves are
upset by Mitterrand’s actions in Chad, the
reality is they have no other place to turn to
obtain more aid. Such leaders as Hou-
phouet-Boigny and President Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire are not about to look to Mos-
cow for help. Washington has told the
French that it does not intend to compete
for influence in the region. In sum, says a
Western diplomat, “The French know they
can take the heat on Chad because in the
end, the Africans will come back to
mother.”
Sure enough, by the end of last week’s
summit, even Habre was trying to sound
conciliatory. “Our views are not totally di-
vergent,’ ’ he said after a private meeting with
Mitterrand. That underscored an important
point. French-African summits are family
affairs. Quarrels don’t reach the breaking
point. Even on Chad, many African leaders
are willing to give Mitterrand more time to
prove his strategy could work. The French
president left the summit in a buoyant mood.
On the way home, he stopped off in Bangui,
the capital of the Central African Republic,
for a dinner at the presidential palace. As
3,000 guests applauded, Mitterrand danced
with the wife of President Andre Kolingba.
It was the first time he had danced in public
in 30 years, he said later, and he was smiling
broadly. The French president knew he was
likely to face more criticism over Chad when
he returned home. But for the moment,
Frangois Mitterrand looked like he could
have danced all night.


WEST GERMANY
A Fight Over the Greens' Soul
The impassioned appeals to shut down
all nuclear plants were almost nowhere
to be heard. The usual pleas for a West
German withdrawal from NATO received
scarcely a mention. Even the volatile ques-
tion of U.S.-made NATO missiles on Ger-
man soil was all but ignored. When the
upstart Green Party gathered recently in
Hamburg to thrash out its future, the main
issue—in fact, the only issue—was whether
the time had come for the antiestablishment
party to plunge into the establishment and
join a mainstream coalition. The decision
was a waffle: not now, maybe later.
Just five years old, the Greens are in the
throes of an identity crisis that threatens to
At the convention in Hamburg: Debating whether an antiestablishment party should join a mainstream coalition
split the party. On oneside are the “realists,”
who see coalition-building as the key to the
future; on the other side are the “fundamen-
talists,” who want to steer clear of conven-
tional politics. Ironically, the growing rift
stems from the party’s unexpected success.
Two years ago, when the Greens were first
seated in the Bundestag, many predicted
that the party would soon fade. Since then,
however, the Greens have turned in a per-
formance so impressive that they have si-
lenced even the naysayers. They now hold
seats in 6of 11 state legislatures, their popu-
larity rating is twice that of West Germany’s
No. 3 party, the Free Democrats (FDP) and
polls indicate that they could take 15 per-
cent of the vote in the next national elec-
tions, scheduled for 1987.
That makes the Greens a potent force in a
country where no single party commands a
majority. The realists argue that the Greens
should broker their newfound power by
accepting the overtures that are being made
by the principal opposition party, the Social
Democrats (SPD), in order to form an alli-
ance. Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) has been slip-
ping in popularity, and his FDP coalition
partners risk losing the minimum 5 percent
voter support required for Bundestag repre-
sentation. A Greens-Social Democrats alli-
ance could be a formidable force in 1987.
“All opposition parties are governments-in-
waiting,” said legislator Otto Schily at the
three-day conference in Hamburg.
But the fundamentalists see little differ-
ence between the Social Democrats and
Kohl’s CDU —and they contend that there
is no proper place for the Greens within the
mainstream. “A Green minister would be a
caricature,” said party member Rainer
Trampert. The purists maintain that an alii-
ance with any establishment party would
divert the Greens from their true course as a
party of protest. A union with the SPD
would be a “shameful collaboration with the
power system,” said party member Rudolf
Bahro, who galvanized the delegates with
his cry: “Out of the system! Out!”
Quandaries: For now, the Greens remain
half in, half out. In Hamburg, the Greens
averted a party split by adopting a compro-
mise resolution that dismisses the Social
Democrats as an acceptable coalition part-
ner for the present, but leaves the door open
to a future alliance with the SPD. One of the
Greens’ quandaries, however, is whether
they will be quite so appealing a coalition
partner a few years down the road. Much of
the Greens’ current popularity is linked to
the Flick group influence-buying scandal
that has damaged Kohl’s coalition and the
SPD. The Greens didn’t even exist as a party
when the events under investigation were
taking place in the 19705, so they have been
left unblemished.
If the Flick scandal subsides and the
mainstream parties recover lost support,
however, the Greens may find their 11 per-
cent popularity rating waning. As it is, the
Social Democrats have begun to have
doubts about the wisdom of a political mar-
riage with the Greens. A pact between the
Greens and the SPD in the Hesse state
legislature recently collapsed after just five
months when the SPD rejected Greens de-
mands to shut down a nuclear plant. Any
lingering doubts were strengthened by the
haggling in Hamburg. “Very inadequate”
was how SPD leader Willy Brandt described
the outcome of the Greens’ convention.
Debate: Some Greens may even agree, for
the feud between the pragmatists and the
purists is far from settled. In fact, the two
camps are likely to fight again—perhaps as
early as March, when the first Greens elect-
ed to the Bundestag reach the midway point
in their four-year terms of office. The debate
will focus on the issue of “rotation.” To
avoid the creation of a party elite, Greens
legislators had agreed to surrender their
seats to other party members at the two-year
point. Since then, many Greens—most of
them members of the “realist” faction—
have rejected the turnover idea,
For all the internecine squabbling, there
was a shared feeling at the Hamburg meet-
ing that the Greens have come of age. “Two
years ago we were still liars, anarchists and
hoi polloi,” Trampert told the delegates,
“Today, everyone wants to be governed by
us.” That is highly debatable. But within the
Greens, the struggle now is over the party’s
soul. And it won’t be resolved until they
decide whether their party, born in antigov-
ernment protest, can consent to govern,

IRELAND
A Refuge for the Provos
The Imperial Hotel and other watering holes, a sign of prorepublican sentiment: ‘There is something out there lurking ’
They were once considered outlaw heroes
throughout the Republic of Ireland. But
lately public disgust over the endless rounds
of bombings and assassinations has begun to
erode support for the Irish Republican A rmy.
Since taking office in June 1981, Prime Min-
ister Garret Fitz Gerald has waged a highly
effective —and surprisingly popular—cam-
paign against the IRA. Even so, IRA sympa-
thizers remain. Newsweek’s Donna Foote
recently visited one town in Ireland where
loyalty to the republican cause still runs
deep. Her report:
Dundalk resembles any number of bus-
tling towns in the Republic. Just seven
miles from the border with Northern Ire-
land, the seaside community straddles the
road from Dublin to Belfast. Trucks and
cars clog the main streets; the town’s
shops —not to mention its 97 bars—do a
brisk business. For years, however, Dun-
dalk has been famous, or notorious, for a less
traditional enterprise: it has provided refuge
for IRA members on the run. That is still the
case. Authorities estimate that despite their
recent success in cracking down on the IRA
elsewhere, there could be as many as 50
hard-core terrorists and hundreds of active
supporters operating in and around Dun-
dalk. To this day, the town is often referred
to in the press by its distinctly unflattering
nickname: “Gundalk.”
Many residents seem resigned to Dun-
dalk’s romance with republicanism. Ac-
cording to Cathal Cassidy, the owner of a
local wine bar, Dundalk is merely a “town of
tolerance.” But there is hardly anything
tolerant about the way local opponents of
the IRA are often treated. Earlier this year,
the funeral for a mother of two local men
who had joined the British Army had to be
held at night. The fear was that the Provos,
the most militant IRA faction, might decide
to disrupt the service in an effort to intimi-
date other potential recruits.
Pro-IRA sentiment in Dundalk seems to
run especially high in the Muirhevna More
housing project, a grim warren of garbage-
strewn streets and ramshackle cottages. The
project provides the IRA with an ample
supply of potential hideouts, including one
used last month by Evelyn Glenholmes,
who is wanted by Scotland Yard in connec-
tion with the bombing attempt against Brit-
ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
Local graffiti: A ‘town of tolerance'?
Brighton’s Grand Hotel two months ago.
To a large degree, the continuing support
for the IRA among many people in Dundalk
stems from simple geography. When the
simmering religious hatreds in Northern
Ireland erupted into violence once again in
the early ’7os, Dundalk’s proximity to the
border made it a natural haven for Roman
Catholic families who were burned out of
their homes —and for Provo activists fearful
of internment by the British. Many of the
refugees never left. The newcomers, as well
as longtime residents, found heroes in the
gun-toting IRA men who whiled away
afternoons in the bar of the slightly seedy
Imperial Hotel in between their forays to the
north. The experience of those years was not
soon forgotten. In 1981 there was a crisis
over hunger strikes by IRA inmates in Long
Kesh prison. Dundalk was one of two Irish
towns that elected inmates to the country’s
Parliament as a gesture of solidarity.
Despite the support they can count on in
Dundalk, local Provos have started to exer-
cise more caution. As in other towns, Dun-
dalk’s IRA members try to lead quiet lives in
the community and deliberately avoid asso-
ciating with other republicans. The shift in
tactics has dispelled much of the Wild West
atmosphere that once prevailed in Dundalk.
But the town’s basic character has not
changed. “In a way, the IRA presence here
is more sinister today,” says one local attor-
ney. “There is something out there lurk-
ing—an evil force. You know it’s there, but
you can’t put your finger on it.”
Extradite: British and Irish officials hope
that they can do that, and more. The 27th
Battalion of the Irish Army, which is sta-
tioned in Dundalk, has stepped up its patrols
along the border. Under Fitz Gerald’s lead-
ership, Ireland has shown an unprecedented
willingness to arrest suspected terrorists
and extradite them to the North or to Brit-
ain. But most important, authorities in Dub-
lin and Belfast have begun to cooperate
more and more on security matters.
Even so, getting the IRA out of Dundalk
and places like it will not be a simple task.
The built-in problems were highlighted by
last month’s botched attempt by the police
to capture Glenholmes. Despite the oper-
ation’s heavy secrecy, an informant man-
aged to learn of the police plan and tip her
off. Exasperated police officials could only
vow that they would eventually get their
woman. Even if they do, however, the pres-
ence of the IRA in the border badlands
around Dundalk is likely to remain as insti-
tutionalized as church on Sunday.


U.S. AFFAIRS
Dueling
For Dollars
Reagan’s budget-cutters attacked the defense budget
last week, but Weinberger didn’t retreat an inch.
A promise from David Stockman, Feb-
ruary 1981: “I’m really going to go
after the Pentagon. The whole question is
blatant inefficiency, poor deployment of
manpower, contracting idiocy, and, hell, I
think that Cap’s going to be a pretty good
mark over there. He’s not a tool of the
military-industrial complex.”
Back in those heady days of the Reagan

revolution, budget director Stockman na-
ively assumed that Defense Secretary Cas-
par Weinberger would live up to his Nixon-
era sobriquet of “Cap the Knife.” But as
Stockman would soon learn, Weinberger
was now marching to a different bugle
corps: he believed he had a mandate to
restore the rippling muscles of America’s
might whatever the cost. For four years
running, Stockman and Weinberger would
act out a ritual drama as predictable as
Charlie Brown and the football. “Dave
would make a pitch to the president for a
slower buildup in Defense,” explains one
budget aide. “Then Cap would go one-on-
one with the president. He’d unroll his
charts, his data on the Soviet buildup and
his spiel. And he’d emerge with his requests
intact. The score to date is Weinberger 4,
Stockman 0.”
Last week the stage seemed to be set
for the Revenge of the Number
Crunchers. Stockman had baited
a trap when Weinberger arrived
for an hour-of-decision White
House lunch with Reagan and his
top budget advisers. Virtually all
the president’s men—including
Treasury Secretary Donald Re-
gan, Sen. Paul Laxalt and seven
White House aides—had been
convinced that now was the mo-
ment to slow the increase in de-
fense spending. They believed that
to sell the president’s budget plan
the Pentagon would have to share
the stringency. For the first time in
the Reagan years, it was Wein-
berger against the world. But Cap
refused to capitulate. Even when
he offered Stockman $6 billion in
budget concessions, they turned
out to be little more than flum-
mery. And once again, Reagan’s
verdict—following more meet-
ings this week—may turn out to be
“Stockman, spare that ax.”
The luncheon debate in the
Cabinet Room was over spend-
ing totals, not specific weapons
systems. Weinberger stressed his
longstanding conviction that the presi-
dent’s resolve was measured by the size of
the defense budget. Any retrenchment, he
argued, would send the Soviet Union “pre-
cisely the wrong signal” on the threshold of
possible arms negotiations. Weinberger
also refused to make any commitments be-
yond 1986, saying that trims in projected
spending during the out-years (1987-88) de-
pended on an arms-control treaty.
Stockman forcefully challenged Wein-
berger’s assumptions, contending that even
Brief holiday from budget battles: The First
an “ultimate agreement” in Geneva would
save only $lO billion in spending on strate-
gic weaponry. As the two men sparred over
budget arithmetic, Reagan felt compelled to
offer a few words in defense of Weinberger.
“Cap’s made a good-faith effort here in
’86,” he said. “But nothing’s happening in
the out-years,” Stockman protested. “If we
don’t cut more than this, we’ll have to print
a $2OO billion deficit figure.”
‘Grunts’: There is always a degree of unre-
ality to deficit donnybrooks within the
White House, since a president’s budget
invariably contains a series of untested —
and sometimes dubious—economic and po-
litical assumptions. Murray Weidenbaum,
Reagan’s first chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, likens the current
struggle to professional wrestling. “There’s
a lot of grunts and groans, but nothing
serious is happening,” says Weidenbaum.
“Nobody’s really getting hurt.” Both Wein-
berger and Stockman, for example, are ig-
noring the simple fact that Congress has
already trimmed $6.4 billion in authoriza-
tions for multiyear spending programs.
That means that all administration propos-

als start from an unrealistically high base —
and thereby understate the rate of projected
increase in defense spending.
Weinberger, himself a former budget di-
rector, found other avenues for gamesman-
ship in offering his purported $6 billion
concessions to Stockman. He gleefully
noted that the Pentagon has failed to spend
all the money that Congress appropriated in
the last two years—and rejiggered his budg-
et estimates to assume lower inflation and
slower delivery by suppliers. During the
luncheon, the defense secretary also ap-
peared to offer a freeze on military salaries
in 1986. But this was, in the words of a
White House aide, “a paper charade.” In-
stead of a planned 7.1 percent raise in 1986,
military personnel would get a 6 percent
increase in mid-1985. This gambit would
inflate Pentagon costs, but Weinberger
could argue that he was holding the line on
pay in the 1986 budget. News leaks of the
freeze proposal, however, prompted Wein-
berger to hold a press conference to stress
that he would never “break the faith . . .
with respect to adequate pay for troops.”
Both sides in the budget battle believe
that Reagan must demonstrate his credibil-
ity, but they differ on whether the emphasis
should be on impressing the Russians or the
Congress. While no one can speak for the
Kremlin, a group of GOP senators warned
Stockman and White House chief of staff
James A. Baker 111 that if Weinberger re-
fuses to yield, the president has no chance of
winning the domestic spending cuts he
craves. Influential Democrats like Sen. Sam
Nunn were increasingly skeptical about the
budget plan. “Right now, I do not see the
seriousness of what they are doing,” Nunn
said. “A lot of games are being played.”
‘Standstill’: Stockman still clings to the
stubborn faith that Round Five of the Wein-
berger Wars can produce the victory that
eluded him all through Reagan’s first term.
He has produced a 15-page single-spaced
memo that explains how the “freeze
plus”—already endorsed by Reagan for do-
mestic programs—might be applied to the
Pentagon budget. Stockman’s “standstill”
would mandate different benchmarks for
different sectors of the defense budget—and
it purportedly strives to leave Weinberger in
control of policy choices. “Say the 1985
budget calls for the purchase of 40 F-15
fighters,” explained a budget official. “And,
say, the 1986 projection is for 48 F-15s. The
standstill would mean that only 40 F-15s
can be bought.” The proposal would trim
defense authorizations by $l2l billion over
the next three years, but an aide speculates
that Stockman “would probably faint if the
president approved the whole thing.”
Weinberger, who is also bickering with
Secretary of State George Shultz over the
theoretical criteria for military interven-
tion, is unlikely to be voted Mr. Congenial-
ity by his cabinet colleagues. “Everyone
feels he’s being unreasonable,” says a White
House aide. But even the torrent of news
leaks depicting administration disarray
seems unlikely to daunt Weinberger, who is
banking on his ideological kinship with
Reagan. The president insists that he is
sticking to his spending targets, although he
privately concedes that Weinberger’s pro-
posals “don’t quite get us there.” And un-
less Reagan gets tough with his defense
secretary, Weinberger may add the Battle of
the ’B6 Budget to his string of victories.

Attack on the Tree People
The homeless in their park: ‘ Somebody’s out there, crawlin ’ up and down the tracks’
KEVIN McKIERNAN
Kenneth Burr died a hobo’s death, down
by the railroad tracks, alone. Alone,
that is, except for whoever put a bullet
through his forehead two weeks ago in the
California coastal community of Santa Bar-
bara. There were few clues about the victim,
fewer clues about the crime. Burr, said the
police, was 35 and had “no occupation, no
next of kin, no hometown.”
When his body was found early one
morning, Burr’s friends, if he had any, were
probably sleeping near the huge Moreton
Bay fig tree that sits in the southside Santa
Barbara park skirting the tracks. Over the
years the tree has become nationally known
along the transient circuit as the address of
Santa Barbara’s homeless. “You might be in
Georgia, maybe in Florida,” says hobo
Lloyd Henry, 52. “Tell your friends you’ll
meet them at the fig tree and you know
they’ll be there.” To both themselves and
the well-heeled town of about 74,000, the
homeless are known as the tree people—
and last week, they were scared.
‘Scum’: A few days after Burr was killed, a
crudely scrawled flier appeared near the fig
tree: “This is a warning to all ‘tree people.’
You are not welcome here in Santa Barbara.
I will make life difficult for you as I did for
Mr. Burr. Although I acted alone, I have a
faithful and respected group of citizens be-
hind me. You bastards are low-life scum and
will not endure.” The message was signed
“B. Ware,” and on the flier, next to Burr’s
photo, was a square containing a question
mark and the note “Victim #2.”
Many of Santa Barbara’s estimated 1,500
homeless took the vigilante message seri-
ously. Over the last few years, as the dis-
placed population has grown in size and ag-
gressiveness, so have conflicts between the
homeless and the city. Two years ago the po-
lice dusted off —then rigorously enforced
—a no-sleeping-in-public ordinance. Soon
after, alcohol consumption was forbidden in
spots favored by the tree people.
A new citizens’ group, the West Beach
Community Association, has also organ-
ized against the vagrants. The group has put
several measures before the city council
that, among other things, would outlaw the
removal of food from garbage cans without
the owner’s permission and restrict visiting
hours near the fig tree. Grocer Paul Aiello,
one of the association’s founders, was
moved to action after four of his clerks quit
work, partly in disgust over the verbal abuse
they received from vagrants while trying to
enforce food-stamp regulations. “We’ve
tolerated what’s going on and made it more
comfortable for these people,” says Aiello.
“The ordinances we’ve proposed are simply
ways of making it less comfortable.”
The homeless have tried to fight back.
Last September, 21 tried to register to vote,
listing the fig tree as their residence. The
city quickly tore down the red, white and
blue mailbox the group planted in cement
near the tree. A few days before the election,
20 of the tree people marched 28 miles up
the highway to the Reagan'ranch to protest
their lack of franchise. Recently the city
thwarted an attempt by the homeless to
erect a Christmas tree near their favorite
haunt. Burr’s murder and the subsequent
threat just solidified the tree people’s feeling
that the city had a vendetta against them.
The city council recently agreed to fund
half of a $30,000 program called Project
Help to provide the local homeless with
shower facilities and mailing addresses in
the hope of improving their chances for
employment. Still, says Willard Hastings,
director of the nonprofit Legal Defense
Center of Santa Barbara, which filed a vot-
ing-rights suit on behalf of the displaced, the
town’s attitude remains “Old Western law
and order: get out of town and we won’t
bother you any more. Sweep the problem
under some other county’s rug.” Even that,
however, might not work. Where did a
group of homeless hide one night last week
after they were rousted by the police? Said
Joe Phillips, 63, nursing a Budweiser, “We
just scatter. But we stay. That’s it.”
Hoax: Late last week Santa Barbara po-
lice received a call from the man they are
convinced scrawled the death warning. Ac-
cording to Lt. Don Williams, the man said
the leaflet was just a hoax; he had recently
been robbed by one of the vagrants and
hoped to scare them away. And although
the tree people weren’t moving on, their fear
was palpable. Groups of 20 or more of the
homeless were sleeping together for protec-
tion on the city hall steps, around the rail-
road station and at other public spots. Said
hobo Phillips, who was staying with two
tree people near the Amtrak station,
“Somebody’s out there, crawlin’ up and
down the tracks doin’ it. It could be any-
body. That’s why we stay together.”

High-Tech Hatred
There are no sheets or burning crosses:
hatred has gone high tech. For $5, anyone
with a computer can plug into the Aryan
Nation Liberty Net, an electronic “bul-
letin board” offering the latest in neo-Nazi
thought, thanks to the Ku Klux Klan.
For example, under the heading know
your enemy there are lists of Communist
Party offices, as well as ZOG (“Zionist
Occupational Government”) “informers.”
And there are editorial offerings, as well. In
a discussion of the case of Leroy Little, a
Vietnam veteran serving a life term for
bombing communist headquarters in North
Carolina, the author inquires: “Why is it all
right for Leroy to shoot and bomb Commu-
nists 12,000 miles from home—but not at
home?” And among the enemies list, a Tex-
an named Buster Keaton carries a ghoulish
footnote: “Buster Keaton killed in an explo-
sion!!!! ... oh glorious day.”
While the messages bear the cryptic sig-
nature 33/5, the Klan makes no secret of its
involvement. “It’s a tremendous tool in the
awakening of the white Christian people to
the Jewish plot to destroy the white race and
Christianity,” said Glenn Miller, leader of
the North Carolina Klan, which operates
one of several such bulletin boards. Because
of the “Jewish-controlled mass media,” says
Miller, “we have to take our message direct-
ly to the people.”

No More ‘Mr. Nice Dinosaur'
Godzilla steps all over Tokyo: Roasting tall buildings in a single blast
TOHO
It is a hot, steamy night in Tokyo. Office
workers head home through the neon
haze of the city. Lovers stroll hand in hand.
The Japanese capital is peaceful. But wait—
what is the cause of that ominous swirl out
in the dark waters of Tokyo Bay? Is it a
belligerent battleship preparing to bom-
bard? Is it a sinister submarine about to
strike? No —it’s an enormous, radioactive
dinosaur bent on crushing Japan under his
scaly feet!
Only one giant reptile fits that descrip-
tion: Godzilla is back, and Japan’s got him.
The Toho Co. Ltd. is counting on his laser
breath to heat up the country. Thirty years
after the original Godzilla made millions of
matineegoers in both Japan and the United
States shake their popcorn with fright, the
film studio last week introduced the re-
doubtable reptile’s 16th film—“ Godzilla,”
a $6.5 million extravaganza that reportedly
drew more than 350,000 monster fans to
theaters in its first day.
Frightening: The original Godzilla,
awakened from his slumber under the sur-
face of the South Pacific by U.S. atomic-
bomb tests in 1954, was a raging lizard who
knew no quarter. But the scaly celebrity lost
something of his malevolent charm over his
last few films. Indeed, by the time Godzilla
made his last movie in 1975, he was nothing
more than a fire-breathing hero, defending
the earth against giant killer moths and
three-headed serpents. But for the new
Godzilla, it’s no more Mr. Nice Dinosaur.
Once again, the monster is out to roast tall
buildings with a single blast. “Fans said
they wanted to see a Godzilla who was
dangerous and frightening,” says Sayuri
Takano, manager of Toho’s 40,000-mem-
ber Godzilla fan club, “not a defender of
truth and justice.”
Godzilla’s revamped personality not-
withstanding, the new film looks like it
could have used a little help—and a little
cash —from Steven Spielberg. True, the
monster was made 98 feet taller, and mil-
lions of dollars were spent on miniature
mockups of Tokyo streets for Godzilla to
kick around. But on the screen, the special
effects are little more convincing than the
time when a stuntman donned the first
quilted Godzilla suit to trample the down-
scaled papier-mache foothills of Mount Fuji
three decades ago.
‘Egoism’: Even worse, Toho has tried to
push Godzilla out of the world of fantasy
and into the realm of realpolitik. The dino-
saur’s first victim is a Soviet submarine.
When he strides ashore, shrugging off rock-
ets fired by jet interceptors and an assault by
Japanese armored brigades, Godzilla is
threatened by orbiting Soviet and American
nuclear battle stations. Even stalwart Japa-
nese Prime Minister Mitamura is hard
pressed to keep the superpowers from wip-
ing Tokyo off the map in their eagerness to
test tactical nuclear weapons in combat.
“Prime minister,” shouts the stereotypical-
ly ugly American envoy, “this is no time to
talk of principles!” Mitamura replies: “Isn’t
your desire to use nuclear weapons nothing
more than American and Russian egoism?”
Well, that’s not why we go to see monster
movies. And, thankfully, despite the limp
political rhetoric, it looks as if Godzilla will
continue to roar. Never mind the wooden
acting. Forget the insipid romantic sub-
plots. Godzilla may have started out as
grade-B entertainment, but he has now
joined the pantheon of Japanese cult fig-
ures, and the fans are coming back for more.
After all, how can you not like a film that
closes with the lyric, “Take care, Godzil-
la/My old friend/Sayonara until we meet
again”?

TELEVISION
The Saga of Peter the Great
The temperature is a frosty 14 degrees
Fahrenheit and precious minutes of
winter daylight are ebbing away. But noth-
ing is moving on the set of NBC’s television
production of “Peter the Great” in Suzdal,
U.S.S.R. Several hundred soldiers and
horsemen from a special So-
viet Army unit that supplies
film extras were supposed to
be ready for a parade scene
at first light, but they are still
trying to get their wigs on.
Director Marvin J. Chom-
sky, like Napoleon and Hit-
ler before him, is finding out
that Russia in winter is a
tough road trip. Chomsky
stomps his feet and lights a
cigar. He grins bravely and
recites the company’s unof-
ficial motto: “It’s not the
time to take the take that
takes the time, it’s the time between
the takes.”
In a nearby cafeteria, Omar Sharif warms
himself with a cup of tea. Making “Dr.
Zhivago,” which he did in Spain, was never
like this. Sharif is displaying symptoms of
cabin fever, stemming from the communist
morality of his dezhurnaya, the Russian
Schell, Chomsky: Headaches
matron who, as in all Soviet hotels, passes
out the keys and maintains order in his
corridor. Sharif’s dezhurnaya will not even
allow him to have a guest in his room to play
chess. He lowers his voice to convey, with
appropriate pathos, the tragic import of her
policy: “I have given up on
ever making love here.”
NBC is betting that the
heroic battles, Byzantine
intrigues, grisly killings and
tempestuous affairs that
filled Peter’s life will at-
tract enough viewers to the
10-hour mini-series to jus-
tify Chomsky’s headaches,
Sharif’s abstinence —and
the film’s $26.5 million
budget. The network paid
the Soviets $5.3 million
for authentic, onion-domed
backdrops in Suzdal, Mos-
cow and Leningrad, real Russian extras and
the distinction of being the first American-
controlled drama shot on location in the
Soviet Union. Peter’s story is so dramatic
that few deviations from the historical facts
are required. The production will not be
entirely accurate, however. Maximilian
Schell, in the title role, has a name that will

attract viewers, but at 5 feet 11 inches he
cannot convey the awesome physicality of
Peter himself, who stood an impressive 6
feet 7 inches. There will be, however, no
political concessions to the Marxist inter-
pretation of Russian history. The Soviets do
not have script-review rights.
Working in Russia has ravaged the livers
Bleep, Bleep, Bleep
Something is supposed to be missing from Dutch radio and
television: advertising. In theory, ads are strictly limited to just a
few minutes during newscasts. In practice, however, on-air
personalities hurdle the barriers in a frenzy of name-dropping.
On “ 1 -2-3,” the most popular TV quiz show in the Netherlands,
Toyotas and Renaults roll gleaming across the stage. Ted de
Braak, the host, tells of enjoying a Heineken beer at de Bijenkorf,
Rotterdam’s posh department store. Hostesses decked out
in Holland International Travel
Agency uniforms greet the prize
winners. In the process, the show
has trumpeted five behind-the-
camera sponsors—but hasn’t vio-
lated the letter of the law.
Now this charade is about —
bleep! —to be edited out of ex-
istence. Culture Minister Elco
Brinkman has put the broadcast-
ers on notice: from now on, the
spirit of the advertising code will
be enforced, too. That means an
end to the nod-and-wink plugs. To
make sure they stick to the rules,
Brinkman has set up a panel to
monitor the airwaves. Each time a
program shows or mentions a con-
sumer product or service, it will be
fined a minimum of $8,550 —$285

for every second the olfending image is broadcast.
Already, Brinkman has sent out a list of “sins” of the broad-
casters. The news show “Televizier” was notified that such
coverage as its feature on the 1985-model Mercedes cars would
henceforth be forbidden. After urging his audience to buy a
particular book, critic Boudewijn Buch was warned to watch
his words. And even the pious Calvinist Evangelical Broadcast-
ers were told they had gone too far when they mentioned tours
for the handicapped to the Holy Land. The culture czar’s
crackdown has made everyone in Dutch broadcasting hopping
mad, and the stations pressured Parliament to overturn the
advertising code. Brinkman re-
plied: “These are panic reactions.
They all know the rules already.”
So far, most broadcasters seem
determined to poke fun at the
rules, hoping to ridicule Brink-
man into submission. Buch now
holds up novels in paper bags,
while a technician bleeps out al-
most everything he says: “This is a
very nicely written book. It is ti-
tled bleep , written by bleep and
published by bleep. Please go
to bleep bookshop and buy it.”
“1-2-3” host de Braak may have
concocted yet another dodge:
don’t call the prize a Lincoln; say,
“This fantastic car is an American
automobile . . . named after an
American president.”


and aggravated the ulcers of the Western
actors and crew members. Still, they say
that they have found the Soviets heart-
warmingly generous and genial. Scottish
actor Michael Ross MacKenzie struck up a
friendship with the swarthy Central Asians
in the stunt-riding crew, who have startled
the foreigners with their morning habit of
breaking the ice and bathing in the Ka-
menka River. They have included Mac-
Kenzie in their evening feasts, which fea-
ture whole roast sheep, washed down with
copious amounts of vodka and wine, ac-
companied by much singing, dancing and
toasting. MacKenzie came back to his hotel
room one night last week and enthused:
“Fve never had such a warm evening. It
alone makes being here worthwhile.”
But in a land where time and money are
not synonyms, Soviet crews work at their
own pace. Animals and actors due on the set
at 9 in the morning may show up at 11.
Shooting stopped in Suzdal for 12 days until
those infamous wigs arrived —three weeks
late. According to scuttlebutt, they were
delayed while a truck driver tarried to
dispose of a load of black-market melons.
One day’s shooting was lost when a Soviet
policeman on a highway between Moscow
and Suzdal decided that the company’s
sound mixer did not have the permit for-
eigners need for overland travel —and
turned him back.
Over Budget: Not that the company has
reason to be enamored of capitalists, either.
The cast and crew were assembled by Law-
rence Schiller, who sold the mini-series idea
to NBC and the Soviets. But when Schiller
ran $BOO,OOO over budget during two
months of shooting in Vienna, he was
abruptly fired. “It was a great tragedy,”
says Schell. Now, the actor adds, it is
Chomsky who gets telephone calls from
America demanding to know why the
shooting isn’t going faster. “It’s so easy for
them to sit in their warm offices and read the
bottom lines,” sniffs Schell. “They know
nothing about filmmaking.”
What is noteworthy about “Peter the
Great” is the simple fact that the Soviet
Union’s communist rulers allowed this tale
of a czar to be filmed in Russia. In the past,
standard Soviet practice has been to enter
into “coproductions” with Westerners —in
which Moscow retained control of the
script. The results were often leaden box-
office disasters, like 1982’s Italian-Soviet
“Red Bells,” a film based on John Reed’s
account of the 1917 Russian Revolution,
“Ten Days That Shook the World.” It suf-
fered in comparison with Warren Beatty’s
“Reds,” which was filmed in Finland. The
Soviets may be hoping that if “Peter the
Great” is. a success, it will bring in more
Western companies—and more hard cur-
rency. The Kremlin is obviously not inter-
ested in the film per se. Although NBC
plans to market “Peter the Great” world-
wide, Moscow has indicated it has no desire
to show it to the Soviet people.

A Taste of Honeydrippers
Robert Plant, the former lead singer of
Led Zeppelin, has a private musical
passion: rhythm and blues from the ’4os and
’sos. But nothing much came of it until last
spring, when Plant ran into Atlantic Rec-
ords chairman Ahmet Ertegun in Tokyo.
Ertegun had a few days free and suggested
that it might be fun to collaborate on an
album of the vintage music that he too
loved. Guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page
and pianist Paul Shaffer, all R&B aficiona-
dos, were brought in. Ertegun served as
Plant: Surprise success for a labor of love
PUTLAND— RETNA
producer, and the record was cut over a few
weekends in London and New York. To
avoid conflicts with Plant’s burgeoning solo
career, the band’s personnel weren’t identi-
fied on the album; Plant and Ertegun named
the mystery group “The Honeydrippers”
after a ’4os R&B band they remember
fondly. The project’s commercial prospects
were estimated to be approximately zero.
But what began as kicks be-
came serious business: the
Honeydrippers’ record is a hit.
The five-cut mini-LP was at
No. 4 last week; sales are at
950,000 and climbing. Even
Ertegun, an R&B pioneer who
at 60 calls himself “the oldest
active record man in the busi-
ness,” is taken aback. “I
thought we’d sell fifty to a hun-
dred thousand copies, just out
of curiosity,” he says. For Erte-
Ertegun: Old blues
BERNARD GOTFRVD— NEWSWEEK
gun and the other participants, it’s a happy
fluke. “The success of the record tells me
one thing,” Ertegun says. “We have to take
into consideration current taste when we
make records. But if you do something out-
side the current taste and do it very well —
the way Linda Ronstadt did on her big-band
albums —you can sometimes become the
exception to the rule.”
Sales of the first Honeydrippers single—
a remake of Phil Phillips’s 1959 slow-dance
sensation, “Sea of Love”—have been so
strong that Atlantic is delaying wide
release of a second single until “Sea”
runs dry. That may not happen for a
while, since last week the song ranked
seventh on the Billboard Hot 100. Its
success is not easy to figure. The song
was already schmaltz-laden the first
time it topped the charts, and Plant’s
lounge-lizard crooning, apparently
devoid of irony, comes close to sink-
ing the new version.
Rockabilly Drumbeat: Happily,
elsewhere on the record the band
takes their musical texts a little
less literally. Ray Charles’s “I Got
a Woman” bounces crazily between
a rockabilly drumbeat and soul-
ful R&B horns; the combination
shouldn’t work but does. And when
Plant and Beck lock into Roy
Brown’s 1948 “Rockin’ At Mid-
night,” and George Young tosses off
a deeply greasy tenor-sax solo, the air
turns hot and smoky. “It was so good
to be huddled ’round in the old style,
everybody playing, Robert scream-
ing his head off,” Jeff Beck says. At a
shade under six minutes, the song is
about twice as long as most R&B
records of the ’4os. The players were
having such a good time, Ertegun
says, that it seemed a shame to stop.
The Honeydrippers reassembled in New
York last week for an appearance on “Sat-
urday Night Live” (minus Beck, who was
replaced by ex-Stray Cat Brian Setzer).
Plant may include a few songs from the
album on his next tour, and the band will
issue a full-length album late next year.
Ertegun says the next set of sessions will be
as casual as the first —whoever
happens to be in town will drop
by and play. The goal will also
be the same: to “make a record
that would have been a fantas-
tic smash in 1949.” In his New
York office, “Rockin’ At Mid-
night” blasting from mam-
moth speakers, Ertegun drums
his fingers dreamily. "Good
old shuffle blues,” he says.
“It’ll get ’em every time.”

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Building a Better Automobile Engine
In their efforts to design a more efficient engine, automobile
manufacturers are simultaneously pursuing two avenues of
research. One strategy is an attempt to improve the time-tested
internal-combustion system in order to propel a car farther on
a gallon of fuel with less noise and fewer emissions. The second
approach aims at leapfrogging the current state of the art by
devising new ways to make a car go. Each method has its
advantages; recently, both have produced significant advances
in engine technology.
Propelling Cars With Plastic
An entry in a recent auto race in Watkins Glen, N.Y.,
points one possible way to the future. While car No. 8
finished a mediocre 35th in a field of 56, its sponsors could
boast that it was the first race car constructed using a largely
plastic engine. More than half the car’s 168-pound experi-
mental power plant was made of Torlon, a durable polymer
manufactured by Amoco
Chemical Corp. of Chica-
go, 111. Specifically, Torlon
is a “thermoplastic,” a
material that can withstand
temperatures of up to 500
degrees Fahrenheit. Poli-
motor Research Inc. of
Fair Lawn, N.J., designed
the engine using Torlon
parts except in the combus-
tion zone, where tempera-
tures as high as 1,600 de-
grees still require the use of
conventional metal parts.
The engine block, normally
the heaviest single component, was constructed of Cycom,
a plastic composite reinforced with carbon fibers.
Plastic engines have several advantages over the standard
metal variety. The Polimotor engine, for instance, is 50 percent
lighter than a conventional engine, which can mean as much as
a 10 percent improvement in fuel efficiency. Plastic is also
quieter than metal and of course does not rust. Torlon parts do
not need the precise machining that is required to produce
metal engine parts. Instead, the plastic is melted and injected
into appropriately-shaped molds. This process is faster and
allows Torlon to be crafted into complex shapes. As a result,
one Torlon component can often take the place of two or more
metal parts and the plastic engine can easily be retooled to
reflect advances in engineering. Although Torlon is somewhat
more expensive than metal, Amoco officials say they are
confident that its advantages will enable car makers—who are
already testing it in America and Europe—to build plastic
engines cost-effectively by the end of the decade.
Running Cleaner on Diesel Power
Diesel engines, once the darling of high-efficiency auto
engineers, have come upon hard times. Although they are as
much as 30 percent more efficient per gallon of fuel than their
gasoline-powered cousins, their appeal has recently been un-
dercut —at least in the huge U.S. auto market —by falling
prices for conventional fuel. To add to the problem, manufac-
Under the hood of the Peugeot 205 E: Power from batteries
turers of diesel-powered cars, which produce considerably
more soot than their gasoline-fueled equivalents, will come
under increased pressure beginning in 1987 when the U.S.
government implements stringent new emissions standards.
General Motors of Detroit, Mich., has decided to stop offering
diesel engines as an option (except for its trucks and bottom-of-
the-line Chevette) beginning in 1986. Nevertheless, Daimler-
Benz of Stuttgart, West Germany—which expects to sell
40,000 diesel-powered cars in the United States this year—has
decided to keep on fighting, with a device that the company
says will cut the soot output of its diesel engines by two-thirds.
Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y., manufactures the cylindri-
cal filter, which is called a trap oxidizer and is mounted on an
engine’s exhaust manifold. Gases entering the device are
forced through a porous ceramic honeycomb, which traps the
soot. The device also reduces engine noise, a nagging point of
consumer resistance to diesel-powered cars. Daimler is al-
ready installing the oxidizer on all Mercedes turbodiesels to
be sold in 11 Western U.S.
states. Although the oxi-
dizer cuts engine accelera-
tion by 5 percent, Daimler
is retooling its diesels to
compensate for the loss in
power. The oxidizer, the
company says, will not in-
crease the delivery price of
its cars.
Electric Autos
Peugeot S.A. of Paris,
France, which already man-
ufactures both gasoline and
diesel cars, has made major new strides with a more unortho-
dox automobile fuel: electricity. The company recently un-
veiled the 205 Electrique, a prototype small car that resembles
the popular Peugeot 205 in every way except one—it gets its
“go” from 12 batteries under the hood. Peugeot claims to have
solved the perennial electric-car problems: limited range and
speed. The 205 E reportedly achieves a top speed of 62 miles per
hour and cruises for 124 miles before needing a recharge. Like
all electric vehicles, the Peugeot runs almost silently and is
virtually nonpolluting. It takes from 8 to 10 hours to recharge
using a built-in recharger that can plug into any standard
outlet, making it ideal for the short, repetitive trips to which
automobile experts have long maintained that the electric car is
best suited.
Rather than conventional lead-acid batteries, the 205 E uses
batteries made of nickel and iron that, due to their chemical
composition, not only deliver double the electrical output of
ordinary car batteries but have a life span twice as long. A 17.5-
kilowatt motor drives its front wheels. No gear shifting is
necessary, since the engine delivers full torque at any speed.
Critics have already pointed out that although 205 E’s nickel-
iron batteries are cheaper at the outset than the more exotic
types used in other electric-car prototypes, they can be expen-
sive to recharge. Peugeot officials are nevertheless optimistic,
and say they hope that the firm will one day produce an electric
car based on the 205 E system.

LITERARY
SUPPLEMENT
A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF THE BEST MODERN AUSTRALIAN WRITING
NENE GARE’S Thoughts of a Literary
Judge in this issue will stir a cello-
like vibrato in the soul of any editor,
especially one whose contributions come in
the hundreds as they do to The Bulletin’s
Literary Supplement. It is ironic that the
more distinguished and professional the
writer, the better-presented is his or her
typescript.
One might perhaps think that a new
writer would take the most trouble to make
a contribution look as good as possible on
paper, hoping that it will attract rather than
repulse the editor. But no, the contributions
come ill-typed, even hand-written, with
folds in the paper revealing previous
rejections. How can one take a writer ser-
iously who has not only abandoned basic
grammar but has not even proof-read
his/her typescript for literals? And then
there is the final outrage of no stamped,
self-addressed envelope!
These manifestations reveal what is at
the heart of Nene Gare’s sympathetic pro-
test which is that so many stories and
poems are personal outpourings which have
not been worked into shape, a process that
can be long and painful. They are a kind of
therapy. To invoke Auden: “Art is not life,
and cannot be a midwife to society.”
Xavier Herbert has already had a good
wake in The Bulletin. But it would be
impossible to let the Christmas Supplement
appear without mourning his death and
being grateful that his writing will live.
Finally, my deepest thanks to the ANZ
Bank for its generous sponsorship of this
supplement.

An interview by David Kerr
and Phillip Edmonds
JUDITH RODRIGUEZ AND
HER POETRY
Perth-born poet Judith Rodriguez is also noted as a musician and
as an artist, but it is her poetry she is invited to talk about here.
EDMONDS: Judith Rodriguez was
born in Perth in 1936 and began
writing poetry at 15. She studied at the
University of Queensland where she
developed an interest in music. She
has taught in girls’ schools and at the
University of Queensland. For two
years she was doing postgraduate
research at Cambridge and later in
Jamaica. She is a contemporary of two
former Queenslanders, David Malouf
and Rodney Hall. Since 1974 her work
has become widely known to readers of
Australian poetry. She is currently a
senior lecturer in English at La Trobe
University. Her published books in-
clude New Plastic Fanfare Red ,
University of Queensland Press;
Waterlife, University of Queensland
Press, Shadow of Glass, Open Door
Press; and Mudcrabs at Gambaros,
University of Queensland Press. Miss
Rodriguez, could you tell us about your
most recent work?
RODRIGUEZ: I have written some
narrative poems: one about George
Bass, the traveller; and a poem in
several parts about the wreck of the
Batavia before I knew Tom Shapcott.
But seeing what he could do with
narrative and drama suddenly made
me feel that a lot of my poems were
clenched and small and I thought I
would like to try expanding. I do not
know how much I will keep on that
tack.
KERR: These “small” poems came
out of your personal way of seeing
experience around you?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, well I think that
Edgar Allen Poe was right. If it is truly
a lyric, very intense, psychic ex-
perience, it is probably brief and pro-
bably appropriately expressed in a
small poem. But then human beings
are interested in circumstances, and
they spread. So I think that there is a
link between these things.
EDMONDS: In the book that I
regard as your best book, Waterlife,
there are many fine poems. I am
thinking specifically of “Rebecca in a
Mirror”.
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, well I am glad
you like that because Rodney Hall put
it in his Collins Book of Australian
Poetry. This is one of the first poems
that I wrote about my children and I,
in the beginning, found it very difficult
to write about them probably
because I felt very much for them. This
was a fairly expansive one for my third
child.
KERR: It reminds me a little of
Judith Wright’s work but it goes a little
beyond what she used to do in that
kind of thing.
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, well of course
Judith Wright went before all of us
who are writing now in so many ways.
There are poems of hers I greatly
admire for fathoming feelings that I
have not dissected yet in, for in-
stance, “Naked Girl and Mirror” and
her “Eloise Awakening” which are
terrific poems. One about folding table
linen to which I want to write a kind of
footnote, and I was fascinated to see
that Rosemary Dobson has a poem on
this women’s ritual too.
EDMONDS: How do you see the
poem now? You were saying before
that you are moving away from the
poems that you regarded as small.
RODRIGUEZ: Oh, that is not one of
the clenched ones I think. Perhaps
that is what disconcerted me when I
first wrote it. It is very free in form. I
am pleased to see that I was doing
there, I think pleasantly in a way that
satisfies me, a lot of sound patterning.
This does fascinate me. I think it
fascinates a lot of poets who started in
the fifties. That was something that
was de rigueur and I think it is
something not to lose. Having it free
and loose and easy, you get with the
language.
EDMONDS: What particularly im-
pressed me about “Rebecca in a
Mirror” was that it portrays a lot of
feeling but it is never sentimental.
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, well I feel that
the tension is between sentiment and
sense. It is one of the more interesting
things about being human.
KERR: There is delight in life in
these poems. But poetry not only
delights in life it reacts to the things
that are happening around it. In your
poetry over the last ten or fifteen years,
how have you reacted to the sorts of
things that have been happening in
Australia?
RODRIGUEZ: Well, I think I was
long bewildered by the way that people
I knew reacted to politics, which was a
closed book to me, and I had been
raised on a sort of fixity of views
that people’s characters did not
change, that there were steady sorts of
principles that one could stick to. And
I think it was when I came back to




Australia after ten years away that I
was startled out of this. I realised why
my close friend David Malouf had
marched against Vietnam in London.
Over there I could not understand it, I
was not very sensitive to that kind of
thing. And when I came back here I
was rather shocked by the flatness and
uncaringness, apparent uncaringness,
of a lot of Australian behaviour, public
behaviour in the newspapers, that sort
of thing. I think this was a customary
jolt. I think a lot of people coming back
feel that, and it is longer the first time,
and when you get behind it, of course
you find that there is real concern.
Well, towards the middle of the 70s, I
think before International Women’s
Year, I had also begun to feel that I
had to fight my way out of a personal
paper bag and be more enterprising,
and this really coincided with the rise
of concern about women's freedoms. I
think Waterlife is full of that; and right
now I feel very concerned at the
direction that society in this country is
taking, and how it will act on the art
that has been really roused up in the
last ten years most productively.
KERR: What I am suggesting is that
your book Waterlife is very much a
celebration of life and of the variety,
the complexity of living, the danger,
the risk. And conservatism, which is
perhaps the arch enemy of that sort of
thing, is a clamp that tries to ensure
that things should remain solid and
stable and unshifting.
RODRIGUEZ: Well, I think that the
tension between them is often quite
helpful. If you look ahead and see some
constriction on your own life I know
I am doing it you know, here is
something to use, here is something to
fight and we will get some productive
energy out of it, but I am afraid I do
not view, say, the funding of the Arts
or the certain attitudes about the Arts
at present very happily. I think we are
going to be very good to writers who
have proved themselves in a financial
way in the last ten years, but I do not
think perhaps we are letting through
enough young people. Well, as long as
one thinks like that there is something
to fight and to work against. I think
that is good and I think it works on a
personal scale in poems too.
KERR: Judith, it is often said that it
is a problem for women poets in a
male-dominated society to get due
recognition. How does this affect you?
RODRIGUEZ: Well, like most
women who write poetry I find myself
doing a very large number of jobs. I
think fragmented time is the biggest
problem for a woman poet who, if she
is that way inclined, probably wants a
husband and children, also wants a
job, and beyond that has to make
imaginative space. I envy the women
who have either very firmly made
themselves that space right at the
beginning who, like a man, have said,
“This-is the main thing lam going to
do”, instead of saying, “that will have
to come after all the rest.” And I also
envy the older woman who has
managed to shuffle off some of those
commitments. I think that is one
problem. I do not think I have ever felt
diffident about sending my stuff to
magazines. I am very fortunate in the
people that I gang with Rodney
Hall, David Malouf. They accepted
that I wrote poetry, different poetry
from theirs, and we swapped criti-
cisms. I never felt put down in getting
my poetry known or published.
KERR: Has this affected your own
writing of poetry the pressure which
women have come under?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes. It has always
been something to bounce back and
prove oneself in a way that one could
do something and try to do it very well.
I have never felt pressure from re-
viewers. I do not care very much about
reviews except regretting when a bad
one comes out in a good place. It is
hard on sales; you work harder. It has
been very cheering that people have
Red spots at Aswan
(for Amanda Salomon)
Now, a drowning in the blue Pacific off a North Sydney beach,
With all those pretty homes, is my idea of death; whistling to
dolphins
As you go down: Or gassed pleasantly in the apartment’s lock-up
garage,
Somewhere in the Fifth Arrondissement: Or taken out in Fifth
Avenue
By a Cadillac, and breaking apart in the spin, splattering windows
Of jewellers and furriers with long ribbons of blood; wealthy in my
death.
But a Third World Termination, Developing Economy annulment,
Though a worthy aspiration, came on as rather unexpected.
In the fading flower, the Grand Hotel at Aswan, Upper Egypt,
The walls shedding paint like dry petals, making something
Of a stand against dysentery, but not much of one:
Outside the open window, the Nile, coursing across the cataract,
Talked of the Plagues of Egypt; the Seven Plagues of Egypt.
And the red spots came up one morning like Biblical retribution
For my Drunkenness and Idolatory, Witchcraft and Adultery,
Blasphemy and Jealousy, Theft and Trickery, Sodomy and VD;
And the swellings set sail across my body like great felucca birds
On the water, slowly but irrevocably
And I thought as I watched, Ah, Sweet Moment of Truth,
Off to meet the Great Employer, not even in a Union.
Two days and nights the swellings came and went, and the woman
With me saved my life, connecting room to allergy; by then
The thing was shaking me, to the roots, face twisted, •
Head whining, body blown up like a bladder, gripped by fever.
We slept in the hotel lobby and the night waiter brought me water
And smiled, knowing if I lived he’d charge me double: He did:
And French doctors came at dawn and shook their heads saying
“Le Botulisme, Le Botulisme,” and then it was the heart
That almost gave. I saw death as the lottery which might choose me
Or else leave me a little longer to suffer in that baggy skin,
Perhaps let to live on for years, and all that foolishness.
I only knew that to live was for her, and those few
Who really wanted me; life was of no intrinsic value,
For the first and only time in my life, I was freed.
On the third day we chose to fly Egypt.
No pharaoh pursued us, not even an American jet.
But it made me ponder whei’e death would be fitting
On a beach, in a garage, on the street, in bed;
Or in Egypt, a land wealthy in death, going west
With the sun, settling down across the Nile.
LARRY BUTTROSE


dug up the history of women in the last
ten years, looked at it and decided that
we can do a lot better, a lot more. That
is very encouraging, and a lot of my
poems do concentrate on that in
women. In my own family I took the
eldest daughter in my mother’s family
and looked at her she had a jazz
band. She died when she was 50.
EDMONDS: Can I get back to how
the women’s movement affected your
poetry. Mother I’m Rooted The
Outback Anthology. How did you view
that book?
RODRIGUEZ: I think it was a very
brave book. Kate Jennings phoned me
up and then came to see me. She
practically fell into my arms when I
said straight away of course she could
have some poems because she had got
some knockbacks from people who
were highly esteemed and I think she
felt that the level of the poetry might
be very low. I think that was very hard
on her because I do not think it
matters the company you publish in. It
is much harder on people who are
starting or who are not poets by
conviction but, Gwen Harwood is
not there. I do not think Dorothy
Hewett is there, and certainly I can
understand that, say, Rosemary
Dobson would not feel comfortable in
the company of feminists who were
tearing their guts out and displaying
them in public and stabbing images all
over the place. But I do not find that
company repulsive. It is one
framework in which I can see the
writing of poetry.
People are looking for women’s
experience. They have always read the
poets to be supported in their dark
moments or their light moments. ■
THOUGHTS OF
A LITERARY JUDGE
by Nene Gare
Novelist Nene Gare, best known for The Fringe
Dwellers, emerged from the experience of
judging a West Australian literary competition
with these notes.
MY FIRST thought is “Why should I
be asked to judge these stories?” So
many of them were well and pro-
fessionally written. I might have added
“Why are they not in print?” I like
anthologies. They keep me up to date
with who is writing, who is new to the
scene, how good they are.
Having said that I have been
appalled is not too strong a word by
the high percentage of stories written
by sad, disillusioned and frustrated
housewives and mothers. One story
was nothing but a category of daily
duties and my comment is “This story
is for you. Now write something for
us.”
Publishers look for material that
catches interest, that entertains,
diverts. Women writers will be read
most often by women. Women who
know your frustrations off by heart
because we too have endured them. So
subsume. Tuck away your disap-
pointments and bring them forth only
as you need them to fill out a
character. And remember, too much
spoils the flavor.
Look up and around observe the
others who occupy your world. It may
help if I tell you that long, long ago one
of my editors told me “You write well
but you need to write of more interest-
ing things.” Not only more interesting
things; we need to write in interesting
language. Poetic, unusual, stimulating,
shocking, stirring, this sentence
electrified me “Mum, now you’re
going to be a grandmother, do you
think you could stop dyeing your
hair?” Mother and daughter instantly
became living folk. How do you feel
about them?
Some stories made me want to rush
into advice straightaway. Those awful
diminutives Trace for Tracey, Hobe
for Hobart, Hill instead of the lovely
Hilary don’t you think readers could
feel a slight chill? The kind one feels
when friendliness too soon becomes
familiarity? A reader, in my opinion,
should be able to preserve anonymity.
And those extra words and sentences
that hammer home the point. Could
you not trust to your reader’s in-
telligence? Believe me, in most cases
you may.
Many of the stories should be in
State archives. They are not short
stories in the usual sense of the word.
They are accounts. Of youth, of an
unforgettable happening, a personal
experience. They would be of
tremendous value for researchers. My
advice is to offer them to the archivist
in your State. They are part of
Australia’s history.
Bless the few whose entries made
me laugh. Humor is in such short
supply right now. And it is daunting
work reading drama. I remember the
female Pope and the male dog whose
only prize was won for being champion
bitch.
Technical faults were, for me, heart-
breaking. I cannot get accustomed to
spelling errors scattered like confetti
throughout a manuscript. Nor can I
approve of careless sentence construc-
tion. It holds me up. How about the
following? “that she had to will
herself into acceptance of their com-
petence to hold their posts.” Or “I
found myself feeling cheated.” And “Of
course she welcomed him politely,
unable to break away from good man-
ners and offered him coffee which he
accepted.” For heaven’s sake, fall
passionately and possessively in love
with your language. Care about it.


“I’m ten percent lover, eight percent poet and two percent head
librarian. The rest, I’m afraid, is water.”
Experiment. Cut out the rubbish and
leave the guts. Fourth best is not good
enough.
In some stories, at the point where
interest was aroused, I found myself
pushed back into the past or projected
into the future, the story held up while
explanations were made. I may be
mistaken to approve the modern way
but more stories than not nowadays
dispense altogether with tedious ex-
planations. One is expected to use
one’s imagination. It does not matter
that each reader makes something a
little different from the same material.
Explanations are boring, short ones
just permissible. Skip the explaining
and get stuck into the story. Give it all
away in the first paragraph if what you
have been fiddling with sounds dull.
Don’t be afraid. More will come.
Finally, do not let writing take over
your life. You are writing about life but
before you can do that you must live. ■
RECOLLECTION
OF OLD PADDO
by Mrs Vera Robinson
At 74, Mrs Robinson is a survivor of the old
Paddington, before it became fashionable. Her
next-door neighbor, Sue Ferrier, has
contributed a drawing.
IT’S FIFTY YEARS since we first
moved in. How wonderful. It didn’t
matter that we didn’t have a lot of
furniture and carpets. They would
come later. After living in flats and
flatettes for six years it was just
heaven to know we had a house at last.
The rent was one guinea one
quarter of our weekly salary. We were
young and healthy and I had plenty of
elbow grease.
Two bedrooms, two balconies, a
lounge, dining-room and kitchen and a
bathroom. Some bathroom. Weather-
board, a bath, tub, and a copper which
knew all the Indian smoke signs. I was
useless with it. Got the copper boiling
all right after nearly suffocating
everyone.
But the view. I used to stand in the
back yard, which was all uneven, and
just look and look. No high-rise build-
ings, in front of me, so I could look
over to the quarantine station on
North Head, and on rough weather
days could see the spray on the cliffs as
the big waves hit them. Across the
harbor we could see the zoo gates and
in the early morning could hear the
lions roaring.
We could see all the big liners
arriving and leaving. On special occa-
sions when fireworks lit the sky all our
friends would come and bring the
children and we’d watch with no ob-
struction of our view. We could look
over to Darling Point, and this was like
looking at painted pictures of England.
That was fifty years ago. Now, I can
stand just outside my kitchen door and
count at least 25 high-rise buildings.
I was born in Little Essex Street, off
Harrington Street, at The Rocks, 73
years ago. My grandfather was a coal
lumper. I suppose that means he was
some kind of a wharfie. My father, his
son, was the local garbage man who
was loved and respected by many.
Many a child on The Rocks would not
have had the taste of fruit and vegies
except for him. He’d take a bit of extra
rubbish for somebody and get these in
return, and give them out. There were
no pensions in those days. Dad would
bring a chaff bag of fruit and vegies
home twice a week, and divide them up
for our family and those out of work.
My mother’s father was a sea
captain, Alec Robertson, a pioneer on
the north coast in Grafton, who
worked for the N.C. Steamship Co.
One of my ancestors was a convict. She
murdered someone, I was told when I
was young, but it didn’t worry me.
What was good enough for the kings
and queens of England was good
enough for me. Only I mustn’t tell
anyone. Now it doesn’t matter.
Everyone takes it all in their stride.
Enough of The Rocks.
From there we went to
Woolloomooloo in Dowling Street. I
used to watch the fire engine with the
horses come from the station. I can
still see the horses prancing under the
harness which hung from the ceiling
and which seemed to fit them instantly,
and the trotting down William Street.
Also at that time the funeral
hearses were all glass, with the horses
all black, with big white plumes in
their harness above their heads, and to
me, aged eight, it seemed wonderful. I
used to ask Mum and Dad if I died
could I have a funeral just the same, as
everyone would raise their hats to me,
and I’d be someone.
From Woolloomooloo we moved to
Darlinghurst, to Ice Street, near the
boundary of Darlinghurst and
Paddington. Then we crossed the
boundary and arrived in Paddo. At
last. Mum and Dad lived in Quarry
Street up near the gates of the Tip.
They waged a war against cockroaches
and rats, which seemed to be part of
the scenery, There weren’t many
things invented to get rid of vermin,
and people would have to scald them
with boiling water. Bugs were things


“At 15... I went and got a job”
Illustration by SUE FERRIER
nearly everyone had, no matter how
clean you were. Then the fleas. They
were so easily caught. No one took any
notice of people attending to these
chores, as we all did them.
Once Paddington was called the
slums and when I applied for a job and
said I lived in Paddington the woman
nearly had a fit. Anyway, I got a
position at radio station 2FC. I was
asked to make the tea, and after two
months I didn’t want to be a tea girl. I
had learnt shorthand and typing and
book-keeping and thought it was be-
neath me, so I left and was sent back to
school. This at 15, so at 15 and three
months I decided I’d had repeating
Third Year and went and got a job
where I could use all these skills, plus
the switchboard and many other minor
jobs, but thought it was lovely so I
stayed in that job till I was married.
Living in Paddington has been a
great experience. I’ve met lots of nice
people and only a few I don’t like. I’ve
many friends at 35 to 45 years and I
have one friend from way back; we’ve
known each other for 65 years. When
we were young we didn’t have any
spare money, so if you wanted to go out
without the kids you could always
leave them with someone and pay them
back in kind. Instead of carting the
poor little kids to the shops we’d take
turns in watching them for a few
hours. If one was ill there was someone
to call in and do any messages and
collect the kids. The key could be left in
the front door and no one worried.
Of a morning when we’d clean the
front of the house we could leave the
front doors open and no one would
come in. Also if we had no money,
which was pretty often, we could walk
to Centennial Park, take the kids to
Seven Bob Beach, now Redleaf, or
down to Rushcutters Bay to the baths
which have now been demolished.
No longer do we hear the cry of
“Rabbits rabbitos!” or “Clothes props!
Clothes props!” You got a pair of
rabbits for 11% pence, the props being
a shilling. Fruit carts are missing, no
fisherman calls out his wares and the


Chinaman with his pole and two
baskets is long since gone. The
milkman and his cart are gone. His
horse which our daughter and the
kiddies next door used to feed would
come sedately down from Jersey Road
to Windsor Street, and as soon as
Nellie reached Elizabeth Street she
would take off to our end for her feed
of bread.
On New Year’s Eve we’d all go out
in the street and dance and sing songs.
But I still love Paddo. We’ve had our
ups and downs, good times and bad,
and it seems strange that I have never
lived farther than about four miles
from where I was born.
The first time I saw an aeroplane
was when the tram driver stopped the
tram so we could all hop out and look
at it. We had a wireless with a cat’s
whisker, and I never had electricity
until I was married, and I was scared
stiff.
Paddington Town Hall was
marvellous. Old time dances, balls,
children’s dances. When I think how
we’d spend all Saturday afternoon
ironing our dresses and primping up,
and we all enjoyed ourselves and
looked like women. Mind you, I like
jeans in their place. I’m no crank and
there’s no generation gap between me
and my grandchildren, nor my daugh-
ter or daughter-in-law, who all wear
them at times.
We had kindergartens in
Paddington to which two of my
children went. We paid two and
sixpence a week first, and then when
lunches were provided the price was
raised to five shillings. It was the Peter
Pan, in Union Street. At the end of
term we’d put our swimming costumes
on and scrub and polish the kindy from
top to bottom. When we scrubbed the
cots we’d hose each other. When
polishing the floor someone would play
the piano. We’d put the polish on and
sit on bags, and some people would
play at being the horses and we’d have
horse races, and did that floor shine!
I look back on a life of laughter and
tears, but thank God that although I
have a sick husband I am mostly
healthy, and I can still see the funny
side of things. ■
IN TRUST
by David Malouf
David Maloufs most recent novel is Harland’s
Half Acre. During 1984 he has been writer in
residence at Macquarie University.
THERE IS TO begin with the par-
aphernalia of daily living: all those
objects, knives, combs, coins, cups,
razors, that are too familiar, too worn
and stained with use, a door-knob, a
baby’s rattle, or too swiftly in passage
from hand to mouth or hand to hand to
arouse more than casual interest. They
are disposable, and are mostly
disposed of without thought. Tram
tickets, matchboxes, wooden serviette
rings with a poker design of
poinsettias, button-hooks, beermats,
longlife torch batteries, the lids of
Doulton soup tureens, are carted off at
last to a tip and become rubble, the
sub-stratum of cities, or are pulped and
go to earth; unless, by some quirk of
circumstance, one or two examples are
stranded so far up the beach in a
distant decade that they become col-
lectors’ items, and then so rare and
evocative as to be the only survivors of
their age.
So it is in the life of objects. They
pass out of the hands of their first
owners into a tortoiseshell cabinet,
and then, whole or in fragments it
scarcely matters, on to the shelves of
museums. Isolated there, in the
oddness of their being no longer
common or repeatable, detached from
their history and from the grime of
use, they enter a new dimension. A
quality of uniqueness develops in them
and they glow with it as with the
breath of a purer world meaning
only that we see them clearly now in
the light of this one. An oil-lamp, a
fragment of cloth so fragile that we
feel the very grains and precious dust
of its texture (the threads barely hold-
ing in their warp and woof), a perfume
flask, a set of taws, a strigil, come
wobbling towards us, the only angels
perhaps we shall ever meet, though
they bear no message but their own
prescence: we are here.
It is in a changed aspect of time that
we recognise them, as if the substance
of it a denseness that prevented us
from looking forward or too far back
had cleared at last. We see these
objects and ourselves as co-existent, in
the very moment of their first stepping
out into their own being and in every
instant now of their long pilgrimage
towards us, in which they have gath-
ered the fingerprints of their most
casual users and the ghostly but still
powerful presence of the lives they
served.
None of our kind come to us down
that long corridor. Only the things
they made and made use of, which still
somehow keep contact with them. We
look through the cracked bowl to the
lips of children. Our hand on an axe-
handle fits into an ancient groove and
we feel the jarring of tree-trunk on
bone. Narrowly avoiding through all
their days the accidents that might
have toppled them from a shelf, the
flames, the temper tantrums, the odd
carelessness of a user’s hand, they are
still with us. We stare and are amazed.
Were they once, we ask ourselves, as
undistinguished as the buttons on our
jacket or a stick of roll-on deodorant?


“William’s a successful software author, but we don’t know what
he’s going to do when he grows up.”
Our own utensils and artefacts take on
significance for a moment in the light
of the future. Small coins glow in our
pockets. Our world too seems vividly,
unbearably present, yet mysteriously
far off.
Each decade a new class of objects
comes into being as living itself creates
new categories of use. After the cen-
turies of the Bowl (plain or decorated
with rice-grains, or with figures, some
of them gods, in hieratic poses, or
dancing or making love) come the
centuries of the Wheel, the age
of Moving-across-the-Surface-of-the-
Earth, from the ox-cart to the Silver
Spur.
Later again, it is not only objects
that survive and can be collected.
Images too, the shadowy projection of
objects, live on to haunt us with the
immediacy of what was: figures alone
or in groups, seated with a pug dog on
their knees or stiffly upright in boating
costume beside an oar; a pyramid of
young men in flannel slacks and
singlets holding the difficult pose
forever, blood swelling their necks as
they strain upward, set on physical
perfection; three axemen beside a
fence, leaning their rough heads
together; the crowd round an air-
balloon. Bearded, monocled, or in hoop
skirts under parasols, and with all
their flesh about them, they stare
boldly out of a century of Smiles . . .
NOT LONG AGO, in the Museum of
the Holocaust at Jerusalem, a middle-
aged American, an insurance assessor,
gave a sudden cry before one of the
exhibits, threw out his arms, and while
two maiden ladies from Hannibal Mis-
souri looked on in helpless dismay, fell
slowly to his knees then, clutching
his chest, even more slowly to the
pavement at their feet. They tried to
help him, but he did not get up again.
His tour companions had found him
difficult, a loud, dull fellow. He had
informed them that he made eighty-
five thousand dollars a year, had a
house at Fresno and a ranch near
Santa Fe, was divorced from a woman
called Emmeline who had cost him his
balls in alimony, had a son who was on
heroin, voted for Reagan, hated the
Ruskies and that god-damned
Ayatollah the usual stuff. He wore a
gold ring on one finger with a Hebrew
letter (he was Jewish).
And now, right in the middle of a
nine-day tour of all the holy places,
Christian, Jewish and you-name-it, he
was dead. He had, it seems, been
confronted here with the only surviv-
ing record of his family, a group
picture taken forty years before on the
welcoming-ramp at Treblinka: his
mother,' father, two sisters, his six-
year-old self, all with the white breath
pouring out of their mouths in the
January cold, heads turned in half-
profile and slightly lifted towards the
darkness just ahead, with beyond it
(though this they could not have
foreseen) a metre of roughened
museum wall and the door into an-
other country.
It was that vision of himself in the
same dimension as the long dead that
struck the man and struck him down:
that rather than any recollection of the
moment when the shot was taken. To
see thus, from the safe distance of an
American travel-group he had joined
in Athens, Greece, that lost gathering
to which he most truly belonged, and
to see at last just where it was (despite
the forty years detour) that he was
headed, had pushed him to the only
step he could have taken straight
through the wall; and an error made
nearly half a century ago, when an
officer had breathed too lightly on a
rubber stamp, was righted at last and a
number restored to sequence. His cry
was a home-coming.
His fellow-travellers on this later
occasion, though shaken, went on to
the rest of the experience: images,
objects, carefully worked facts and
descriptions. Only that one man went
right to the centre, stepping through a
wall that was in the end as in-
substantial as breath, and on into
flame.
GILLIAN VAUGHAN came back from
her great-aunt Connie’s with a present,
a large and rather dog-eared envelope
that she was clutching with fervour to
her schoolgirl breast and which she
refused at first to show.
Her mother was disconcerted, and
not for the first time, by the child’s
intractable oddity. At just eleven
Gillian was old-fashioned that was
the kind way of putting it, and
stubbornly so; it was something she
would not outgrow. It worried the
mother, since her own nature was
uncomplicated, easy (or so she
thought), and she would have wished
for the same qualities in her child.
“Gillian darling,” she protested now,
but mildly, she was easily hurt, “what
on earth? I mean, what are we to do
with them?”
“Nothing,” the girl replied. “Look
after them, that’s all. I said I would
and I will. You don’t have to worry. I’ll
do it. They’re Aunt Connie’s most
treasured possessions.”
The envelope contained five x-ray
photographs, and the curious child
had chosen them.
Connie Hermiston, great-aunt
Connie, was eighty-seven. For the past


“Sir Gawain said he was sorry he had slain the woman. Sir Bors then
proposed a resolution opposing the slaying of women, which was
passed. A very large knight rode in and challenged the entire company;
this was tabled for a twelvemonth. There being no further business, we
adjourned.”
year or more she had been passing on
to her various nieces, and to those
grand-nieces with whom she had con-
tact, the family relics she was respons-
ible for and which she wanted to leave
now in younger hands.
She was not herself a collector, but
she had, because of her extreme age,
become the custodian over the years of
other peoples’ treasures though
treasures was too large a word for the
jumble of bits and pieces she had
stacked for safe-keeping in cupboards,
drawers and odd cartons and hat-boxes
beside her wardrobe. Other peoples’
sentiments or passions might be more
accurate, as they attached themselves,
mysteriously sometimes, to a kewpie
doll on a black crook, from the
Brisbane Exhibition of 1933, a fan
made of peacock-feathers, several
evening bags, pearl-handled cake-
forks, a little lounge-suite made of
iridescent china, medals, pushers-and-
spoons, Coronation cups, christening
dresses, handpainted birthday cars
with celluloid lace edges. None of it
had any real value, it was just family
stuff; but each item had its pedigree,
with the name attached (so far as
great-aunt Connie’s memory could be
trusted) of a Hermiston or a Cope or a
Vaughan or a Glynn-Jones. Offered
something out of this treasure house
that should be hers, some piece of
family history that she should be the
one to carry forward, Gillian had
chosen the x-rays. Only now, when she
regarded them with her mother’s eyes,
did she see that her choice might be
peculiar. She sighed, unhappy to dis-
cover that she had put herself, yet
again, on the odd side of things.
“His name was Green,” she said
solemnly, as if the specific detail might
make a difference. “John Winston
Green.” She meant the subject of the x-
rays, which showed, in various degrees
of ghostliness, in left and right profile
but also frontally, the thorax and jaw
of a young man.
Her mother’s sister, Aunt Jude, who
had been at the window, came up now,
and leaning down she kissed the child
on the top of the head, at the parting
where her hair was drawn in pigtails.
Gillian looked up at her. Jude
Hermiston smiled. She took the dusty
package from her sister and examined
it. “Let’s look,” she said, “shall we?”
She slipped the first x-ray out of the
package, then one by one the rest.
She had seen them before. Years
back, on visits to Aunt Connie’s, she
too had been allowed to take from their
envelope the stiff, transparent sheets,
and holding them to the light had seen
him this bit of him: John Winston
Green, Aunt Connie’s young man. Odd
emotions stirred in her. They seemed"
her own; but were too deeply overlaid
with what she had heard and caught
breath of from Aunt Connie for her to
be sure. Except that the emotions were
powerful and real a kind of
astonished awe as before a common
mystery.
The profile, its lovely line: where the
base of the skull, so round you could
feel it in the cup of your hand, swooped
down to the neck, with the vertebrae,
all ghostly grey, stacked delicately one
above the other, almost pearly, and the
Adam’s apple a transparent bump. The
left profile, then, minimally but per-
ceptibly different, the right.
The adam’s apple: how touchingly
present and youthful it was. You felt it
in your own throat like a lump of
apple, or like a difficult word. And the
firm line upwards to the jaw. In the
third and fourth image the head was
turned sharply right John Winston
Green might have been giving the eyes-
right salute to an unseen general; but
the thorax appeared straight on and
all the elements were changed; you saw
the contained energy in the throat
muscles, the strain of the tendons of
the neck. The power and will of a whole
being was there. You felt the
squareness, the solidity of it all the
way down to the footsoles, the stern
discipline, held breath in the ribcage,
the pushing upward of the skull, the
way gravity tugged, created weight
(say eleven stone six) and held it to
earth.
The neck seemed thick in the front
views. The vertebrae in their pile like
children’s bricks were too squarely
packed. But in profile you caught the
delicacy of the thing, and it was this
that touched and moved Jude now as it
had moved her twenty years ago. The
young man’s adam’s apple rose in her
throat. A word it was, that he had
intended to speak but could not,
because he had to hold his breath for
the machine; a thought that had
sparked in the skull, travelled at
lightning speed down that luminous
cord and got stuck in his throat. It was
there, still visible.
John Winston Green, Aunt Connie’s
young man, had worked as a clerk in
the Bank of Queensland. He was an
oarsman as well, wrote poetry, and had
died at Bullecourt in France, in 1917.
The x-rays were Aunt Connie’s last
memento of him. All the rest, letters
with poems in them, snapshots of
occasions she still remembered and
could describe picnics at Peel


Island, tennis parties, regattas and
all the small gifts he had sent her when
he was away on rowing trips in the
south, and from Paris and Egypt, had
been consumed in a fire nearly thirty
years ago. Since they hadn’t at first
been worth keeping, the x-rays had
been stored in a garage and had alone
survived. “They were the only thing he
gave me that lasted,” Aunt Connie
could say in her dry, no-nonsense
manner. “Isn’t it odd? The most faith-
ful representations of all they were
in the end. Why shouldn’t I love them
best of all?” This, Jude guessed, is
what she must have told her grand-
niece Gillian. Is what she had told
Jude.
There are natural lines of descent in
a family. They are not always the direct
ones. It is proper that the objects
people care for should find their way
down through them, from hand to
hand and from heart to heart. “She is
my true mother,” Jude Hermiston had
told herself once, “and this young man,
of whom I have only this brief il-
luminating glimpse, is my true father.
That lump in his throat must be my
name.”
She restored the last of the x-rays to
their package. She smiled, and so did
the child. And Harriet Vaughan, who
was fond of her sister, watched her
daughter take the package and clasp it
once again, so solemnly, to her breast.
“What was the choice, darling?”
“Oh spoons,” the child told her
lightly, “that belonged to grandma.
Moya Cope got them. And a little case
for jewels.”
Harriet looked again at the ancient
envelope the child had hold of and was
resigned: not to the entrance of these
odd relics among them, but to her
daughter, this child who had come to
her, she thought, like a stranger,
having no likeness she could discover
either to Eric or to herself, an utterly
dear and separate being whose very
difficulty she loved.
“You don’t mind, mummy, do you? I
mean I know the spoons were more
valuable .”
“Of course I don’t,” her mother told
her, and leaned down to kiss the child.
“You funny bunny! Of course I don’t.”
WHY CREATIVITY
DECLINES WITH AGE

David Foster has recently been
awarded a two-year senior
fellowship by the Literature
Board.
BLOODY HELL, is that my cow
bellowing? What can be the matter
with her. Bulling already, I missed her
last month too, I must remember to
ring Muldoon before eight, get her
done this morning. I must write that
down. I’ll forget if I don’t.
Come on, give it a rest, Kate! I
haven’t pulled those blackberry canes
out of Philpot’s fence yet. He’s looking
for a chance to have a piece of me, and
this will give him the opportunity.
Should have sprayed them in March,
before they lost their leaves.
I’ll get up and give her some meal,
calm her down a bit. What’s the time?
Six thirty, damn. Not much point
coming back to bed, I may as well get
up. But I don’t want to get up in the
dark, I don’t want to go to work either.
Faculty meeting, which reminds me: I
promised I’d bring Carruthers some
honey, that’s the third or fourth time
he’s asked. I’d better come good. I’ll
get the honey now, while I think of it.
I’ll put it near my briefcase.
Wait: the honey will be candied.
Pat’s been onto me to get some for her,
I’ll light the fuel stove, then I’ll put the
honey tin in the oven to warm up the
honey while I’m checking the cow.
No kindling. What’s the weather
like out there? Cold. Wet. Thought as
much. Wonder if Bret put the kindling
in the tank? Bet a quid he never. No
pine cones because of the drought, and
all the wood is wet and green, which
reminds me: I’m out of chain oil. I must
remember to get some chain oil when I
take the Morris in for a service, and is
it due for a service? I must check the
sticker.
These boots need tidying. It’s
supposed to be Meg’s job, she’s
supposed to tidy the back verandah
before she goes to school.
That’s right, my gumboots have
holes in them. They track mud on my
socks. And the cork floor in the kitchen
needs resanding, I’ll have to do that
when I get round to it.
I’ll go back to the bedroom and get
my shoes, are you awake Pat? No
contractions? Like a cup of tea? I’ll put
the kettle on.
This powerpoint is falling off the
wall, I must remember to get Pat to ask
Jackson to fix it when he brings the
blender back. Suppose I could do it
myself, it needs bigger rawl plugs.
Longer screws. I might measure it
while I’m standing here, where’s that
tape measure? Should be here in the
sewing drawer, wait a minute: didn’t I
see it under the hi fi in the lounge
room? I’ll go and get it now.
Christ, what was that? Bloody
wooden blocks, how many times have
they been told not to leave them all
over the floor! Someone could get a
nasty injury.
Look at that. The tuner’s been left
on all night, Candy for sure. She’s
learnt to press the buttons. I’m going
to have to speak to her. The others say


I spoil her rotten, so here’s a chance to
prove I don’t. I’ll make her cry in front
of the whole family.
I wonder is this lounge room fire
still burning, I could steal a . . .
What was that? A drop of water!
Don’t say the flashing’s cracked again,
when will they invent a sealant that
won’t crack in a frost? I’ll have to go up
and take a look. If this weather set
in . ..
No, I’d better get something to
catch the drips first, what can I use?
The washing is dry. Karen could have
put it away. Why can’t she do a bit
around the house? She’s not asked to
do much.
Hello sweetheart, you’re up early!
Did Daddy wake you? You want some
orange juice, well we’ll . . . we’ll get it
for you now.
Where is the orange juice usually
kept, sweetheart? In the fridge? I see,
well there’s none left. Was it empty last
night? You don’t know. We’ll get some
oranges out of the shed for you, just let
Daddy put his shoes on.
00, dear, look! A nasty big tack in
”I’m afraid we can't publish it, but we could shred it for you.”
Daddy’s slipper, has Bret been playing
with Daddy’s tacks? I’m not saying it’s
your fault, Candy. I didn’t say it was
your fault.
Come on now, don’t cry. I’m going to
get your orange juice. Listen to
naughty old Katy bellowing, I was
going to give her something to eat, you
want to come with me? You’re cold.
Well why don’t you go back to bed if
you’re cold? Just till I get the fuel stove
lit. Then you can come out in the
nice warm kitchen. That’s the
good girl.
No paper. I must have paper to
light the stove, I must tell Pat to
stop burning cardboard, it clogs
the flue. The flue needs sweeping
too, I must remember . . .
Paper in the wastepaper
basket. Why is this paper being
thrown out? My best stationery! I
don’t remember ... Karen’s hand-
writing. Dear Geoff . . .
Dear Geoff! Alter I specifically
told her .. .
Pat. Look at this. That little
bitch has ... cup of tea? The
kettle should be boiling, or did I
forget to switch it on? I’ll check.
The roof is leaking in the
hallway too. Oh God, that
reminds me, mother’s rug in the
... ice cream containers, are
there any left?
Come on Pat, get up and give
us a hand!
You put holes in them? For the
seedlings, I see. Oh God, the
Defender for the lettuce! It’s
raining, there won’t be a lettuce
plant left! Left me get the ladder
first.
Ladder’s not here, did I .. . ?
That’s right; and he never
returned it. What did he want it
for? The scout hall clean-up. Oh
Christ, the scout hall clean-up. I
said I’d take that stuff to the tip
and I forgot. I must make a note on the
calendar.
Is it really July 30? Harrison’s
research grant proposal is due. I don’t
think I’ve seen it. I must ask the
professor of physics if he’s ... I must
get the radio on, check the weather.
The clock has stopped. It’s later
than we think, who’s got a digital
watch? Bret, it’s high time you got up!
What about your karate practice? And
is there any reason why you didn’t put
the kindling away?
Read your mail, Karen, and why
would I do that? But that was a letter
from you to him. I found it in the
wastepaper basket.
Why don’t you put the washing
away? You don’t do much about the
place.
Who said you could take my
stationery?
You want to leave home. I wouldn’t
mind leaving home.
I don’t care if she has.
I don’t care if they do.
You are not leaving home until you
get your higher school certificate! I’m
looking forward to it too, by the way,
your horse is due to be shod, have you
rung the farrier?
Orange juice? Can’t Karen get your
orange juice for you, you little pest!
Your brother Darryl’s already
divorced.
All right Bret, what’s the time? You
bastard, why did you leave that kind-
ling in the rain. Eh? I’m going to use
your blocks for kindling. How many
times have you been told not to leave
them on the lounge room floor?
Ah, Michael. Where’s that digital
watch Grandma gave you for Christ-
mas, son?
You’ve lost it already.
Pat, if you don’t have that baby
today or tomorrow, you realise what it
means? It won’t be able to start school
Soft victories
Sea full of bones
slopped in a bowl whose edge is infinite
whose limitless lapping
smothers the beach bit by bit,
your fibreless gnawing ridicules death.
You do not notice one small breath
launched against the evening light,
cannot feel the tidal hunger
which drags me here to watch each night
sunset flicker in a momentary vein,
Westernport fill with the wax of winter,
opalescent silk and bandages of rain.
Yours is the silence on which I splinter.
You have no face
and yet this creeping around the headlanc
is a kind of embrace,
no hands and yet
this tentative pawing, always successful
is a kind of rape.
I will be victim, willing and bland,
articulate ulcer dressed in silk
needing nothing but to drown in this milk
of silence flowing from sea to sand.

till it’s five. We’ll have it round
the house another twelve months.
AS TO the graphics for the con-
ference, it would be nice, I agree,
to have 256 K of RAM, but I
cannot see us convincing
O’Donnell. If you like to think
back, when we bought those
winchesters for the Hewlett-
Packard, we had no
idea . . .
Excuse me. That’s my phone.
The cow’s out! Jesus, you can’t
chase her back? No, of course not.
Well do you think . . . Karen has
what? Left home! Shacked up at
the caravan park, I see. I think
we’d better ... I suppose we’d
better speak to his father, he’s the
councillor, isn’t he? What do you
mean it’s not your problem? You’re
her stepmother, aren’t you?I know
she doesn’t like you, and you don’t
like her. No one is to blame.
Listen Pat, is the cow near
Philpot’s?She’s on Philpot’splace
now. Well I can’t get away at the
moment, but thanks for ringing.
All well?No contractions? Cheers.
Sorry Col, where were we? Oh
yes.
You know, when I was a
graduate student, all I had was
the use, at three o’clock in the
morning . . .
Bev? You wanted me? A meeting?
What meeting was that? The Estimates
Committee, oh God, did you . . . was I
aware? Look, ah . . . tell them I’ll be
late, would you? By the way Bev,
haven’t I got a faculty meeting this
morning? This afternoon. I wonder
could you ring Professor Kirkpatrick
and tell him I won’t be able to attend
the meeting of the Estimates Com-
mittee, as I’m tied up here. Thank you.
Chrissie! Your weekly appointment,
of course, do come in. Sorry Col. I
think we’ll have to defer it till we know
whether Boag bought that Dulmont
Magnum. Because we did get the new
stopped flow reactor, and that was a
major victory, and at this point, I
really don’t see how . . .
Sit down, Chrissie. You don’t feel
you’re getting a fair go here, why is
that? What’s wrong?
Excuse me, my phone, hello?
Alan Chadwick, how good to hear
your voice, Alan. Look, I was so im-
pressed with that . . . You’re here now.
A bite of lunch, well. . . why not? What
time could you make it, Alan? Perhaps
we could meet in the staff club, do you
know the staff club here? You’re at the
airport. No, of course it wouldn’t be too
much trouble. You could give us a talk.
We’d be delighted. I’ll send someone
out. No, not at all. Cheers, Alan.
Bev, did you get that? Take care of
Dr Chadwick, will you.
Now Chrissie, I tried to make it
clear when you joined us, that your
background was a little deficient in . . .
Excuse me.
Karen!l don’t want to talk with you
now, except to say I think you’ve made
a grave error, and I. . . yes, and I love
you too, but. . . hello?
That was my daughter. She left
home recently. Chrissie, look at the
time, I have to prepare for a faculty
meeting, but wait: you’ve got the data,
of course, can we have a quick look at
it?
This is very interesting! Have you
tried . . . ? What if we were to take some
more of this white stuff in the brown
bottle and put it on the long thing here
with the whiskers. Do you think that
might do something? Tell you what,
you go back and try it. See what
happens.
The new professor of aboriginal
studies! A pleasure. What’s that?
You’ve done time in prison and you’re
not ashamed of it; why should you be? 1
hadn’t realised the professional board
met today, to tell you the truth, but I
guess . . . end of the financial . ..
No, I’ll sit next to you, if I may.
What’s the first item for considera-
tion? That no member of the pro-
fessional board shall attempt, in any
way, shape or form, to facilitate the
seating arrangements for any other
member of . . .
Are we going through that again?
An urgent phone call, can I take it
here? Thank you.
Hello? Pat? Karen?
Mother. What a pleasant surpise, is
something wrong?
I arranged to have dinner with you
tonight? It’s the 25th anniversary of
Brian’s death. Of course I remember my
brother Brian, wasn’t he the one with
the freckles?
By the way, have you settled on the
unit? I said, have you settled on the
unit?
You haven’t exchanged contracts!
What the hell’s going on? What’s your
solicitor’s number, I’ll give him a ring.
Barramundi for father, of course. I’ll do
my best.
Item: that the university be declared
A sight for sore eyes
They wrap mountains round my eyes,
the say ‘look’ and it’s all what they say
where the colour, that’s another word is
deepest blue, and that’s the colour of
the wind, blowing this way, warm and dry
coming from the mountains, visibly.
I have eyes in the back of my neck
too, the sun is mumbling the day’s news
over my head. In so many words.
My morning bath was warm, out of a tap.
This garden is just one year younger
than I, ‘girdled round’ five years ago
with six-foot galvanised iron on
rimu posts, the sawn timber elsewhere
supports the Number 8 fencing wire
with one barbed strand, a little rusted.
The new vicarage is a “bungalow’,
the verandah faces north by west,
casements are fashionable magic
again, since the double-hung sash went
out, opening on the forms of pains, of
mumbled words, mountainously pronounced.
Too small to see over, I can thread
my ‘line of vision’ through a nail-hole
in the iron. I give it a tug.
The mountains have shifted at their moorings,
shudder and heave clear. The biggest wind’s
in that quarter, it loosens the snows,
the Green Road is under water, old
Mr and Mrs Troon in a boat
are “taken out’ repeated in a dream
of the Troons, the Troons! What have I done?
What are the Troons doing ‘taken out’
in a boat in the dark up Green Road,
old and ugly and wet? The wind was
never so dry and warm or the smell
of sheep so sour or the dust so thick
in the macrocarpas. The mountains
are -the colour of wind, the highway
north is a pillar of dust by day
half-blinding riders and dogs, westward
the river still rises. My mother
bathes my eyes with ‘boracic’, she ties
up torn dianthus, delphinium, phlox
wasted on the alluvium the storm-
waters have been scraping seaward since
the sun mumbled the first implanted
word. My mother grows it all from seed.
ALLEN CURNOW


a nuclear-free zone.
You can’t expect me to agree to
that, I’m the professor of nuclear
medicine! How can I work without
isotopes! What am I going to use for
labels?
No, you listen to me for once. I’m
always listening to you.
Now you’re being very offensive.
I will not be spoken to that way
Chairperson!
Well, what am I to call you. I can’t
call you “Mr” Chairperson. I can’t call
you “Mrs” Chairperson.
ALAN, me old mate, I can’t tell you
how much I’m looking forward to this
talk. What’s it called?
The correction of binocular dispar-
ity in random dot stereograms.
It sounds very interesting. I must
say it’s something I don’t know much
about. I hope you’re not expecting any
sensible questions from my part of the
room.
What am I up to? Well, apart from
being dean of the faculty this year, I’m
chairing a government inquiry into the
impact of computer technology on the
live sheep export industry.
To tell you the truth, it doesn’t seem
to have any.
FATHER! You’re looking well. You’re
not feeling well. Your back is in pain.
Could I write you a script. Well I
suppose I could, except...
Except I’d prefer you see your own
GP. No, it’s just I don’t carry a
prescription pad about with me. And
we doctors, we’re funny that way. We
don’t like to prescribe for our own
families. I mean, my wife, your daugh-
ter-in-law, is expecting a child right
now, but I won’t be delivering the baby.
Pat: my wife. The one with the dark
hair, the young one. The new one, if
you like. No, I haven’t seen Stella in
some months now, but I’ll be in touch
because Karen ... never mind, is
Mother about? Could I come in, do you
think? Out of the cold?
Here’s your barramundi. Not at all.
Nothing’s too much trouble for me old
Da, what put me though medical
school at great expense. Sorry about
your bad back, Da. Sorry I can’t write
you a script.
Your prostate? Hell, I’d rather not
discuss it.
Hello Mother! What’s that you say?
Brian won’t be here tonight, no I don’t
suppose he will be. It’s a terrible thing,
death. But he’ll be here in spirit, I’m
sure.
Funny you should be thinking of
Brian. I mean, it must be thirty years.
It’s twenty five years to the day, is it.
Dad, be there in a minute. I’d like a
few words with Mother first. Could I
fell that tree in the backyard for you?
Tell you what, I might leave it till
Meg’s birthday party. I’d rather do it
in the daylight, you see. Safer.
I must say I don’t remember us ever
celebrating Brian’s death, Mother. If
celebrating’s the right word.
You fixed his room up. Just as it was
the day he died.
Yes, I suppose I may as well take a
look at it while I’m here. By the way, I
can’t stay for dinner.
Ar, come on, for Christ’s sake! Pat’s
expecting a baby! x4.nd the cow’s out,
and . . . Don’t say that about Pat, Mum.
It’s just not true. I mean, I’m very fond
of you and I’m very fond of Pat, so
don’t say things like that about Pat.
Karen? Karen is fine. She’s doing
exceptionally well, in fact.
She rang you this morning. She
asked for money.
Now what is going on here, Mum?
Frankly, I think this is a bit sick. Well,
I mean, he’s been dead for twenty five
years.
Certainly, I realise he was your
favorite. We were all aware of that.
Athol killed him. What do you
mean? What are you saying?
I’d like a word with you, please Dad.
Now what has Mother been eating? Is
she still living on tea and dry toast?
You’ll have to get her to eat properly,
it’s just no good at her age. Nutrition is
most important in the elderly. If you
don’t get the right vitamins, you get
problems with your back, and with
your brain, and with your prostate
gland.
I am very concerned about her. Does
she seem to you to be behaving
strangely?
She’s all right, you reckon. You
can’t force her to eat. In that case, I
think the district nurse should come
in, one day a week. Will you organise
that, or must I do it?
You can’t do it, you’re too busy.
You know what you’ve become? A
selfish old man. My word I turned the
telly off, you realise one day the telly is
going off forever? And there’s no telly
in the world-to-come, as far as I know.
That woman your wife and my
mother is showing all the signs of
early senile dementia!
All right: now what exactly do you
mean when you say Athol did kill
Brian? He broke Brian’s heart, is that
what you’re trying to say? Because if
that’s what you’re trying to say .. .
He held Brian under the water till
Brian drowned.


What a false, vicious, dreadful ac-
cusation to make against a prominent
juror. And I was there too, do you
think I had a hand in it? Maybe the
less favored brothers ganged together
and murdered the bright one.
You know something? You don’t
belong in a home unit, you belong in a
padded cell. You’re a lazy, bone-idle
pair of useles social parasites. You’re
typical of your entire generation. Why
don’t you get out and do a bit for those
less well-off than yourself? Look at this
oil heater, blazing away night and day.
Why do you need a V 8 car? You never
go farther than the club, you’d be
better off riding a pushbike.
I’m sorry ... I’m sorry ... I’m under
a lot of stress. I’ll go and knock the
tree down, would you care to hold the
torch?
Fry the barramundi Mum, I’ll stay
to dinner. We’ll have a yarn about old
times. I’ll tell you what fun I had when
I was a kid.
CHRISSIE? Hope you don’t mind me
ringing you so late. ’Zvery late. Sorry
f’the way I spoke to you today. You’re
going to be a good scientist Chrissie,
can we talk about those results ?■
PROVERBS
by Dorothy Featherstone Porter
Dorothy Porter has recently published a new
volume of verse, The Night Parrot.
FLICK’S religious/racial position
among the volunteers at the kibbutz
was a curious one. Her mother was
Anglican, her father was Jewish, while
Flick herself was a cynical atheist who
didn’t give a shit for either Christian-
ity or Judaism but, nevertheless,
claimed religious holidays from both.
Unfortunately, the kibbutznik bitch
who was in charge of the work rosters
for the foreign volunteers had decided
to clamp down on Flick’s ingenious
brand of malingering.
She ordered Flick to come to the
volunteers’ office one lunch-time and
informed Flick that she had conned
her very last chofesh (pronounced
“hofish” delicious Hebrew word
that meant holiday from the kibbutz
grind). Channa told Flick, with some
relish, that in future she would work
both Jewish and Christian holidays to
make up for the time she’d cheated
from the kibbutz. Channa, like many
Israelis, had very mixed feelings about
half-Jews. Flick’s laziness reinforced
her prejudice about their basic goy
untrustworthiness.
Now Channa had the hide to lecture
and worse joke on the laziness of the
volunteers. Flick groaned, turned
away, collected her sole letter.
Groaned again, recognising her
father’s handwriting, and left.
That dispiriting incident in
Channa’s office had been two days ago.
Now she was flat broke, back at the
kibbutz, back in the kitchen washing
mountains of dishes and no chofesh in
sight for at least three weeks. And
incarceration in there meant for Flick,
and everybody else, but particularly
Flick at that moment because the old
fart played favorites, Benny’s corn-
pany.
Benny, even by Israeli standards,
was insufferably garrulous. And he
was neither sweet nor agreeable to go
with it. He was old, vain, malicious,
thin-skinned and probably mad. His
passions were 1948 war stories top-
billing his own heroic exploits in the
Hagannah, archaeology, skin-diving
and pestering green female volunteers.
Flick was getting to the “ripe” female
volunteer stage, which meant getting
increasingly fed up with Benny’s inces-
sant attentions, and which would in-
evitably result in a violent rupture with
mutual verbal abuse. All Benny’s
friendships with green female vol-
unteers ended this way.
Flick was still green enough to feel
an uncharacteristic pang of pity for
Benny sitting in a damp, draughty
corner of the colossal kitchen as far
away from the cooking and scrubbing
kibbutznik women, who could barely
tolerate him, as architecture would
allow. A leg injury inflicted while
working in the banana plantation had
reduced Benny to the indignity of
peeling onions, potatoes and carrots
for eight hours a day, six days a week,
sitting on a broken stool, crouched
over a tub of grubby, cold water with
peeling knife in his gnarled fingers,
while his squinty blue eyes raked the
room searching for someone to talk to.
“Flick!” he called across the vast
cement and stainless steel kitchen on
Flick’s very first miserable, grey
day back from chofesh at quarter past
six in the morning.
“Hullo, Benny”, she replied without
enthusiasm.
“Ask Miriam if you can come and
help me do onions. I have something
important to tell you,” he lowered his
voice melodramatically on “import-
ant”, hissing the word slightly.
Flick nodded wearily. Benny was
full of secrets. She decided to avoid
asking Miriam anything.
“I mean this, Flick,” Benny called
insistently, “I have something to show
you that you will like. Something very
rare.”
Flick walked across the wet, cold
floor to Benny’s lair of water, grime
and onion.
“What is it?”
“Come closer,” said Benny in his
nearly perfect but guttural, theatrical
English.
“Put out your hand”, he ordered,
whispering harshly, “but don’t let
anyone see you.”
Oh Christ, more Benny games,
thought Flick sticking out her hand.

With ludicrous Harpo Marx-like
stealth, Benny took from his pocket an
object which he put in Flick’s hand,
then elaborately, with bullying force,
he closed her fingers around it. Flick
resented Benny’s dirty, thick fingers
pressing on hers, but co-operated with
the nonsense by furtively bringing her
clenched hand close up to her face. She
looked down at Benny solemnly for
clearance, which he gave with a nod,
before she opened her hand. She saw
square in the centre of her palm a tiny
and only slightly damaged dark-pink
glass bottle.
“Such a thing you will have never
seen before,” muttered Benny.
“No,” admitted Flick, with little
curiosity.
She wasn’t interested in Benny’s
bits and pieces of buried treasure
“You’ll get it back in due course, sir.”
unless it were the gold Roman coins he
occasionally found and no amount of
crawling would make him part with
one of those.
“You wouldn’t find one of these
under a gum tree in Australia,” Benny
chuckled.
“Probably not,” said Flick, then
added in a barely disguised bored tone
to end the game, “what is it?”
“That is a good question,” mused
Benny squinting up at the bottle in
Flick’s hand, which was reflecting a
very delicate pink light, “but I know
the answer, lucky for you.”
“What is it?” Flick repeated,
knowing she’d be called on shortly by
Miriam to help with the interminable
washing-up.
“A perfume bottle Roman,”
Benny shrugged, “probably fourth cen-
tury not quite Byzantine.”
“Very nice,” Flick said casually,
then asked, “is it worth much?”
“I have found things worth much,
much more,” Benny answered cryptic-
ally, “would you like to come with me
this afternoon to where I found this? I
will take a tractor.
“This afternoon, Flick, perhaps we
find you something really interesting.”
Flick usually finished work in
mitbach, the kitchen, at 2.30 in the
afternoon. Unfortunately that after-
noon she was working with someone
new on the washing up. The new
mitbach arrival was from Ohio, USA,
and her name was Mitzi. She couldn’t
be serious! Flick thought, but Ameri-
cans always were. Mitzi wore a pretty
little red jump-suit, simpered and
pranced around the dishes like Gidget
Goes to Summer Camp. Mitzi was
determined not to get wet and disap-
peared whenever the scummy washing-
up water developed a dangerous swell,
seriously aggravated by male kib-
butzniks hurling unscraped plates
from five paces into the sink. Flick was
soaking wet and in a vile mood. It was
simply impossible to get Mitzi in the
line of fire. Finally Mitzi nicked off
early. Flick was left scrubbing the pots
Mitzi was supposed to have done. And
worse, a certain Moroccan illiterate
called Esther was standing over her to
make sure she finished them. Esther
was normally fairly agreeable and
Flick was usually able to communicate
with her in schoolgirl French. But this
afternoon Esther was in a brooding
rage, blaming Flick for Mitzi’s
advanced case of uselessness.
Esther let Flick go at 3.30. Flick
nodded curtly and came out in the
afternoon sunshine to find Benny
storming up and down about to do his
block. Feeling exhausted she relaxed
against the plain, outside wall of the
dining room and smiled apologetically
at Benny.
“Sorry I’m late.”
“Get in the tractor! Get in the
tractor!” Benny snapped while limping
over to the tractor, then hauled his
considerable bulk into the driver’s
seat.
Flick silently obeyed; getting into
the tractor meant climbing into the
trailer pulled by the tractor.
“Comfortable?” shouted Benny in-
congruously as the tractor labored its
way along the smooth, white-sanded
kibbutz road leading down to pardes,
(Hebrew for the orange/lemon groves).
“Fine,” shouted back Flick, feeling
the cold through her thread-bare
kibbutz rationed jumper in the winter
afternoon. Then Benny started to sing.
Something ancient, cretinous and
English with a lot of tee, dee, hees.
Probably Benny didn’t know the
words.
“Recognise this song, Flick?”
“No.”
“I learnt it from an Australian
soldier!”
Waltzing Matilda!
She’d been right. Benny didn’t
know the words. Just the skeleton of
the tune. He sang it all afternoon.
It took Benny half an hour to
relocate the spot where he claimed to
have found the perfume bottle. He
stopped the tractor and turned around
in his seat with an excited expression
that on the face of any man less
childlike than Benny would have been
very frightening. He chuckled through
the gaps in his teeth.
“I hope you have not told anyone
you were coming here with me.”
Flick shook her head. She knew
from past experience that Benny was
in his secret treasure hunt mood.
Benny climbed out of the tractor
and limped over to a field lying fallow
for winter. Breathing heavily through
his mouth he knelt down and sifted
dirt through his fingers.
“The rain from last night should
have brought some things to the sur-
face,” he observed.
“What are you hoping for?” asked
Flick.


“Who knows?” shrugged Benny,
grinning.
“Benny, let’s look for things. It’ll be
dark soon and I’m getting cold.”
The wind nipped across the field
and flicked some grit in her eyes. She
rubbed them with clenched, angry fists.
When her vision became comfortable
she noticed Benny watching her with
his round-eyed, curious monkey face.
“I’m buggered,” she said coldly,
“I’m going back.”
“Not just yet,” Benny said softly,
bending down very carefully, dislodg-
ing the dirt in front of Flick’s feet with
his digging trowel. Suddenly he went
down on hands and knees, scratching
in the dirt, breathing very heavily.
Despite herself, Flick was intrigued.
She saw him cleaning up some small
object with saliva on the tips of his
fingers.
“What have you found?” Flick
asked.
“I’ll tell you in a minute,” Benny
replied.
He was busy fiddling with the object
for a few more minutes, then suddenly
he ordered Flick to close her eyes.
Mystified she obeyed. She heard
Benny’s bones crack as he stood up.
She smelt his dirty clothes as he came
up very close to her. She could feel on
her face his heavy, bronchial breath.
She could imagine the triumphant,
thrilled look on his face. She knew
he’d keep her waiting. She felt his
hand land on her shoulder and stay
there, quite still, uncaressing. She
could hear the wind racing across the
fallow fields, catching in the dark,
green leaves, tangling in the thorny
branches of the nearby lemon groves.
She could hear the sea the light
blue Mediterranean with its white
sand and flat surf. She didn’t par-
ticularly want to open her eyes. She
felt she was drifting to sleep. She felt
intensely aware of Benny near her,
touching her, but she was un-
concerned.
“Open your eyes!” Benny ordered.
She opened her eyes quickly, sus-
piciously. Benny took her hand gently
and closed her fingers tenderly around
the object.
“Be careful not to break it,” he said
urgently, as if it were not only fragile
but alive.
Flick loosened her fingers and
looked at the object. It was the pink
perfume bottle.
“Isn’t this the one you showed me
this morning?” asked Flick, screwing
up her face, confused.
“Maybe it jumped out of my
pocket!” exclaimed a delighted Benny.
“Is it for me?”
“Who else? Look at it carefully .”
Flick turned it around slowly and
noticed something had been engraved
on it, Hebrew letters.
“Hebrew? That’s strange, Benny, I
thought it was Roman or something.”
“Use your brains, Flick!”
He was laughing.
“You wrote it?”
“Of course!”
“What’s the Hebrew say?”
“My little secret.”
Flick smiled.
“I’ll ask someone.”
Benny frowned.
Later that afternoon Flick
wandered around the precincts of the
kibbutz; the perfume bottle nestled in
tissue paper deep in her cast-off Israeli
army pants pocket. Flick was
superstitious. She was hoping the per-
fume bottle might bring her luck. God,
her life could do with some. If a genie
suddenly materialised she had quite a
list of wrongs to be righted.
“Hiya! Flick!”
Flick turned around to see Katie, a
fellow Australian and her room-mate,
running towards her from the road
leading down to the children’s houses.
“Been looking for you!” panted
Katie as she reached Flick.
“What is it?” Flick asked, thinking
it was either another of her father’s
emotional telegrams urging her to ring
him or something nasty Channa had
planned for her.
“Look, you’ve got to do something
about Benny!”
“What’s he been doing?”
A cloud of weary exasperation
passed over Katie’s usually blank
freckled face.
“Just coming around every five
minutes to see if you’re back.”
“Shit, I only saw him about two
hours ago! What does he want? Did he
say?”
“Do you think I’m stupid enough to
ask Benny something and have him
standing there raving for the next
three hours!”
“Well, what did you say to him?”
“I said you’d gone for a walk and
The first born
There they sit, day after day on the beach
Casting tearful glances across the sea towards the mountains of
their homeland.
No means exists for the arrest of the terrible homesickness which
was carrying off so many of the natives.
So wrote James Bonwick of the last of the Tasmanians,
Marooned on Gun Carriage Island in Bass Strait
By the harsh decree of a savage government
Glad to be rid of people and of guilt.
They died in the sulks like so many bears
Said the Old Hand, sucking at his pipe
Remembering the koala he had tethered at his camp
Which refused all food and died.
Staring into the fire he puzzled over the ways of this alien land
With strange animals and even stranger humans
Or were they human?
People who cared nothing for bright gold or stone houses
Or the rich crops where whitey toiled from daylight to dark
Until by day’s end, so hard to tell where soil ended and man began.
For the dark folk, the first born, the earth gave riches enough
Gathered easily from the ground or plucked from the sea.
What newcomer could understand a people
Who owned everything, who owned nothing.
In whom a hundred thousand years of living were part of flesh and
bone
Living in the landscape while the landscape lived in them
To take them from their dreaming was to tear them apart
Making wounds unseen to strangers’ eyes
And so they died.

that I didn’t have a clue when you’d be
back.”
“Good.”
“Oh, by the way, the last time he
dropped around he left a note for you. I
put it on your bed. Piss him off, Flick,
stop him coming around. That old
bugger really gives me the creeps.”
“OK, OK, I’ll try. It’s not my fault,
you know, he’s kind of adopted me or
something.”
“He’s just a dirty old man. He’s
always bothering some girl or other.”
“Yeah, I know.”
Katie’s face went blank.
“I’m going to Renee’s now for a cup
of coffee. See you in the dining room
tonight. Bye!”
The dining room was bright with
harsh light and orange, plastic plates.
Even though the tables were in a
democratic jumble the volunteers and
kibbutzniks tended to eat separately.
Flick looked around the room, search-
ing out tolerable companions. She saw
Katie sitting with a motley group of
Poms, Yanks and Canadians. All
boring deadshits, though friendly
deadshits. She knew they’d be swap-
ping travel stories.
Flick collected a tray, cutlery, a
plate then indifferently picked out her
dinner from the very limited
smorgasbord. Tomatoes, gerkins, plain
yoghurt, bread, oranges, cucumbers.
Boring. But then again, as Channa was
so happy to remind the volunteers, the
kibbutz was not a three star hotel!
“Would it be too much to ask for the
pleasure of your company at my and
Yona’s table?”
Flick hadn’t noticed Benny creeping
up on her. He gave a creaking and
ludicrous bow. Flick groaned, swearing
silently. Yona was Benny’s wife. A
grand-prix raver. She could talk
anyone into the deep trance of a
genuine medium. She was almost as
notorious as Benny. They usually sat
alone, avoided by both volunteers and
kibbutzniks.
“All right, all right, I’ll come!”
snapped Flick.
She followed Benny sullenly and
could hear the other volunteers laugh-
ing at her predicament. What a day!
Yona’s round, harmless, mad face
beamed when she saw Flick. With her
thick-lensed glasses, boyish grey hair
and smooth skin she looked like an
ageless gnome.
“My goodness, Flick!” she ex-
claimed with delight.
“Hullo, Yona,” Flick replied with
bad grace.
Yona was an English Jew who had
the style of Joyce Grenfell on uppers.
“Well, have you got yourself some
dinner? Oh, of course, yes, I can see
you have! Oh, please sit down, that’s
right. Now, Benny, go and get Flick a
cup of tea. Hardly Twinings but never
mind. It’s impossible to get Benny to
listen but I know you’ll appreciate this
story! The most extraordinary thing
happened in the laundry this morning.
Sort of lovely and horrifying at the
same moment. You see, Ruthie Koppel
was supposed to collect sheets and
pillow cases from one of the children’s
houses when she came rushing back to
tell us I still can’t believe it
something similar once happened to an
aunt of mine in a grocer’s shop in
Surrey ...”
On returning to her room much,
much later she read Benny’s note.
To Dear Flick,
I will tell you what I wrote on the
perfume bottle just for you. May
your dreams all come true.
That is exactly what I
wrote. A blessing from me
for the rest of your life.
your friend, Benny
Flick was both moved and
amused. It reminded her of
the notes Rhonda Wilson
used to send her a million
years ago back in primary
school. Rhonda Wilson had a
tragic and determined crush
on Flick which Flick gradu-
ally killed with scorn and
faithlessness.
“Have you told Benny not
to come around here again?”
Katie asked, narrowing her
eyes warily.
Flick threw up her hands.
“You can’t say that to
someone! Christ, Benny’s got
feelings, you know!”
“It won’t be the first time
Benny’s been told to piss off,”
Katie asserted flatly.
“Oh yeah? I can well
believe that!”
“Well, why can’t you say
something to him then? I
don’t want him perving
around here. He’s just a
bloody nuisance. It’s my
room too!”
Flick lost her temper.
“You and your mates,
Katie, you’ve got lots of guts
when it comes to telling
someone like Benny to piss
off. Piss off, Benny! Go away, Benny!
But it’s a different story when it comes
to dealing with someone who’s got you
by the tits, someone like dear old
Channa. Let’s see you tell Channa to
piss off, Katie. Be tough where it’s
going to count.”
Katie looked unmoved.
“Let’s not fight about Benny,” she
said, “who cares? C’mon. Just keep
him out of my hair.”
Flick nodded.
“Sorry I yelled,” she mumbled and
left the room.
It was raining outside. Pelting
down. Flick went straight back inside,
then went to sleep. Benny, her father,
the world. They’d all keep. Mitbach in
the morning. Steam; rubbing the sleep
out of her eyes; forcing down gritty
Turkish coffee to stay awake; Benny
calling for her to come and talk to him.
Dream? Dreams come true? Perfume
bottles coming down in a pink shower
like rare, glittering Smarties. ■
First contact
In the 19305, the Leahy brothers, on a gold
prospecting expedition into the Highlands of
New Guinea, took footage of their first contact
with a tribe of Melanesians who had thought they
were the only people on Earth.
This is the only place I know,
I don’t know where the rivers go,
Only the dead live over the hill;
Their skin is white as mandible.
They have no arrows,
They have no bows,
They are weak and carry sticks;
Swaddling to hide their dicks.
It was as if the sun resigned
As scales fell from our eyes,
Tell the women to go and hide,
My brother, make a sign.
The conquistadors set up a camp,
Shot a pig to show their strength;
Released the ghosts from a gramophone,
And filmed the edge of steel on stone.
With jungle knife they cleared a space
To lure the birds of paradise,
And metal, matches, food in tins;
Assured that they were in like Flynn.
The women met their human needs
And traded sex for shells and beads,
And left their menfolk sniffing bogs,
As they dethroned the leucous gods.

IT AIN’T ME, BABE
by Emily Hagg
Emily Hagg was born and educated in Sydney,
where she is now with the public service. This
story was the first of hers to be accepted for
publication, although other pieces have since
been published elsewhere.
JANE STRIDES through the park,
admiring her new pink pointed boots
and striped tights under her new black
mini op-shop find of the week from
St Vincent de Paul. Her spiky hair
gleams, earrings rattle. Across her
path, pigeons fly up like shuttlecocks,
children push each other off the
swings and the sun shines in the beer
bottle of a sleeping drunk.
“Poisoningpigeons in the park, ’’she
sings to herself, blithe and slightly off-
key.
“You’re weird,” says the five-year-
old behind her, loudly. His friends
snicker.
“What would you know, dwarf,”
says Jane, turning swiftly: “You can’t
even tie your own sneakers.” She
swings back and taptoes on down the
path toward the shops.
“Fuckin’ moll,” says the five-year-
old, climbing back onto the swing.
Fred sits in the bar of his local with
his paper, his beer and the tobacco
pouch he’s had since the war in front
of him. He rolls a cigarette with one
hand while he studies the form guide.
“Summer’s on the way, I reckon,
Fred,” says the barman, wiping down
the sinks under the bar. “Look at all
those lovely young sheilas in their
little tops out there.” He rinses the
dishcloth and waves it toward the
window. “Sight for sore eyes, eh, mate?
And even better down at Bondi.”
Fred grunts, without looking up
from his paper.
“You’re not getting past it, are you,
Fred?” The barman and Fred’s
neighbor at the bar, another regular,
both laugh loudly. Fred wonders: Will
Dapto Darling win the 2.30? He
glances reflectively toward the front
window.
Beyond the cool cavern of the pub,
the street is a medley of color and
movement. The road is jammed with
traffic and the pavements seethe with
Saturday morning shoppers: old ladies
pushing babies in lethal strollers,
parents juggling children and shopp-
ing bags, early drinkers on their way
into the pub and early drunks on their
way out. At the corner near the lights,
an earnest girl in faded jeans holds a
pile of smudgy newspapers under one
arm while she argues fervently with a
cynical ex-hippie about class struggle.
Further down the road, the men at the
end of the queue for the Hot Bread
Shop pause from their conversation in
Greek to admire a young woman
wearing a frangipani in her long hair,
crossing the street in front of them.
Two punks, retreating from the
sunlight, push past in search of a
coffee shop and a small scruffy
mongrel behind pauses to sniff at a
paper bag in the gutter. From further
up the street, the sound of a hot jazz
combo percolates through the noise of
traffic and shoppers.
The kaleidoscope shifts across
Lynn’s sunglasses as she walks,
wondering if she’ll meet her ex-hus-
band. It’s two years since he left her
but she knows that his new girlfriend
is living in the area. Lynn wonders
what she’ll say if she meets him.
What’s one sentence to sum up 12
years’ betrayal? She thinks about it
while she waits at the barrow where
the gleaming heaps of new summer
fruits spill over the rough boards.
“Here you are then, darling,” says
the barrow man as he hands her the
last bag. “Cheer up. You’re not dead
yet.”
Lynn ignores him as she takes the
bag and turns away.
“Creep,” she mutters to herself.
“Pig. They’re all the same.”
She passes Fred, on his way back
from the TAB, stepping back with
relief into the quiet gloom of the pub.
The barman puts a fresh beer in front
of him.
“What so you reckon for the 2.30,
then, Fred?” the barman asks, stack-
ing empties efficiently and sliding their
wire tray into the dishwasher.
Before Fred can answer, he is faced
with a huge bunch of celery.
“Whoops, sorry,” says Jane, in front
of him, moving her bag to the other
shoulder.
“Can I have two middies of old,
please?” she asks. Fred looks at her
legs as she leans against the bar with
her back to him, talking to Lynn.
Miniskirts. He thinks: asking for it.
Just look at that get-up. Dyed hair,
plastic earrings. Another bloody
hippie. In his day, decent women didn’t
go into public bars.
“I really love these old pubs in
Newtown,” Jane is saying to Lynn,
“and the amazing old characters you
find in them.”
Fred turns away in disgust and goes
back to his paper.
“It’s great to see you again, Lynn; it
must be years. Are you still studying?”
“Yeah, I’m doing a Ph.D. And a bit
of teaching. How about you?”
Lynn has taken off her sunglasses.
She eyes Jane’s long plastic earrings
and low-cut top in amazement, trying
to reconcile this image with her
memories of Jane: a tall, aggressive
woman with long brown hair, striding
round the quadrangle in an army shirt,
denouncing Germaine Greer as a bour-
geois individualist.
“I’m working as a clerk in the
public service.”
“You’re kidding,” says Lynn (think-
ing, “What a sell-out”).
“No, I’m working at night with a
small theatre group but we haven’t got
any money so I’ve got a straight job as
well. How are things in the Depart-
ment?” asks Jane. (She thinks, "It’s a
time-warp: she looks exactly the same.
I remember us kicking down that door


together in the last occupation; I swear
she was wearing the same overalls.”)
“Here you are then, love,” says the
barman, putting down the beers. Lynn
glares. Jane takes the beers and pays.
They lean against the bar, settling
in. Lynn lights a cigarette. Fred scowls
behind their backs: No peace in your
own local; it’s too much. He shifts his
beer and papers ostentatiously further
down the bar and drags his seat away
from Jane’s bag which falls over
sideways, spilling fruit and papers. But
neither of the women notices.
“So, how are things at uni these
days?” Jane asks, watching and
remembering the familiar nervous
gestures with which Lynn lights her
cigarette.
“Things are a lot quieter. More
conservative. People are into
scholarship, rather than activism,
these days.”
“Yeah, I’ve been back on campus a
couple of times and it seems different.
Women in high heels and men with ties
and briefcases. Like a re-run of The
FBI.”
“It’s so depressing. The only thing
flourishing is religion.”
“Uh-huh. Are you still teaching
Feminism?”
“Oh, yes that’s what my thesis is
on: Women and Domestic Labor.”
“Really?” says Jane (thinking,
“Still?”).
“I’m teaching an introductory
course in Feminism, with another
woman called Helen. I don’t think she
was there when you were.” Lynn looks
at her cigarette. “Sorry; do you want
one?”
“No, thanks. What about Alice?
And Sue and Valda?”
“None of us talk to each other any
more. Alice is a lecturer now. She
keeps to herself. Sue and Valda have
their own group and they won’t talk to
either of us. They say we’ve sold out to
the men. There’s a lot of residual
bitterness from political disagree-
ments over the last three years.”
“It sounds just the same. Feelings
still running high.”
“Yes but more underground.
Memos, rather than meetings. Do you
still see anyone from the Depart-
ment?”
Jane smiles. “I met Valda in the
street one day. I was really pleased to
see her and said g’day and she
denounced me on the spot. Said she
didn’t want anything to do with anyone
who was involved with Tim. I hadn’t
seen him for a year; I didn’t know what
she was talking about. Is he still
there?”
“He’s still there alright, stalking
round with Kropotkin in one pocket
and contraceptives in the other. All the
men in the Department are the same,
into power games and sexual politics,
but he’s definitely the worst. He’s such
a manipulative bastard.”
“I haven’t seen him for a couple of
years,” says Jane. “If you hate it so
much, why do you stay?”
“Where else is there to go? Academ-
ic jobs are like hens’ teeth these days.”
“I guess so,” says Jane, recognising
in herself both sympathy with Lynn’s
bitterness and relief that she no longer
shares it.
“Anyway,” Lynn continues, “I still
think it’s important to try and instil
some radical politics into the students.
Even if it’s difficult at the moment. I’ll
say that for Tim: he still goes to
demonstrations and tells his students.”
“Are you doing anything politically?”
“I’m not in any party or group and I
don’t go to meetings or even
demonstrations these days. But I feel
that my political consciousness is part
of me and part of what we do in the
theatre not just what the group
performs but the way we work
together. I guess most of us are radical
has-beens, except the ones that are too
young. There’s a lot of positive energy;
it's really good, a good vibe.”
“Uh-huh,” (“Jesus, ‘positive
energy’, ‘good vibe’ . . . Next she’ll tell
me they’re all fire signs.”) “Another
drink?”
“Yeah, sure.”
Lynn stands and leans against the
bar, looking away from Jane toward
the barman and wondering if this is
the same woman who held her hand all
one night in a police cell in Brisbane.
The barman puts down two more
beers and' Lynn pays.
“Thanks,” says Jane. “Are you still
married?”
“No. Chris left me two years ago.
He’s living with one of his students
now. Somewhere round here. The boys
are with me. Shit, I’ve spilled my beer.”
“Oh, Lynn, what a bummer. I’m
really sorry.”
Fred moves his paper from the
spilled beer and calls for the barman to
turn up the telly.
“Are you involved with anyone
else?” Jane asks, watching the barman
mop up.
“No, there hasn’t been anyone for
over a year. I slept with a couple of
guys after Chris left, to try and prove
to myself that I wasn’t repulsive, but it
didn’t work out.” She drags a match
down the side of its box and exclaims
in frustration as it fails to ignite.
“Damn! You know, I just don’t think
that men are capable of forming a
decent relationship.” The match flares,
she lights her cigarette and draws back
with relief. “I think that all men are
emotional cripples. That’s how society
trains them.”
“But don’t you think that we that
women often act like victims?” asks
Jane. “I know I did when I was on with
Tim. Sure, he’s oppressive but I went
along with it. I think you have to
acknowledge your own participation in
oppressive situations or you get into a
frame of mind that only allows tyrants
or victims. If you want something
better, you have to move outside that
dynamic and decide that you’re going
to have a good relationship and then
you’ve got a good chance of getting
one. It’s like politics in general: You
have to have at least an idea of
something better and a belief that it’s
possible if you’re going to work to
achieve it. I think it is possible to have
a good relationship with a man. Maybe
a lot of women don’t but some do.”
Lynn smiles, recognising Jane’s en-
thusiasm and remembering some of
the raves they’d had each time that
Jane discovered a new Path to Enlight-
enment (Marxism, Anarchism, Femin-
ism . . . now, apparently, Self-help).
“What a ratbag,” Lynn thinks, with
affection.
“So, are you involved with someone
at the moment?” she asks. “Have you
found an unoppressive man to have a
Good Relationship with?”
“No, not at the moment.” They both
laugh.
“It’s all revolutionary theory, as the
great feminist Vladimir Illyitch would
say. Let’s drink to Radical Celibacy in
the meantime.”
Lynn raises her glass: “Here’s to a
better class of person!”
“Do you remember that night we
spent in the cells in Brisbane?” Jane
asks.
Lynn swirls her beer. “How could I
forget? All those pigs in black, right
around the square, before the march
started. Remember the party in the
park afterward, when we all got out?
“I have to go. I’m picking up one of
the boys from sport.”
“Yeah, I’d better go, too. I’ve got to
paint some props. Now we’re living
near each other, you’ll have to visit.”
“Good to see you again,” they say to
each other, meaning it.
. “Fuckin’ molls,” says Fred, watch-
ing them go.


VELODROME
by Angelo Loukakis
Sydney born Angelo Loukakis, winner of the
NSW Premier’s Literary Award for 1981, is now
preparing a second collection of stories. He has
also written for film and television.
PAYS HIS $3 and goes in, late on a
summer afternoon. Not the stand, not
the inside, but around on the guard
rail looking down. That’s the best
place. Walks right round where there’s
nobody else and leans against the
guard rail and looks down.
Hopes it doesn’t rain. Because those
thunderstorms on summer afternoons,
they can really come down in Sydney.
But you can see them coming from in
here, you can keep a lookout from here
real easy.
Doesn’t race anymore himself, but
likes to go and watch the old mates. At
the Velodrome in Camperdown. But
wasn’t there a better place to put it?
Can never work out why they put it on
this hill, catching all the bloody wind.
“Thirty years this year since I
started racing, Teddy.”
“Long time, Ron old son.”
“I’m 45, but I’m a wreck.”
Getting on for dusk. Twilight. The
clouds over Botany Bay are streaked
with purple. Can see the airport from
the Velodrome. The planes coming
down, going away, the lights. The
radar tracking round and round, look-
ing and looking.
“It’s like a saucer really, like the
radar dish over there.”
“What is?”
“This velodrome. The way it’s
turned up around the edge. I mean, you
can see the likeness, can’t you.”
But Teddy has to go. His son is
racing this afternoon. Ted has to go
out in the middle where they’re getting
ready, he has to check the boy’s bike.
Stays leaning against the fence and
waits.
It’s starting to fill on the other side,
where the grandstand is. Everyone’s
got cushions. The bloke with the hot
dogs, he’s starting up. He’s an idiot.
Same bloke every week. What do they
call it ... ?
Sheltered Workshop. He should be
in a Sheltered Workshop.
“Doggies! Doggies! Doggies!”
You can tell, the way he’s smiling.
Warm-up laps, they’re starting to do
warm-up laps. A long night alright
Juveniles, Juniors, Seniors, Veterans,
then Aces by the time it’s over. Aces.
They’ll be worth watching, in a One
Hour Madison.
Three years since he rode one him-
self. That long more or less since the
back went at the foundry. But three
out of 45 is not much. A good run? Only
if you were kidding yourself.
In the centre of the track, on the
grass in the middle, they’re all sitting
around. A lot of fold-up chairs for the
helpers, and they’ve got rugs, to keep
the legs warm. You have to keep warm.
It gets darker and cooler, and that
wind, the north easter, starts to blow
in off the bay.
A couple of blokes out there in the
middle to talk to.
Hans Westerman. Tony Reid. Not
kids either of them. Hans would be 10
years a veteran by now. On the pro-
gramme it says he’s a veteran alright.
And Tony, always that smooth style,
and not a kid either.
The early races are boring, the kids
are slow. They’re nervous at the start,
and they jump the gun every time.
Restart. Restart again. Dads hold them
up on the line. Hand on the saddle,
hand on the bars. Sometimes it’s the
father’s fault. They give them a shove
before the gun.
Turns away and looks out over the
roof-tops, toward the airport again.
There’s the expressway, snaking
around the outskirts of the airport.
You can tell from the lamps, orange
colored. Bright orange. And the purple
in the sky getting deeper.
He put them together and made a
Broadmeadow Club jumper.
Now it’s time for a Senior Handi-
cap.
“The better riders give the weaker
ones a start, ladies and gentlemen,
anything up to a 150 metres in 2000.
Gives the old timers a fair shake,” the
man on the PA says.
Could do with that sort of start
myself. But training again? No way.
It’s easier watching other mugs.
It takes the backmarkers, the men
on scratch, the full six laps to catch the
frontmarkers, the plodders. About
three minutes in all. Not a bad finish.
But then it always is when the better
riders get to the front.
And then a bit of a gap in the
programme, before the good stuff
starts.
“Doggies! Doggies! Get your
doggies!”
No thanks.
Lines up Tony and Hans in the
middle, making a mental note of where
they’re sitting on the grass, among all
the other riders and bikes and gear.
Then goes to the gate that lets you into
that part.
Waits for the bloke with the white
coat and the flag at the gate. This bloke
thinks he’s something special. Waves
the flag to signal all clear. But anyhow,
no riders on the track, no accidents as
you get across.
“Tony old mate. How are ya?”
“I could kill.”
“You could too, by the look of ya.”
“Ready to give these wackers a
hiding except for the sprint I mean
to say and they tell me I’m 42.”
“I’ve always said you were a good
rider ... Good luck in the Madison.”
Turns to Hans who’s on his
haunches next to them, checking the
chain on his bike. The Austrian’s
giving it his full attention.
“And you too Hans.”
Hans nods without looking. He
never was much for talking, even if his
English was pretty good. On his day,


“Mr Marplew, you have
two minutes on the
works of John Buchan
starting ...
...Now, what are the
thirty-nine steps?”
"...Um, the thirty-nine
steps is an...
. . .Aargh . . . !!!”
still a hard man to beat.
He makes his way back to the other
side of the track to watch the final
race. The lights come on, and the circle
of concrete turns white. Three hundred
metres around, two straights, two
bends, a ribbon of light. Same sort of
thing at the Night Trots, a ribbon of
light.
The One Hour Madison is about to
begin.
“I think we’re ready now ladies and
gentlemen . . . This one is for two-man
teams a series of springs for points
and money. One rider goes for broke in
the sprint each five laps, while his
partner takes it easy in the main
bunch. Then they swap over.”
Counts them on the programme.
Ten teams, including Hans and Tony.
$l5O for the team with the most sprint
points at the end. $lO per sprint along
the way.
“There’s the gun and, oh mate, is
there anything like the Madison for go
and excitement?”
Two young Blacktown riders are
pouring it on.
“They’re hoping to get a break on
the field, folks. Pick up the sprint
points with no competition. Very cun-
ning ... But the others are starting to
peg them back . . . Never that easy, is it
folks?”
Crowd yells “Nooo!”
After the third sprint old Hans is
finding it a bit hard. Tony has to do the
next three sprints himself to let him
get his breath back.
Doesn’t help though they’re
starting to go backwards . . .
Getting towards the end, they’ve got
bugger-all points compared to some of
the other teams. They look fit, but
they’re getting nowhere.
Can’t help thinking about that.
They’re getting old is what it is. That’s
something you can’t beat. Something
Mum used to say.
“Don’t understand why you do it
boy, this bike business.”
“Something to do, Mum. But I
really like it, see?”
“You could be doing better. You’re
old enough to get a job. Working, Ron
my boy. That’s what makes a man.”
What about Dad and those bloody
pigeons? If he’s allowed to have the
pigeons I’m allowed to ride bikes.”
“Don’t swear son. Just don’t
swear .. .”
1954? 1955? Can’t remember.
Focuses on the lap board. There’s
only one sprint to go. But the old mates
have had it. Westerman’s pulled up.
Tony’s still rolling round for forms’s


sake suppose so he can say he
finished.
The kids from Blacktown win it
they’d be 18 though, wouldn’t they?
with 63 points. Not much of a race
really. Not when you’ve seen Patterson
ride. Or Mockridge. Or even the last of
old Oppy before he retired.
Things are winding up. The bloke at
the PA switches it off.
Tempted to make a rush and get out
before the crowd. But no. Wait for
them to go. Be the last.
They’re filing out.
Wind’s got up really strong now.
The empty chip packets are blowing
down the steps, blowing out the door,
like it’s time for them to go too.
Last rider carries his machine on
his shoulder out of the marshalling
area. Bloke at the gate goes.
Still have to turn the lights off. Can
stay a bit longer. And then it’s back to
Erskineville for you, old son. Home. To
the falling-down dump. What’s the
point of going there anymore?
Could stay here, if you wanted to.
Right here. Sleep under the
grandstand say, and no one would
know. You don’t have to keep any door
open to keep cool here. The bricks in
that place keep it hot, and then you
open the door onto the Princes
Highway, and still it’s hot. They hold
the heat.
Lights are off now. How many watts
would they be?
The last car starts up in the car-
park, and goes. All quiet now.
Stays where he is for a time, then
walks around to the grandstand and
sits on the stairs. The wind keeps
blowing in off the bay you’d never
get hot here at night. Unless you were
pushing a bike.
Nothing happening but the airport
radar still, couple of kilometres from
here. Round and round and round . . .
Never been on a plane. So what? Never
had the money to do it.
Out there in the middle, in the
darkness, a helicopter is coming down
slowly.
Keep looking and you see things.
Anything can happen. You can make it
up if you want. $3 gets you in.
Jumps out and he’s in his racing
gear and he’s got his bike. The pilot
stays inside. The others are waiting for
him to get on the track. They’re all
young.
Ten laps it’ll be, and he gives them a
half lap start. It’s a breeze, a piece of
cake, a walk-over. He catches them in
four laps, then laps them. Pulls up and
the crowd goes crazy, they’re clapping
like thunder. The others get off, he’s
going to do a victory lap.
He’s away.
But he doesn’t stop. Keeps going.
Slowly at first, then faster and faster
and faster. So fast he’s finally off the
ground, he’s riding above the ground.
The people are yelling and scream-
ing. The pilot’s watching him through
his glass bubble, watching him go up.
And then you can see it he’s on
his transmitter to somebody.
Somebody, maybe the airport.
Somebody’s got to keep track of him
and make sure he’s safe. Make sure he
can land again when he’s ready. The
radar can do that. They’ll guide him
back down, when he’s ready.
The last event on the programme.
Made up and gone. The breeze is too
strong, too cold to stay here tonight.
Have to go home. ■
BLOOD
by Renate Yates
Renate Yates has just published a novel, Social
Death, and has a volume of short stories coming
out in early 1985.
HE WAS TOLD to call them Grace and
Arthur. His parents had demanded it.
Grace and Arthur were not consulted
on the matter and did not really seem
to mind very much. Sometimes Grace
raised her eyebrows in a way she had
when he called her by her name loudly,
in the park or on the street, raised
them as though to say it has nothing to
do with me what my grandson calls me.
Then she would take his hand, con-
descending carefully to his smallness,
Grace was good with children, and say
mildly “William you should not shout
quite so loudly in public” and they
would walk on together quite com-
panionably.
At the kindergarten William told
his teacher that he had no grand-
mother or grandfather. She was a kind
girl, and felt sorry for him and avoided
talking to the class about
grandparents whenever she remem-
bered, until the day Grace came to the
school to pick him up. It was a
Tuesday, the day Grace always had her
hair done and she looked very elegant,
(she subscribed to Vogue of course),
every inch a real grandmother.
William’s teacher, a discerning girl,
took stock and said stiffly “well, it
seems we’ve been telling some little
white lies, haven’t we William?” and
Grace raised her eyebrows and said “of
course it has nothing whatever to do
with -me, it’s his parents they have
these funny modern ideas and there’s
nothing I can do about it is there?” and
laughed and his teacher laughed too.
Later, when he told his parents
what had happened they laughed too,
but really laughed as though they were
quite sure it was all really funny and
not like Grace and his teacher had
laughed. It was a puzzle but they
explained it to him. How Grace and
Arthur, as well as being Daddy’s par-
ents and thus his grandparents, were
also people, real people and had
names. Not just any Granny or
Grandpa, real people like he, William,
was a person and had a name. Would
he like to be called just Child? William
agreed that he would not like to be


called Child. He always remembered
that day; it was the day he had
acquired grandparents of his own, just
the same as all the other children at
the kindergarten, and it felt reassur-
ing.
Grace and Arthur had a unit
overlooking the harbor which they
kept obsessively tidy. It was full of old
furniture and fascinating bric-a-brac
which Grace and Arthur had collected
over the years; with inlaid boxes, por-
celain figures and glass birds on highly
polished tables and careful bowls of
flowers everywhere. The flowers were
mostly imitation, but very expensive
Grace said. They looked incredibly
real, huge bunches of white gardenias
nestling in shiny green plastic leaves
or tall red silk roses in sheafs. “So
convenient” said Grace “they never
fade, they never die, and I don’t have to
change nasty smelly water.” Grace was
wonderfully fastidious, “aren’t they
simply marvellous?” She also said “it’s
the effect that counts, that really
matters.” On the window sill a pair of
blue Victorian vases with long crystal
drops threw a cold light onto the floor.
Beside them, on Arthur’s antique desk
with the tooled green leather top there
were framed photographs of Arthur
shaking hands with important people,
while Grace, smiling gently stood by
his side.
William liked to visit Grace and
Arthur. They let him do anything at
all, even jump on the sofa with his
sandals on which he was not allowed to
do at home. When his mother said
“William stop that immediately”
Arthur would say “oh leave him alone
dear” and look at her disapprovingly,
he was good at looking disapproving
and this made William feel uneasy. So
he would become more boisterous and
naughty and Grace and Arthur would
laugh and tell his mother that she was
too strict. They allowed William too
much ice cream and too many sweets
and fizzy drinks which his mother said
would rot his teeth and Grace and
Arthur said “you fuss too much dear,
leave him alone dear.”
When William was tired of jumping
on the sofa or on the big leather chair
he would stand by the window and
watch the boats on the harbor.
Sometimes he was allowed to look
through Arthur’s binoculars even
though they were very heavy and his
mother fussed about him dropping
them, while the others sipped their
drinks and talked, or Arthur talked.
“Blood” he often said, when he
wasn’t deriding an associate (Arthur
had a sharp, malicious tongue) “is
thicker than water. Look at William,
look at the way he holds those
binoculars the image of my Uncle
Jim.”
“But he’s got your eyes Arthur”
Grace might say “and Mary’s nose of
course.”
“And the curl in his hair and the
color just like Vera’s.”
They discussed William in this way
as though he was an object only
recently and advantageously pur-
chased. William by the window felt like
a visitor in their lives, a listener and
not part of them at all even though it
seemed to be important, this discus-
sion of his shape. They discussed it in
such intricate detail, their heads
speculatively on one side or another as
they searched for confirmation of
resemblances. His character too was
not his own but partly Arthur’s,
Grace’s or that of some other obscure
relation William had never seen. A
relation always belonging to Grace or
Arthur; his mother and her people
were never mentioned at all. The blood,
it appeared had emanated entirely
from Grace and Arthur, perhaps the
water it was thicker than, came from
his mother’s side of the family.
Grace and Arthur hardly ever
visited William’s house, they were
much too busy. William thought they
were very important people, always so
busy with other important people
about whom Arthur could be very
funny afterwards. He crucified his
friends gaily and with remarkable
facility, was intolerant of their mis-
takes, mishaps and even their smallest
errors. Arthur capitalised on disasters.
William’s parents laughed a great deal
when they visited Grace and Arthur.
They were always so busy, strugg-
ling along, Grace would say, their lives
revolving around the large, square,
gilt-edged invitations which were
regularly displayed on their mantel-
piece.
Sometimes William brought pic-
tures he had made and colored in for
Grace and Arthur but they hardly
seemed to notice. “That’s nice dear,”
Grace would say; “and now have some
more cake.” They took much more
notice when William was being noisy
and boisterous. On his birthday they
always gave him money. “So much
easier dear” and Grace handing over
too many crisp notes, “and he can buy
exactly what he wants.” William and
his mother banked some of the money
in William’s own
bank account and
they spent some of it
together, but after-
wards he never
remembered what
they had bought.
The only thing he
remembered Grace
and Arthur ever
giving him was the
carnation. Once
when his mother
took William to see
Grace and Arthur,
Grace was making
flowers out of multi-
colored tissue paper.
Carnations she ex-
plained to William
and let him help.
They drew large
circles on the paper and cut them out
with Grace’s big silver scissors. Then
Grace took some of the circles and
bunched them carefully in the middle,
making a stem out of picture wire and
then pulling and tucking the petals
into shape. When a flower was finished
William was allowed to put it gently, so
as not to squash it, into the large vase
Grace had prepared. The carnations,
all made of different colors were
beautiful, so bright and luscious and
very nearly real, except for the blue
ones.
“Effective, don’t you think?” said
Grace who was making them for some
of her friends for Christmas, “and so
fashionable this year dear” to
William’s mother. William was allowed
to choose one to take home because he
had been such a help to Grace. He
chose a big red one and buried his nose
in it. “It smells like paper” he said “but
nice”. “It’s the appearance, the effect

that matters” said Grace.
His mother pinned the carnation to
the corner of a poster on the wall of his
room where it looked very pretty.
But after William’s parents were
divorced Grace and Arthur faded
gradually from William’s life; somehow
they seemed to be busier than ever and
he saw even less of them than he had
done before. On the rare occasions his
mother, doing her duty, took him to see
them, Grace and Arthur were ex-
ceptionally quiet. They whispered and
spoke in hushed tones about things
William was not supposed to know; like
the divorce, and whose fault it was,
and how it was all to be expected since
“she was never really one of us” which
he heard Grace mutter to Arthur one
day as his mother stood by the window
looking at the boats on the harbor and
biting her lip. “But it doesn’t make any
difference to us dear” said Arthur “you
must come and see us often”, and once
a year on his birthday they sent
William a cheque which came in very
handy as he was growing up and
saving for record players and bikes.
One day his mother said to William,
now nearly grown up “you don’t want
this any more do you?” and took the
faded carnation off the wall. It had
only faded a little, Grace always used
the very best paper. The carnation
reminded William of Grace and
Arthur. “Why” he asked his mother
“don’t we ever see Grace and Arthur
any more?”
“I think” said his mother “though
I’m not sure, that Grace and Arthur
have cut you out of the will of memory;
you remind them of things they would,
in their world, rather forget. It’s the
effect you see, you have the effect, not
your fault of course, of reminding them
of a mistake; perhaps even of one of
their failures.” She paused and then
went on briskly “although really I
think they’re just too busy, you
remember how busy they always were,
they’d love to see you I’m sure”, and
she threw the carnation into the bin.
William did not understand his
mother, he was not listening very
carefully, mainly because he did not
really care. There was, after all, very
little to remember about Grace and
Arthur. He remembered jumping on
sofas, looking at boats through
Arthur’s binoculars and too much ice
cream.
He remembered the endless discus-
sions of his character and shape and
he remembered Arthur saying, too
often, something about blood. But the
faces of Grace and Arthur eluded him.
THE DOWRY
by Penelope Nelson
Penelope Nelson, who holds degrees from
Sydney and Macquarie universities, has
published short stories and poems in various
literary magazines and anthologies.
THERE IS a Saturday morning rush at
the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.
Our funeral my mother’s funeral
is running late. We mourners are
trampling over the poppies and
rosebushes outside the chapel as we
wait our turn. My husband and elder
son are both wearing ties. Excluding
school ties, there proved, when we
ransacked the house this morning, to
be a choice of three: one plain, dark
red wool (London, designer unknown,
circa 1955); one blue and green,
Florentine-patterned silk (Pucci, circa
1969), one fawn silk with burnt orange
stripes (Pierre Cardin, circa 1978).
They are wearing the silk ones. My
son’s legs have grown so much in 12
months that he has had to wear black
cord jeans under his brown corduroy
jacket because the trousers that
matched the jacket revealed a band of
hairy calf.
My uncle comes up to greet me. He
has not spoken to me since the 1975
election but he advances cordially
today. He calls me by my mother’s
name.
My younger son is handing out
copies of the readings for the service.
Kate, an elegant woman in her late 60s,
says to me: “Your darling boy has
offered me a copy of the service but my
eyes are hopeless. I don’t read any
more; I’m reduced to listening.”
“It must be terrible,” I reply, “but
we’ll all be peering at this tiny print.”
“It’s unspeakable, ducky,” Kate
says. “I can see outlines, though,” she
adds. “A little further off I see a bit. I
can tell you, for instance, that your
mother would have adored your suit.”
“Do you think so?” I can* feel
decades of parental disapproval evap-
orating. I am with a hundred people
who thought John Kerr was right but,
for today at least, I can accept them. If
they cared for my mother, they are
alright by me.
“Think so?” Kate says. “I know it.”
My suit is a black and white check
(Trent Nathan, end-of-season sale,
1982) and I also wear dark glasses,
prescription lenses, 1979. A man in a
black suit approaches my husband and
offers to relieve him of the bunch of
roses he is holding. I look daggers
through the glasses.
“Thank you,” he says. “I think my
wife prefers me to take these in
myself.”
I kiss people. I try to comment
coherently on my mother’s last days.
There are friends of my parents from
the 1950 s here today, although there
has been no notice in the papers.
Unhesitatingly, I remember their
names. I feel as if I could recall whole
slabs of the Walter de la Mare,
Norman Lindsay and Robert Louis
Stevenson that my mother used to
read to me at Palm Beach in the years
after the war when she was a young
woman with long hair like Rita Hay-
worth’s. However, I don’t have to do
that. All I have to do is read the
beatitudes without bawling. Blessed
are they that mourn. My younger son
and I have a pact: If I look as if I am
going to cry when it is my turn to read,
he is going to make faces. But I know
now that he won’t have to. Blessed are


“As a matter of fact, this is the first time I’ve ever had to cater for a
literary luncheon.”
they that mourn, for they shall be
comforted.
“You’re very lucky you’ve had your
mother for this long,” a secretary at
work tells me. “You’ve known her and
your boys have, too. My mother died
when I was three; I scarcely even
remember her. And my son has never
had a grandmother.
“Yes,” I say. “You’re quite right
we’ve been very lucky.”
Kate and I speak on the telephone a
couple of times. I am sitting at my
typewriter one day, using Bob Marley
for rhythm as I type. She rings. I can
scarcely hear her. “National Trust,”
she says. “Darling Point .. . Diary
exhibition.”
“But I’m fascinated by diaries,” I
shout. “I’m writing a novel set in 1897
and diaries are just about the best
source. Just a moment; I’ll turn this
down.” Marley fades a little, the
Wailers wail; his backing musicians
repeat the only reggae chords they
know in a minor key. I can hear Kate
now.
“Dowries,” she is saying. “Dowries
from 1880 onward. Some of it is very
witty. On loan from the costume
museum.”
“Oh,” I say, disappointed. Dowry,
not diary. Pity. “I love costume exhibi-
tions.” There is some truth in this. I
get high in fabric shops. I don’t know
the name for the proneness to sexual
fantasy inspired by layers of filmy,
floating cloth soft and sensuous on
the skin but these phrases would
not have been stolen by the cosmetics
copywriters if my fetish were not
widespread. Silky, satiny, gossamer,
sheer. “I’ll go, of course,” I tell Kate.
She explains how to find Lindesay, the
National Trust house..
It is bitterly cold on the day I go.
Winds scud across the little park at the
end of Darling Point Road, leaves pile
up against the security signs of the
American consul’s residence. I confi-
dently approach the best-situated piece
of real estate in sight but it proves to
be Canonbury, once the convalescent
arm of the Women’s Hospital in Crown
Street. Closed now, like the hospital,
and empty. When my boys were born,
in the boom years of seven thousand
births a year at Crown Street, I could
have convalesced here but sight
unseen I chose not to. Too late now
the shutters are boarded up and it is
hard to imagine that this grim
Victorian pile smelled, quite recently,
of the newborn.
Somebody’s chauffeur sets me in
the right direction and I get to
Lindesay. Inside the white building,
volunteers from the Trust’s ladies com-
mittee are selling $3 catalogues.
Others are waiting in vain for anyone
to buy their teatowels, pot pourris and
place mats.
I enter the first room. There are
handsome dresses, all from different
periods, all expensive. If the conjunc-
tion is witty, as Kate has assured me it
is, I am slow to get the joke. A seagreen
patterned evening gown looks like the
kind of garment Julia wore on the ship
in the television version of Brideshead
Revisited.
In the library, I am briefly diverted
by a jubilee ribbon from 1897 my
year. Under a picture of a fat Queen
Victoria doing her crochet work, is this
verse:
Her court was pure, her life serene,
God gave her peace, her hand reposed,
A thousand claims to reverence closed
In her as Mother, Wife and Queen.
Tennyson, the catalogue assures
me. Poor man, I think; he had to say
something. We all utter platitudes on
public occasions.
As I go from room to room, I begin
paying more attention to the custod-
ians than to the exhibits. Trust ladies
are wearing fairly standard Sloane
Ranger gear: navy blue suits, tartan
skirts with plain blazers, the obliga-
tory silk scarf, pearl earrings. Many of
them are even talking valiantly to each
other about the items on display. This
is frustrating to me. I would prefer to
overhear some good gossip. The words
that recur in their conversation today
are “the lace”. “Have you seen the
divine lace?” they are asking. Out of
this world.
It may be my mother’s fault that
lace does nothing for me: She never
had a lace tablecloth or a lace runner
or a decent pair of lace drawers; she
did not bequeath me any antique
embroidery, she had no time for any of
that stuff. She did struggle with Viyella
children’s clothes for a few months
when my brother was small but she
wisely abandonded the effort and
headed for David Jones, instead. No,
what she bequeathed to me was alto-
gether different.
My mother read me verses that
scanned. She taught me not to split
infinitives. When other children
learned catechisms, I recited after her
“Different from, opposite to, con-
trasted with.” Thanks to her, I twitch
every time someone says “between you
and I.” This is my dowry, in that other
sense of natural endowment. She
taught me my mother tongue.
“Have you seen the lace? You must
see the lace before you go.” The com-
mittee ladies are most insistent. The
lace is on display in an area designated


the Marble Hall. I never dreamed that
I dwelled anywhere so decorous. Black
satin, violet chiffon those are the
fabrics that move me. Here everything
is white and creamy and delicate.
"Crochet collars, handmade pillows,
set of 9 circular extremely finely
knitted cream lace round mats 13cm
diameter.”
Suddenly, in the middle of all this, I
do see a joke.
Is it the one Kate meant?
Propped in the marble hall is a
photograph of Les A. Murray. The
Australian poet, the Trust ladies have
labelled him. The boy from Bunyah,
the peasant mandarin, grins from one
of his XOS handknit jumpers. I read
the catalogue entry.
95 Christening Dress & Coat, of the
Australian poet Les Murray.
“Hand-worked silk crepe made by
Mrs Miriam Murray (nee Arnall)
Bunyah, NSW 1938. Miriam
Pauline Murray was born in Kurri
Kurri, NSW in 1915 & died in Taree,
NSW in April 1951, just a month
short of her 36th birthday. Daugh-
ter of a Cornish coal mine manager
who died when she was a child, Mrs
Murray grew up in Newcastle & was
a nursing sister there before her
marriage, in 1937, to Cecil Allan
Murray, dairy farmer of Bunyah, a
district on the lower north coast,
south of Taree. The christening
ensemble which she made for her
son Leslie Allan, born 17th October
1938, was used for his christening in
the free Presbyterian church at
Bunyah; kept by her widowed hus-
band for many years after her
death, it was passed on to Leslie in
time for the baptism of his son
Alexander Cecil in 1978”. Quote Les
Murray. Contemporary photograph
of poet.
SUDDENLY, I am not at all in-
different to lace. The handworked
cream garments bring re-readings of
his poems flooding to my mind. The
Widower In The Country, Evening
Alone At Bunyah, Cowyard Gates
none of them will be the same for me
now. I have had glimmerings before.
“The great unstated subject in Les’s
poems,” I said once to a professor of
English, “is his mother.” I picked a
reticent and upright man to say this to
and he replied: “It would be a bit
tasteless to pursue that, wouldn’t it?”
Ignoring that warning, I once con-
cluded a study of ritual in Murray’s
poems with this observation: “The
major loss in Murray’s life and his
father’s life is also mentioned in this
poem ( Cowyard Gates)
my mother placing and placing
a tin ring on some dough, telling
me about French.
The first weeks of her absence.”
“IT IS significant,” I wrote, “that, in
her one overt appearance in Murray’s
work so far, his mother is glimpsed
performing a ritual act.”
Certainly I have found a joke the
mountainous poet dwarfing his own
christening robes. A current poem of
his refers to the aristocracy of the fat.
It is dedicated to Robert Morley.
But there is another message here,
too: hope, tenderness, a mother’s gift.
A dowry.
When I get home, I telephone Les
Murray. “I know what you’ve seen,” he
says. “In fact, we got some sort of
notice that the exhibition is on. Yes,
she had a great ability for that type of
handwork, didn’t she?”
“Come off it, Les,” I say. “It’s a
poem; you know it is.” ■
SERGE BERKALOFF
by Alister Kershaw
Alister Kershaw, who lives in France where he
was ABC correspondent for many years, has
completed a book of memoirs, ... and Friend,
about writers and assorted eccentrics he has
known. Serge Berkaloff is
one of the eccentrics.
WHEN I FIRST saw it, the South of
France my little bit of it, anyway
was still recognisably the South. It
wasn’t any longer the Midi of Mistral
by a long chalk, the Midi of the
Felibrige, the Midi so radiantly evoked
by Leon Daudet; but it hadn’t yet
become Miami, either.
“Currency controls” prevented the
English from returning to their pre-
war hang-outs, the Germans were a
touch diffident about showing their
faces, the Americans had had enough
of being shunted from one battlefield
to another and were only too pleased to
stay at home, and the Japanese,
whatever else they may have been
doing, were not scurrying over the face
of Europe with cameras.
In the summer months there was a
small-scale invasion of Parisians, in-
cluding a far-from-monstrous regiment
of pretty young women. Nobody was
inclined to complain about that. For
the rest of the year, the particular
patch of the Var where I was staying
with the writer Richard Aldington was
occupied solely by permanent residents
wine-growers, fishermen, a handful
of retired schoolmasters and notaries.
I was on excellent terms with a
number of the fishermen and wine-
growers but much of the time the
fishermen were fishing and the wine-
growers were growing wine. Richard
was a hard worker when engaged on a
book, his wife had a house to look
after, and sooner or later, the pretty
young women went back to Paris.
I was only 25, and sometimes, I
admit, I found time hanging a bit
heavy on my hands. What could one do
about it? Why, go and visit Serge, of
course.
Serge was a White Russian. France
was filled with them then, a mere 30
years after the Revolution. Princes and
dukes and counts abounded. Serge’s
pretentions were more modest: he
simply claimed to be the son of a
former admiral of the Imperial Navy.
Nevertheless, he had one advantage
over the princes and archdukes his
claims were, I think, genuine.
If they weren’t, he’d gone to a lot of
trouble to make them convincing. The
villa where his father lived (and where
I was once taken by Serge) was
crammed with an impressive collection
of naval memorabilia and the old
gentleman certainly looked and
behaved like a retired admiral.
For that matter, Serge, too had a
“presence”. While awaiting the
restoration of the Romanovs, he ran
the local inn but, until one had been
admitted to the inner circle and
even after he comported himself
with a sort of benign haughtiness.
Slugging our way on foot along the


dusty road from St Clair to Le
Lavandou, Richard and I would oc-
casionally be overtaken by a huge,
almost insolent motor-car, at the wheel
a dark lean fellow some 40 years old
Serge heading regally for the market.
From the comfort of his car, Serge
would disdainfully salute us one
condescending finger raised to the
edge of his beret. It was impossible not
to be awed by such natural hauteur.
Imperceptibly, we dropped into the
role of obsequious peasants. It was
with some difficulty that we restrained
ourselves from tugging our forelocks
as Serge whirred past.
“At least he acknowledges our
existence, Alister. Mark my works, one
of these days we’ll be accorded the
status of honorary White Russians.
Pazienza, pazienza!”
As usual, Richard was quite right: it
proved to be a question of patience. He
had walked into Lavandou by himself
one morning and on his return was so
immoderately pleased he was almost
purring.
“Momentous news, my dear boy. I
have received from Serge the salute
favored by the great Duke of
Wellington himself two fingers, as I
live and breathe. At last Serge has
demonstrated before all the world that
he considers us as outranking the local
fishermen.”
And so he had. Measuring us
against who knows what occult Slav
criterion, Serge had come to the con-
clusion that we were a cut above the
rest of the community. Our progress in
his estimation thereafter resembled
nothing so much as that of Freema-
sons being initiated into ever-higher
degrees of the lodge, until all five
fingers were lifted in ceremonious
greeting.
We were so bucked by Serge’s
benignity that we felt able to call on
him and ask whether we might
perhaps be permitted to lunch next day
at the inn. Serge was all graciousness.
We would be welcome guests, he
assured us. Would we care to leave the
arrangements to him?
I could weep when I think of that
meal. It started at 12:30 and finished as
night was falling. The zakuski alone
would have kept a whole family for a
week: caviar and blinis, tiny spiced
sausages, little pies containing mys-
terious savoury titbits, hearts of
artichokes stuffed with foie gras, as-
paragus, whole lobsters Mornay,
Rockefeller, a VArmoricaine. And this
was the prelude only.
There followed a loup de mer
Berkaloff and his wife Yvonne
redolent of the Provenpal herbs on
which it had been laid to bed during
the cooking, wild duck, salad, cheeses,
a perfect souffle, fruit, accompanied by
wines such as I had never drunk before
and was not often to taste again.
Serge in person deigned to serve us,
subtly conveying that we were guests
in his own home and that it was no
more than an amusing eccentricity of
his to play the part of butler. At the
end of the meal, as we lolled back in
our chairs, surfeited and unrepentent,
he appeared with a bottle of vintage
champagne, misted-over in its ice-
bucket. Might he perhaps invite us to
join him in drinking a toast to our
acquaintanceship? He certainly might.
“Monsieur Aldington”, he said after
dismissing with a seigneurial wave of
the hand our felicitations on his
cuisine, “Monsieur Aldington, I have
recently had the pleasure of reading
your Death of a Hero in French,
alas, for my English is, I fear, limited.
May I say that it would not be
unworthy of our great Russian
authors?”
I had been present more than once
when someone had complimented
Richard on this or that book. Nobody
dislikes hearing his work praised,
whatever he may pretend, and
Richard, the most unaffected of men,
made no attempt to conceal his
pleasure. In my experience, however,
while gratified, he was never
overwhelmed. Now I saw a weird
phenomenon take place. Commended
by Serge, Richard displayed a delight
which had never been elicited by tri-
butes from his peers.
“My dear Monsieur Berkaloff, you
are far too kind. I really don’t know
how to thank you.”
“Monsieur Aldington, I merely state
the opinion of one with some small
pretention to culture.”
Serge never found it necessary to
pay Richard any further compliments,
but he didn’t high-hat him either, and
that was already something: he high-
hatted everyone else. Richard and he,
however, met as equals or almost as
equals since Serge delicately let it be
understood that, if he had ever had a
mind to, he could have written books
which would have been rather better
than Richard’s.
With me, he let it be just as clearly
understood that our relationship was
that of master and pupil. My taste in
wine, my coarse colonial humor, my
defective French, my inability to ap-
preciate Dostoievski, were only a few
of the shortcomings which were
ruthlessly excoriated. “Pauvre
Australien, pauvre primitif”, Serge
would say despairingly whenever I
offended against his standards,
“pauvre indigene ...”
His civilising mission went well
beyond jeering at me when I asked for
a local wine in preference to a
bordeaux or when I omitted to employ
an imperfect subjunctive where I
should have. My etats d’ame
themselves were subjected to Serge’s
scorn. One gets depressed now and
again, especially at 25, and when I had
an attack of it I would usually go to
Serge for consolation. Did I get it? I
did not.
“Depressed? You, an insensitive
Australian? My young friend, only we
Russians know what it is to be de-
pressed. / am dejected at this very
moment, but in my case I am not
suffering from a trifling Australian
despondency but from a veritable
cafard russe, a Russian depression.
That is a depression.”
My private life came in for close
examination and, where Serge con-
sidered it appropriate, pitiless criti-
cism. There was a very fetching young
woman who lived in the neighborhood.
I was greatly taken with her. Serge was
not. He conceded her physical attrac-
tions (he would have had to be blind
not to) but she was, he told me sniffily,


not the sort of girl he would wish any
friend of his to associate with. Her
father was neither an archduke nor a
retired admiral (“Does one indeed
know who her father was, does she?”)
and her accent was unacceptably pro-
letarian.
“For God’s sake, Serge, I’m not
sleeping with her father, and you’re
always telling me what a lousy accent
I’ve got.”
“Pauvre aborigene, you have much
to learn . . .”
I certainly did patience, for
example. Serge’s attempts to dictate to
me in the matter of my love affairs
were of such breath-taking arrogance
that I frequently felt like clipping him
one on the jaw. Naturally, I didn’t. No
“His early books were grand - all his characters based on real people.”
one in the world, I fancy, would have
dared to. What made him immune from
assaub;, however infuriating he might
be, was the fact that he was enveloped
in a kind of archiepiscopal dignity.
Now I come to think of it, that is what
Serge was a raffish and saturnine
archbishop.
Thanks to this pseudo-ecclesiastical
aura of his, he was able to exercise the
most astonishing authority over the
most improbable people. One lift of his
censorious eyebrows was enough to
quell anyone, however recalcitrant. My
friend Henry Williamson, author of
Tarka the Otter which had delighted
me in my youth, was among those who
made that particular discovery. When
planning his first visit to the South,
Henry asked me whether I could
recommend an inn where he could be
assured of the absolute peace and
quiet he needed in order to begin work
on a new book. He wanted to start on it
the minute he arrived and the slightest
interruption would be calamitous. I
placed the problem before Serge.
“You, Alister, a miserable
Australian” (he never could get over
the absurdity of anyone being an
Australian) “have, of course, little if no
knowledge of artists and the condi-
tions essential to their activity. Artists,
you will concede, are not often met
with in the howling wastes of your
native land. I, on the other hand,
Russian by origin, French by adoption,
and, above all, possessed of a rare
sensibility, enjoy a spontaneous affin-
ity with writers, painters, musicians.
Tell your friend that he will find here
precisely the atmosphere he seeks.”
The morning after Henry’s arrival, I
called at the inn to drink a pastis with
Serge. Henry was sitting at a table on
the terrace, typing away at a
tremendous lick. I wouldn’t have in-
terrupted him for worlds but, as I tip-
toed past, he looked up, haggard,
distracted, feverish, and greeted me.
“I’m glad to see your book’s pro-
gressing, Henry.”
“Book? Book? I’m not writing a
book. I’m writing letters to Serge’s
English clients confirming their
reservations.”
“You’re what?”
“Yes, and I must get on with them.
He wants them finished without fail
this morning.”
I don’t doubt they were, too.
Whether the book was ever finished, or
begun, is not so certain. Yet Henry, to
his credit, bore no grudge. Like the
rest of us, he was totally mesmerised
by Serge, and when writing to me
afterwards never failed to ask for news
of him.
Have I, perhaps, made Serge’s man-
ner of speaking sound a bit too
orotund, pompous even? It wasn’t. His
remonstrances, his homilies, his
sideswipes at Australia were delivered
with a beautifully understated self-
mockery.
Half-a-dozen times in the course of
the year, an appealing waif (the daugh-
ter, as far as I recall, of one of Serge’s
waitresses) would come clambering up
to the villa where I lived charged with
a peremptory message for “Monsieur
Alister”. I was expected at the inn by 7
pm at the latest. I knew what that
meant. “Tell Monsieur Berkaloff that
I’ll be there on the dot.”
Across the terrace, across the
restaurant, across the bar, and
straight into the kitchen that was
my itinerary on these occasions. Serge
would momentarily quit his saucepans
and smiling evilly, shake my hand, and
say something like this:
“Eh Bien, tonight you will learn the
difference between the miracle of la
haute cuisine and whatever rank
prison fare you were accustomed to eat
as you squatted by your campfire in
Australia. A certain client with more
money than can be come by honestly
has given me carte blanche in prepar-
ing a meal for him. He will, needless to
say, eat superbly well but sparingly;
you, poor primitive, will eat equally
well but copiously.”
What followed was a balletic per-
formance which I will recollect with
emotion to my dying day. The plutocrat
would instal himself in the restaurant.
I, in the kitchen, would hear Serge
suggesting or, rather, imperiously
instructing that champagne be
drunk by way of aperitif. Daunted like
everybody else, the plutocrat would
assent.
The bottle would be placed before
him and, no sooner had he downed a
glass, than Serge, harlequin-like,
would come bounding up, “And now,
Monsieur, with the zakuski, an
authentic vodka?” Before the poor gull
had time to reply, the bottle of
champagne, three-quarters full, would
be adroitly removed and replaced with
a bottle of Moskovskaia. Meantime, in
the kitchen, I would finish off the
champagne.
Those zakuski those artichoke
hearts, those lobsters, those caviar-
laden blinis! But the wretched client


would not have had enough time to eat
half of them when they, too, would be
whisked away by Serge (“Monsieur
has found these modest amusegueule
to his taste? Mere frivolities. But now
comes a dish which I venture to hope
you will not despise.”)
While I tucked into the remainder
of the Zakuski in other words, most
of them and downed the better part
of a bottle of vodka, the plutocrat
would just manage to sample the next
course and then that, too, virtually
untouched, would be carried back to
the kitchen and to me. And so it went
on.
You might think that Serge would
inevitably lose these well-heeled cus-
tomers forever. Certainly not. As well
as being a great comedian, he could
have been a great stage magician. His
patter was so rapid and fantastical, he
writhed so distractingly as he threw
himself into attitudes of fake humility,
he waved his hands in such ex-
traordinary arabesques (at the same
time somehow retaining his sacerdotal
majesty intact) that I don’t believe his
victims ever realised how dextrously
they’d been gypped, or that they’d been
gypped at all. They went away quite
oblivious of the fact that someone else
had eaten the bulk of the meal they’d
paid for.
Not all of Serge’s banquets left him
simultaneously with a fuller wallet and
the satisfaction of having helped to
educate my untutored colonial palate.
Dennison Deasey an old friend from
Australia, was staying at the inn, had
been staying there for months, unable
to tear himself away from Serge and
the good life.
He and I were lunching there. It was
winter and there was only one other
client, a personable young man who
ordered his meal with unmistakeable
expertise. The three of us finished at
the same time. With the most charm-
ing diffidence, excusing himself for his
unconventional behaviour in a French
of rare elegance, he begged that we
would do him the honor of joining him
for a glass of brandy. We did so.
I haven’t any recollection of what
we talked about but, with the help of
Serge’s admirable cognac, the con-
versation lasted for a couple of hours.
Deasey and I hated to break it up. Our
host did, too. It was somewhat
melancholy alone at the inn, he told us.
Would we not add to the debt of
gratitude he already owed us for our
company by being his guests at dinner
that same evening? Under the young
man’s influence, Deasey and I had
become devilish genteel ourselves. We
protested that he was too kind, that we
couldn’t possibly . . . that he was . . .
that we were ... in short, we accepted.
The young man, we learnt on
returning to the inn some hours later,
had made an equally favorable impres-
sion on Serge. “If only,” he said
meaningly to me, “if only your choice
of associates was always as happy.”
We had, it seemed, been dining with a
count.
What an evening! Spurred on by the
prospect of soaking the count for every
franc he’d got and no doubt also
feeling it was incumbent on him as
between two members of the upper
classes Serge really went all out. It
was one o’clock in the morning when
we reached the coffee and cognac and
by then we were all on Christian name
terms.
Even then the evening was not over.
The count called for a magnum of
champagne two magnums Serge
must take a glass with us two
glasses, three so must his wife, his
daughter, the waitress. Deasey and I
felt that the least we could do was to
offer a magnum ourselves. The count
wouldn’t hear of it. No, no, he must
insist on his privileges as our host.
Serge was impelled to perform a
frenetic Cossack dance, his wife could
not be induced to stop singing, his
daughter went from one to another of
us and embraced us with unremitting
ardor, Deasey was behind the bar
mixing frightful compounds which we
drank alternately with the champagne,
I was dancing, singing, embracing and
mixing drinks simultaneously, the
“Must be getting near
Christmas ...
count remained his courtly self.
Around four o’clock, at Serge’s
suggestion, we switched to vodka.
Serge beamed happily as his finest
crystal glasses were smashed against
the wall a la Russe.
I awoke late the next day. At the inn
I found Deasey in no better shape.
Serge, when he joined us on the
terrace, was equally hung-over but
there was an exultant gleam in his
eyes.
“The count, chers primitifs, has
gone into Cannes to visit his bank. He
was well-advised to do so. Never before
have I had the pleasure of making out
such a bill! I only hope that the count
will not be obliged to sell his ancestral
home in order to pay it.”
The count, of course, never did
return. In the role of wealthy aristo-
crat he had been so convincing that it
was quite a long while before we
recognised the harsh reality. Poor
Serge had dropped a packet.
Deasey and I conferred. We had
enjoyed a unique, an unforgettable
debauch. Vaguely remembering what
had been eaten and drunk, not to
mention the shattered Baccarat
glasses, we realised that we couldn’t
possibly foot the bill, but it would be
unpardonable to let Serge stand the
racket alone. Over a mournful drink,
we submitted our suggestion.
“Look, Serge, we had a stupendous
time the best evening ever. It’s only
fair that we should pay our share. Cut
out all those larcenous extras you’ve
added to the bill and we’ll split it three
ways.”
“My friends,” said Serge for once
we weren’t primitives or aborigines
“I am moved by your proposal but I
must decline it. If, after all these years
as a restaurateur, I am incapable of
telling when someone is a crook, I
deserve to pay for my stupidity. But,
mon Dieu, he was as like a count as any
count I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen
hundreds of them. Perhaps he really
was a count.
“But of course! Your common every
day bilker swindles to get a meal for
himself, out of sheer vulgar hunger; he
doesn’t have the chic to risk a couple of
years in prison simply to offer a meal
and such a meal! to a pair of
complete strangers.
“I am ashamed of my momentary
irritation. Now I have understood. I
wouldn’t have him arrested if I could.
Noblesse oblige. Come, poor
primitives, let us have a bottle of
champagne and drink to the health of
the count.” ■
