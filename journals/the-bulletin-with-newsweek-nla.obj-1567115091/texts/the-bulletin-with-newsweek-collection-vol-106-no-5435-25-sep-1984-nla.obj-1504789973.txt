THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Sales tax on wine
The budget application of a blanket 10
percent-on-everything sales tax to Aus-
tralian wine seems to have been hasty
and ill-conceived.
A tax on wine ONLY in containers
over 750 ml (ie flagons, casks, etc which
make up around 80 percent of wine
sales volume), at 20 percent would or
should have:
1) Netted more than 10 percent on
the lot.
2) Been cheaper to collect.
3) Made no difference to sales of
such containers. I cannot agree with the
wine industry lobby and the South Aus-
tralian Premier that such a tax would
destroy the livelihoods of the growers
(mainly in the irrigation areas) much of
whose produce ends up in casks and
flagons. It is interesting to note that
casks are or were commonly sold pre-
tax, in 1984, at almost exactly the same
price that they fetched in 1975. (I have
one of my old price lists to prove it.)
Increasing the price of a cask from
$4.99 to $5.99 (20 percent) would not,
these days, deter customers.
4) Satisfied the breweries who, even
as substantial vignerons themselves,
take the negative view that because beer
is overtaxed wine should be too.
5) Left the somewhat fragile “top
end” of the wine industry to go through
its natural and inevitable self-rational-
isation unaided by government prod-
ding. It is in the top end that experiment
and quality improvement occur from
which the Australian wine industry
could (and there is much evidence for it)
become a force in the world.
Government-induced increases in al-
ready high costs serve to put the state
boot into many worthwhile makers who
will be abandoned by drinkers in favor
of those wineries able to discount, ad-
vertise and promote the most heavily.
Even those wineries must eventually be
less quality-conscious in order to com-
pete with each other.
To add insult to injury, the budget
has by reducing sales tax on imported
wine from 20 percent to 10 percent
handed an unwitting if temporary
subsidy to imported wine.
Although a new customs tax of 10
percent will make up the difference and
slightly increase prices, most imported
wine is not held in bond. Therefore,
much of the wine already in Australia
escapes the new tax but still pays only
10 percent sales tax.
One last thought is that 10 percent
sounds awfully like a precedent-es-
tablishing rate a foothold for future
budgets to build upon.

YOUR NEW PEUGEOT SR IS READY.
An emergency is the worst
time to find out how safe your
car is.
Which is why Peugeot
destroys several hundred cars
each year.
They roll them, skid them,
run them into concrete walls,
run them into each other.
Only then can they design
doors that don't jam shut, locks
that don't burst open, and foot
pedals that don’t trap your feet.
Peugeot also tests the
components that give you every
chance to avoid an impact.
Handbrakes must survive
40,000 hand pulls. Shock
absorbers 100,000 kilometres.
Warning lights must show
at the first sign of low brake
fluid or brake pad wear.
All four power assisted disc
brakes must balance the
correct braking effort. Whether
the car is fully laden. Or empty.
Off road. At speed.
Nothing is overlooked when
it comes to your safety. And
your comfort. Because a
relaxed driver is a safer driver.
So your SR is crammed
with features that would be
added luxuries to other cars.
Air conditioning. Power
steering. Sophisticated AM/FM
stereo/cassette.
Electric front windows.
Central locking.
All standard.
And seats that are anything
but standard.
All of which makes the SR
much better value than other
fully-imported European luxury
cars.
So you see, the Peugeot
SR goes one step further to
ensure your safe arrival.
Because Peugeot know
that not only is the standard of
the car important, so is the state
of the driver.
Take an SR for a safe test
drive at your nearest Peugeot
dealer. Or write for a free
brochure.

Battling ‘concrete cancer’
We have read with great interest your
well-timed, well-presented and well-re-
searched article on “concrete cancer”
(B, September 4).
We have successfully treated and
reclaimed spalling concrete for the past
nine to 10 years and our products are
specified and currently being used on
some of the buildings illustrated in your
article.
It is also our experience that the
other major curse which often faces
modern high-rise buildings is water
penetration. This defect can be caused
by several factors, more specific to these
types of constructions some of these
already described in your article.
While these problems are not unique
to Australia, few proven remedial treat-
ments are available anywhere.
As the result of our consistent re-
search, we have developed specific ma-

terials which are not only used locally
but also are being exported to countries
in Asia and the Middle East.

‘Unfortunate’ terminology
It is unfortunate that the term “con-
crete cancer,” colorful though it may
be, seems to have become an accepted
pseudonym for steel corrosion in
describing the problems being experi-
enced with most high-rise buildings.
Cancer, in the minds of most people,
carries with it connotations of a termin-
al illness. Problems being experienced
with high-rise buildings hardly fall into
that category.
To say this is in no way to under-rate
the seriousness of these problems, nor
the cost of remedial measures when they
are required. At the same time, their ex-
tent should be kept in perspective lest
your otherwise factual article create the
impression that all or even the majority
of high-rise buildings are suffering
serious deterioration.
To attribute the annual maintenance
cost of all buildings, suggested by Dr
Blakey of the CSIRO Division of Build-
ing Research to be of the order of $3
billion a year, to defects in modern high-
rise development is totally misleading.
In a recent paper, in which he cited $3
billion as the cost of maintaining Aus-
tralia’s total building stock, estimated to
have a value of some $3OO billion, Dr
Blakey also estimated “the current re-
pair costs in Australia for damage
caused by reinforcement corrosion” as
$lOO million a year a totally different
order of magnitude to $3OOO million!
The fact is that it is very much the
minority of such buildings which are
suffering serious defects. The great ma-
jority are performing their function
quite satisfactorily, although no build-
ing is completely maintenance-free.
It should be noted that the causes of
the deterioration which has occurred
are now well recognised. Research by
the CSIRO Division of Building Re-
search and other organisations is help-
ing to clarify many of the rules which
were neglected during the boom years
and this, coupled with the revision and
updating of our codes, should ensure
that at least the more serious of the pre-
sent problems do not recur.

What’s in a name
New heights of absurdity have been
reached by “groups” of distinctly ama-
teurish guitar twangers appearing at ho-
tels, nightclubs and at other centres of
entertainment in the names they have
chosen for themselves.
One of the recent choices of names
for a group (possibly inspired by the
success of “Beatles”) is “The
Cockroaches.” This is a rather unfortu-
nate choice if the group expects to be
employed by restaurants. Cockroaches
are not popular with restaurateurs.
Here are a few suggestions for
“groups” in search of a suitable name:
The Termites, The Lice, The Latrines,
The Germs, The Maggots, The Retarded
Mongols, The Bed Bugs.

Buderim Qld
Police minister surprised
In reference to the article “Government
and police union on collision course”
(B, September 4) by Denis Reinhardt,
relating to the Queensland Police De-
partment, I would like the right of reply.
Firstly, might I point out that it is
blatantly one-sided. Mr Reinhardt did
not take advantage of my offer to speak
with him at short notice from him
to state the Government’s position.
But to the article. Mr Reinhardt in
his wisdom claims that relations be-
tween the government and the police
union “are moving towards outright
confrontation.”
I am sure the bulk of the state’s 4800
police would be as surprised at his
supposition as I was and it is certainly
not the general impression I have
gained in extensive travel throughout
the state over the last few months,


speaking to a wide cross-section of
police officers.
I have received numerous telephone
calls and letters from both individual
police and police union branches
strongly supporting both my stand in
refusing a long-standing union demand
for a police transfer tribunal and that of
the police administration under Com-
missioner Terry Lewis.
Such a tribunal would make policing
a state the size of Queensland unwork-
able.
That the state government has
stopped deducting police union fees
from officers’ wages is quite true but
what Mr Reinhardt did not say is that it
no longer collects union fees from
Crown employees on behalf of any
union.
Unionism is not compulsory in
Queensland. Our government believes it
is the individual’s inherent right to have
the freedom of choice whether to belong
to a union or not.
The claim that we are offering to pro-
vide legal expenses “now offered by the
(police) union,” conveniently omits the
fact that the Crown has always, as laid
down in a Commissioner’s circular
memorandum 61/81 dated July 3, 1981,
reimbursed the police union for legal
fees incurred by police officers found
not guilty of charges against them while
“on duty.”
“How time flies! I remember when
your father used to come around for
the protection money.”
The only difference is that payment
will now be made direct to the individ-
ual officer, if he has not applied for re-
imbursement through the police union.
The offer of immediate assistance
with funeral expenses is made to ensure
that no officer’s widow and family are
temporarily financially embarrassed,
wherever they may be in the state after
their husband or father has been killed
on duty.
What Mr Reinhardt did not say was
that funeral cost provisions are already
part of the usual government ex-gratia
payment made in such instances, equiv-
alent to workers’ compensation ben-
efits normally paid out to widows
within a fortnight or three weeks.
Few, if any, funeral directors de-
mand cash payments, so I doubt if this
assistance literally a 14- or 21-day
loan to be deducted from the ex-gratia
amount if the need arises will ever be
necessary.
Acting Police Commissioner, Mr
Syd Atkinson, advises me Mr Rein-
hardt’s claims that normal monthly
meetings between the police administra-
tion and full executive of the police
union had been cancelled are not cor-
rect.
The normal monthly meetings had
been held for over seven years, to his
knowledge.
He will be meeting the full union
executive as normal, on Tuesday (Sep-
tember 4) and no confrontation situa-
tion will be promoted by him.
Where time permits, I have also al-
ways met with the full union executive,
despite Mr Reinhardt’s claims, and
none to my memory “have degenerated

into heated exchanges” to quote his
article.
Most of the other points raised by
your writer are currently subject to in-
vestigation by the Police Complaints
Tribunal a legally constituted, totally
independent body headed by Judge
E. C. Pratt, QC, of the District Court,
established for just such a purpose.
I suggest further comment on these
complaints be left until the tribunal
completes its hearings.
But I must take exception to Mr
Reinhardt’s bold interpretation of com-
ments made by former Opposition
Leader Mr Keith Wright in State Parlia-
ment, that “Mount Isa police had rail-
roaded a murder suspect into life impri-
sonment for a crime to which another
person later confessed.”
This matter is now subject to an ap-
peal but, as I told the House in reply on
August 28, the officer in charge of the
Mount Isa CIB, Dectective Sergeant
E. J. Billing, “states that neither the de-
scription by Albury (the other person,
according to your report) of a weapon
he allegedly had used on the woman,
nor the description of the way he
abused her body, or even the dress of
the colored woman who he claimed to
have assaulted in Mount Isa, corre-
sponded with the assault on the mur-
dered woman.”
I rest my case for balanced reporting
which I was led to believe was the
essential ingredient to good journalism.

Conflict avoidable
An article (B, September 4) depicting
the Queensland Government and the
Queensland Police Union being on a
collision course is an accurate assump-
tion. The relationship between the
union and the government has been de-
teriorating to one of conflict for some-
time.
The changing attitude of the parties
has been precipitated by the Queens-
land Government failing to address the
real problems facing policing in
Queensland. These problems include
critical shortages of staff (Queensland
has lowest ratio of police to population
of any Australian state), dramatic short-
ages of proper equipment and facilities,
unfair transfer system, reduction in ac-
tive policing through overtime and
weekend work cutbacks. Consequently,
in an effort to resolve the problems, the
union has been forced into the public
arena. Thousands of dollars have been
spent on a media campaign designed to
draw attention to these pressing issues.
The government response has not
been characterised by efforts to con-
structively address and resolve the

problems. Rather, it has been one of
vindictive attacks on both the union and
senior officials. Examples of this reac-
tion include withdrawal of payroll de-
duction of union dues and accusations
of political bias by some police union
officials. It is little wonder then, that this
union is on a collision course with the
government. My union is not going to
desert or neglect its members. If the
government expects the union to do so
by not pressing for the resolution of
these problems then the government is
wrong. The collision can be avoided by
the government facing its responsibil-
ities to policing in this state.

Film institute defended
Your article “Institute faces new con-
fusion” (B, September 11) is full of er-
rors of both fact and assumption. It is a
direct attack on me, and through me on
the Australian Film Institute.
Additionally, in your rush to point
out the AFl’s shortcomings you choose
to ignore the institute’s very real
achievements over the past three years.
These include a $600,000 (more than 50
percent) increase in earned income; a
complete revision of the distribution
department, resulting in an effective and
efficient program of service not only to
independent film-makers but also to
educators, film societies, cinemas, social
welfare agencies and diverse audiences
throughout the country; an upgrading
of the Research and Information
Centre, resulting in its establishment as
the finest such centre in Australia; and
an increase in memberships of more
than 1000.
The Film Events which you criticise
have also been a success. The first two, a
tribute to German film-maker Rainer
Werner Fassbinder and a retrospective
of the films of Japan’s Shohei Im-
mamura, reached 101.5 percent of the
total audience reached by the National
Film Theatre (NFT) in a full year’s op-
eration in 1981, and 74 percent of that
reached in 1982. The income from these
two events was 136 percent of that
achieved by the NFT in 1981, and 108
percent of that achieved in 1982. Suc-
ceeding Film Events have built on this
base. Further, the cost was equal to or
less than that of reaching fewer people
under the old NFT system.
The NFT was beloved by many, and
with reason, but it is often forgotten that
NFT presentations frequently played to
a handful of people, sometimes to none.
Nonetheless, during my tenure the AFI
believed that there were conditions
under which the NFT could be revived.
We outlined these to the recent Austra-
lian Film Commission Cultural Activi

ties review. If the AFC chooses to revive
the NFT it will be, at least in part, be-
cause the AFI has urged it to do so.
The single essential condition which
must be present for this to occur is the
availability of greater subsidy. Inter-
national organisations similar to the
AFI (the British Film Institute, the
Cinematheque of Paris, the Museum of
Modern Art Film Program) operate
with a minimum subsidy base of 60 per-
cent, often extending as high as 90 per-
cent. As the subsidy available to the
Australian Film Institute is consider-
ably below this level, its services are
correspondingly reduced.
Further, it is the issue of subsidy
alone which is responsible for the pos-
sible closure of AFI cinemas. While I
believe that the AFI has succeeded in
making these the three most interesting
cinemas in Australia, I know that their
continued operation requires greater as-
sistance from the Australian Film Com-
mission.
I must also take issue with your at-
tack on me. Given that your reporter
makes quite merry with my reputation,
her lack of specifics is disquieting. Staff
are cited as sources in a reference to
budgeting without any detail as to who
they might be. The AFI has a staff of
almost 50 and naturally only the most
senior of these are involved in the
budgeting process. Consequently, the
use of unnamed sources is damaging
without being respectable.
Last, I would like to point out that
your picture is incorrectly captioned. It
is not a picture of me “at work at the
AFI.” It is not my practice to direct
business curled up on a table-top nor
amidst a sea of half-empty wine glasses.

Immigration policy
I do not think David McNicoll proves
his contention that Australia’s present
immigration policy is “favoring Asians”
(B, August 28).
It is true, as he says, that, if we com-
pare 1981-82 with 1983-84, many fewer
migrants arrived from the United King-
dom and Ireland and from the rest of
Europe while the intake from Asia was
only 3000 lower. But this was due to the
same/triteria being applied impartially.
The only departure from impartiality
is that Australia admits brothers and sis-
ters of residents from almost any part of
the world, provided they meet some ad-
ditional requirements, but will seldom
admit them from Vietnam. That is be-
cause in 1984-85 only 5000 Vietnamese
will come in under the Orderly Depar-
ture Program priority being rightly
given to spouses, fiances, minor unmar-
ried children and parents.
It is not clear how far the limitation
of numbers is affected by Hanoi’s de-
cisions. So far as it is Australia’s doing,
workers for refugees will condemn
neither our government nor responsible
members of the Opposition since our in-
take policy overall is a credit to the na-
tion.
We do, however, know of Vietnam-
ese applicants whose ties here are al-
most certainly closer than those of the
married British tradesman to whom Mr
McNicoll refers and who like the
tradesman have had to be rejected
through the operation of the current
policy.

The human animal
Mr Phillip Adams, in his “Let’s ban all
these filthy animals” (B, September 11),
has beaten a path to the animal king-
dom. The majority of the human race
prefers to remain human. While “nat-
ural sex” belongs to the marriage couch,
no one has said that you can’t enjoy
your married partner. But the sperm be-
longs in the womb.
Condoning homosexuality, bisexu-
ality, rape, incest, etc, mentioned by Mr
Adams, may be liberal but is it at the
expense of being Christian? Does the
Bible count for anything?
Those who worship and serve “the
creature rather than the Creator” are
given to vile passions: “Even their
women exchanged the natural use for
what is against nature. Likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the
women, burned in their lust for one an-
other, men with men, committing what
is shameful, and receiving in themselves
the penalty of their error which was
due.” (Romans 1.26,27)
I would invite Mr Adams to rejoin
the human race and Christianity, too,
unless he has been seduced by a gang of
rapacious snails. If so, perhaps the pen-
alty was due.

Air fare comparisons
Re your Wildcat item: “Fare Go”
(August 28) quoting Choice magazine:
Little Rock/Louisville should be com-
pared with Birdsville/Black Stump. A
more valid comparison with Mel-
bourne/Sydney, the biggest cities in
Australia, is San Francisco/Los
Angeles. In 1979 the return air fare for
the latter was $5O. What is it today?
W. WOOTTEN Esq
Sydney NS W
Correspondent Wootten has a point.
The present “full” single economy airfare
between Los Angeles and San Francisco
(a distance of 542 km) is SUSB9 with
United Airlines. Using an exchange rate
of $A = USB5c, that’s $A104.70 or 19.3 c
a km. The Sydney-Melbourne single
economy fare is $140.90 over 707 km or
19.9 c a km. So, on the face of it, there’s
not much in it but, since deregulation in
the United States, nobody pays the full
fare and discounts on regular services are
commonly up to 30 percent and more.
The stand-by fare Sydney-Melbourne, at
$ll3, is 16c/km. Ed.

better than most Euro
New Toyota Camry
better than most Euro
After pushing new Toyota Camry through a course
of witches hats, one thing will be obvious.
It handles like you're driving something sophis-
ticated and expensive from Europe.
All you need do is take a look underneath Camry
and you'll discover why.
You see, the new Camry has gas pressure shock
absorbers at the front and fully independent suspension.
With the control of rack and pinion steering and
front wheel drive.
ALL VERY ADVANCED. ALL VERY SPORTY.
And better than a lot of other cars with similar
features. That's because Camry's advanced features are
specially tuned to work together in complete harmony.
The result is new Camry now handles even better
than the previous model that won Car of 'B3.
So even though Camry is a family car, you could be
excused for actually enjoying a winding mountain road.
You could even be excused for
enjoying Camry on the open road.
After all - you do have a Super
Responsive 2 litre engine with elec-
SUPER RESPONSIVE
tronic fuel injection under your right foot.
SOMETHING THIS MUCH FUN
IS PRACTICAL TOO.
So you've had your fun and you start to pack up your
witches hats.
And before long anotherthing will become obvious.

Camry's space and luggage capacity is totally unlike
most European family sports.
With a big hatchback and split folding rear seats,
Camry's capacity for a family and their luggage is enor-
mous. And anything that enormous is just the right size
for a family.
NEW CAMRY IS A CAR THAT CAN WEAR
MANY HATS.
Camry now has more luxury appointments.
There's a new tilt steering column for a more
comfortable driving position.
Further improvements have been made in-
side with a redesigned dash and seats with new cloth
upholstery.
The result is a more plush interior with more comfort
for driver and passenger alike.
Camry will hold the road as well as most European
family sports. Then hold your family with a lot more ease.
So Camry further builds on its unique reputation.
The perfect combination of European luxury, inno-
vation and finesse with the practicality of a Japanese car.
So if you have a family and you still love to drive, new
Camry has been built for you.

Oh what a feeling!


skilful and as aggressive as men” (B,
September 11: “New frontier looms for
women’s rights”). Professor Bryson can-
not accept a biological truth that
women are not “as strong, as skilful and
as aggressive as men.” Her perceptions
are limited if she does not realise that
most women do not even aspire to that
“equality.” Such “research” papers as
hers are just part of the boring, predict-
able and, now, desperate attempts by
“feminist activists” (her words) to main-
tain the momentum of their “calls for
action” calls unheeded and
unneeded.
Should Professor Bryson wish to
compete “equally” with men, let her go
to East Germany or Russia where I am
sure they will oblige with a course of
anabolic steroids. But I assume that her
“action” is purely academic and verbal.
“Equal opportunity” is now seen for
what it is: the aggressive attempt by a
minority to vent their hostility against
their male “oppressors.” The catchcalls
of “opportunity, rights, discrimination”
are just misused arguments to try to
cloud the judgments and quell the rising
indignation of normal, decent Austra-
lians.
I applaud the call for an open Olym-
pics very few women would make the
qualifying times! Or, like “affirmative
action,” would the professor have us
handicap men?

Victoria’s Liberals
Tim Duncan’s look at the Victorian Lib-
eral Party (B, September 11) was spot
on there is a pall of gloom and no one
really believes Kennett is capable of
leading it out of the wilderness.
But Duncan misreads the Young
Liberals, particularly those who operate
in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. True,
they do function as a giant singles bar
and there are many of us who believe all
they deserve is each other.
In the dirty tricks department, they
are masters and mistresses. The
party’s trendies use them to stack
branches, turn the rumor mill and gen-
erally destroy those they perceive as be-
ing right-wing and traditional.
The Victorian Liberal Party needs a
massive purge before it can be taken
seriously and the first on the list should
be the Young Libs.

Balance in question
The Bulletin is a magazine with a long
tradition of journalistic excellence. The
article written by Denis Reinhardt on
the sugar industry (August 21) is an un-
fortunate departure from this high stan-
dard.
I was interviewed for and quoted in


the report. I am not inexperienced in
being interviewed by journalists, nor do
I strain at gnats. On a most generous as-
sessment, however, your journalist has
combined portions of my comments
with his own interpretations and
opinions in a way which makes it diffi-
cult to discern the difference. The ulti-
mate effect is to destroy both balance
and the facts.

Biological controls
Several years ago, our Society warned
the previous federal government that
their plans for a massive media cam-
paign on quarantine would serve no
useful purpose and could do a great
deal of harm.
Travellers coming to this country are
well aware of quarantine regulations.
However, the media campaign would
serve a dangerous purpose in showing
anti-social individuals how our agricul-
ture could be severely damaged by in-
troducing a pest plant, animal or dis-
ease.
The article by Graeme O’Neill (B,
September 11) on the introduction of
blackberry rust indicates at least one
person has already learned the trick.
The solution lies in the comment made
by Graeme O’Neill that “the basic prob-
lem is that many landowners are fed up
with what they see as interminable de-
lays.”
Much of the delay is due to the lack
of scientists working on biological con-
trols. The recent cutback in federal
spending on science is a tragic mistake.
Scientific work is not a drain on the
public purse but in both the short and
long run can lead to massive increases
both in our standards of living and
quality of life.

Dreams up in smoke
Please relay a message to Bert Kelly
(The Modest Farmer, B, September 11)
so he can warn Fred of his unrealistic
expectations about buying a tobacco
farm.
Firstly, let Fred know he was wrong
in thinking tobacco-growers receive a
subsidy from government of $25,000 per
farm. He might consider secondly, if it
is so lucrative growing tobacco on the
alleged subsidy, why 30 percent of
tobacco-growers have left the industry
in the past 10 years.
The only government subsidy
received by the tobacco industry is a
contribution toward research.
So, Bert, Treasury know they could
not save $l3 million by your scheme be-
cause they do not pay it now.
Before 90,000 woolgrowers become
excited about a massive increase in ex-
ports to the United States of America,
they should be warned of a few facts.
Eliminating restrictions on tobacco
coming into Australia will not open the
floodgates for American tobacco and
cause an increase in demand for Austra-
lian wool in the USA.
Sure, the Americans use it as an ex-
cuse for not taking more wool. The fact
is, their tobacco is no longer in demand
either for quality of presentation or
price. In the 19605, 70 percent of Aus-
tralian imports came from the USA,
today, the percentage is less than 50.
Tobacco manufacturers can import
tobacco from Brazil, Zimbabwe, Ma-
lawi, Korea, Philippines, etc at half the
price of USA tobacco. If more tobacco
were to enter Australia, it would prob-
ably come from these sources.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Pressure on Peacock
FEDERAL opposition leader
Andrew Peacock was under
increasing pressure to “put up
or shut up” after he made
serious allegations against
Prime Minister Bob Hawke in
the House of Representatives.
Peacock alleged that Hawke
was “a crook,” a “perverter of
the law” and “one who associ-
ates with criminals and takes
his orders from those who di-
rect those criminals.” The sub-
sequent criticism of Peacock
came from within even his
own Liberal Party.
• See story Page 30
Senate censure
THE combined federal Oppo-
sition and Australian Demo-
crats in the Senate censured
Resources and Energy minis-
ter Senator Peter Walsh for
“deliberately misleading the
Senate by his selective tabling
of documents.” It was the first
such Senate action since 1974
when the then Foreign Minis-
ter, Senator Don Willesee,
was censured.
Clive Evatt dead
ONE OF Australia’s best-
known jurists, former Labor
politician Clive Raleigh Evatt,
QC, youngest brother of the
late “Doc” Evatt, died, aged
84, at the Sacred Heart Hospi-
tal in Darlinghurst, Sydney.
He had been a patient for the
past 18 months. His son Clive
Evatt Jr and daughters Justice
Elizabeth Evatt and Penelope
Seidler survive him.
Poison arrest
POLICE in Geelong arrested
a 20-year-old apprentice elec-
trician over threats to poison
the town’s water supply. He
was charged with blackmail
and demanding money with
threats to endanger life. He
was detained after a phone
tip-off to police.
Tax-dodging report
ABOUT 6000 companies had
avoided paying some $2.5 bil-
lion in taxes, said special in-
vestigator into tax avoidance
(“bottom-of-the-harbor”)
schemes Roger Gyles, QC, in
his second report to the feder-
al government. But, said the
report, the figure would be
very much higher if other
schemes were taken into ac-
count. Following release of
the report, the Taxation Office
announced moves to collect
tax not recouped by the
Fraser government.
Harsher laws
THE federal government an-
nounced up to tenfold in-
creases of penalties for
breaches of taxation laws.
Fines for the most common
tax offence failure to fur-
nish information to the com-
missioner are to be raised
from between $4 and $2OO to
$2OOO for a first offence. A sec-
ond offence, if committed
within five years, will carry a
fine of $4OOO and a third
$5OOO or one year’s imprison-
ment for an individual and
$25,000 for a company.
Bomb ‘guinea pigs’
A REPRESENTATIVE of
the British Nuclear Test Vet-
erans Association, Geoffrey
Robertson, appearing before
the royal commission into
British nuclear testing in Aus-
tralia (sitting in Adelaide),
said the British government
had used Australian civilians
and servicemen and British
soldiers as “guinea pigs” to
Meeting the people: Pope John Paul II with a Quebec Indian
test the effects of exposure to
high levels of radiation on hu-
mans. The commission was
told that the British govern-
ment would deny the claims.
Banking licences
FEDERAL Treasurer Paul
Keating announced the gov-
ernment’s decision to call for
applications for an unspeci-
fied number of new banking
licences. Applications close
on November 23 and cabinet
decisions on them are ex-
pected early next year.

Pope in Canada
POPE John Paul II continued
his tour of Canada. About
500,000 people attended an
open-air mass in Toronto and
heard the pontiff assert that
technology had to be man’s

New ministers
SOUTH AFRICA’S new
Executive President, Pieter
Botha, appointed the first two
non-whites to a South African
cabinet. They were the Rever-
end Allan Hendrickse, leader

chamber. For the time being,
they have not been assigned to
any special duties.

Jakarta’s port area of Tanjung
Priok fired on thousands of
Moslem youths trying to
.march to the local police
headquarters to free four men
held there for beating a securi-

Gromyko for US talks
PRESIDENT Reagan an-
nounced to an unscheduled
press conference that Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko had accepted an in-
vitation for talks “on a range
of issues of international im-

invitation, said the president,
to ease “suspicion and hostil-
ity” and “maybe convince
him (Gromyko) that the
United States means no
harm.”

Judges fear court at risk
in the Murphy affair
Pre-election mud-slinging in federal parliament has coincided with fears held by judges that
the standing of the High Court could suffer from side-effects of allegations involving
Justice Lionel Murphy.
ANTHONY HILL
reports on the building tensions and concerns.
JUDGES of the High Court are be-
coming increasingly worried about the
long-term effects on the court’s public
standing of the welter of allegations in-
volving Justice Lionel Murphy.
While the seven judges have had no
formal discussions about the many im-
plications, they are known to be con-
cerned that the court is being dragged
into the political arena. Whatever the
outcome of the present issues, they fear
that the court’s reputation for impartial-
ity and detachment from the political
process runs a real risk of being
damaged in the public mind.
It is not merely a question of
Murphy being “invited” to give evi-
dence about his behaviour, before a sen-
ate select committee at public hearings
due to start in Canberra on October 1.
(This, in itself, is unprecedented: Never
before has a federal judge been asked to
answer before a parliamentary commit-
tee allegations about his conduct.
Whether Murphy will appear is still un-
certain.)
Of equal concern is the sight of the
judge’s name being flung about both the
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives by politicians engaged in the
offensive mud-slinging that ac-
companies the run-up to most election
campaigns.
Did Mrs Murphy buy a diamond
from Perth financier Christo Moll? This
suggestion was denied categorically by
the judge in a statement read to the Sen-
ate in which he said the story was “a
continuation of a disgraceful campaign
of defamation by The Age, now directed
against my wife.”
Federal National Party leader lan
Sinclair asked in a question on notice in
the House if Murphy, as attorney-gener-
al, had had any involvement in the
downgrading of customs surveillance
on a man who has been named in the
New South Wales parliament as a crime
figure.
And Liberal frontbencher Steele
Hall asked whether prime ministerial
advisor Peter Barron had had talks with
The Senate committee: from left: Senators Bolkus, Tate, Haines and Lewis
Age editor Creighton Burns over any
material relating to a Swiss safety-de-
posit box held jointly by a judge of the
High Court and Miss Junie Morosi.
Both Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Burns said that Barron had not.
With such political “dead cats”
bursting on the parliamentary land-
scape, it is not surprising that both the
government and the court are alarmed
that the dignity of the institution may be
impaired.
Murphy is not the first High Court
judge to find himself savaged in the par-
liament. Former Liberal attorney-gen-
eral and Chief Justice Sir Garfield
Barwick was attacked by the then Labor
Opposition over advice to Governor-
General Sir John Kerr in the days be-
fore the dismissal of the Whitlam gov-
ernment in 1975.
In this sense, the High Court has
scarcely been out of the political arena
for the past nine years. It is now being
asked whether there ought to be any
more senior judicial appointments from
among practising politicians.
In this respect, the arrangements for
the public hearings of the Senate select
committee into the allegations against
Murphy are an attempt to move the in-
vestigation a step away from the politi-
cal arena.


At one stage, it was thought that the
sessions would be in the Hinkler Build-
ing, a short walk across parkland from
Parliament House. But all outside
venues with enough space to accommo-
date the expected large press contingent
have been booked. The hearings will be
in Senate committee rooms one and
two, on the lower floor of Parliament
House. In the event of an overflow of
spectators, an audio system will be put
into committee room three.
At least the hearings will not be con-
ducted in the Senate chamber itself.
This is partly because the Senate will be
sitting and partly because of a sense of
the proprieties.
The four-member committee will set
a precedent by having two assistant
commissioners: Xavier Connor (66) and
John Wickham (65), both former
judges. The committee and the commis-
sioners will meet in Canberra for the
first time on Thursday of this week.
As another first, the committee will
have counsel to assist it, Theodore
Simos, QC, and counsel representing
the witnesses, will be able to examine
and cross-examine the witnesses. This is
to meet Murphy’s objections to the first
select committee that the hearings
should be held in public and his lawyers
have the right of cross-examination.
How long the public hearings will
take is not known. Seven sitting days
have been set aside from Monday,
October 1, until the following Sunday
if necessary. But it could be over within
two or three days, depending on the
number of witnesses called.
So far, only NSW Chief Magistrate
Clarrie Briese is listed to be summoned.
His allegations that Murphy may have
tried to influence the outcome of a court
case involving Sydney solicitor Morgan
Ryan led to the establishment of the sel-
ect committee.
Murphy will be invited but not com-
pelled to give evidence. Whether any
other witnesses are called will depend
on suggestions or requests either from
the assistant commissioners or from
counsel.
The committee will report to the Sen-
ate both on questions of fact arising
from Briese’s allegations and on
whether any conduct of Murphy’s may
have provided sufficient grounds for his
removal from office under section 72 of
the constitution. If the committee or
the full Senate - finds against him, the
next step likely would be a referral of
material to the Director of Public Pros-
ecutions, lan Temby, QC.
The government last week conceded
that Temby should not be asked to re-
port on the existing material pending
the outcome of the committee hearings.
The committee met for the first time
last week, in private, to plan the mech-
anics. It is chaired by Senator Michael
PUBLIC OPINION
Labor withstands the wrangling
THE INITIAL pre-election political
wrangling has not dented the federal
government’s lead in the public opinion
polls. Over the first two weekends in
September, Labor support stood at 50
percent while that of the coalition Op-
position had eased to 41 percent.
Opposition leader Andrew Peacock’s
approval rating slumped 3 points to 34
percent. Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s
dropped by 1 point to 68.
The support lost by the Opposition
went to “other” parties, backing for
which rose to 4 percent. Democrat sup-
port was stable at 5 percent.
Backing for Labor in the Senate rose
1 percent, to 47, with coalition support
falling by 1 point to 41.
If an election had been held early in
September, the Morgan Gallup Poll
finds, Labor would have retained its ma-
jority in the House and the Democrats
and independents would have held the
balance of power in the Senate.
Of all electors surveyed, 71 percent
(down 1) said they felt Hawke was the
better choice as prime minister while 17
percent (unchanged) preferred Peacock.
Of Liberal-National Party voters sur-
veyed, 46 percent (down 1) preferred
Hawke while 37 percent (unchanged)
said Peacock.

POLITICS
Peacock short
of ammunition
for showdown
By ALAN REID
Tate (Labor, Tas) who will have a cast-
ing vote. Other members are Senators
Nick Bolkus (Labor, SA), Austin Lewis
(Lib, Vic) and Janine Haines (Demo-
crat, SA).
They have until Thursday, October
11, to report. But, if the Senate is not
sitting or has risen for the election, the
report can be sent to Senate president
Douglas McClelland. In that case, it
would be deemed to have been pre-
sented to the Senate and would carry all
the rights of privilege.
This is normal Senate practice when
setting up select committees but some
doubts have been expressed as to
whether it will hold good if the Senate
has been dissolved or prorogued for an
election campaign. Does the Senate still
exist in such a case? And, if not, can
privilege attach to the documents? Most
parliamentary officials think that it does
but it is a debatable point which has
never been tested.
The Prime Minister is considering a
similar move in connection with the fi-
nal report of the Costigan royal com-
mission into the Painters and Dockers’
Union. Costigan now has until October
31 to finish his report.
Hawke told parliament last week
that he was committed to the “earliest
possible release” of its contents ... or at
least as much of them as can be made
public. If parliament were not still sit-
ting then, Hawke said, the government
would “seek to take such steps as will
permit the appropriate public release of
the report.” This could mean having it
tabled in the Victorian parliament. But
the federal parliament could pass a res-
olution allowing the report to be sent to
the presiding officers the speaker of
the House or the Senate president and
allowing its release under privilege.
Either way, Hawke said, his assess-
ment of the election timing would not
be influenced by evidence given to the
Senate select committee on the allega-
tions against Murphy. □
WITH the smell of a general election in
their nostrils, Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock are locked in a private feud as
well as a public one. The dislike that has
flared between the former good friends
is in part dictating their parliamentary
tactics. Each is out to damage the other
personally and, each hopes, irre-
trievably obviously in the belief that
the coming poll campaign will have a
strong “presidential” element.
The clash has become quite vicious.
To Hawke, Peacock is “that squalid op-
portunist” who adds stupidity to other
failings. Peacock refers slightingly to
“this man” and describes Hawke as a
liar, lacking in integrity and honesty,
preferring mateship to duty and suffer-
ing from an inflated ego.
Peacock knows that somehow he has
to damage the Hawke image which ac-
cording to public opinion polls has
enabled the Labor leader to enjoy a de-
gree of acceptance unmatched by any
other Australian politician. But despite
the vehemence with which he has as-
sailed Hawke, Peacock does not seem to
have had much effect as yet.
Hawke’s high poll ratings have con-
tinued. Rather than Peacock damaging
Hawke, it has been Hawke who has
damaged Peacock.
Deliberately, through the tactics of
denigration he has followed in the
House of Representatives, Hawke has
produced a situation in which doubts
have been raised about Peacock’s lead-
ership capacity doubts which, in turn,
have led to public speculation as to
whether deputy Liberal leader John
Howard will take over the helm if the
party rates indifferently at the general
election.
Hawke has a head start in the overall
election contest. He has quite a respect-
able amount of parliamentary “fat” to
begin with. In the 125-strong House, the
Australian Labor Party has a majority
of 25. Twenty-three extra seats are to be
contested at the next election. The ALP
looks a safe bet to take out up to 14 of
these new seats, meaning that Hawke’s
majority at election time effectively will
be nearer 30 than 25. He could lose 15
seats without losing government.
Failing a landslide and none seems
to be in prospect 15 seats is a large
An election near: Andrew Peacock on a vote-getting sweep through Sydney


order for an opposition to win at a
single poll.
Actually, if the opinion polls are any
guide, there could be a minor anti-Op-
position landslide.
Not that Hawke does not have his
weak areas. Medicare could be one.
ALP members are uneasy that feel-
ings of resentment about Medicare may
bite into their majorities. Rumbles in
their electorates suggest that voters are
hostile because they are paying more for
Medicare than they expected to pay
when the government first introduced
the scheme.
The assets test on pensioners also is
causing some concern. Many pension-
ers are against the test and their votes
are reasonably important. Pensioners
these days are a sizeable section of the
voting community.
In some electorates, too,
the debate on Asian migration
into Australia compared with
that of Europeans has
produced an issue which is a
possible “sleeper.”
Then there are the continu-
ing allegations of corruption
in NSW charges which
could rub olf on the Hawke
government if they were es-
tablished, especially as his
powerbase is the right-wing
NSW ALP machine.
At this stage, however,
none of these issues appears
to be sufficiently momentous
to threaten the Hawke elec-
toral ascendancy.
In the big issue the econ-
omy Hawke is in front. And
it is the economy and the pub-
lic assessment of how it is be-
ing managed which probably
will decide the outcome of the
national poll.
Hawke undoubtedly has
been lucky.
The drought which had
plagued the final years of the Fraser
government broke soon after Hawke
won office in March last year. The
United States economy also picked up,
with a consequent improvement from
which Australia has benefited in the
world situation.
On the home front and Hawke
claims, with seeming justification, that
this was due to good management
rather than to good fortune employ-
ment increased, interest rates fell, un-
employment flattened out, there was a
home-building revival, industrial
troubles were few and business showed
signs of becoming more profitable.
Some observers have expressed the
view that the improvement is fragile,
that the economy is going to be weaken-
ing next year and that the Hawke gov-
ernment will not be able to bring down
another budget with tax cuts and a re-
duction in the deficit. That may be so.
Next year may be testing for Australia
but my experience is that voters pass
their judgments on what is rather than
on what might be. And, if that assertion
is correct, Hawke is very much in the
box seat and looks likely to stay there
failing some catastrophic blunder.
Peacock needs any break to come
while parliament is sitting. Hawke is
good on the hustings and on TV but he
is not a good parliamentary performer.
He appears to have little feeling for
parliament as an institution. He uses it
mostly as a forum, mainly to abuse Pea-
cock and the Liberals. Hawke controls
the House because he controls the ALP
majority but he cannot dominate it.
There are more interjections to a
Hawke speech than there are repetitions
and there are plenty of those. Never-
theless, Peacock cannot get the upper
hand, even occasionally, in the way
Gough Whitlam could get on top of
John Gorton and Billy McMahon.
Peacock has not got much back-up
on the Opposition benches. He is fortu-
nate in having Howard as an opening
batsman. Howard calm, logical, di-
rect of speech was among the parlia-
ment’s best debaters when he was
treasurer in the Fraser government and,
if anything, has improved in opposition.
Shadow Immigration minister Michael
Hodgman and Wilson Tuckey, a self-
made millionaire from the seat of
O’Connor in Western Australia, are two
rough and tough types who are useful in
a brawl and Alan Cadman from
Mitchell in NSW is a dogged fighter.
National Party leader lan Sinclair is
tough and able on his feet but seems to
have lost some of his fire since his col-
leagues Doug Anthony and Peter Nixon
have retired from the parliament.
Shadow Health spokesman Jim Carlton
can make a good case but the ranks thin
rapidly thereafter.
Hawke is not that much better served
on the ALP side. Treasurer Paul
Keating is an able performer in any
company. Deputy Prime Minister
Lionel Bowen is effective and fast on his
feet. Foreign Affairs minister Bill
Hayden is much more fluent and per-
suasive now than when he was ALP fed-
eral leader. Special Minister of State
Mick Young handles himself much
more ably on the floor of parliament
than ever he did in a carpark or a Cus-
toms hall. Deduct these and not much is
left except for a few such as Aviation
minister Kim Beazley and others who
have promise rather than achievement.
At this stage, it would seem that Pea-
cock needs a break in the order of some-
thing like a Petrov defection - a big
issue on which he and his followers
have overwhelming public support if
he hopes to defeat Hawke. □


VICTORIA
Budget nod to
an economy
back in business
Rob Jolly: his budget bears the trademark of confidence
By TIM DUNCAN
“COST consciousness” will be the key
phrase in the Cain government’s run up
to the election next March although
its third budget, brought down this week
by Treasurer Rob Jolly, is sufficiently
ambiguous to appeal to the social engin-
eers within the Australian Labor Party
through its parallel emphasis on boost-
ing employment.
Jolly told The Bulletin last week that
the rate of capital expenditure increase
this time round is less than in either of
his two previous budgets. “That fits in
comfortably with what is occurring in
the private sector,” he explained.
His budget bears the trademark of an
administration unruffled by opposition
and confident that its view of the world
is acceptable to the electorate at large.
It was an easy budget to put together.
The Victorian economy has lifted from
its depths of 1982, with the help of the
pump-priming public sector investment
that derived from last year’s expan-
sionary state budget.
Because state revenues from sources
such as payroll tax rose in line with the
increase in economic activity and be-
cause a whole range of new taxes and
charges was introduced last year to bal-
ance the expansionary budget, there
was no need for the government to risk
making itself unpopular by raising taxes
again this year.
For the March election, the govern-
ment has taken the opportunity to bring
down a “Steady as she goes” budget
with all its general overtones of reassur-
ance and administrative stability. The
massive fiscal expansion of the past two
years, during which time the Victorian
public sector has been used to compen-
sate for the failings of the Victorian pri-
vate sector, appears to be over.
The budget does not usher in an era
of contraction for the Victorian public
sector. Rather, it proclaims that the pub-
lic sector will grow more slowly.
Its tax relief measures include pay-
roll tax adjustments that the govern-
ment says will assist more than 4500
companies, mainly small to medium
ones. Stamp duty on workers’ compen-
sation premiums has been reduced
while land taxes for holdings of small to
medium-sized businesses have been ad-
justed favorably.
The tax relief is by no means spec-
tacular and much of it amounts to freez-
ing taxes and charges in real terms,
which could be defined as relief relative
to the movements of the past two years.
As it was explained to The Bulletin , the
budget does not pretend to provide
many real cuts in either revenues or ex-
penditure.
Recurrent expenditure expansion is
also fairly modest. The emphasis this
year is on the public hospital system
which has received more staff funding,
and on the tertiary and further educa-
tion sector, with increased capacity to
train apprentices.
This is not going to be an easy budget
for an Opposition to exploit.
Admitting that this third budget was
very much a creature of its predecessors,
Jolly adds that massive expansion can-
not be sustained year in year out. But he
argues that the high capital spending
has been the driving force in Victorian
economic strategy and he would like to
keep it that way.
Jolly is not new to economics. Unlike
the two most recent federal Treasurers,
Paul Keating and John Howard, he did
not learn the jargon on the job.
He took out an honors degree in
Economics at Monash University where
he was influenced by lan Ward and
Brian Brogan (who became Gough
Whitlam’s economic adviser in 1972).
Jolly well remembers American econ-
omist Harry Johnson who was visiting
Monash when Jolly tutored there.
Johnson, a conservative neo-classical
economist, often said things with which
Jolly disagreed but he considers the
American to have been the most brilli-
ant economist there and remembers
Johnson explaining that United States
spending in Vietnam was a major
source of the inflation which ravaged
the international economy early in the
19705.
The member for Dandenong since
1979, Jolly went into politics from the
Australian Council of Trade Unions.
He was Bob Hawke’s industrial advo-
cate for many years.
During the 19705, Jolly took out a
masters degree in economics from
Monash and joined the advisory board
of the Institute of Applied Economic
and Social Research at Melbourne Uni-
versity where he came into close contact
with Dr Peter Sheehan, now permanent
secretary of Jolly’s Department of Man-
agement and Budget.
He was taught at Dandenong High
by Barry Jones, now federal minister for
Science and Technology. “He (Jones)
told me all about how the judge in the
Dreyfus case had a bad case of piles
which was why he held only short sit-
tings. I can always remember that. Very
colorful teacher, Barry was.”
Jolly cannot remember having a
weekend off since Easter and he sees his
three daughters mainly at breakfast. He
is a jogger and, despite advice from his
sedentary Treasury staff, plans to run
the Big M marathon this year. Never-
theless, politics seems to have prohib-
ited him from indulging in his chief out-
side interest harness racing.
Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.
Moonee Valley patrons might otherwise
hear more of the No Risk syndicate,
named by Jolly out of inspiration from
the Victorian State Bank advertising
campaign. They might also hear of more
pacing nags such as Jolly’s first, Fabian
Flyer, or his current “shows lots of
promise” Mod Fin Man for modern
financial management. □


RETAILING
Rift among
consumers over
price scanning
By ANTHONY HILL
THERE IS A RIFT in the consumer
movement over the use of new technol-
ogy, particularly electronic price scan-
ners, in retailing. At its core are moves
in Victoria and the Australian Capital
Territory to make price-marking com-
pulsory on all items for sale.
The use of electronic scanners, which
“read” black bars marked on
goods, means the goods for
sale do not have to bear price
tags. A voluntary code of eth-
ics requires only that prices be
shown on Bcm by 2cm tags
fixed to store shelves. Prices
are stored in a computer
memory bank and are regis-
tered as the scanner reads the
bars.
According to the ACT con-
sumer group Canberra Con-
sumers and to the Australian
Retailers Association, the
legislative proposals to com-
pel individual pricing display
“a luddite mentality” and a
return to “the horse and
buggy days.”
But the Australian Feder-
ation of Consumer Organisa-
tions (AFCO) and most other
consumer groups angrily re-
ject the charge, saying that
customers are being “bludg-
eoned” into losing their price
consciousness.
AFCO president Robin
Brown said: “We are not doc-
trinaire or luddites. We do see
long-term benefits from the
new technology. But, to pro-
tect the less privileged mem-
bers of the community, we
would like to see item pricing main-
tained.”
The electronic bar codes were in-
troduced to Australia about three years
ago from the United States. Most manu-
facturers and big retailers use them for
stock control and product numbering
but the goods are still priced individual-
ly and run up manually at the check-out
counter. About 80 stores throughout the
country, however, are using the bar
codes to their full potential. The code is
passed over a laser scanner on the coun-
ter which transmits the information to
the store computer. The computer regis-
ters the description and price and issues
a detailed receipt.
The retailers say the system is more
efficient, is quicker for the customer go-
ing through the check-out, reduces the
margin of error for over- or under-
charging and adds to higher turnover.
While people are no longer employed
on price marking, retailers say there has
been no overall drop in employment.
Extra staff have been put on at the
check-outs, shelf-packing and in office
work.
“Scanning codes have been well-ac-
cepted by the Australian consumer,”
says Australian Retailers Association
deputy national director Alan Mc-
Kenzie. “This is the ultimate test how
many people you can attact through
your check-out.”
Brown concedes that his position is
The new technology: a bar code scanner in a supermarket
“reasonably conservative.” But he adds:
“We recognise the potential benefits
of the system, particularly for stock
control. “Yet we do believe that a sub-
stantial proportion of the community
will lose price consciousness if individ-
ual price marking is removed. AFCO is
not at all convinced that the savings of
doing away with individual pricing are
all that significant.”
These arguments are behind the
moves to reintroduce legislation in the
Victorian parliament to compel individ-
ual price marking and also behind pro-
posals by Territories and Local Govern-
ment minister Tom Uren to bring down
an ordinance in the ACT.
The Canberra move is aimed at the
territory’s only scanning store, Can-
non’s Food Barn, in the industrial sub-
urb of Fyshwick.
While Uren is being backed by Ken
Doyle, chairman of the local House of
Assembly’s consumer committee, he is
opposed by Canberra Consumers the
only AFCO member so far unequiv-
ocally to support the code scanning
system.
Canberra Consumers’ chairman Ray
Lehrer said: “It is an ideological men-
tality you are trying to fight here.
“There are problems with the elec-
tronics coming in but you have to look
at the new technology in new ways.
“They are trying to over-protect the
customers. They say the housewife will
forget the prices by the time
she gets to the check-out . ..
but they overlook the detailed
description on the receipt.”
Under the voluntary code
worked out 18 months ago be-
tween the Australian Retailers
Association and a working
party representing state and
federal consumer affairs min-
isters, prices in the store com-
puters can be changed only
outside trading hours. This is
to prevent variations between
the shelf price and the check-
out.
But, according to Doyle,
surveys by the Knox Prices
Action Group in Melbourne
show “an incredibly large er-
ror rate” between the shelf
price and the computer price.
He told the local assembly
that a brand of cakes marked
at 99 cents was recorded at
$2.59 and baked beans listed
at 36 cents went through at 56
cents.
Errors also work in the
customers’ favor, of course.
Michael Cannon, whose fam-
ily runs the Canberra scan-
ning store, says the error rate
is much lower than it would
be under the manual check-
out system.
Queensland Consumers’ Association
secretary Molly Robson says the code
scanners are part of a “psychological
ploy” to reduce price awareness among
customers.
While profits have risen, this has not
been reflected in a corresponding drop
in prices and she says employment in
the scanning stores has not increased at
the same rate as turnover.
With individual price-marking,
Robson says, it is possible for customers
to keep tabs on price rises over a period.
Without it, she says, consumers “lose
the ability to control what is going on
around them.” □


QUEENSLAND
Hinze frustrated
over wider
racing inquiry
By DENIS REINHARDT
QUEENSLAND Racing minister Russ
Hinze wants a wider inquiry into the
Fine Cotton affair because of his strong
suspicions about rigging in at lease two
other events. In one, a gal-
loper which since has disap-
pointed punters bitterly won
after a heavy betting plunge.
However, with more ar-
rests expected in the Fine Cot-
ton ring-in case, opinion
remains divided within
state cabinet about a wider in-
vestigation.
The first court hearings in
Brisbane of conspiracy
charges against five men ar-
rested in connection with
“Fine Cotton” will not be
held until October 16, thereby
preventing debate in the
Queensland parliament under
the speaker’s interpretation of
standing orders relating to sub
judice matters.
111-fated Queensland Turf
Club inquiries drew to a close
with an indefinite adjourn-
ment last Wednesday and a
statement by QTC chairman
and former Supreme Court
judge Sir Edward Williams
that “the public can be as-
sured every reasonable step
will be taken to prevent any
further attempt at horse sub-
stitution.”
Hinze has support both in-
side cabinet and on the Oppo-
sition benches but a fortnight
ago he was able to gather the
backing of only Industry min-
ister Mike Ahern and one
other cabinet member for a
full judicial inquiry. Although
Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was
absent, leading a trade delega-
tion in Europe, his deputy re-
layed the Premier’s opposi-
tion to such an inquiry.
The morning cabinet met,
Queensland police an-
nounced the laying of the first
charges against horse trainer
Hayden Haitana. Hinze felt
that he had been out-
manoeuvred.
Another question Hinze is
understood to want answered
is why stewards intervened
only after “Fine Cotton” had run the
race. If they had done so before it, bets
would not have been forfeited to book-
makers but could have been traced
through their sheets.
Hinze is flying in the face of cabinet
lore against commissions of inquiry.
“Why would we have a judicial in-
quiry because, regardless of what terms
of reference were set down, it would
drag on? Maybe it would end up not as
an inquiry into ‘Fine Cotton’ but into
horse racing in Queensland and the
Premier doesn’t want that,” one senior
cabinet source told The Bulletin. □

AWARDS
Film pessimism
proves to
be premature
By SANDRA HALL
AROUND this time last year, the Aus-
tralian film industry was predicting a
dim future for itself after yet more
changes to the legislation governing
concessions for film investors.
The pessimism was premature. The
1984 financial year ended with invest-
ment money flowing freely and 14
features and 23 short films and
documentaries competing for the Aus-
tralian Film Institute’s annual awards to
be made next month.
The finalists have just been an-
nounced. There are four contenders for
Best Film Strikebound, Richard Low-
enstein’s elegantly accomplished ac-
count of a South Gippsland coal strike
of the 1920 s and its effects on the miners
and their families; Annie’s Coming Out,
Film Australia’s production based on
the story of the cerebral palsy sufferer
Anne McDonald, her therapist Rose-
mary Crossley and their successful fight
to win Anne the right to take charge of
her own life; Silver City, Sophia
Turkiewicz’s story of a Polish girl who
arrives in Australia as a post-war refu-
gee; and My First Wife, Paul
Cox’s study of the collapse of
a marriage.
None of these four is likely
to set the box-office afire but
they are all sharply individu-
alistic films about strong sub-
jects, giving healthy indica-
tions that Australian cinema
is finally broadening its range.
Two of them may be period
pictures but they’re both a
long way from the languorous
pastorales and nostalgic
folksiness we have seen so
often before. Silver City is a
love story but, like Strike-
bound, it throws interesting
sidelights on critical aspects
of social history and national
character.
The feature nominations
are divided between nine
films. Up for Best Director are
Gil Brealey ( Annie’s Coming
Out), Cox, Turkiewicz and
Ken Cameron whose Fast
Talking is a quirkily naturalis-
tic film about a group of kids
in trouble with school, parents
and the law.

When you find the car that you always
wanted, life can get pretty exciting.
Particularly when the car has all the
trappings of a luxury car in an economy size.
All the verve and grace of a Rover.
All the economy reliability and high
resale value of the best imported Japanese cars.
And, best of all, a modest price tag of
$13,400.* (Which is about what you’d normally
pay for a Toyota Celica Hatchback, Mazda 626
Super Deluxe 5-Door, or aTelstarTXs Ghia.) **
As you can see, the Rover Quintet is really
something to get excited about.
The luxury in exciting detail.
When you discuss the Quintet, it’s best to
start with a long list of comforts and features,
and just tick them off.
Power steering. Electric windows. Electric
aerial. Twin remote control exterior mirrors.
Pioneer stereo radio/cassette.
Seats, doors and headrests beautifully
finished in crushed velour.
Carpet you’d be happy to have in your
home. (Even the load space is carpeted.)
Alloy wheels. Radial ply tyres.
Tachometer. Interior releases for the fuel filler
cap and rear hatch.
You’ll also find a 16-way warning light
display that lets you know if doors aren’t closed
properly or if a bulb has blown.
And warning chimes in case you leave
your lights on.
Electric sunroof and air conditioning are
attractive options.
Exciting Performance.
The Rover Quintet is surprisingly quick. f
More than a second quicker up to 100
km/h than the Camira SL/X 4-speed and the
Toyota Celica 5-speed 3-door.
The Quintet is also more economical,

Standard petrol at that.
The source of this remarkable perform-
ance is the Quintet’s highly efficient 1.6 litre,
4-cylinder engine with its overhead cam, alloy
cylinder head and its electronic ignition.
To cap it all off, the Quintet has cat-like
agility. With 4-wheel independent suspension
and front wheel drive.
Exciting but sensible.
For all its luxury and performance, the
Rover Quintet is also a surprisingly practical car.
It has four doors, a rear hatch and rear
seat backs that fold down independently.
It’s so well built, you’re assured of trouble-
free motoring.
(You only have to walk around the car to
see how well it all fits together.)
All in all, can you think of a more exciting
way to spend $13,400?*

BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR
51st try started great career
By GLENNYS BELL
KIM HARDING was turned down by
50 firms when she went looking for her
first job. It was heartrending but a major
challenge. Today, Harding is marketing
director for American Express, a
woman one of a small band who
has set her sights on the top in the cor-
porate world.
She also is a candidate this year for
The Bulletin-Qantas Business Woman of
the Year award. This year’s award is at-
tracting nominations of women of
many skills and occupations. Here, we
profile three of them.
HARDING began job-hunting in 1974.
She was a Bachelor of Com-
merce from the University of
NSW and had a university
medal (Lintas Prize) for the
student showing the greatest
proficiency during the degree
course. She was also job-hunt-
ing in the middle of a re-
cession. She says: “It was a
hard market but I had both
qualifications and work ex-
perience.” (She had worked
part-time as a motor vehicle
underwriter and a marketing
consultant for FIA In-
surances.) She just happened
to be the wrong sex. “Only
one in 20 students in com-
merce was a woman at the
time. Firms had a vision of a
tall man in the job,” she says.
Eventually she got a job
with Mauri Bros & Thomson
as manager of its PMU Dis-
tributing Division, looking
after products including im-
ported tinned salmon and
concentrated orange juice.
In 1975, she joined
Kimberly Clark as senior
product manager in charge of
feminine hygiene products.
Her product “was the poor re-
lation of the company. It was
losing money, the sales force had limit-
ed product knowledge and gave no in-
store service. The market share was 15
percent.”
Within a year, the market share was
48 percent. Behind the increase was her
developing expertise and experience in
marketing: “Segmentation of the mar-
ketplace, a strategy of differentiation,
aggression and innovation, sales force
training and motivation, appealing
packaging and advertising, and a new
product developed to satisfy a market
gap.”
She joined Heuga Australia, the car-
pet manufacturer, in 1978. She under-
Kim Harding: “I’m not a workaholic. I don’t live to work”
ROBERT DORAN
took a marketing audit for the company
to determine where it was going, where
it should be going and how to get there.
She was also offered the opportunity to
work at its head office in Amsterdam,
Holland, but decided that her future
was not with carpets.
Instead, she studied the market, con-
sidering which companies could expect
to grow and whether she could grow
with them: “When I investigated the
growth opportunities for industry over
the next 10 years, it was obvious the ser-
vice industries offered great potential
and the multinationals offered great
range. So I looked for a multinational
service industry.”
At the same time, in 1980,
American Express was look-
ing for a marketing director.
Harding got the job. She had
two staff members to help her
in marketing and the com-
pany had 170,000 card-hold-
ers. Harding’s job was to ex-
pand services and gain new
members.
Membership now stands at
500,000 and she has a staff of
30.
She has concentrated on
cards for women. In 1982, of
the 500,000 women qualified
to be card-holders, only one
in 20 were members. Today,
the figure is one in six.
But her interest is more
than financial. She has be-
come a regular speaker and
advocate for women’s ad-
vancement in the business
world, talking to groups such
as the Australian Institute of
Management or to seminars
such as the recent one or-
ganised by Women in Man-
agement called Targeting for
the Top.
Harding works a long day,
from 7am to 7pm, but she


Diane Holuigue: a major influence on food in Australia
says: “I’m not a workaholic. I don’t live
to work.” She has her hobbies yacht-
ing is one. She also runs her own con-
sultancy business with clients not in
conflict with American Express, such
as food and paper companies. “It’s
financially rewarding and it keeps me
learning,” she says.
DIANE HOLUIGUE, nee Nicholls, has
all the qualifications to run one of the
best-known cooking schools in Austra-
lia. She developed an early love of all
things French, most of all French food,
found herself a French husband and set
up The French Kitchen in Melbourne.
After studying for an Arts degree at
Melbourne University, she was briefly a
geography teacher but decided to study
the subject at first hand and travelled
around Europe studying Cordon Bleu
in Paris and London.
She and her husband, Gerard, mar-
ried in France and came to Australia to
make their life here. Diane did their
cooking and friends admired her food
so much they suggested she start teach-
ing them. Thus, 15 years ago, The
French Kitchen began in the kitchen of
the Holuigue house. It has stayed there
ever since, though it has expanded
somewhat like the souffles Holuigue
demonstrates. She started with just one
assistant Hugette Quennoy, now her
main teacher but now there are five,
with outside chefs brought in for
specialist dishes.
She has enticed overseas experts,
some of the greatest chefs in the world,
Anne Symons: “a policy of persuasion”
to visit Australia to demonstrate their
skills. Among them have been Joel
Bellouet, of Le Notre in Paris, the
creme de la creme of pastry, confection-
ery and chocolate making, and Italian
chef Guilano Bugialli.
Her own classes, for about 20 stu-
dents, are held six to eight times a week.
Students sit on pews to watch the de-
monstrations. A course of six sessions
costs $l3O. The basic classes cover
classical French cooking but extra
classes can range from Thai cooking to
chocolate making.
Holuigue does not neglect Australian
chefs. This year she offered her students
a course titled “The Three Best Women
Chefs in Australia.” She brought Gay
Bilson from the Berowra Waters Inn,
near Sydney, Jenny Ferguson from You
and Me (Sydney) and Stephanie Alex-
ander from Stephanie’s in Melbourne.
Her peers in the cooking world ac-
knowledge Holuigue as one of the
major influences on food in Australia.
In a review of her cookbook The French
Kitchen , Joan Campbell, food editor for
Vogue Living , described her as a special-
ist with “hardly a rival in this country
. . . The French Kitchen ... is a wonder-
ful inspiration to beginner and experi-
enced cook alike.”
Over the years, Holuigue has been
awarded many honors. She is a Certi-
fied Member of the International As-
sociation of Cookery Schools and has
been made a Member of the Order of
Coteaux Champenois, the top honor of
French champagne vintners.
ANNE SYMONS,' when she was ap-
pointed personnel manager for Rheem
Australia Ltd, in Sydney, followed a
policy of persuasion she calls “Softly,
softly.” The company was not used to a
woman in an executive position. “I was
the only woman manager,” she says.
That was in 1980. A year later, the
person who recruited her left the com-
pany and she became corporate person-
nel manager.
Symons took it slowly, initially: “A
lot of the men in the company were at a
loss on how to deal with a female man-
ager because they hadn’t had one be-
fore. It was a bit of a challenge for me, a
matter of proving I could do the job and
come up with the goods. A case of per-
suasion.”
She had the background and experi-
ence, for both personnel and persua-
sion. She had graduated from the Aus-
tralian National University in Canberra
in Psychology and English and joined
the commonwealth public service in
1975 as a graduate clerk. Under a rota-
tion program, she moved into various
positions, ending up as Officer in
Charge in the Human Relations section
of the Department of Productivity in
Adelaide.
In the normal course of events, her
next promotion would have taken her to
Canberra but she decided it was not her
city and she did not feel the public ser-
vice was her future. In 1980, she applied
for and was given the job at Rheem.
Her responsibilities now cover
salaries, staff and personnel develop

doubled when Rheem acquired the
dishwater and heater appliance com-
pany Vulcan Industries.
For Symons, it means expanding one
of her particular interests, her “hobby
horse” of staff development. Rheem is
also conscious of the government’s
affirmative action policy and Symons,
with fitting new employees into the
company structure, has plenty to keep
her busy. But she has also reached the
stage where she is beginning to think
about her own development. “There are
two choices,” she explains. “I can either
stay in the personnel area and develop
that or I can gain new skills so I can
move into more general roles within

MIGRATION
People’s needs
come before
economics
By ANTHONY HILL
GOVERNMENT immigration policy
has switched over the past two years
from an economic rationale to a hu-
manitarian one, according
to the Immigration and Eth-
nic Affairs minister, Stewart
West.
West told The Bulletin the
new policy emphasis did not
necessarily mean “massive
economic disbenefits,” since
these migrants would raise de-
mand for goods and services
especially housing.
“Every three or four mi-
grants that come in generate
demand for one extra dwell-
ing,” West said in an inter-
view. “Whether they have a
job or not, they will be look-
ing for housing either in the
public or private sector.
“And the most obvious dis-
advantage initial high un-
employment has to be set
against the capital they bring
in. In 1981-82, the 118,000
settler arrivals brought $650
million in capital inflow an
average of $20,000 for each
application.” (The average a
person is just over $5OOO but
one application can involve a
family group.)
The problem is that the
1981-82 figures included
75,000 arrivals in the business, skilled
labor and employer nominee categories.
This is the group you would expect
to have substantial capital savings to
transfer.
But this is the group in which there
has been the biggest reduction in the mi-
grant intake, as the emphasis has
switched to the family reunion program.
West told parliament recently: “We
had the sorry spectacle of migrants giv-
ing up secure jobs in their home
countries and coming here in good faith
only to find their skills were no longer
required.
“Over time, I anticipate that the need
for the skilled worker intake will re-
duce. In the short term, we will continue
to need some skilled migrants.
“But, as our training institutions im-
prove their planning, the only need for
skilled migrants should be in the highly
specialised areas currently catered for
by the Employer Nomination Scheme.”
Under the Occupational Share Sys-
tem introduced this year, only 24 of the
50 designated occupations have been al-
located a share for skilled migrant re-
cruitment this financial year. Numbers
will total about 7500. In addition, there
will be 4000 employer nominees al-
lowed and 4000 business migrants out
of a total immigration of 74,000.
The family migration program will
take in 42,000 new settlers with 16,000
people entering under the refugee and
humanitarian policy guidelines.
The following table shows what has
Stewart West: “need for skilled worker intake will reduce”
happened in Australia’s immigration
program over the past six years and pro-
jections for 1984-85.
Year Family Refugees Skilled
78- 17,200 13,400 38,000
79- 18,300 19,900 42,900
80- 19,500 21,800 69,700
81- 21,700 21,900 75,000
82- 26,900 17,000 49,100
83- 33,900 14,700 21,000
84- 42,000 16,000 15,500
The figures show clearly that, while
the migrant intake has dropped con-
siderably since the peak of 1981-82,
there has been a turnaround in the pro-
portions between the family and labor
skill categories.
In 1981-82, the business/skilled
labor component was 63 percent of the
total intake. Last year it was 30 percent
and this year it is expected to drop to 21
percent.
At the same time, the family migra-
tion program has risen from 18 percent
of the intake in 1981-82 to 48.5 percent
last year and is expected to reach 56.7
percent this year.
The refugee program has shown little
movement in overall terms. From 18.4
percent of total migration in 1981-82 it
rose to 21.6 percent last year and this
year it will drop slightly to 21 percent.
It was on this basis that West pointed
to the changing emphasis in the migra-
tion program from an economic to a hu-
manitarian rationale.
He defends the decision to
raise the minimum capital re-
quirement for business mi-
grants from $250,000 to
$500,000, saying it is more
realistic.
“People were buying their
way into Australia with less
than $lOO,OOO to invest in a
business after paying for ac-
commodation,” he says.
“They said they were business
people but their capital was
nothing very much and often
they were ending up unem-
ployed.
“We don’t think the new
policy will have any effect on
the numbers themselves but
it will make it more effective
in getting employment for
Australian residents.”
Under the new guidelines,
business migrants must have a
business background and be
able to demonstrate their cre-
dentials in the field. Evidence
of net worth will have to be
sighted before a visa is issued
and they will have to have at
least $250,000 available to
transfer to Australia before
migrating. □

Good handling has tradition-
ally been thought of as the sole
domain of small sporty cars.
And ride comfort of
large luxury cars.
A situation that to
brings to mind the
verse,“never the
twain shall meet.”
| That is, until now.
) Instead of seeing
performance and
comfort as mutually
exclusive, today’s
drivers expect the best of both
in a new car.
Split personality.
Long stretches of open
highway. Coiled mountain passes.
Winding back roads. Driving
conditions and road surfaces are
as variable as the weather. And
just as unpredictable. Some
inspire sporty response, others a
smooth ride.
What was needed was a
suspension that would tame the

ITS ALWAYS BETTER THAN IT HAS TO BL
roughest roads without compromis-
ing ride comfort. An ability to adapt
that demanded a system like
Mazda’s exclusive Auto Adjusting
Suspension.
The hi-tech/hi-touch choice.
A car’s behavior is affected by
a number of variables. Identifiable
drawbacks like vertical pitching,
along with bouncing, rolling and
related control problems had to be
eliminated. Yet, a car’s handling
and ride are also affected by
intangibles like the weather and
driving habits of individual
motorists. Overcoming these
variables meant a new suspension
for the 929.
Mazda realized that a
conventional suspension system
could never offer the freedom of
choice desired by today’s drivers.
The key was new automotive
technology based on the precision
and accuracy of microelectronics.
A hi-tech/hi-touch approach that
puts the driver in touch with the
road. One that guarantees the right
ride at the right time, regardless of
conditions or speed.
Dial a ride.
Through microcomputers, Auto
Adjusting Suspension electronic
sensors constantly monitor vehicle
speed and acceleration. That
information is fed to the damper
control motors at each wheel via a
processing unit housed in the dash.
If ride comfort is desired, the driver
can set the console-mounted
selector to SOFT. This decreases
the damping force of all four
wheels for travel that is smooth and
sure. On HARD, the 929’s dampers
become more rigid for active,
sporty driving.
And to give drivers the best of
both, Auto Adjusting Suspension
can be set to AUTO, its three
average speed points let the driver
dial in the ideal ride at any speed.
When the 929 travels in excess of
the preselected 50, 80 or 120km/h,
the front dampers will automatically
set to HARD and the rear to SOFT
for greater stability.
The use of microelectronics in
the 929’s Auto Adjusting
Suspension means impeccable
road manners at all times.
Automatically adjustable, the
system eliminates quick pitching
forward and lateral roll during
sudden braking, acceleration or
sharp turns.
Satisfaction a step ahead.
Another step forward in our
pursuit of excellence, Auto Adjust-
ing Suspension reflects Mazda’s
philosophV that technology must
work to provide comfort as well as
performance. Further proof that at
Mazda, we constantly strive to build
cars better than they have to be.

Our bush gear grows on the US
Outback in Beverly Hills: Drizabones and R. M. Williams’ moleskins
Bush spectacular: Jenny Kee’s Aboriginal-inspired Mimikee
By BERWYN LEWIS
THE TACITURN, bronzed Aussie in
shearer’s trousers and wallaby jacket
would have been laughed off the streets
of downtown Manhattan 10 years ago
but These days it’s greetings all round:
“Gidday, Blue!,” “ ’ow yer goin’,
mate?,” “Slip us a shrimp, will ya?” as
kids, taxi drivers, fashion editors and
store buyers echo newly-created and
popular images of Australia.
The dream merchants of Down
Under have succeeded in turning the
dream machines back on their inven-
tors.
“Australia’s image and desirability
have never been higher with North Am-
ericans,” said Don Morris, managing
director of Mojo, Sydney, the adver-
tising agency responsible for blitzing
West and East Coast Americans with
Paul Hogan tourist promotions.
For Americans still yearning for an-
other last frontier, Australia fulfils an
existential and economic gap thanks to
the Hoges TV commercials, the Qantas
Linda Jackson style: Aboriginal batik (left) and Bush Gum Leaf print with Akubra


Shirts, jacket, Bushed Australia; belts, leggings, Fabian Dattner
Koala campaign, the America’s Cup
win and the latest wave of Australian
films.
Nowadays, everyone wants to look
as though they’ve just stepped out of the
shearing shed. The beaut-looking bloke
from the bush in his hardworking, bush-
look clobber is hot stuff on Fifth Avenue
to the point of inspiring a key men’s,
wear bible of North American fashion
buyers, Daily News Record, to dub the
look True Grit when it featured Out-
back Trading Co clothes on its front
page and centrefold in the May edition.
The emergence of bush couture (as
opposed to haute couture) on the Am-
erican collective fashion consciousness
probably began in 1977 when Austra-
lian fauna and flora collections by
Linda Jackson and Jenny Kee first ap-
peared in small shops around Colum-
bus Street, Manhattan.
Jackson, primal priestess of art brut
Australiana, with her hand-printed and
painted designs, is inspired by sources
More bush-style co-ordinates from the Outback Trading selection
as disparate as parrots, corroborees,
large waratahs and small Sturt peas,
Ayers Rock and rainbows executed in
bright, fluorescent shades. The Jackson
fragrance Opal Essence, the jewellery in
paua shell and opal and accessories
such as gumleaf ankle socks, bow ties,
hatbands and knickers along with black
sheep wool garments (some trimmed
with chook feathers) has taken New
York by surprise.
Kee’s wool sweaters which feature
thick and intricate wildlife scenes sell to
New York stores and have featured in
Women’s Wear Daily and American
Vogue, They shot to the top in the
fashion stakes when Princess Di wore
her Jenny Kee koala sweater at a polo
match.
Jackson and Kee are involved this
year in an Australian promotion with I
Magnin stores during September and
October which features sweaters, fab-
rics, scarves and assorted garments for
the American autumn.
“They had no idea that anything like
this was going on in Australia,” said
Jackson in her spacious loft-style studio
and showroom in William Street, Kings
Cross.
“Now, time has caught up. We’re
having an impact. Other countries are
beginning to look and see what we’re
doing instead of the other way around.”
Jackson and Kee’s collections have
also sold to Olivia Newton-John’s
boutique, Koala Blue, in Los Angeles,
“Americans are attracted by my
colors,” said Jackson. “I’m a painter at
heart and I’m a native.”
But how did the bush look make it all
the way from the outback plains to the
well-heeled sidewalks of New York?
Chris Blundell, veteran merchan-
dising man, and John Turner, former
banker, teamed up 18 months ago to
form Outback Trading Co. Under their
distinctive platypus logo, they set out to
market and distribute a range of Austra-
lian designers, manufacturers and


Going to waist in the US: a range of Outback belts by Attaque
trademarks in the United States. Their
collection of 150 garments not only
created a total look but also gave the
stores something easy to promote.
Outback Trading has made deliver-
ies ever week since June across the US
to boutiques, specialty stores and big
chains such as Abercrombie & Fitch,
Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman,
Neiman-Marcus and Wilks Bashford
(an up-market men’s store in San Fran-
cisco which has installed a complete
Outback Trading boutiqufe).
I Magnin began on September 7 a
blanket radio, TV and print advertising
campaign promoting their Outback
Trading shops in their San Francisco
and Chicago stores.
In New York Bergdorf Goodman is
giving Outback Trading a full window
display on Fifth Avenue featuring the
entire Outback collection, Saks is pro-
moting the collection and Neiman-Mar-
cus will be staging runway (catwalk)
presentations.
It’s “heritage dressing,” said
Blundell, up to his armpits in packaging
at the Outback Trading showroom in
Marrickville, Sydney.
“The styling is based on original
1900 s clothes; big stockman-style coats
in stonewashed leather, moleskins,
shearer trousers and shirts, belts, hats
and jackets like the Tassie blueys a
heavy wool, fireproof, waterproof and
bushproof jacket with a leather collar.
“The leather collar was essential to
protect the wool from the blokes’ beards
and stubble,” explained Blundell.
These days, stubble is not a pre-
requisite because “heritage dressing” is
androgynous and it translates into the
large and layered look in vogue in the
autumn and winter of Europe and
North America.
The leather coats retail at SUSIOOO,
the blueys SUS2OO, the shirts SUSI3O
and everything matches. The rabbit-skin
Akubras go with the bandolier and
bullocky belts which come complete
with empty gun shells and could be
straight out of a Tom Roberts painting.
Getting America into moleskins has
been a bit of a problem, says Blundell:
“They don’t know what they are, so
they’re not sure why they should pay
SUSI2O for a pair of white jeans. They’ll
soon find out. When you wear mole-
skins, you really know you’ve got a pair
of trousers on.”
Burrs and sheep dags may not be a
problem for the average Manhattanite
but this has not stopped the sales of
shearer’s trousers with double padded
reinforcements on the front to protect
the wearer against sheep pressure and
burr tears.
This winter, Bowen hats and wallaby
jackets in large red and black check tar-
tans and belts hung with jangling horse
harness pieces could be a familiar sight
in New York’s downtown bars.
“Our look is dead straight, dead hon-
est and it comes complete with hard-
working sweat stains,” said Blundell.
Outback is not limiting itself to Fifth
Avenue ritz and glitz.
Abercrombie and Fitch, a hunting
outfitters, has placed orders for a special
“huntin’, shootin’ and fishin’ ” jacket
with Outback Trading and from this
year Outback will be outfitting
hardworking cowboys of Montana to
horse-breeders of West Virginia.
John Denver, John and Bo Derek,
Charles Bronson, Joan Collins and
Liberace have bought Outback Trading
garments and, according to Blundell,
Ronald and Nancy Reagan might be
wearing theirs this winter.
The “heritage dressing” look with its
flares, flaps, capes, tabs, fantails (for
spreading over the back of a saddle),
knee and elbow patches and straps for
buttoning down against all weathers has
appeared on the pages of the New York
Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Mon-
treal Gazette, Town and Country maga-
zine, Esquire, M magazine, American
Vogue, Glamour, Harpers and many
more publications.
“The big problem in the US is that
Australians are famous for their dis-
appearing acts. They’ve been walking
in, making rash promises, walking out
and never been sighted again,” said
Blundell.
“Maybe it gets too hard for them.
Maybe it takes too much money. But we
had to spend at least six months
overcoming the stigma we’ve created for
ourselves because we don’t deliver. If
you don’t deliver you are whipped.”
Blundell and Turner criss-crossed
the US in 1983, knocking on store and
magazine editors’ doors, piecing
together merchandising ideas and in-
spiring confidence.
“Finally they started to say to us,
‘You guys are just what we’re looking
for’,” said Blundell.
During this time the fort was held in
Sydney by the third member of the Out-
back Trading team, Rosemary “office
jillaroo” Wilson.
According to Turner, the Australian
Bank gave them their big chance by pro-
viding the financial support.
“The major problem faced by small
businesses, especially those just starting
out, is finding adequate financial sup-
port from traditional banking sources,”
said Turner.
He emphasises that they won’t be
caught next year, despite sour predic-
tions that Australia is the flavor of the
month a fad in fickle fashion circles.
Outback has big plans to tie in With
the film Robbery Under Arms and its de-
signer, Anna Senior.
“Provided we keep on giving them a
story to promote, we’ve got a future,”
said Blundell. □

PUBLIC OPINION
Labor down
but not out in
Victoria, NSW
John Cain: slump in popularity
Jeff Kennett: boost in approval
Neville Wran: still in doldrums
APPROVAL of the Victorian govern-
ment and its leader, Premier John Cain,
slumped during August but not by
enough to push Labor out of an elec-
tion-winning position.
The Morgan Gallup Poll reports that
support for the Australian Labor Party
dropped 2 percent, to 50 percent, while
Cain’s rating fell by 4 percent to 44.
But, had an election been held at the
end of August, Labor would have been
returned with about its present majority.
The Liberal vote rose by 1 percent, to
37 percent, in the latest poll. Support for
the Australian Democrats increased by
the same amount, to 5 percent, while
National Party backing was stable at 5
percent.
Opposition leader Jeff Kennett’s
rating increased by 3 percent to 40 per-
cent but 25 percent of voters remained
unsure of him.
In NSW, support for the ALP was
down 1 percent to 46 while Liberal-Na-
tional Party backing was unchanged at
45. An election at the end of August
would have gone to preferences, ac-
cording to the poll.
Premier Neville Wran’s approval re-
mained at a low 38 percent, with 51 per-
cent disapproving of the way in which
he was handling his job. Opposition
leader Nick Greiner’s rating dropped 3
percent to 49 percent.
Almost one third of voters thought
Greiner would do a better job as prem-
ier than Wran; 29 percent said “the
same” and 24 percent said “worse.”
The Victorian poll surveyed 1231
electors throughout the state during
August.
They were asked which party would
receive their first preference “if a state
election were being held today.” Only 5
percent of those surveyed did not state
their preference.
The first table compares the latest re-
sult with those of previous Morgan
Gallup Polls and the April 1982 state
election result.

Electors then were asked whether
they approved or disapproved of Cain’s
and Kennett’s handling of their jobs.
Disapproval of Cain as Premier was up
3 percent to 41, with 15 percent of elec-
tors undecided.
Disapproving comments included
“Don’t like his policies,” “He’s not
strong enough,” “State taxes too high,”
and “Broken promises.”

Whenever Test Marketing
creeps into the conversation
some bright spark always asks,
“Can’t you do it by computer
these days?” Well the answer is
yes, sort of. Computer market
models have been around for
at least 10 years. They’re used
to predict sales and market share
based on assumptions fed into a
programme. They can be a useful
tool, particularly if time saving
and secrecy are critical. Computer models have real
disadvantages, however, when used to replace ‘live’ Test
Marketing and the hip-pocket vote of the typical
Adelaide housewife. Computer models were designed
for the larger markets of the U.S.A. and Europe.
Sufficient, detailed consumer data is often not available
here to the extent envisaged overseas. Cost is high at
upwards of $60,000 in most cases, and that doesn’t
include the cost of producing
the product, packaging and
advertising. By comparison a six
month Adelaide Test Market with
weekly detailed audits covering a
panel of, say, 50 representative
stores, would cost less than
$30,000. And you end up with
facts not a forecast.
‘Live’ Test Marketing has
definite advantages over
computer research models. And
Adelaide has definite advantages for Test Marketers. All
the details are in “Test Marketing in the Eighties—Why
Australia’s top Marketers choose Adelaide”.

NEW SOUTH WALES
Graziers and
Aborigines on
collision course
Chris Kirkbright: Aboriginal and grazier claims not mutually exclusive
JOHN ELLIOTT
By ANASTASIA JOYCE
A REPORT tabled in the New South
Wales parliament has highlighted the
need for the state government to clarify
its position on Aboriginal land rights
claims.
At present two government policies
are in conflict. The government wants to
build small farms in the west of the state
into bigger, more economic holdings
but it also wants Aborigines to claim
land rights. In many cases the claims of
farmers and Aborigines could compete
for the same areas.
The report made by a joint commit-
tee of inquiry has recommended that a
policy of farm build-up be implemented
in western NSW. Now there is a restric-
tion on the amount of land a grazier
may own. “Farm build-up” would lift
this.
The report said that many grazing
properties were not generating enough
funds for the maintenance of an average
family. It said that larger holdings
would give increased profits due to
economies of scale.
The only available land for farm
build-up, however, would be vacated
leasehold land or alternatively vacant
Crown land which is subject to Aborigi-
nal land rights claims. Under the Abor-
iginal Land Rights Act, claims may be
made on vacant Crown land providing
it is not likely to be used for an “essen-
tial public purpose.” Exactly what an
“essential public purpose” is, nobody
seems to know. But the outcome of a
recent land rights claim for Tredega, a
3673 ha property west of Bourke, could
provide an answer.
Tredega was advertised in the
January NSW Government Gazette as
being available for lease to local gra-
ziers. Applications were received but as
Tredega was vacant Crown land pref-
erence was given to an application from
the Wanaaring Land Council, the local
Aboriginal land council.
A policy statement released by the
Department of Agriculture in July this
year could mean that the Aboriginal
claim will not be successful. The state-
ment says that the promotion of econ-
omically viable properties should be the
cornerstone of land use policy.
This policy, together with the recom-
mendations of the joint committee, sug-
gest that farm build-up may be an “es-
sential public purpose.”
Both the report and the policy could
help counteract the effects of the rural
recession within the western region.
Drought, overstocking and poor meat
prices have caused a reduction in rural
employment and productivity. Some
graziers who have been forced off their
properties have gone into the regional
centres in search of supplementary in-
come. Others have left the land alto-
gether. Employment of rural workers is
virtually non-existent in some areas.
This together with the general de-
crease in farm profitability has reduced
commerce within the towns and helped
create high unemployment. The joint
committee’s report says that farm build-
up could help redress this situation. It
would allow farmers to increase their
carrying capacity without a fall in meat
quality, thereby increasing their profits.
The Registrar of the Aboriginal Land


Rights Act, Chris Kirkbright, said that
while the policy should be supported it
should not be allowed to jeopardise
land rights claims. He said: “If the gov-
ernment determines that farm build-ups
preclude Aboriginal land rights claims
then that would be a decision based on
false premises.”
Kirkbright said the government had
to realise that farm built-ups and Abor-
iginal land claims were not mutually ex-
clusive.
Aborigines wanted land to build up
properties. □
MOTORING
Cars from
robots - and
roof gardens
By PETER WHERRETT
DON DEVESON, the general manager,
was giggling. We had just finished a tour
of the Ford Motor Company plant at
Geelong and as we left the main build-
ing he pointed out two semi-trailer tray
bodies, one empty and the other holding
two crates of assembled engines.
“That’s our current inventory,” he
said, indicating that the Ford plant
efficiency was at such a level that carry-
ing huge stocks of anything for a rainy
day was no longer necessary.
He was doing it with such delight
that one could not help but be aware of
the enthusiasm being Number One and
being profitable has generated in the
company. In fact a journalists’ tour of
Ford facilities left the visitors feeling
that the Australian automobile industry
is alive and well and living at Geelong
and Broadmeadows.
Deveson had been introduced earlier
as “the last of the big spenders.” It is a
title he cherishes. “I have $3OO million
to spend here,” he said. The only
trouble he was having was with the
“bean counters,” the sometimes unim-
aginative but always necessary people
who control company finance.
As we sat down to lunch in the
executive boardroom Deveson invited
us to have a bread roll. “We make ’em
here,” he said.
If we needed confirmation, later in
the apprentice training area there was a
list of skills displayed for us, all allied to
what one might expect in the motor in-
dustry with the exception of the last:
“Cookery.” Deveson wanted us to know
that Ford, Geelong, was on the way to
being self-sufficient.
They call him “the gardener” around
the Geelong basic manufacturing oper-
ation. The attractively-landscaped areas
around once grey and boring factories
justify the title. He pointed out that tem-
peratures on the rooftops of the factory
buildings averaged 28 degrees and that
he was planning to set up hydroponic
gardens on the rooftops to grow veg-
etables for staff canteen use but also to
sell to the people of Geelong.
He showed us proudly a staff canteen
built with the savings from a $l3 million
investment in robotic equipment.
Deveson could not stand to return the
surplus to the “bean counters” so he
built the new canteen “for the workers.”
“I have made an undertaking,”
Deveson said, “to the ACTU that auto-
mation of these plants will not mean the
loss of one job. We will create ways to
keep our staff levels up.”
Deveson is not alone in his concern
for his employees. At the Broad-
meadows assembly plant, manager
Roger Wiggill told us of a scheme called
employee involvement (El).
Employee involvement is the result
of a joint venture between Ford and the
ACTU. Wiggill said that the concept of
El is to set up groups of employees,
working on the production line, who
meet regularly to make suggestions as to
how they can do their jobs more
efficiently. In many cases the sugges-
tions result in simpler and less tedious
job performance which, in turn, means
greater productivity and higher quality.
Employees made their own video to
show what they were achieving. It was
not great television but it made the
point.
Ford’s current pre-occupation is with
quality and the progressive reduction in
warranty claims since 1981 seems to jus-
tify this interest. Things are not perfect
yet; but they are better than they were.
Apart from El, another reason for
improved quality is the robots. Some
areas of the plants are eerie with their
absence of people. Programmed ma-
chines lift, clamp, join, weld and set
aside substantial components more ac-
curately, more consistently and without
complaint or discomfort.
But the human factors are still the
most interesting. There-are more than
3000 employees at the Broadmeadows
assembly plant from 15 nationalities. It
is a challenge to maintain harmony with
such numbers.
It is for this reason as much as any
other that Ford claim El is important. It
is apparent that morale in the company
has improved dramatically with worker
participation. Of course, it does no
harm to be Number One, either.
Ford produces around 600 cars a day
throughout Australia but requires a
sales and marketing staff of only 362. As
Max Grandsen, Ford’s director of sales
and marketing, is proud to point out
this is more than 100 fewer than they
had two years ago.
Naturally, they have computers and
more than 380 dealers to help in their
task. Nevertheless, the company must
sell more than $6 million worth of ve-
hicles every day. That’s around $16,500
a head and everyone is expected to con-
tribute.

Now you can spot Australian
cars with Bosch fuel injection.
If you’re quick.
What people are asking of today’s Australian
cars is that they go farther, faster, with more power,
on less fuel, than ever before.
Bosch Fuel Injection makes that simple.
In many of the finest cars Australian
manufacturers offer, Bosch Fuel Injection
components help deliver higher performance
with easier starts, quicker response, better
mileage, and lower exhaust emissions.
Ideas in the right place at the right time.
Bosch Fuel Injectors in multi-point systems,
for instance, inject fuel right at the individual
cylinders. So your engine receives its energy
precisely as required.
The electronic brain then reads thousands of
combinations of engine operations and driving
conditions, and dictates the optimum mixture of
air and injected fuel. Result: Maximum power as
you need it from less fuel.
And with today’s demand for fuel economy,
the concept of fuel injection is as pertinent as the
injection itself. The mileage boost Bosch Fuel
Injection equipment provides results in
significant savings for the average motorist.
We move with the best of companies
Bosch Fuel Injection has become a high
technology essential for today’s efficient,
top-performing machines.
All Japanese models sold in Australia with
fuel injection are produced under Bosch licence.
All U.S. manufacturers and all European
makers offering fuel injected cars either have
complete fuel injection systems or components
from Bosch.
In fact, every car with fuel injection on
Australian roads has either a Bosch made or
Bosch licensed Fuel Injection system under the
bonnet.
To keep ahead -
Bosch breaks with the conventional
Sophisticated solutions from Bosch range
well beyond automotive. Bosch Power Tools.
Bosch Dishwashers and Rangehoods. Bosch TV
studio equipment are just a few of the thousands
of the advanced electronic and electromechanical
products we’ve pioneered.
As a result, we’re an international company in
over 130 countries employing 110,000 people,
nearly 7,000 in R & D alone.
People capable of finding the right answer to
the toughest challenges.
Including yours.

of sales planning and distribution, said:
“It isn’t too easy to predict what should
be built, in what proportions and with
what options some two months before
the dealer actually gets a signature on
the dotted line.”
But they do it. And with considerable
accuracy.
Product planning has a 10-year lead
time. That is, the cars that Ford will
build for us to use in 1994 are more than
a figment of someone’s imagination
right now.
They won’t tell you how much more,
of course, nor even what we are likely to
be offered in 1986. When you tour the
design studio it is not really the design
studio but an area mocked up to show
how it is done, not what’s being done.
All the time the plants grind on,
helping managing director Bill Dix to
announce that Ford has made record
sales and record profits while other Aus-
tralian makers languish in a sea of con-
fusion and uncertainty.
That’s why Deveson was giggling. □
EDUCATION
Computer
experiment pays
off for students
By WILLA McDONALD
COLIN WOODLEY, director of educa-
tion services with the Association of In-
dependent Schools of NSW, knows the
power of computers: he spent the past
two years with an experimental class at
MLC School, Burwood, NSW. The
class did two years’ work in one.
Woodley took one group through
fifth and sixth class using computers the
children could take home from school.
They finished in the top 20 percent of
sixth class children in the state while
still in fifth class.
The computers taught the children
first to touch-type, to ensure proper in-
teraction with the machines. The chil-
dren now average typing speeds of 84
words a minute. Composing essays and
poems took a third of the normal time
which, together with more effective
learning, helped free them for other ac-
tivities.
Rather than being rushed into year
seven they spent the extra time in hu-
man development courses which
involved excursions, visiting speakers
and debates.
Woodley, convinced of the value of
supplementing schoolwork by using
computers at home, is involved in estab-
lishment by the association of a
software library of school subjects. Stu-
dents (or parents) at any level can ring
the association’s computer and select
any of about 300 programs which will
show up on their home computers with-
in a few minutes.
The potential of such a library
stretches even further than homework;
it means that the technology and re-
sources are available to let children
work at home, if not full-time, at least in
bad weather or during illness.
But Woodley disagrees with academ-
ics, such as Professor Tom Stonier of the
faculty of Science and Society at
Bradford University, England, who
have predicted that teachers will be-
come obsolete by the year 2000 when
school will only be needed for play to
fulfil children’s social needs.
Woodley points out that computers
are unsuitable for subjective courses
such as philosophy and literature; the
user cannot depart from a structured
program and ask the computer ques-
tions and not every child is stimulated
by computers, just as not every child is
stimulated by books.
He is concerned at the number of
parents who have bought home com-
puters only to find that the computer is
abandoned after the novelty of its
games has worn off. He believes that
most cases of home computers lying idle
result from families buying inappro-
priate models and then not knowing
what to do with them.
The association is running courses
for families to introduce them to com-
puters, to help them select the model of
most use to the whole family and to
show them how to get the most from the
technology. It also is running a series of
workshops to alert principals to the
necessity of developing policies for in-
tegrated use both at home and at school
to see that the home computer is not
used only by self-motivated, advanced
students and then in an erratic and
unguided way.
Experience in Australia and overseas
has found a tendency for computer re-
sources to be dominated by a small
group of above-average students. To
overcome this, the federal government
specified when announcing in February
a three-year national education pro-
gram aimed at introducing computers to
every school that priority be given to
students disadvantaged financially,
racially, sexually or physically.
The national program, to cost $18.7
million, is concentrating on introduc-
tion of hardware to schools.
The University of Sydney and busi-
ness giant IBM have joined forces to
help schools obtain computer hardware.
Recently, 20 teachers from five Sydney
high schools completed a four-week in-
tensive training program on personal
computers at the university as part of a
$2.5 million project funded by IBM.
The aim of the project is to educate in
standard computer skills teachers in
NSW, Queensland and South Australia
who can return to their schools and pass
on skills to students and fellow teachers.
IBM will give each of the Sydney
schools (Glebe, Fairvale near Fairfield,
Auburn Girls’, the Catherine McAuley
School at Westmead and the Inaburra
Independent School at Menai) 16 per-
sonal computers at the end of this year.
Home computers which will last a
child for from three to five years can be
bought now for about two weeks’ wages.
With cost problems eased, there is
nothing further to stop computers from
playing an integral part in children’s
education at school and at home. □

HEALTH
Hormones for over-60 women a boon
Professor Barry Wren: advances made in the past few years
Checking osteoporosis: a bone analyser in a Sydney hospital
By BETTINA ARNDT
CONSIDER THIS startling statistic:
Women over 60 years of age now ac-
count for 8 percent of Australia’s popu-
lation but for 40 percent of the health
care beds. Care for older women al-
ready imposes a considerable burden on
our health care system and, unless ur-
gent attention is focused on this increas-
ing problem, the cost implications are
immense.
The latest statistics show 1.16 million
women over 60 in Australia. Their num-
ber is expected to grow by 47 percent
between now and the year 2001. (By
comparison, the number of males over
60 is only some 900,000 and expected to
grow by 44 percent.) Female life expect-
ancy continues to increase. Female life
expectancy (at birth) was more than 78
years in 1982, that of males 71 years
and the gap between the sexes was in-
creasing.
Since elderly women usually are de-
pendent on the public purse for their
health care 82 percent are eligible for
and receive health benefit cards entitl-
ing them to free hospital and medical
care the trend is for an ever-increas-
ing dependent population of older
women to be the financial responsibility
of fewer and fewer taxpayers. The fig-
ures tell the story: the number of women
over 60 is expected to grow between
now and the year 2001 at an annual rate
of 2.35 percent and the projected
growth of the number of taxpayers
(aged 15 to 60) over the same period is
less than three-quarters of this figure
(1.73 for males, 1.71 for females).
Few areas of public health present as
great a threat to the long-term financial
viability of Medicare as does the care of
older women. This is why a break-
through in therapeutic treatment of
older women could be of economic sig-
nificance to this country.
The treatment concerned is hormone
therapy used for oestrogen deprivation
suffered by post-menopausal women.
New research has shown that oestrogen
loss after menopause makes women sus-
ceptible to debilitating diseases requir-
ing costly medical care.
Apart from sheer numbers, the
reason older women make So many de-
mands on hospital and medical re-
sources relates to diseases caused by
their uniquely female hormone depriva-
tion. Research has shown that this
deprivation can be rectified with im-
mense benefits not only for the health
and well-being of the women concerned
but also for the economic health of the
communities upon which they depend.
A prime example of these older
women’s diseases is osteoporosis which
involves loss of calcium from bones,
greatly increasing the incidence of frac-
tures. Hip, wrist and spine fractures are
most common and elderly women ex-
perience fractures 15 times more often
than do males of the same age. Twenty-
five percent of women over 65 suffer
from this type of fracture and will fre-
quently require hospital care. Twenty
percent of women over 65 with hip frac-
tures die within a year of sustaining
them.
Women experience a rapid loss of
calcium from bones, somewhere in the
order of 3 to 5 percent a year, immedi-
ately following menopause. The rate of
loss then slows down somewhat but 10
or 15 years after menopause, when the
woman is around 65, she will often have
lost more than 25 percent of her bone
calcium. This loss places her at risk of
bone fracture and slows the healing pro-
cess when fractures do occur. The role
of oestrogen in osteoporosis is clearly
shown when younger women lose the
function of their ovaries through surgi-
cal intervention: they show the same in-
itial rapid loss of calcium and a similar
fracture rate to that of older women 10
to 15 years after having been deprived
of their natural source of oestrogen,

by older women has convinced special-
ists such as Professor Barry Wren, medi-
cal director of the Menopause Clinic at
the Royal Hospital for Women in Syd-
ney, that oestrogen deprivation should
be regarded as a disease which needs
treatment. Wren says: “It is my belief
that we should regard the post-meno-
pause as a naturally occurring endo-
crine deficiency disease. Following the
menopause, women are deficient in one
of their natural hormones oestrogen.
As a result of this deficiency, they may
develop a number of distressing symp-
toms and debilitating medical condi-
tions. These range from unpleasant
short-term effects commonly associated
with the menopausal phase such as hot
flushes, sweats, muscle aches and pains,
formication (a sensation of ants crawl-
ing in the skin) to long-term life-threat-
ening conditions such as atherosclerosis
and osteoporosis.”
In Wren’s view, the hormone de-
ficiency suffered by the post-meno-
pausal woman makes her similar to
people suffering other endocrine dis-
orders such as diabetes, myxoedema
(thyroid deficiency) or Addison’s dis-
ease (adrenal deficiency). He believes
that, like the diabetic, the post-meno-
pausal woman requires long-term medi-
cal care: “The problem is that people
have regarded the post-menopause as a
normal physiological event rather than
a pathological process which can be
corrected. It is only in the past few years
that advances have been made which al-
low us to treat these women with a high
degree of safety.”
The safety issue is crucial to current
debate over the use of hormone therapy
in the care of post-menopausal women.-
Evidence for the beneficial effects of
oestrogen replacement therapy for
treating diseases such as osteoporosis
dates back to the 19405. Doctors have
long known that giving post-meno-
pausal women oestrogen can halt the
loss of bone calcium and reduce hip
fractures by up to 80 percent.
A range of machines is available to
diagnose accurately the amount of cal-
cium present in bone. At the Meno-
pause Clinic, women at risk of osteo-
porosis are tested using the Molsgaard
Bone Mineral Analyser which measures
the calcium content of peripheral bones.
Using this machine, it is possible clearly
to diagnose women at risk from os-
teoporosis and demonstrate differences
in bone calcium loss before and after
oestrogen treatment.
A far more simple demonstration of
the effects of oestrogen would be to line
up a group of elderly women treated
with oestrogen for some years next to an
untreated group. The treated women
would literally stand taller.
The dreaded “dowager’s hump,” has

garded as a normal sign of ageing. This
lump is due to the compression of bones
in the upper spine following loss of
bone density and can be avoided by
oestrogen therapy. Spinal compression
need not occur.
(Apart from oestrogen deficiency,
other factors which affect osteoporosis
include diet and exercise. Lifestyle and
diet changes, including calcium sup-
plements, can also be beneficial).
Despite the well-known beneficial
effects of oestrogen, the hormone
therapy has not gained widespread
acceptance because evidence
emerged during the 60s and 70s that
women given oestrogen began to de-
velop cancer of the uterus and
breasts at a much greater rate than
normally predicted.
Before menopause, the incidence
of cancer of the uterus is one in
25,000 women. The incidence in-
creases after menopause but the use
of the type of oestrogen therapy of
the 60s was found to increase that
rate still further, to one in 250
women. Add to this increased risks
of breast cancer, thrombosis, hyper-
tension and an apparent increase in
gall bladder disease and it is hardly
surprising that hormone therapy fell
into disrepute.
Since then, however, a vast
amount of international research has
refined the hormones used
with the result that the risks
now are minimal.
The history of hormone
therapy for the meno-
pausal woman is similar to
the history of the contra-
ceptive pill. The type and
doses of hormones used in
the pill originally resulted
in dangerous and un-
pleasant side effects for
some users but it has been
refined to the point where
most women can use pre-
scriptions with no ill
effects.
But it is not so easy to
overcome the effects of
years of negative publicity
and educate doctors and
their patients about the
latest developments. Wren
says: “It is natural that
doctors will be conserva-
tive about a treatment
which has received so
much adverse publicity.
The difficulty is educating
them that this situation has
now changed and the ben-
efits of long-term hormone
therapy now far outweigh
the risks.”
The major advance in
the use of hormone therapy
in the past decade was the dis-
covery that women could be pro-
tected from an increased risk of
cancer by adding another hor-
mone progesterone to the
oestrogen. Studies from researchers
around the world using the combined
treatment over the past eight years or so
have produced no reports of uterine
cancer in the women being studied.
More work is needed to prove that
the new regime of hormones used does
not increase the risk of breast cancer.
Some Canadian research suggests that
the progesterone may even have a pro-
tective function in this area and French
scientists are investigating a new
oestrogen which may give the positive
action of oestrogen without increasing
the risk of breast cancer.
Breast cancer remains the one
grey area requiring more research in
the safest balance of hormones.
Thrombosis, the increase of clot-
ting factors in the blood, is another
risk reduced considerably by the new
regime of hormones.
The natural oestrogens also have
reduced the risk of hypertension and
one (Piperazine Oestrone Sulphate)
has been shown to lead to a reduc-
tion in blood pressure in about 20
percent of women.
The therapy still is not appropri-
ate for some women for instance,
any with a history of cancer of the
endometrium. Some women with
particular types of breast cancer
should not take oestrogen. But, with
the risks now generally contained,
the possible benefits of hormone
therapy are emerging.

step-from wooden poles to lattice towers,
carrying transmission lines of the then unheard

Transfield. And 500 kilovolt lines have become
the order of the day.
Transfield built a large part of the first 500
KV line in New South Wales and last year
completed their first 500 KV line in Victoria, a

Moorabool substations, west of Melbourne. Not
to mention building Australia’s first Tower

specialists such as Wren is long-term
hormone therapy, commencing from
the onset of menopause and continuing
throughout the rest of the woman’s life.
The post-menopausal life expectancy
for a woman over 50 is now 30.59 years
well over a third of her life. Research
shows that short-term hormone therapy
is ineffective in treating osteoporosis
immediately after cessation of
oestrogen therapy, bone erosion re-
sumes at a rate equivalent to the normal
rapid rate associated with the post-
menopause. This requires a radical
change in the approach to hormone
therapy which was seen as a short-term
treatment to reduce the effect of prob-
lems associated with the menopause
period itself.
By reducing the incidence of os-
teoporosis, Wren has estimated, the po-
tential saving in hip fractures alone
would be about $l5O million a year.
A cost analysis produced by the
Westmead Hospital in Sydney showed
the cost of treating the hip fractures of
119 women over 50 in 1983 was
$865,600. The patients concerned occu-
pied 4327 bed days during the year
(with an average stay of 36 days). The
charges for surgery alone amounted to
$42,185.
These costs do not take into account
convalescence and ambulatory and
physiotherapy care after discharge.
Long-term hormone therapy offers
beneficial effects other than reducing ill-
health through osteoporosis. Women
taking oestrogen have been shown to
have a significantly reduced risk of
heart attack.
Oestrogens have been shown to in-
crease levels of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, an effect which reduces the
risk of developing atherosclerosis and
myocardial infarction.
The oestrogen needs to be adminis-
tered from the onset of menopause to
reduce the risks of atherosclerosis. Once
it has developed, oestrogen has no effect
on reducing atherosclerotic plaques.
Figures are not yet available but ex-
perts believe that the potential cost
savings through using hormone therapy
to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis are
likely to be substantial, too.
There are also effects on psychologi-
cal and sexual health.
Oestrogen deprivation can cause loss
of vaginal lubrication and thinning
(atrophy) and shrinkage of the vaginal
walls and external genital tissues result-
ing in painful intercourse, decreased
sexual enjoyment and eventually to loss
of libido.
Recent research at the Royal Hospi-
tal for Women showed that hormone
therapy increased vaginal lubrication
and restored the health of the genital
tissues. Women studied report an in-
crease in sexual enjoyment. □

CHESS
The power of Purdy
IF ANYONE could imagine anything
more beneficial to their chess than per-
using this column, it probably would be
reading the late Cecil Purdy’s lucid and
entertaining articles on the game. Some
of his best have been preserved in the
book C. J. S. Purdy: His Life, His Games
and His Writings, a copy of which is the
new problem prize.
Few would dispute that Purdy was
Australia’s greatest chess teacher. But he
was also a top-notch player. He reached
his peak in winning the world corres-
pondence championship in 1954. This
was in the days before the East Euro-
peans discovered international corres-
pondence chess but, even so, winning a
world title is never easy.
The recently-concluded Purdy Mem-
orial Correspondence Tournament, or-
ganised in Purdy’s memory soon after
his death in 1979, fittingly included
three Australians: Karlis Ozols, Phil
Viner and John Kellner. None was able
to head off the winner, W. Kosenhow of
the USSR, but Ozols lowered his colors
in their individual game.
Essentially a positional player,
Purdy did not shirk mixing it with
rough-and-tumble tactics at times.. In
the following game, from the 1948 Aus-
tralian Correspondence Championship,
a curious feature is that Purdy uses the
same Knight six times in the first 15
moves.

COVER STORY
Australia’s burglary epidemic:
the community strikes back
Burglary in Australia has become too easy, too lucrative and too common but it could
have reached saturation point: Insurance companies, police and the beleaguered
general public are rallying to test an ambitious crime-prevention program which,
BRUCE STANNARD
writes, may have as a by-product a re-awakening of community spirit.
LENNY “The Ferret” Cooke is a very
successful thief. He has to be. A heroin
habit costing him $6OO a day means to
him that he must break, enter and steal
from as many as four or five houses in
the inner Sydney suburbs usually
Newtown and Stanmore each and
every day without fail. Over the past five
years, he figures that he has “knocked
off’ many of those homes at least two or
three times.
Lenny sticks close to the home he
knows best. The oldest of four sons in a
family notorious for drunken brawling,
he grew up in a Dickensian world of
institutions and remand centres. He had
been in “The Bay” (Long Bay jail) twice
for persistent break and enter offences
by the.time he was 26.
The family home - a grim little ter-
race not far from the diesel stench of
King Street, Newtown, is still a place
to which he can repair although his
father, a former tugboat deckhand,
reckons that Lenny is “big and ugly”
enough these days to look after himself.
The Ferret lives in a boarding house just
down the road.
Cooke is not your cliche wild-eyed
junkie. It is precisely because he is so
good at what he does that he looks and
sounds almost normal. Because he al-
ways has the money, he says he “never

dries out and gets ugly.” “Getting the
stuff’ is all that counts.
“People make it easy,” he said. “It’s
like they’ve hung out a sign that says,
‘Hey, Lenny, come and take my VCR!’
It’s a walk-up start at half the places.
They leave doors open, windows up. It’s
as if they’re asking me to come in and
scout around.”
He works alone and, he says, without
tools. “Forget the old jemmy, mate,” he
said. “A thing like that just attracts at-
tention. You’ve just got to scout about,
look for the right signs. When you know
what you’re after, it’s a snack.”
Cooke says that he goes mainly for
jewellery. “If I saw a VCR (video
cassette recorder), I’d pick it up,” he
said, “but the way I work, in broad day-
light, I don’t like the idea of carting a
bloody great tape-deck down the road.
“I did it once for a special (order). A
bloke said, ‘Keep your eyes open for a
decent VCR for me.’ He gave me 300
bucks that’s a ton on top of what
you’d usually cop, so I’m not about to
knock that back. It took me about an
hour to find one. I just marched out with
it under my arm.
“People know what’s going on but
they won’t look at you; they look down


The spoils: unclaimed stolen property waiting to be auctioned by police in Sydney
JOHN ELLIOTT
or away or get busy doing
something else.”
Cooke disposes of most of
his stolen property through
any one of three neighbor-
hood “fences” who have no
hesitation in giving him cash
on the spot. And, although he
once tried what might seem to
be the easier route buying,
cutting down and re-supply-
ing heroin he figured that
the risks of serious violence
were considerably less
through simply knocking off
houses in the suburbs.
“Coppers aren’t really a
problem,” he said. “They
cruise around in their cars all
day but they never get out.
About the only time you see a
cop on foot is when he’s buy-
ing his lunch.”
When I raised the appar-
ently novel notion of guilt,
Cooke fixed me with a con-
temptuous smirk. “Insurance,
mate!” he almost shouted.
“They’re all bloody insured,
aren’t they? Everyone’s
covered these days. They get
their VCRs replaced inside
two days so they haven’t
really lost anything, have
they?”
But what people have lost and this
is not an easy point to get across to a
thief, let alone one with a raging drug
habit is not so much the mere pos-
sessions as the sense of sanctuary. The
idea that a total stranger someone
who rnay well be desperate enough to
launch a sudden, violent attack has
had the gall to break into and stomp
KENT MEARS
Det-Sgts Walker (left) and Gibson with boss Joe Parrington
around a private home strikes a deep
sense of outrage in most people. When
an apparently very skinny thief
managed to wriggle through a doggy-
door in my home recently and make off
with an as-yet-unpacked VCR plus $75
from my wife’s purse, it left me about as
angry as I’ve ever been. It was only after
a young detective constable came and
took no more than a cursory note that
the realisation dawned that what had
happened to us seemed to be, as far as
the police were concerned, only margin-
ally more significant than a parking in-
fringement. Housebreaking has become
so commonplace throughout Australia
that it is almost rare these days to en-
counter someone whose home has not
been broken into.
WHEN Detective Chief Superintendent
Joe Parrington joined the NSW police
force, 33 years ago, the Breaking
Squad’s investigation threshold was
$lOOO. That meant that they simply did
not probe any property theft in which
the value was under that mark. That
threshold has risen to $55,000.
“Unless it’s a big job,” Parrington
said, “there’s no way they can afford to
get involved. If they went to every little
job, they would become nothing more
than burglars’ clerks.”
The Breaking Squad’s soar-away
threshold and, indeed, the police atti-
tude to it offers a startling glimpse of
the way in which property
theft has been allowed to be-
come the biggest growth in-
dustry in the history of Aus-
tralian crime.
Although they will not say
so publicly, senior NSW
police admit that until now no
one has been paying specific
attention to it let alone dis-
playing any interest in co-
ordinating efforts to counter
it. But the public, politicians
and the police hierarchy seem
suddenly to have realised the
extent of the problem. In a
masterful understatement,
Parrington says: “No one as-
sociated with law enforce-
ment in this state could be sat-
isfied with current results. We
have had an explosion in
property crime and we have
been very ineffective in deal-
ing with it. That’s the truth
and there’s no point in run-
ning away from the truth.”
Parrington said that the
state’s 20 district superinten-
dents (10 in the metropolitan
area and 10 in the country)
had been briefed on the extent
of the problem in special sem-
inars conducted recently at
police headquarters in Syd-
ney. “They have the troops in the field,”
he said. “Now it’s a matter of gathering
the public support we need for the
counter-attack.”
One householder in every 25 living
in the Sydney metropolitan area is like-
ly to have his home burgled in the next
12 months. Householders in the 10 high-
risk areas Stanmore, Paddington,
Petersham and Lewisham, Haberfield,


Belmore, Marrickville, Newtown,
Darlinghurst and Leichhardt have,
according to NRMA Insurance, one
chance in six of having their homes
burgled within a year.
As an indicator of just how bad the
situation is, Parrington provided the de-
partment’s statistics. In 1975, property
breakings in the Sydney metropolitan
area alone totalled 38,912 and involved
goods valued at $ll.B million. In 1983,
there were 78,876 offences involving
property valued in excess of $lOO mil-
lion.
A similarly dramatic rise was evident
in NSW country areas (counting Wol-
longong and Newcastle). In 1975:
10,166 offences involving $2.3 million.
Last year: 20,510 and $15.4 million.
The clear-up rate in the Sydney
metropolitan area was as low as 7 per-
cent last year and state-wide only 6.8
percent.
Melbourne had 18,414 home bur-
glaries from January 1983 to April this
year a 50 percent rise in a year.
Victorian police could not pinpoint
Melbourne’s most-burgled suburb, let
alone the city’s most-burgled street,
lacking a computerised database. When
I asked at Russell Street police head-
quarters for those details, I was advised
to come back in two years.
The national statistics are just as
gloomy. A survey conducted recently by
market research firm Yann, Campbell,
Hoare, Wheeler disclosed that the
homes of one in six Australian house-
holders had been burgled and that all
Australians could expect to be burgled
twice during their lifetimes. The total
value of goods stolen through burglary
in 1983 was put at $250 million. Bur-
glaries cost the insurance industry $4l
million in 1979. This year, the national
figure is projected at $159 million.
According to Dr Geoffrey Sutton, di-
rector of the NSW Government’s Bu-
reau of Crime Statistics and Research,
economic tough times, rising unemploy-
ment and burgeoning drug addiction
are all contributing factors. Sixty per-
cent of those in prison for break and
enter offences are known to have had a
heroin habit. “Governments appoint ex-
perts like me in attempts to solve prob-
lems like these,” he said, “but what
we’ve come to realise is that the sol-
utions seem to lie in a return to first
principles.
“The sense of community that has
been allowed to run down, the gap be-
tween the police and the people ...
these are the sort of things that have to
be tackled head-on before we can hope
to make a dent in the crime statistics.
It’s not a question of putting more
police on the job. We could have
100,000 police out there and it still
wouldn’t be enough.
“The public is the greatest untapped
resource the police has. It’s about time
the siege mentality was lifted and both
sides started to work together for what
is, after all, the common good.”
But at last, in Victoria and NSW at
least, attempts are being made to hit
back at the thieves with tougher
sentencing and a new and carefully co-
ordinated police-community approach.
Parrington, the man who led the long
police investigation into the death of
Griffith anti-drugs campaigner Donald
Mackay, has been appointed chief of
the NSW force’s new anti-theft branch.
Tall and gaunt, with the grey tough-
as-iron looks and gravelly voice of film
star Lee Marvin, Parrington has made a
determined start. Instead of papering
over the cracks or making excuses for
past police methods, he is galvanising
his forces with a shrewd combination of
high-tech computer data and what he
hopes will be a return to old-fashioned
community spirit much the same mix
that has proven such a success in the
Neighborhood Watch program in Vic-
toria.

major insurance companies NRMA

Dr Geoffrey Sutton: drug addiction has contributed to the increase of burglaries
ERNIE McQUILLAN
program to start in Sydney and spread
throughout the state.
Although proposals for the program
are still being drafted, the scheme
should be in operation within eight
weeks of acceptance by the police.
Victorian figures, still confidential,
are believed to show a significant drop
in home burglaries and property theft
because of the success of the Neighbor-
hood Watch program adapted from an
American model. (Japan and Britain
have them, too.) In Detroit, Neighbor-
hood Watch is largely credited with a 61
percent drop in the overall crime rate. It
helped reduce burglaries by 48 percent
in Seattle and they fell by 25 percent in
St Louis. United States Justice Depart-
ment statistics claim that Neighborhood
Watch has largely been responsible for
an overall drop of 8 percent in personal
theft, an 18 percent drop in muggings
(persbnal robbery) and a 7 percent drop
in assault.
In Melbourne, the Commercial
Union Insurance Company is under-
writing the costs of the program. Much
of the money involved is being spent on
green and white plastic gate plates and
“operation identification” stickers em-
blazoned with the distinctive Neighbor-
hood Watch logo which designate par-
ticipating homes. Finance committees
within each program also pay for
matching 4.5 cm x 6cm aluminium signs
erected at the boundaries of the Watch
zones. Householders are urged at com-
munity awareness meetings to inscribe
valuables with their driving licence
numbers, using an electric vibro-en-
graver bought by the finance committee.
(The NSW scheme is expected to have
these engraving pens made available
from suburban police stations.)
Police advise citizens on ways of
securing their homes and detecting and
observing possible criminal activity.
Each month, police statistics made
available to the Neighborhood Watch
committees are able to chart the success
of a program and encourage participa-
tion.
Inspector Bill Robinson, the officer
in charge of Victoria’s Neighborhood
Watch program, said that police were
very impressed with its impact on the
burglary statistics but that they would
not be made public until extracted from
a wider database. The Victorian pro-
gram is to be extended from 32 to 100
zones by the end of this year.
“Each of the 32 zones involves about
600 homes,” Robinson said. “That is a
total of only 23,000 people. Melbourne
has a population of 3.5 million, so we
really are just scratching the surface.
“We do feel we are on a winner here
but we don’t want to muff it before we
really know what we are on about. The
trends are very, very positive but it’s just
too early to run out and claim we’ve got
the burglars licked.
“Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of
the Victorian experience is the way in
which a new sense of community is
arising. Neighbors who haven’t spoken
to each other in years or, in some cases,
have never spoken are now able to com-
municate over a common goal. And the
police are part of this.
“We were for a long time isolated in
our comfortable little mobile cocoons,
cruising through the suburbs; now we’re
out there talking with people. People
now know their local police and I must
say the police are enjoying the new rela-
tionship. We’re helping to bring the
community together, to make it whole.”
Bill Rollo, corporate relations man-
ager for Commercial Union in Victoria,
said his company expected to pay out $2
million in claims for stolen VCRs this
year alone. “There were 78,000 home
burglaries in Victoria last year,” he said.
“That’s one every seven minutes. Ob-
viously, it’s in our interest to knock this
thing on the head.
“It involves more than mere public
relations: We’re trying to show people
that we are interested in something
other than simply collecting premiums.
The re-birth of community spirit in our
big cities may well be one of the more
extraordinary events in Australian life
over the past 30 years and we are very
pleased to be part of it.”
Commercial Union has committed
$lOO,OOO to Neighborhood Watch to
cover its first two years of operation in
metropolitan Melbourne. The company
also has an option to provide a further
$50,000 to help fund a third year.
Commercial Union has funded a
series of “Burglars Beware” advertise-
ments in Melbourne’s suburban news-


Laurie Poulton: police started losing ground when they were taken off the beat
ERNIE McQUILLAN
papers in an attempt to spread the word
about the program among the under-
world and the company is producing a
videotape which dramatises a particu-
larly horrific burglary and is meant to
be used as Neighborhood Watch teach-
ing aid.
“There is no point in disguising the
fact that a lot of break and enters are
committed by thoroughly vicious and
destructive individuals,” Rollo said.
“Often, if the thieves can’t lay their
hands on what they’re after, they smash
the furniture or vandalise the place. By
showing people a worst-case scenario,
we hope to drive home the message that
it’s up to them to secure their homes
properly. The police can’t do it on their
own; the current crime figures demon-
strate that.
“We think community awareness is
the most powerful weapon we’ve got.”
According to Rodney Smith, chief
executive of the Insurance Council of
Australia, 70 percent of all house break-
ing occurs during the daylight hours.
“The police place a great deal of em-
phasis on the activities of drug addicts
as housebreakers,” he said, “but not
nearly enough on the adolescent bur-
glar. There are dormitory suburbs
around our cities that are virtually emp-
ty during the working week. And,
during school holidays, that presents a
perfect opportunity for 12 to 14-year-
olds to indulge in a little burglary.
“There is a lot of peer pressure
involved with kids and these days it’s
not enough to simply sample a bit of
shoplifting. They go in for the big time.
We have evidence that there are very
well-established fencing operations in
some schools where kids can dispose of
all sorts of merchandise from VCRs to
color television sets.”
Although police dispute the claim,
Smith says that break and enters go up
by at least 20 percent during school hoi-

idays. “That seems to indicate that the
kids are out and about and that they are
not all innocent little possums,” he said.
“You get a couple of hefty 14-year-olds
and they can get a videotape recorder
out pretty fast.”
Parrington likens the business of
minimising the property theft epidemic
in NSW to the way in which the Chinese
dealt with their fly plague: “Every
Chinese was asked to kill at least one fly
a day,” he said, “and, with a thousand
million swatting Chinese, it didn’t take
them long before there weren’t very
many flies in China. That, in essence, is
what we have to do here. We have been
able to identify the problem, we know
how to deal with it and now it’s a ques-
tion of organising people to swat he
crooks.”
Parrington admits, though, that one
of the biggest headaches the anti-theft
squad police are going to face in NSW
is a sense of community hostility. “Over
the years,” he said, “police have gradu-
ally distanced themselves from the com-
munity.
“You can hardly blame the police:
They’ve copped a lot of abuse over alle-
gations of corruption and wrongdoing
... Police who live and work under that
sort of stigma aren’t going to go out and
seek to buddy-up to the community.
“We’ve got to work at breaking
down those barriers on both sides be-
cause we certainly can’t do this job on
our own. We’ve got to have community
support because it’s the people out there
who know what’s going on. Anyone
who has ever had a drink in a suburban
pub knows there are certain blokes who
have hot items for sale and, so long as
they are prepared to turn their backs on
it or perhaps even participate by buying
stolen property, this whole rotten busi-
ness is going to be self-perpetuating.
The good old Aussie ‘l’m all right, Jack’
mentality has got to give way to a return
to old-fashioned respect for other
people’s property.”
Chief Superintendent Laurie Poul-
ton, joint head of the NSW Community
Relations Bureau, admits that police be-
gan losing ground against house thieves
about 10 years ago when police were
taken off the beat and put into patrol
cars as a response to Sydney’s suburban
sprawl. “We gained greater mobility,”
he said, “but we paid a terrible price in
isolation from the community we were
meant to be serving.
“There was a time when local police
knew householders and shopkeepers on
a first-name basis. There was a mutual
trust and respect for what we call the
common law tradition. Our task now is
to try to rekindle that spirit of commu-
nity co-operation.”
Poulton is quick to stress that Neigh-
borhood Watch is not merely police
public relations: “The closed-shop,

‘them and us’ mentality was
allowed to go too far,” he
said. “We’ve got quite a bit of
ground to recover. No one is
denying that but the time is
right to market a new police
image.”
Parrington believes that at
least part of the upsurge in
property crime is due to what
he sees as growing community
selfishness. “We’ve lost that
sense of community some-
where along the way,” he said,
“and we’ve got to get it back.
We’ve become isolated, with-
drawn. There was a time when
people left their back doors
open so neighbors could come
and go. They left money out
for the butcher, the baker, the
candlestick-maker and it was
all on trust. No one leaves that
kind of money lying around
these days; it would be
knocked off within minutes.”
Jewellery, color television
sets and video cassette record-
ers continue to be the most
popular items among thieves
although home computers are in-
creasingly among their most frequent
targets.
“They are all easily disposable,” Par-
Community involvement: a Victorian ad warning the crooks
rington said. “We know that a great deal
of the current property theft wave is di-
rectly drug-related. A $7OO VCR sells in
a pub for about $2OO and, if you’ve got a
heroin habit that’s costing
$6OO a day, that means you
have to knock off three a day
just to keep going. Our job
will be to make people aware
that addicts are desperate
people who will take advan-
tage of any situation to satisfy
their habits.”
THE FERRET is, to say the
least, apprehensive about the
way in which Neighborhood
Watch might inpinge on what
he calls his “easy pickings.”
He said: “It just means I’ll
have to be that much more
careful.”
Cooke does not intend to
curtail his thieving. “A bloke’s
got to live,” he said, “and, be-
lieve me, I need the money.
“If things get too hot in
Newtown, I’ll go someplace
else.
“There are plenty of
suburbs where there’s just no
one home during the week.
This Neighborhood Watch
business can’t work if there’s
no one in the neighborhood to do the
watching. I think I’ll be OK. And, if I’m
not, I can always go back to dealing
dope.” □

Now, the Far North Queensland commercial...
DAVID M c NICOLL
THE LATE Sir Robert
Menzies left some wonder-
fully quotable quotes but
none better or more far-reach-
ing than his momentous dec-
laration: “Queensland is
different.” It is different
and, the further north you go,
the more different it becomes.
I’ve just come back from
the area slightly palsied and
stuffed like a Strasbourg goose
after three days as a guest of
the Amateurs. In other words,
I attended the annual beano,
shindig, assemblage, attroupe-
ment and general how’s-your-
father put on by the Far North
Queensland Amateur Turf
Club.
Why they do it, heaven
knows. What it costs, I shud-
der to think. But, for three
days in September, the cream
of Australia’s corporate estab-
lishment chiefs head north
and deliver themselves into
the hospitable hands of the in-
destructible far northerners.
How do I start the saga? Well, here
we go. The first race on the first day (yes,
it’s a two-day meeting) at the Amateurs,
saw eight horses line up for the 400 m
Crusader Oil Handicap of $2OOO. Seven
were quarterhorses and one For Your
Pleasure, owned by Sir James Killen
and banker Jim Kennedy was a thor-
oughbred. The money poured on the
quarterhorses and the bloodhorse was
about 5-2.
The thoroughbred played up at the
barrier, threw its jockey, galloped down
the track, cleared a fence and disap-
peared into the scrub. Fifteen minutes
later, to everyone’s astonishment, the
clerk of the course reappeared with For
Your Pleasure who in the meantime had
blown to 5-1. The vets pronounced her
fit to start.
The gates flew open and For Your
Pleasure, notwithstanding her Marco
Polo examination of the Cairns district,
jumped to the front and beat the quar-
terhorses by four lengths.
THE AMATEURS have been meeting
since 1959, the idea the brainchild of
local publican Les Gallagher and sup-
ported now by his tycoon son Peter. So
famous has the meeting and attendant
hospitality become that the event is a
must for governors, premiers and other
politicians.
The formal side: Amateurs convenor Sir Sydney Williams, left,
welcomes Queensland Governor Sir James Ramsay and
Victorian Governor Sir Brian Murray
This year was by way of being a fare-
well for Sir James Ramsay, the soon-to-
retire Governor of Queensland, who has
become a much-loved part of the local
landscape. He had another governor
this year for support Sir Brian Mur-
ray, up from Victoria with his stunning
wife. They had been up to Weipa, in-
specting the bauxite operation.
The first Amateurs race for the
Carlton United Cup, in 1959 was won
by Ned Williams with a moke he
brought up by ship from Brisbane. Ned,
Russell Hinze, with his wife, Fay, and Sir Robert Mathers, of Brisbane
who these days is Sir Edward,
a learned judge and chairman
of the QTC, has a good sense
of priorities. He adjourned his
inquiry into the Fine Cotton
affair so he could go north for
the weekend festivities.
THE SERIES of lunches and
dinners at the Amateurs are
hosted by companies with in-
terests in Far North Queens-
land CSR, Comalco, Carl-
ton United, Ansett, TNT, etc.
They also sponsor races to the
tune of more than $60,000.
A well-delivered bomb
landing on the Cannon race-
course during the Amateurs
would remove dozens of the
corporate chiefs of Australia
Sir Eric Neal of Boral, Sir
Eddie Cohen of CUB, Ross
Cribb (TNT), Ted Forrester
(Ansett), John Ralph (Com-
alco), John Elliott (IXL), Jim
Curry (Utah), John Reid
(James Hardie), Keith Steel
and Jack Campbell (CSR) and lan
Matheson (Westpac) to name only a few
among the company heavies.
Then there were the pols: Queens-
land Deputy Premier Bill Gunn (a clone
of Joh, if ever I saw one) and assorted
ministers including Don Lane, Martin
Tenni and, of course, Russ Hinze.
HINZE HAS to have a paragraph to
himself. I can see why he repels many
people but I can see why he fascinates
others. He is completely assured that he


is invulnerable and that
anything he does or says is
okay. You have to have lots of
confidence to sit at lunch with
a governor and his wife and
assorted big-time guests and
keep a tranny to your ear
listening to the interstate race
results. There’s no doubt
about it: Russ is a one-off.
THEN THERE were the
guests from outside Queens-
land. The Prime Minister of
Papua New Guinea Michael
Somare, and his delightful
wife, Veronica, arrived by
night as the party at the
Tobruk Pool (what a party!)
was in full swing. Cheerful, full of com-
mon sense and always interesting,
Somare had a different angle on the
Fine Cotton affair. He had backed the
second horse at Port Moresby, cursed
silently when Fine Cotton won and then
rejoiced at the disqualification.
In from the Northern Territory was
Paul Everingham, plus wife. In my
view, this comparatively young man is
headed for the political heights. I can’t
see anything stopping him.
He has earthy humor. When Cribb,
at lunch, introduced him as “Paul
Everingham, from foreign parts,” Paul
shouted: “You leave my parts alone;
that’s a private matter.” It got the
biggest laugh of the meeting.
WHERE DID everyone stay? Some at
the old-fashioned but comfortable
Great Northern, which boasts beneath
NT Chief Minister Paul Everingham and his wife, Marie, who flew in from Darwin
PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare calls to a friend in
the crowd. Deputy Premier Bill Gunn heard him clearly
its sedate exterior the swingingest piano
bar in Cairns (the Tuna Towers Banana
Bar runs a close second). Most guests
stayed at the new Pacific International,
half owned by Ansett and half by the
Kamsler family. It matches most metro-
politan top hotels.
Paul Kamsler showed me over the
Fee Marvin suite, booked annually by
the actor-fisherman. Apart from its
rooms, the suite has a private patio
where 80 guests can be entertained.
CAIRNS in winter is delightful. Beards,
babies, bikinis (an increasing number of
leotards) and happy fugitives from the
south by the hundreds.
It has been noted often that Cairns
people now pronounce the name of
their city “Cans” the same way, ex-
cept for the added “s” that the French
pronounce Cannes. John Reid, also rep-
resenting Qantas at the party,
told me that some recent Am-
erican arrivals on the new
West Coast-to-Cairns Qantas
route asked on their arrival:
“Are we in time for the film
festival?”
My companion on the
flight north was fellow-guest
Jack Ferguson, former deputy
premier of NSW. Of all the
politicians and ex-politicians
I know, I find Jack one of the
most delightful down-to-
earth, with a tremendous
sense of humor and not a bad
hand with a glass of some suit-
able libation. Jack was one of
the most popular visitors at
the Far North Queensland festivities.
AT ONE of the lunches, in the beautiful
Botanic Gardens, I was in-
troduced to Justice Peter Con-
nolly. “Are you here for the
Amateurs?” I asked. “No, I’m
sitting at Cairns,” said the
judge. “Fortunately, the jury
is out so I’m able to make this
lunch.”
WHAT ABOUT the races?
Two days, excellent fields.
The Foxwood Cup was won
by the remarkable mare
Crewshade (fourth win in a
row) who lumped 70 kilos
over 2000 metres and won by
four lengths. There were
flocks of bookies, including
one female bookie who did
steady business, and one pay-
out clerk attired in the
skimpiest bikini I have seen.
The Fashions on the Field
produced about 50 of the best-
turned-out ladies you could
hope to see. One or two were
rather extreme. One lady
wearing a fur in the Cairns’
heat looked great but must have been
roasting.
JUST WHAT constitutes Far North
Queensland?
“Far North Queensland is the area
between Fizard Island and Hamilton
Island,” said Sir Sydney Williams in
one of his speeches.
“Hear, hear,” yelled Keith Williams
who owns Hamilton Island. (I need
hardly mention that Sir Sydney Wil-
liams owns a slice of Fizard.) □

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
I would like you to meet my LISIM ...
YOU MUST have noticed that our lan-
guage is devoid of deeply sensitive
words that deal with matters relating to
sex. For some years now I have been
campaigning for a word to cover the-
mate-with-whom-you-might-happen-to-
live-but-to-whom-you-are-not-actually-
married. It is a tricky one to handle.
It has become urgent again for two
reasons: Senator Brian Harradine has
introduced a private member’s bill to re-
verse the government decision to give
travel benefits for members’ de facto
wives and the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation is in deep and terrible
trouble over a decision to give entitle-
ments to homosexual partners.
You must appreciate that these
words are not good enough. Nobody
wants to be a de facto or a homosexual
partner. I mean, we saw a former vicar
and his wife several weeks ago and nat-
urally we asked after their daughter
Raelene.
“She’s fine.”
“I suppose she’s doing her HSC?”
“Heavens, no. She finished that four
years ago.”
“Golly, she must be married.”
“No, not actually. She’s ...”
“You might as well tell him, Arthur,”
chimed in the vicar’s wife.
“Ahhh, she’s living with an engineer-
ing student in Ascot Vale. Oh, a very
nice fellow. We like him. I would think
they could even get married when he
gets through.”
“What about George?”
George was the apple of their eyes,
captain of the church cricket team.
“He’s gone on a hiking tour of
Europe.”
“On his own?”
The vicar’s wife took over. “No, he’s
with Alice, the daughter of the vicar’s
warden. They have been together now
for three years. They think marriage
would spoil their relationship. Aren’t
children funny these days?”
Now, you see, the old vicar needed
help. Living unmarried with a sexual
partner is utterly acceptable in 1984 but
there is no word to cover it. You can call
him/her your stablemate. But, then,
“stablemate” doesn’t quite cover the
special relationship. You can go for
“co-habitor.” “Hello, Aunty May. I’d
like you to meet my co-habitor, Helen.”
No, it doesn’t work.
You could say: “Helen and I are liv-
ing together.” But that is not good
enough, either. It would satisfy neither
Senator Harradine nor Ken Myer. You
could be living with 15 Helens in a com-
mune in Rathdowne Street, Carlton.
“Mistress,” of course, is beyond the
pale. Try calling a modern girl your
mistress and she will clout you behind
the ear with her weight-lifting gear.
Then remember how Time magazine
used to be very coy. If a celebrated crea-
ture were living with somebody and
they were more than just mates Time
would always say, for example: “Errol
Flynn’s great and good friend.” When-
ever they said “great and good friend,”
you knew it was on.
All right. I invented a word
LISIM. Now, LISIM means Living In
Sin Illegal Mate. It has a nice euphoni-
ous ring about it. It covers both hetero-
sexual and homosexual partners. It rolls
off the tongue without causing a blush to
anyone and I propose to pass it on to
Oxford, Websters, the Sidney J. Baker
dictionary of the Australian language
and Eric Partridge.
It will relieve everyone of embarrass-
ment. “Hello, Aunty. I would like you
to meet Phyllis, my new LISIM.”
Where’s Agnes? “Oh, hell, I can
never keep track of Agnes. The last I
heard of her, she was hiking in the
Himalayas with her LISIM.”
The uses of LISIM could be many.
One of the deepest problems of our
modern society is keeping up with rela-
tionships. You never know any more
who is with whom.
I would like to see a LISIM column
in the paper to go with Births, Deaths,
Engagements and Funerals.
“Sir Alexander and Lady
Throgmorton of Weepers Lane,
Chisslewit, Surrey, wish to announce
that their son Jonathon Pride
Throgmorton is LISIM with Cheryl
Grump of Koala St, Redfern.”
“Graham Fosdick of Spring Hill,
Brisbane, wishes to announce fresh
lisiming. He is no longer LISIM to Kate
Ocker of Aspley. He has moved
in with Maureen Comely of In-
dooroopilly.”
Indeed, it would be helpful to all
concerned if we could have further an-
nouncements such as: “Garth Blossom
and his LISIM, Melody Leftfoot,
proudly announce the birth of their son
Kim, 3kg, at Mt Pleasant Hospital on
September 10. Thanks to Dr Kildare
and staff.”
Frankly, I would like to talk to both
Senator Harradine and Ken Myer about
LISIM. I don’t believe that lisimry
should be treated lightly. We wouldn’t
want our MPs or ABC staff to be fickle
in their lisiminous relationships. They
should be even more lisimonious than
marriage.
What’s more, we are campaigning
for an official lisimit.
In other words, no benefits would be
paid unless said member or staffers had
been lisiming for two years. □

ANNE ROSENGREN
Jimmy Breslin, star columnist in the
New York Daily News, has hired the
City hall for a debate with Rupert
Murdoch on the subject of truth. Says
Breslin: “I intend to use this debate as
the start of a campaign to summon the
anger of the populace and drive Rupert
Murdoch out of my city.” Rupert has
not yet answered the invitation.
Statistics, mostly vital: Marlene Dietrich
is now either 80 or 83. She lives in a
three-room apartment on the fifth floor
of an elegant building on the Avenue
Montaigne, Paris. She spends much of
her time in bed she broke a hip in
1975 and again in 1981 tended by a
housekeeper and a 53-year-old male
secretary. But she still gets up at 6 am to
dust, polish and care for her plants, still
loves to cook and still sees a small circle
of friends. Her daughter, Maria Riva, is
now 59. The men in Dietrich’s life have
been: Rudolph Sieber, to whom she was
married from 1924 until his death in
1976, Jean Cabin, Yul Brynner, Joe
DiMaggio, Ernest Hemingway and the
novelist Erich Maria Remarque. Of
Hemingway, she told a biographer:
“The love between us had nothing to do
with sex; Hemingway, I might say, was
above the sexual.” And, asked if she
fears death: “Naaah. One should be
afraid of life, not death.”


To publicise a new motel at Port Mac-
quarie, NSW, the little port’s mayor,
John Sterndale, visited Sydney to pre-
sent a bottle of Macquarie port to Lord
Mayor Doug Sutherland. Common or
garden Sydneysiders could not expect
to be so lucky: the motel cost $7.5 mil-
lion so the rest of the giveaways were
bottles of sand. Genuine Port Mac-
quarie sand, though.
When it comes to swimming, Sandra
Symons, the editor of Mode, is not a
whole lot better than a Spanish mack-
erel; nor is she a whole lot worse. Five
times a week she swims, non-stop,
1600 m at the Hyde Park Club in Syd-
ney. Yet she had never tried scuba
diving until, on assignment in the
Whitsundays in the first days of spring,
she was shown how by a courtly
Queenslander. Once she emerged snuffl-
ing, complaining that her mask was
leaking and he splendid fellow took
off his, lent it to her and went back to
their accompanying yacht. When she
got back, she was wonderstruck. “It’s
marvellous,” she said. “How could you
bear to give it away?” To which, of
course, the answer was: “Ah, well, I
wasn’t too keen on that dirty big shark.
Didn’t you see it down there ... ?”
Ascetic trenchermen at the Festival of
Light fell back with faint cries when de-
tails of lickerishness and sin were laid
bare not so much by pecksniffery as by
dispassionate bureaucracy. In San
Diego, California, Joe Conforte, the
world’s biggest-deal whoremaster, is in
the slammer not only because he owns
and lives off the biggest big whorehouse
in Nevada the Mustang but also
because he owes Uncle Sam $l7 MIL-
LION in taxes. If that’s the tax bill, say
the Feasters, what on earth were the
gross profits?
Those interested in a drop of the good
stuff now and then could do worse than
join Operation Blizzard to the Antarctic
in November to restore Douglas
Mawson’s hut and perhaps to sample
some of the Four Crown port with
which the Yalumba people supplied the
Mawson expedition in 1929. Still more
OK wines with names such as
Heggie’s, Pewsey Vale and Angas are
being supplied at the direction of
the present Yalumba czar Wyndham
(Windy) Smith. Why Windy? Yalumba
was founded in 1849 by Sydney Smith.
His son, Walter G., sold wine and
canned fruit in India and HIS partner
was Percy Wyndham, after whome
Windy was named.
When Leo Schofield who describes

A voice from the grave
PHILLIP ADAMS
A FEW weeks back I wrote about the
League of Rights, that unlovely organ-
isation of rabid racists who continue to
infiltrate both the National and Liberal
parties. I gave a potted biography of the
league’s leader, Eric Butler, who insists
that the Holocaust didn’t happen; that
the extermination of the Jews is a myth;
that gas chambers are a publicity stunt.
Mind you, Butler believes all sorts of
strange things. For example, he argues
that Hitler was a Jew the illegitimate
son of Baron Rothschild.
My article provoked two fatuous let-
ters: one from Butler that failed to re-
fute a single fact and another from John
Bennett, Melbourne’s revisionist histor-
ian. He’s the one who sees concentra-
tion camps as little worse than Butlins,
who echoes the line of ultra-right histor-
ians that “there is no credible evidence
of a plan to exterminate Jews or of gas-
sing in gas chambers.”
While not drawn to religion, I find
the Bennett-Butler line blasphemous, a
more monstrous obscenity than any-
thing to be found in the nastiest video
nasty, a slander against the millions of
people Jews and others who died in
the concentration camps. But, rather
than waste further space on such lunacy
(and I’m always conscious that any pub-
licity tends to swell the ranks of organ-
isations such as the league), I’d have let
the matter rest.
However, two things happened.
First, my 15-year-old daughter came
home from school where a teacher had
told her and classmates including a
Jewish kid that the Holocaust was a
hoax. A man given to expressing some-
what eccentric views in various Letters
to Editors, he had signed up with Butler
and Bennett.
Second, a letter arrived from a Bul-
letin reader.
“Dear Mr Adams,
“Agitated by the lunacy of Mr Ben-
nett’s arguments, I’ve written the at-
tached letter to your editor. On second
thoughts, however, I decided not to
send it. I have valid grounds for such a
decision. The Nazis and neo-Nazis have
memories which are long indeed and
the Werewolf and similar organisations
have kept me in their revengeful focus
for years.
“So I’m sending it to you. You may
use it, if you wish, without disclosing my
address. At my age, all I want is some
comfort and peace of mind.” (My corre-
spondent was a political prisoner in
Auschwitz between 1941 and 1945. And
SS women among “mythical” Belsen victims
ASSOCIATED PRESS
lest Bennett say that the correspondent,
too, is a party of the Jewish conspiracy,
let me emphasise that he’s non-Jewish).
“I worked as an electrician in the
camp. My work included installation of
power supply to five underground gas
chambers within the camp.
“I was also frequently required to re-
pair cables attached to the gas chamber
ceilings. These cables were repeatedly
damaged by the victims, whilst they
were being choked to death by the Cyc-
lone B.
“I would enter the gas chambers
shortly after the ventilation ended as the
lights had to be restored before the next
batch could be sent into the chamber.
“Pyramided heaps of contorted bod-
ies of men, women and children filled
the chambers. These people were trying
to end their climb on the top of others to
reach for the disappearing air. Before
they all died of cyanosis suffocation,
some managed to reach the concrete
ceilings, ripping off wires or lamps.
“The gas chambers were in use all the
time I was in that camp the weak, ill
and unproductive Jews, Gypsies, Poles,
Russians, etc (but not Germans) were
gassed and cremated daily, sometimes
in the thousands. But after the battle of
Stalingrad (when many Germans be-
came PoWs in Soviet hands) the gas-
sing, of ever-growing propor-
tions and numbers, was al-
most reserved for Jews and
Gypsies.
“During 1944, when the
camp population reached
300,000, the quota of deaths
by gas was around 30,000 a
day. Among approximately
4.5 million destroyed in
Auschwitz, well over half
were Jews and over 750,000
were Gypsies.
“I was a witness at Nurem-
berg. I gave evidence at the
International War Crimes Tri-
bunal, in the first main trial,
against the Gestapo chief
Kaltenbrunner and at the sec-
ond main trial against
Himmler’s deputy, Oswald
Pohl, and eight of his subordi-
nate SS generals. These men
were in overall charge of con-
centration camps, described
as ‘the main economic enter-
prise of the SS.’ They attended
gassings on occasions and
supervised far-reaching plans
for the further development
of Auschwitz into a gigantic
‘Himmlerstadt’ or Himmler City. By
1948, had the war not ended before, it
would have contained three million in-
mates with a capacity of 200,000 daily
exterminations in gas chambers.
“These blueprints, designed at the
offices of the Central Construction Au-
thority of the SS, were seen by me and
hundreds of others connected with con-
struction work at Auschwitz and, if not
many survived, our testimony at the
trials withstood all tests. I was cross-
examined for weeks by the best legal
brains of Germany, appearing in their
hundreds for the defence at each court
proceedings. They could not undermine
my account of the facts.
“Napoleon Bonaparte, the most
publicised personage in human history,
was declared by certain biographers
only 50 years after his death to be never
existent.
“The so-called researchers quoted by
Mr Bennett, who deny the gassings and
Holocaust, are obviously in the same
category.
“I am an old man now and don’t like
to revive past and painful memories.
I forgave but cannot forget. But any at-
tempt to reverse the facts of mass
genocide carried out by the Nazis is rid-
iculous.” □

1984, the year of Newkspeak
RON SAW
I’M GOING to buy time on all the tele-
vision and radio stations in Sydney one
day soon and, unpredictably, I’ll burst
on to the airwaves shouting “Nicar-
AHGWA, Los ANGELUS, LAS Vegas”
until they cut me off.
Nobody will take the slightest notice,
of course ... not for the first two or
three months. But, sooner or later, I’ll
become a known ratbag and:
“What’s with this bloke?”
“Something about Nicker-agg-ewer
and Los Angeleez and Los Vegas, I
think.”
“What about ’em?”
“Search me.”
And then they’ll go back to talking
with the sports staff about Iven Lendl
and Alane Prost and no sooner will they
have turned their backs than I’ll be on
the trumpet again: “Nicar-AHGWA,
Los ANGELUS, LAS Vegas, EE-
VAHN Lendl, Al-AN Prost...”
Still no notice. But I’ll hang in there
on a pirate wavelength. The Prime Min-
ister will make some plonking state-
ment, the Leader of the Opposition, the
Pope, the chairman of the Elvis Presley
Fan Club and in I’ll bust: .. Nicar-
AHGWA, Los ANGELUS, LAS Vegas,
EE-VAHN ...”
Oh, they’ll stop me they’ll come for
me with ropes and strait-jackets but,
even while I’m shrieking in my padded
cell, somebody will be getting the mes-
sage.
This subject, I know, I attacked a
scant two months ago. But some sub-
jects need a damn good nagging.
Why in the name of heaven do we
behave this way? Why do we speak so
badly, so carelessly? It can’t be plain
laziness: nobody could be as lazy as
that.
The only defence I’ve heard is: “So
what? If that’s the way we pronounce it,
then it’s right innet it?”
No, it bloody-well isn’t.
If you are not too tired, try to cast
your mind back to the days when we
resolutely told the Poms how to pro-
nounce Melbourne and Bris-
bane and Derby and Albany.
A classic horse race in Brit-
ain may well be something
pronounced the Darby and all
the fashionable young fellers
of Oscar Wilde’s day may
have had rooms in The Awl-
bny. But that port in northern
WA is pronounced Durby and
the people who live in that
chilly little town in the south-
west call it Al-bny. And: For the 1984
Olympic Games, Rupert Murdoch had
about 100 reporters in Los Angeles.
Every one of them would have heard
the Angelinos discussing, perhaps no
more than naming, their city. Certainly,
the reporters would have heard the
mayor welcoming them to “Los
ANGELUS.” And - on TV and, I sup-
pose, radio probably 95 of those 100
reporters told Australians about Los
Angeleez.
That big, amiable, moustachioed ten-
nis feller John Newcombe was for some
reason part of the coverage. He must
have heard his fellow announcers
well, a few of them pronouncing it
properly: if he worked with idiot boards
the idiot-boarders must have written it
phonetically for him. Somebody, surely,
must have known enough to tell him.
Yet not once did Newk get it right.
Frankly, I don’t know the “right”
pronunciation. It’s quite possible that
every Spaniard and Mexican in the
world shudders when he hears Los
ANGELUS; it’s almost certain that a
million Poms faint dead away when
they hear Melbn, Brisbn, Albny and
Durby but we’d be just as wrong if we
said Darby about Derby, WA, as we are
when we say Angeleez.
Anybody who wants a real argument
should get to work on the word “sched-
ule.” It’s reasonable to ask whether if
you pronounce it shedule you also
talk about shool, sheme and shizo-
phrenia.
Anybody who was ever in action
with American forces used the term Ell
Zee (for LZ or helicopter landing zone),
not Ell Zed. For a while, it seemed that a
wonderful breakthrough had been
made. Z pronounced zed? How crazy.
How do we get a D into Z? Do we
talk about zedoos, zedebras, zedeal,
zedinc, Zedionists and Zedoroas-
trianists? I once put that, in a smartarse
way, to a professor of English.
“You’re probably right,” he said.
“And, while we’re about it, we should
get another pronunciation for W. I al-
ways feel I should be talking about
doubleyew-ine and doubleyew-omen.”
That, mind you, is bringing rationale
into it and that will never do. The last
refuge of traditionalists is that there is
nothing rational, nothing logical, about
the English language.
Certainly, logic and rationale have
nothing to do with the Australian lan-
guage unless we agree that our only
uniformity is that we’re just too damned
lazy to speak properly.
We have the hide to laugh at New
Zealanders because they won’t pro-
nounce Is thn, fsh, trm, wnd, sx, etc
but we’re giving up the attempt to pro-
nounce any penultimate vowels at all.
Try listening to radio and TV: Nissn,
Edm cheese, carpt, saucepn, strawbry,
lavatry, towl, cabnt...
Well, never mind about penulti-
mates; never mind about just vowels.
In the past week on TV, I’ve heard
people who should know better per-
forming like infants. The NSW minister
for Police, Peter Anderson, spoke
relentlessly of pleece. And a weather
girl on the ABC told us about the
tempecher.
The news gives my mind a pretty
nasty tossing around no matter where I
hear it.
Why can’t somebody say “govern-
ment” instead of “gummint?”
Getting back to the weather, Dal
Myles, the sometime weatherman on
Sydney’s Channel 10, keeps trying
chummily to say “and for us” and can
manage no better than “anfrus.”
Still, by far the worst vocal crime
now a habit was in-
troduced, I think, by Michael
Willesee. Signing off, he’d say
words to the effect of, “The
program will be back on
Friday night and WE’LL SEE
YOU THEN.” This loath-
some habit has been taken up
by Katrina Lee and Tim Web-
ster, on Channel 10, and a
man called me the other day
to tell me that Simon Towns-
end urging his viewers to
wait through a commercial
break had said: “See you in
a moment.”
Well, he didn’t see me. □

THE ARTS
Graeme Blundell: standing
tall in the theatre
Despite a career in films, television and on stage which often has suggested
otherwise, actor/director Graetne Blundell insists that he has always
been part of the establishment and as SUSAN MOLLOY reports
he is relishing his new role in the revitalised Australian theatre.
IN THE overwhelming confusion of
musicians, singers, actors, and props at
the tired end of another long rehearsal
day, Graeme Blundell is a slight figure.
And he knows it: It’s something he
plays on. His height just that little bit
below average is a joke against him-
self. His naughty-little-schoolboy face,
still mischievous after 39 years, creases
in gleeful self-mockery at the very men-
tion of his acting career.
“In film they want tall actors with
names like Bryan, Jack, Helen,” he says.
“I say, ‘Down with actresses with size 9
feet.’ And in the beginning here, in
theatre, it was awful. No one realises
how awful it used to be. There was
nothing. When I started, there was
virtually no Australian theatre.
“It was, as John Romeril has said,
like the history of the VW: The parts
were made overseas and assembled
here.
“I was told I was too little and too
Australian to be an Australian actor.
Bruce Spence was told he was too tall
and too Australian, even though he is a
New Zealander.
“All there were were tall English ac-
tors prancing round or tall Australian
actors asked to be tall English actors.”
People such as Blundell, in the nos-
talgic, mad, bad days of Melbourne in
the late 19605, helped form indigenous
Australian theatre at the Pram Factor).
But his first professional performance
was with the Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany, (MTC) and it is this rock of estab-
lished theatre to which he has returned.
He went back six weeks ago to the
school which helped create him, as one
of three associate directors.
Blundell’s first production in this
somewhat exalted position is the Bertolt
Brecht/Kurt Weill The Threepenny Op-
era which opens next week.
While it is de rigeur in some circles to
“knock” the Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany. Blundell says he has never been
part of that.
He acted in some pretty terrible
films, explored some other byways of
the business. Might he not then, per-
haps, have assumed some mantle of
anti-establishment? Not so, he says. “I
was always part of the establishment. I
do not see any reason to become en-
trenched and conservative because you
work for Crawfords or McElroy and
McElroy or Fairfax or Packer. And I
like the more conservative things now.
“I really enjoyed doing On Our Sel-
ection. It was one of our (the MTC’s)
biggest hits. Then I did Filumena, a
Graeme Blundell: “I want the chance to consolidate the directing part of my career”


BRIAN FERGUSON
beautifully-crafted piece. The next thing
I’ll be doing is a Graham Greene-ish
piece, A Pack Of Lies. There is a sub-
stance to these pieces. I’ve spent most of
my life doing new stuff and having argu-
ments with writers.”
Blundell sees himself as a two-city
person, with a rented house with his
wife and child in East Melbourne while
his former wife and two children live in
Sydney. Before emigrating back to Mel-
bourne, he bought a house in Kings
Cross.
“I’d better not say anything bad
about Sydney theatre because I may
want to work there again not that I
did any work in theatre for the five years
I was there, except for benefit nights for
the Nimrod ...
“But, you know, I quite like being
multifunctional ... I’m
writing books on Aus-
tralian humor and do-
ing magazine writing. I
am in that loathesome
area of celebrity
journalism, which most
people in the trade hate.
Living on my nerves, I
find I have to have a lot
of things happening.
“Maybe it is because
of insecurity. Really, it
is fear. I just have this
drive to do adjacent projects.
“It has cost me money to come back
to Melbourne but, at 39, I want the
chance to consolidate the directing part
of my career. I’ve directed about 60 or
70 shows at the Pram Factory and
Paul Cox: boosting film
Hoopla (which became
the Playbox Theatre)
but this company gave
me an important oppor-
tunity.”
Oh yes, he says, a
gay mafia is definitely in
control of areas of Syd-
ney theatre: “One of the
reasons people are
coming back to Mel-
bourne is a feeling that
heterosexuality may be
back in fashion. That’s
not a bad thing.
“And you really have to work here.
As they say, in Sydney you look for the
flaws in Patrick’s glass and in Mel-
bourne you work out who went to Don’s
party.
“There’s a certain buoyancy in Mel-
bourne. Film has a real buzz in it, with
Richard Lowenstein and Paul Cox, and
the MTC has a new lease of life. Audi-
ences are up and we’re even getting new
audiences. The cabaret scene is very
well entrenched and successful. The
comic arts area is well developed here. I
mean, there is a lot happening. The cul-
ture area is on a big up.”
Blundell says that he “agonised”
over whether to play Alvin Purple yet
again in the McElroy and McElroy $2.5
million film Melvin, Son Of Alvin which
should be released at Christmas.
“My mates said, ‘You’re mad; take
the money.’ So I did. Oddly, I enjoy
combining a lowbrow career with a
highbrow career.
“I did the first Alvin because I was
totally broke and had three small chil-
dren. Anyway, 1 enjoy the glamor and
silliness of working in film.”
It’s neither glamorous nor silly in re-
hearsals for The Threepenny Opera, the
satire on the bourgeois society of the
Weimar Republic, first staged in 1928.
Blundell’s old mate Red Symons
once a guitarist for the 70s pop band
Skyhooks and lately musical director
for television, films and shows is mu-
sical director for this street opera. He
has a fleeting blow-up with actor/chor-
eographer David Atkins and some ac-
tors who cannot remember some lines.
Blundell, who says he has been
screamed at by too many wives and
children, does not want to know about
rehearsal tensions.
He has a 12-month contract with the
Melbourne Theatre Company and
seems quite happy to continue being as-
sociate director. It is unlikely that the
director, 61-year-old John Sumner, will
retire. The company is still very much
his baby. □


FILM-MAKING
Director is
dolebound
no longer
The coalminers of Strikebound: an unashamedly political message
By FIA CUMMING
AFTER a 15-month stretch on the dole
recently, Richard Lowenstein easily
could be mistaken for one of the unfor-
tunate unemployed.
While this may have been the case,
those dole payments helped him to sur-
vive while creating a highly-regarded
film which not only breaks new ground
but also stands to make some money.
Lowenstein, 24, returned recently
from four months overseas, during
which Strikebound the film he wrote
and directed was well reviewed by the
critics.
At Cannes, Strikebound was singled
out from among the 35 Australian ex-
hibits for packed houses, a full-page re-
view in the prestigious Le Matin news-
paper and a flood of invitations from
other film festivals. From there it went
to the Karlovy Vary festival in Czecho-
slovakia the most important in the
Eastern Bloc and won the main
award, then to Venice where it was
given a rare ovation at the Critics Week.
It also will be shown at the Edinburgh,
London, New York and Pia (Japan)
film festivals.
The Australian premiere, launched
by Prime Minister Bob Hawke, was held
on September 8 in Wonthaggi, Victoria.
The film opened in Sydney on Sep-
tember 13 and will open in Melbourne
on September 20.
Lowenstein began work on
Strikebound shortly after his 21st birth-
day, fresh from the Swinburne Film and
Television School in Melbourne where
he had shown obvious talent. The idea
came from a book by his mother,
Wendy Lowenstein, recording an inter-
view with an ageing couple on their ex-
periences during a coalminers’ strike
during the 19305.
Richard went back to the couple,
Agnes and Wattie Doig, and inter-
viewed them in more detail about the
strike. With their help, he developed the
story into a film combining documen-
tary and drama. Agnes and Wattie ap-
pear in a personal prologue and epi-
logue to the film, reflecting on what life
was like in those times.
The result is, unlike virtually all fea-
tures of the new Australian cinema, an
unashamedly political film which shows
the Depression years in all their cruelty
but also the human strength and humor.
Lowenstein says: “I though it was time
Australian films stopped wallowing in
their own nostalgia and prettiness and
in some ways showed the ugliness of the
situation, which doesn’t mean it can’t be
visual at the same time.”
Where films such as Caddie used the
Depression only as a visual backdrop,
Strikebound explores the social phe-
nomenon of the time; the extraordinary
strength of left-wing union militants
and the Communist Party.
But Lowenstein insisted it should be
both true to history, as seen through the
Doigs’ eyes, and a sensory experience
for the audience. Each person working
on the film agreed and tried to make
their own contribution a work of art.
Lowenstein says modestly: “I guess I
have a bit of integrity but it’s more a
matter of doing a story justice. I wasn’t
about to do a second-rate film about a
fantastic story. The story was inspiring
everybody who worked on the film
they would have worked for nothing if I
had asked them.”
There were plenty of problems in
achieving the standard Lowenstein
wanted. First was money. Distributors,
investors and producers alike dis-
approved of the quasi-documentary
structure which Lowenstein wanted and
warned that the film would go nowhere
without cuts. Lowenstein responded
with anger and more determination.
Even as the film entered pre-produc-
tion, he took jobs producing film clips
for rock bands to make money, almost
all of which went into the film. One of
the clips, for Tim Finn’s Fraction Too
Much Friction, was voted among the
world’s 10 best by the Los Angeles
Times.
The investors refused to pay for
stereo sound, which is virtually unheard
of in a film with a $500,000 budget (the
final figure was $750,000). After three
months’ wrangling, Lowenstein raised
the money himself and put it into the
film as an “interest free loan.” Now the
sound track is one of the film’s assets.
On such a low budget, however, it was
inevitable that some corners had to be
cut. Lowenstein says: “It’s about 50 per-
cent of what I had hoped it would be. I
was still very young when we started
shooting I could kick myself for some
of the mistakes I made then.”
With Strikebound into the cinemas
after more than three years’ work, Low-
enstein hopes not for riches but simply
for more work offers to keep him off the
dole during his next projects. He has
two film ideas ready to develop: one is a
black comedy, anti-James Bond, set in
Australia, the other another semi-docu-
mentary about a rock band trying to
break into the business, with lots of mu-
sic and using film clip technology.
But whatever the subject, Lowenstein
says he will make films with a message.
He believes Strikebound is very relevant
to today and not just because of
events such as the coalminers’ strike in
Britain. It is all too easy for workers
to forget how hard they had to struggle
for better conditions and for employers
to revert to old practices, he says.
The last coal mine in Victoria was
closed in 1968 but the old mine at
Wonthaggi was opened for use during
the film. Hundreds of millions of litres
of water had to be pumped out, the crew
faced unexpected dangers and the
grimy coal dust coating the actors’ faces
is the real thing.
Wonthaggi was treated to its gala
opening, in the town’s Union Commu-
nity Arts Centre. But it will also have a
more lasting memorial the coal mine
which is now in working order and
proving a popular tourist attraction. □


Few cars have
new Crown's set
of standards.
V—-
gS®;
SBS
Take a close look at the standards offered
in Australia's luxury car market.
The fact is for all their high price tags, a lot
of so-called luxury cars offer you relatively few
standard features.
Toyota Crown is one of the very few cars
offering a complete set of standards.
Crown's engineering standards include
an advanced 2.8 Super Responsive engine
with electronic fuel injection,
4 wheel disc brakes, full-frame
chassis, vehicle speed sensitised
power steering and fully independent rear sus-
pension with trailing arms.
Inside Crown pampers you with power
windows, air conditioning, moquette cloth
seating, telescopic steering column, even a
small refrigerator to keep drinks cool.
They're all, along with many other fea-
tures far too numerous to describe here, stan-
dard on the new Toyota Crown.
Yet on some "luxury cars'' such basic
standards as air conditioning and power win-
dows are add-on options at extra cost.
No matter how much you're prepared to
pay for a luxury car, you'll usually find Crown
offers a comparable list of standard luxury.
So consider Toyota Crown alongside any
luxury car you can think of. When it comes to
standard luxury, we're sure Crown will
compare very comfortably indeed.

DANCE
Quicksilver
tarnished by
funding cut
By JOHN CARGHER
THE Victorian Ministry for the Arts
might do worse than invest in one of
those cheap pocket calculators. It used
to share the running costs of Adelaide’s
Australian Dance Theatre, accepting
the company as the official Victorian
dance company in place of
Ballet Victoria, which self-
destructed in 1975.
ADT and its energetic di-
rector, Jonathan Taylor,
brought a breath of fresh air
into the Victorian dance
scene, though the tutu-and-
pointe brigade took some con-
vincing that the strange aroma
was not poison gas. The
growth of modern dance thus
begun and paralleled by in-
terstate companies grew
slowly, did not cost the sky
and had an assured future.
Came the dawn late last
year. Without warning ADT’s
annual Victorian grant of
$260,000 was withdrawn. The
details of negotiations and
financial adjustments are too
complex to detail but the min-
istry offered $130,000 for the
current year to enable ADT to
give a nine-performance Mel-
bourne season at the Play-
house in the new State
Theatre complex and make a
two-week tour of the country.
The $260,000 had given
Victoria half the company’s
work each year and a
guaranteed three seasons in
Melbourne. This year’s
$130,000 gives it one month
and one season the cost of
the latter in the expensive
Playhouse reducing the com-
pany’s activities even further.
Schoolboy arithmetic shows
this to be a poor bargain com-
pared with the old arrange-
ment, unless the ministry has
plans to build up some other
group or intends to rotate
visiting companies. If so, it is
a secret guarded more closely
than the private conversations
of our politicians.
The season at the Playhouse proved
that ADT is as good a company as ever
and, with proper subsidies, it certainly
could become the major force its grow-
ing public had anticipated.
At its best, in Glen Tetley’s Revel-
ation and Fall, it equals anything which
can be seen overseas. Tetley’s work is
way-out modern in the worst possible
way, created in the best possible way. It
means only what the viewer can see in it
but the apparent gobbledegook blends
smoothly Peter Maxwell Davies’ music,
Michael Pearce’s costumes and scenery
and William Akers’ lighting with
Tetley’s choreography.
People who do not like Picasso or
Pollock cannot ignore the fact that their
paintings are valued in millions of dol-
lars because millions of people get
pleasure from looking at them. Revel-
Robert Canning in Glen Tetley’s Revelation and Fall: way-out
ation and Fall comes into the same
category, except that public perform-
ances can be seen by no more than 850
people at once. Yet a Picasso work and
a Tetley ballet can’t gain universal ad-
miration unless they, and similar works,
are accessible. In the case of ADT Vic-
toria is being denied that privilege.
It would be nice to say that the bal-
ance of the program was on the same
exalted plane. It was not. Barry
Moreland’s Palestra is an open-ended
exercise in gymnastics which takes
place surprise in a gymnasium.
(Italians call a gymnasium a palestra.
Why was the ballet not called Gymna-
sium!)
Putting a (very good) pianist, Robert
Curry, on the stage is not exactly origin-
al but Nina Thomson’s set design gives
the proceedings a very definite lift. Pal-
estra is fine as far as it goes,
which is not far enough
choreographically and too far
in its lengthy silent periods
during which audiences clear
their throats a gimmick
which has worn out its wel-
come.
The world premiere of
Jonathan Taylor’s Quicksilver
was grossly unfair to the
dancers, so obviously was it
under-rehearsed. Basically it
is an ideal closing ballet; joy-
ous and full of movement
which proves that the ADT
dancers are just as good as
those of the Australian Ballet.
Choreographically its major
failing is that it only uses the
full ensemble; there are no
solos or minor variations
whatever. Taylor’s positive
and inventive steps are diffi-
cult to follow in such continu-
ous mass movement.
The music is a Bach violin
concerto and, though the
dancers appear in tights and
not clown costumes, there are
a few echoes of Taylor’s other,
better Bach ballet Flibber-
tigibbett. Still, the technical
virtuosity of so many dancers
is almost as surprising as their
raggedness was at the prem-
iere. Here is a worthwhile bal-
let, just the kind this company
needs after Taylor puts
more work into it.
But rehearsal time costs
money and while ADT is in
limbo it is painful to speak
harshly of dancers who are
clearly able to do the job
properly. South Australia is
giving $550,000 in 1985 to the
once joint state company. Vic-
toria’s failure to match this is
incomprehensible. □

THE MEDIA
Broadcasting
tribunal
in a bind
The ABT’s David Jones: there’s no shortage of paper work
KENT MEARS
By GERALDINE WALSH
A POSTER at British railway stations
during World War II inquired: “Is your
journey really necessary?”
The question was posed in the na-
tional interest. Perhaps a similar one
should be asked today about the work
of our national broadcasting regulatory
body, the Australian Broadcasting Tri-
bunal (ABT): “Is your public inquiry
really necessary?”
The rationale behind the establish-
ment of the tribunal was that “the
electro-magnetic spectrum (air waves,
in layman’s terms) is both a public util-
ity and scarce national resource” and,
therefore, broadcasting licences should
be issued and controlled to prevent
communications anarchy.
This country has had such licences
since broadcasting began here, but the
tribunal was to be a different animal to
its forerunner, the Broadcasting Control
Board.
Broadcasting has changed consider-
ably in Australia since the tribunal came
into being in 1977. It was then respon-
sible for the overseeing of 249 television
and radio licences; today it is respon-
sible for 438.
Tribunal membership has increased
from three to seven but staff has in-
creased in the same period from some
106 (at June 30, 1978) to only 115 in
June this year. About 50 members of the
staff are in Melbourne, which does not
make for smooth operation.
The tribunal chairman, David Jones,
requested funding from this year’s
budget to fill 27 new positions. The sum
of $316,000 was allocated to increase by
eight the average staffing level for the
year. Yet the establishment approved by
the Public Service Board is 187 a rec-
ognition of the tribunal’s burgeoning
workload.
In a press release at budget time,
Communications minister Michael
Duffy acknowledged that “the number
of inquiries and hearings has grown
substantially and recent developments
in administrative law have placed ad-
ditional pressure on staffing.”
The full station licences are the im-
portant ones and number 237 com-
prising 137 commercial radio stations,
50 commercial television stations and
50 public broadcasting stations.
By and large, the rest of the 438 are
ancillary licences translator and re-
peater stations which relay parent
stations’ programs. Their licence renew-
als are generally heard separately.
Licence renewals are a predictable
part of the tribunal’s workload.
A station which has adhered to the
Broadcasting and Television Act and
the tribunal’s standard can assume the
maximum period of renewal, three
years. However, the vast majority of
stations no matter how faultless
have to undergo public inquiries. Any
public submission regarding renewal
obliges a hearing.
The number of television station li-
cences has been static since 1977 but 50
public radio stations have been licensed
since 1979 and the ranks of commercial
radio stations have increased by nine in
that time.
Jones is philosophical about the tri-
bunal work load, saying that the media
are an attractive area in which sales and
purchases take place constantly. Yet, he
says, he does wonder about the need to
gain administrative approval for the ac-
quisition of even one share which puts
the purchaser into the position of hold-
ing a prescribed interest (5 percent of
capital for TV and 15 percent for radio).
The tribunal could be forgiven if it
felt itself beleaguered. It faces four chal-
lenges in the Federal Court to its stan-
dards and one Freedom of Information
Act appeal in the Administrative Ap-
peals Tribunal. Jones is not fazed. He
thinks that “perhaps some aspects of the
tribunal’s power should have been
tested before.”
He says: “The whole ball game, in
terms of administrative law, in this
country, has changed a fact not
sufficiently appreciated and has to be
taken into account by us.”
The scope for judicial review of ad-
ministrative decisions has slowed the
pace at which tribunal decisions can be
made.
“I’m not prepared to cut corners,”
says Jones. “We can’t afford to put out
things that aren’t right and to get things
right takes more time, more resources
and more effort. That’s a fact of life.
People have to accept in this day and
age the size of the decisions, the
amounts involved and the sort of pro-
cess that has to be gone through ...
“How much is a TV station in Perth
worth? The last one changed hands at
$5O million. How many courts deal with
matters involving $5O million? They are
not only major commercial matters,
they are major matters for the people
who are getting the service. That’s where
our responsibility lies to come up
with the right decisions for the public,
as an independent body.”
The third TV licence for Perth is a
classic example of the time-consuming
preliminary work, sitting days and re-
port-writing that faces the tribunal’s
seven members and staff. It is expected
that there will be 10 or more applicants
and possibly five parties seeking stand-
ing.
The tribunal estimates that the hear-
ing will take three months. Continuous
sitting in Perth will not be possible:
members will need breaks to take part
in other on-going work of the tribunal.
The amount of work going the tri-
bunal’s way seems to be growing like
Topsy. Surely, something has to give.
Logically, some of the more trivial re-
quirements imposed on broadcasters
and tribunal alike should be removed
from the Act. But only governments can
do that and, as one tribunal member
said with a laugh: “Changes to the
Broadcasting and Television Act aren’t
common.” □

THEATRE
Horses for
courses-
even in media
By BRIAN HOAD
A DISPIRITED reader recently sent in
a copy of her last playscript. After four
years of struggle, she has admitted de-
feat and given up her ambition to write
for the stage. She hopes that her script
and a detailed covering letter will shed a
little more light on why so few Austra-
lian plays are emerging these days.
Her bitter experiences range across
the country through theatre companies
large and small. Her main beef is that
most of them didn’t even bother to re-
turn her scripts although she always
included a stamped and addressed en-
velope for that purpose. She found this
particularly discouraging.
Then there were the homosexual
cliques the notorious Mauve Mafia
which kept blocking her path. Clearly a
mettlesome woman, possibly a militant
feminist, she wove this theme into her
latest and last play, to caustic effect. The
Mauve Mafia must have been mortified.
Little wonder that so few scripts were
returned. She admits she is somewhat
lacking in “diplomacy.”
A more common trap she fell into
was that of muddled media. Her final
opus, originally intended as a television
script, was adapted only later to the
stage. The result was lots of little scenes
involving 12 characters (which could, at
a pinch, be handled by seven actors).
But in these stringent economic times
most theatre companies find it more ex-
pedient to fill their Australian content
quotas with new works (if any) which
require only two or three performers
circling a kitchen sink or a black stump.
There are, of course, always excep-
tions. Sydney’s Griffin Theatre Com-
pany, apart from devoting itself to Aus-
tralian writers, has always been closely
associated with the world of television
and this year has been operating with
the financial help of ATN Channel 7.
You could call it the Yellow (or Media)
Mafia of the theatre world.
Griffin’s latest offering is a new work
by Jennifer Paynter, When Are We Go-
ing To Manly? It involves 19 characters
(eight actors) and 27 scenes. It’s certain-
ly intelligent, well-observed, cleverly
constructed material for teledrama. It
flashes with breathless haste backward
and forward in time around the pivot-
No time for subtlety: Mark Butler, Barbara-Jane Cole, When Are We Going to Manly?
al year of 1954 exploring why a
bright, wild spirit of 1932 ended up on
the beach at Manly in 1982 as a mad old
woman. But the multiple scene changes
don’t work in the theatre.
In the production by Rhys Mc-
Connochie, efforts to satisfy the un-
reasonable demands of the script have
severely cluttered the limited acting
area. Too much of the action is forced
into too many odd corners out of sight.
The chaos is heightened by requiring the
actors to take on up to five roles each.
They are also asked to gain or lose 10 or
20 years at the flick of a switch. They
can’t.
So, despite a spirited performance
from Barbara-Jane Cole as the be-
nighted heroine (and considerable sup-
port from Noel Hodda as her husband)
the work founders as do most
teledramas transposed to the stage.
There is quite simply, no time for
subtlety and depth of characterisation.
There is none of that emotional in-
volvement between audience and per-
formers which makes theatre unique.
The relationship between audience
and performers forms the basis of on-
going theatrical experiments carried out
at The Performance Space with some-
times startling, sometimes bewildering
effect. It is the Sydney headquarters of
the counter-cultural revolutionaries of
the performing arts the Red Mafia.
They are in a quite mellow mood at
the moment with their latest perform-
ance (the word “play” is considered ob-
solete in this environment), Jara. It is a
tribute to Victor Jara, composer and
performer of Chilean folksongs. The re-
lationship between Jara and his vast
audiences became so strong, so politi-
cally potent, that with the US-backed
destruction of the Allende government
in Chile in 1973 the military seized the
opportunity to murder Jara too.
The seedy old ballroom in Cleveland
Street has for the occasion been turned
into Pena de los Parra, a seedy old
house in Santiago which became the
headquarters of an artists’ co-operative
that shook a nation. It was there that
Jara first came to prominence as a lead-
er of the popular song movement which
helped sweep Salvatore Allende to
presidential power in 1970.
Audience and performers sit around
tables together. The performance is car-
ried out among the audience, or up on a
stage, or on a dais, or anywhere else felt
appropriate by director Nigel Rice.
Seven actors provide the narrative back-
ground of the life and times and death
of Jara (as compiled by journalist Guy
Morrison). It is a setting for the emo-
tional core of the evening a dozen of
Jara’s songs most movingly performed
by Hernan Flores to his own guitar.
The result is a strong portrait of a
remarkable man who gave up a brilliant
career in theatre to go out to the people
to express both concern and condemna-
tion, to sing of love and hope. As he
explained it, his guitar had found a pur-
pose: “I need the wood and strings of
my guitar to give vent to sadness or hap-
piness, some verse which opens up the
heart like a wound, some line which
helps us all to turn from inside ourselves
and to look out and see the world with
new eyes.”
There is much food for thought on
art and life here. □


FILMS
A fine line
’twixt passion
and logic
By SANDRA HALL
HEARTENING as it is, Annie’s Coming
Out is unlikely to precipitate a run on
the box-office for it threatens almost as
much as it inspires by leading its audi-
ence into areas most people would
rather ignore.
The story of a sophisti-
cated mind trapped
speechless inside a helpless
and mis-shapen body, it is
both a vision of life beyond
the pale and an unsettling
reminder that the needs
and wishes of the physic-
ally handicapped are much
like anybody else’s.
When we first meet her,
Annie’s intelligence is not
an advantage but a curse,
making her doubly sensi-
tive to the indifference of
those around her a state
of mind made explicit by a
soundtrack voice speaking
her thoughts. “I wanted re-
venge,” it says. “The
strongest emotion I felt
was hate and hate made me
strong.”
In other circumstances
such a declaration might
sound melodramatic but
there is no melodrama in Annie’s
Coming Out. Certainly, there is a nurs-
ing sister who regards cleanliness above
godliness and treats her patients as
pieces of hospital furniture, different
only in the fact that at appointed times
they have to be fed, but she seems a
fairly accurate personification of the in-
stitutional attitude toward the physic-
ally handicapped as described by Rose-
mary Crossley and Anne McDonald in
the book, Annie’s Coming Out , on which
this Film Australia production is based.
Certain details have been altered and
names changed but essentially the film
is a brisk and movingly laconic account
lit with humor of the events which
led up to the 1979 court case in which
Anne McDonald, who suffers from cer-
ebral palsy, won the right to manage her
own affairs after living from the age of
three in St Nicholas Hospital in Mel-
bourne. Now 23, she lives with Rose-
mary Crossley, the therapist who helped
her win her case and with Crossley’s
boyfriend Chris Borthwick who co-
wrote the script. Anne is enrolled in a
Humanities course at Deakin University
and is working on a second book
triumphant validation of the court’s de-
cision.
By all accounts, it was not an easy
film to make. First of all, Vanessa
Redgrave was going to play the
Crossley character; then she wasn’t. As
well, there were all the legal and moral
problems associated with the drama-
tisation of events involving the living
and finally the artistic struggle to make
drama out of material which might have
been turned more cheaply and con-
servatively into a documentary.
The decision to produce a feature
film seems to me to have been the right
Rapport: Arhondis and Punch-McGregor in Annie’s Coming Out
one, for it’s unlikely that a documentary
could have caught the elements which
make this film as intriguing as it is
touching.
On its most basic level, it’s a fascina-
ting detective story. When the Crossley
character, Jessica Hathaway (Angela
Punch-McGregor) first meets Annie
(Tina Arhondis) in the hospital, the
child’s parents and the doctors and
nurses who look after her are all firmly
convinced that mentally she is pro-
foundly retarded. Yet gradually, as she
works with her, Jessica begins to suspect
that this is not so. As this suspicion
grows, so does her absorption in Annie
and her predicament until dedication
begins to seem like obsessiveness.
Her boyfriend, David (Drew
Forsythe), is at first sympathetic then re-
sentful; the doctors are indulgent, then
impatient; and Annie’s parents who
have believed for 14 years that they are
doing their best for their daughter are
caught bewildered in the midst of a fer-
ocious debate between orthodox medi-
cal opinion and the ostensibly wild
theories of someone who seems bent on
taking Annie away from them.
Both the script (by John Patterson
and Borthwick) and Gil Brealey’s direc-
tion tread a fine line between passion
and logic by edging things with irony.
Jessica, it is acknowledged, is a difficult
character but her singlemindedness is
matched by her sense of humor and the
fact that she genuinely likes Annie and
the other children. (One of the film’s
most touching aspects is the sense of
rapport evident between Jessica and the
children all of them sufferers from
cerebral palsy in their scenes
together). As Punch-McGregor plays
her, there is no earnestness in Jessica
just an extraordinary
amount of energy and
goodwill, together with a
tactlessness just short of
breathtaking. As David,
Forsythe is the perfect foil
funny, extrovert,
exasperated and rather
queasy about Jessica’s ob-
session with Annie until he
(in a finely played scene) is
won over by Annie herself.
It’s hard to say just how
fair a film like this is to all
concerned. Despite the
name-changing, this is go-
ing to go down as the de-
finitive story of Annie
McDonald because film is
such an intensely emotion-
al medium. Yet on the sur-
face it seems a fair attempt
to deal with an enormously
complex case. There are a
couple of ogres among the
doctors and nurses present
but they are more than
matched by others who are seen doing
their best to look squarely at the evi-
dence. Monica Maughan is especially
good as Jessica’s colleague, a woman
who both admires and resents her for
being a better therapist than she herself
can ever hope to be.
If any point of view is under-repre-
sented (and the reasons are perhaps
legal), it is that of Annie’s parents. They
are seen hovering on the edge of the
action, baffled, worried and occasional-
ly pitied. Their dilemma the difficulty
of knowing whether the court is grant-
ing Annie her freedom or taking away
her security is never quite enunciated.
Yet in its humor, its lightness and its
lack of condescension, Annie’s Coming
Out is a remarkable film, as likeable as it
is subversive. □
Annie’s Coming Out: in Sydney at
Hoyts Centre; in Melbourne at Hoyts
mid-city. Soon for other states.

BOOKS
Men take
a couple
of beatings
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
Bearded Ladies, by Kate Grenville.
University of Queensland Press,
$14.95.
Loving Daughters, by Olga
Masters. University of Queensland
Press, $14.95.
A WOMAN friend of mine noticed me
reading Kate Grenville’s book of
stories, Bearded Ladies, and said:
“They’re brilliant stories but all the men
are awful.” As a woman said it, I can
agree without fear of being thought
sexist. Grenville has a great deal of tal-
ent but every prospect does not please
when only man is vile.
Not that Grenville’s women are
suffering saints but one wishes that the
sensitivity, awareness or imagination of
the best of the women could be shared
by the men.
These are crude and brutal, as in the
first and seventh stories, wet and gutless
in the last or flashers and gropers in sev-
eral others.
Grenville gets the balance right when
she writes about children. The worlds of
all these stories are sharp and painful
but with children there is always the
possibility of illumination, of a vision of
healing.
In the most moving story in the
book, “The Test Is, If They Drown,” the
theme is given in the first sentence:
“Miss Spear in number forty-two is a
witch.” For the two gangs of children
led by the narrator and Mick, the harm-
less old spinster living alone with her
cat “must be a witch. No way she can be
anything else. A witch a murderer a
gobbler of children a creature from an-
other planet. An alien.”
With great delicacy Grenville tells
how narrator Sandy plans a raid on
Miss Spear, is caught and yet ends as
her friend a friendship that is cruelly
broken and betrayed in loyalty to the
gangs.
The same controlled drift toward
tenderness and back again is apparent
in another fine story, “A Summer
Aunt,” where the 16-year-old narrator
Louise and her formidable professor
aunt work through the theory and prac-
tice of “the fundamental evil of Man.”
While the anthropologist aunt, with
Kate Grenville: the prospect of further development of a considerable talent
Rabelaisian detail, warns Louise that
men “are obsessed with it” Louise is
taking every opportunity to let the
young car-fiend Jeffrey let his hands get
under her dress. There is humor and a
splendidly detached observation in this
story and Man, for a change, is rather
absurd but not awful.
The quality of writing is almost uni-
formly high in Bearded Ladies. The
stories are set in England, Europe, Am-
erica and Australia. Grenville has
settled back in Sydney, where she works
for multicultural television, and the
most accomplished stories are those set
in Australia. So, in welcoming Bearded
Ladies, one can look forward to a fur-
ther development of a considerable
talent.
Olga Masters began writing plays
and stories in her late 50s and her first
collection of stories, The Home Girls,
won a National Book Council Award.
Loving Daughters is her first novel.
Loving Daughters reads like a quiet
book about quiet people on a farm and
in a country town but no one who has
lived in the country will be fooled.
Everyone else will know what the Rev-
erend Colin Edwards means when, at
the end of the book, he writes to his
mother in England: “We always say
nothing ever happens in these places,
don’t we? ... But I have several things
to relate ...”
Loving Daughters is a novel of great
authority and subtlety, written by some-
one who has been observing people for
many years and storing up the knowl-
edge of what goes on behind appear-
ances.
The basic drive of this hidden activ-
ity is made explicit by Edwards almost
at the finish of the novel:
“But Edwards knew people seldom
took the course that created happiness.
Not even for themselves. They kept the
soft bladder of their feelings inside a
hard leather covering, pumped tight like
a football. They preferred to hang on to
the tightness and the hardness, not
caring that it was reflected on their
faces. I think many people are fright-
ened to be happy, Edwards decided. If

it means being generous, they’d rather
be miserable.”
Such bleak realities do not make
Loving Daughters a miserable book. On
the contrary, it bubbles with the human
comedy of the outlying farms and the
little town of Wyndham near the coast
of southern New South Wales.
The time is the 19205. Two beautiful
and very different daughters, Una and
Enid, keeping house for their widowed
father on his farm, form an instant tri-
angle with the young bachelor parson
Edwards. When he visits the girls on the
death of their sister-in-law, Edwards
knows he must have one of them. But
which one?
Enid is the quiet one, good at
cooking and gardening. Una is the flib-
bertigibbet, good at embroidery and, in
a crucial later episode, all too clever at
painting. In the end Edwards chooses
(or is chosen) but it is the wrong choice.
Masters has established herself with-
in two years as one of the best writers of
fiction in Australia. □

PURE NEW WXX

Primavera Estate 1984
Never has so
much been written
about so little
By DENIS O’BRIEN
The Dearest And The Best, by
Leslie Thomas. Methuen, $19.95.
THE LOCATION is southern England
in 1940. After the worst winter of the
century there is the early promise of a
glorious summer but not much else
looks heartening from this part of the
sceptred isle.
The war against Germany is going
badly. Hitler’s troops are fast on their
way through France; his air force has
begun making deadly random sorties
across the Channel without meeting
much opposition.
A British commando raid on Ger-
man-occupied Norway, mounted more
as a boost for morale than for strategic
significance, is being revealed as an ill-
planned debacle. In the House of Com-
mons, Neville Chamberlain is flounder-
ing through his last weeks as Prime
Minister.
So much for the engagingly-arranged
background of facts. Zoom in now on
Binford, a fictional picture-postcard vil-
lage folded into the Hampshire coast-
line and the centre of Leslie Thomas’
novel.
Binford is drawn to represent just
about everything idiosyncratically
English about England of the period. It
is the home front in microcosm; the
small lens through which fragments of
the beginnings of a world war are
viewed; a mise en scene of a most famil-
iar sort.
With a conditioned expectation of
being led toward the larger view, the
reader tolerates the detailed descrip-
tions of village life and absorbs
patiently the quickly-sketched popula-
tion of ordinary folk made slightly
larger than life by the underlining of
their eccentricities and the very fact of
their selection from the long gallery of
English caricatures.
After the first hundred pages, with
the main cast assembled and nothing
much happening, the reader begins to
grab for the saving thought that perhaps
this will turn out to be a subtle satire. Or
maybe sleepy old Binford, with its roast
beef traditions and stiff-upper-lipped
stoicism, will be revealed suddenly to
accommodate a Nazi spy ring. There
must be a twist somewhere.
Sadly, there is not. In this, his 16th
novel in 18 years, Thomas attempts to
reclaim Word War II as a subject of fic-
tion from the social historians who have
been plundering it over recent times but


V 6 power,
just part of the pleasure
of real grand touring.
Nissan 300ZX.
»1»
In the history of motoring, few cars, if any,
have captured the imagination quite as vividly as the
timeless Z-cars.
From its inception in 1969, this classic marque
has provided a unique blend of performance and
style, comfort and safety.
Now, Nissan proudly introduce the 300ZX.
Its styling is reassuringly familiar yet it is
sufficiently re-styled to reduce drag to a co-efficient
of a mere 0.31. But it’s beneath these sleek exterior
lines where the real advancements lie.
The most radical change is the introduction of
the brilliant new VG 30E V 6 engine. Of oversquare
design, the 60° bank angle and pentroof combustion
chambers combine to make this lightweight
powerhouse capable of producing a remarkable
balance of power (124 kW @ 5,200 rpm DIN) and
torque (241 Nm @ 3,600 rpm DIN). Yet, for all this
output, efficient economy can be realised thanks to
the introduction of Nissan’s highly advanced ECCS
(Electronic Concentrated Control System). With
silicon chip electronics the ECCS system monitors not
only fuel flow but temperature, mixture, spark and
other critical engine functions. Such sophisticated
technology takes 300ZX to the forefront of
automotive development.
On the inside, 300ZX belies its sports tradition
because, here, the number one priority is comfort -
comfort unimaginable in most performance cars
and unrivalled in most sedans.
In front of you spreads a truly comprehensive
array of analogue instruments: simple, easy to read,
unobtrusive.
Throughout the interior, from the plush velour
seats to the thick-pile carpet, the cockpit is warm,
opulent and extremely quiet. So quiet, in fact, that the
4-speaker AM/FM digital radio
cassette delivers virtuoso
performance at even the lowest
volumes.
Of course, air conditioning
is fully integrated. And, for open-roof traditionalists,
the T-bar roof panels can be simply and quickly lifted
out and stowed in the rear boot space.
The Nissan 300ZX is the epitome of the grand
touring car. Whether you prefer the 5-speed manual
or the new 4-speed automatic, you can be assured of
many years enjoyable motoring in a stylish, supremely
comfortable, high performance thoroughbred.

he suffers a dent to his considerable
reputation as an entertaining story-
teller.
In an unintentionally ambiguous ar-
rangement of words, The Dearest And
The Best is blurbed on the dust jacket as
a “major novel of World War II.” If, as
that hyperbole suggests, it had been
written during the war it might have en-
joyed a reasonable level of esteem if
only for its comforting attachment to all
the values and virtues so significant to
England at the time. As a novel about
the war, written more than 40 years after
the event, it comes off the page an-
achronistically and falls limply for want
of a sterner point of view and a less
insipid plot.
Plot? Well, that’s a loose use of the
word. The plot line is so thin at times as
to be almost invisible.
The Lovatts are Binford’s leading
family. Robert, the father, is a retired
solicitor, chairman of the local council
and commander of the local Home
Guard unit. Fussy, pompous and im-
patient, he stomps around the village
humming snatches of Rule Britannia
and is given to sniffing the air pro-
prietorially. On parade, he stuffs card-
board into an otherwise empty World
War I holster.
Color him as a slightly less endearing
Captain Mainwaring of Dad’s Army.
Elizabeth, his wife, is the archetypal
middle-class Englishwoman of the
period sensible, long-suffering and
seeming to float in an eternal mist of
lavender water.
Celia Johnson perfected the charac-
terisation.
The two Lovatt sons James, an ar-
tillery captain, and naval sub-lieutenant
Harry suggest themselves as roles that
might have been played by John Mills
and Richard Attenborough when
younger: one self-important, patron-
ising and given to guilt-ridden marital
infidelity; the other cocky and self-as-
sured, yet haunted by self-doubt.
Older readers might find difficulty
suppressing images of wartime movies
that arise from Thomas’ text.
Early in the piece, his description of
Binford reminded me irresistibly of the
rural England mocked up by Holly-
wood for the 1942 film Mrs Miniver, and
it came as no great surprise to find the
influence acknowledged in a bibli-
ography.
Twenty years ago, Thomas leapt out
of Fleet Street journalism on the
strength of a memorably affecting ac-
count of his boyhood as a Barnardo boy
in a book titled Same Time Next Week.
Including a couple of other works of
non-fiction, he has since turned out the
equivalent of almost a book a year.
In his latest novel, he seems to be
suffering from the effects of over-pro-
duction. □

Changes of direction
by Patricia Rolfe
FRANK THOMPSON left University
of Queensland Press in a surprising
switch 18 months ago and took his Aust
Lit reputation to Oz Lit Rigby in Adel-
aide while Laurie Muller left Lans-
downe, where he had pioneered the
“big” TV-advertised book, and went to
University of Queensland Press (UQP)
where print runs can be small indeed.
Rigby and Lansdowne are both
owned by James Hardie. Marketing is
done from Sydney and Thompson’s
brief was to find a role for Rigby which
would set it apart from Lansdowne in
the marketplace.
The idea is to make Rigby a fiction
house producing books which people
read and leave Lansdowne making
books which people look at. Thompson
sees it to some extent as restoring Rigby
to what it was before some muddled
years of changing ownership and man-
agement during which, inevitably, the
accountants moved in.
After years of spotting writers inclu-
ding Peter Carey and David Malouf,
Thompson is assessing manuscripts as
“good reads” and hoping he says to
turn up someone with the storytelling
talents and able to develop the pro-
fessionalism of people such as Jon
Cleary and Morris West. It’s a slim seg-
ment of the market between generally
subsidised literature and pulp. Thomp-
son has slotted four of his Stonyfell
series hardback $7.95 into it and is
hoping for the best.
In another series he has so far pub-
lished John Emery and Rory Barnes
both South Australians and has
novels by John Sanski, Nicholas Jose
and Natalie Scott coming.
He is careful not to poach from UQP
(although many writers see their loyalty
to editor above publisher) but yearns for
Carey’s work.
Thompson plans to keep up Rigby’s
old reputation for Australiana. He be-
lieves that this has changed. People used
to see it as an armchair read; now they
are just as likely to read an account of
crossing the Simpson Desert to find out
how they can do it themselves.
ANGUS and Robertson have a budget
of $lOO,OOO for a national radio cam-
paign beginning late next month for The
All-Time Favorite Australian Song Book
by cartoonist, writer and architecture
assessor Patrick Cook. The selection is a
broad sweep from Botany Bay to Fare-
well Aunty Jack and Cook has illus-
trated many of them in color. The form
Frank Thompson: keeping up Rigby’s repu-
tation for Australiana
of the campaign has not yet been de-
cided. Perhaps Cook can sing, as well as
everything else.
THE PRESIDENT of the Australian
Labor Party clearly did not consider the
federal government’s wage pause when
he doubled some of the New South
Wales Literary Awards reasoning, no
doubt, that what writers earn will not
make inflation rage.
This year, the fiction and non-fiction
awards were each $lO,OOO. That took
them level with the Vogel award and the
total handed out by Neville Wran was
$52,000.
The NSW Premier does not seem to
take a provincial view of the awards.
Few of this year’s winners live in NSW
and only poet Les Murray, with his rou-
tine tribute to the inspiration given him
by the dairy farmers of the north coast,
made any reference to the Premier
State.
On prizes: The Booker McConnell,
Britain’s most valuable, recently found
it was no longer that; it had been edged
out by the Betty Trask award of 12,500
pounds (about $19,000) for a first novel
by someone under 35 and of a “roman-
tic or traditional nature.” Stung, the
Booker people raised theirs to 15,000
pounds.
THE INDUSTRY will not have a pro-
motion campaign like the “Take A
Look At A Book” it had last year. The
committee could not find the $50,000
needed from the industry. □

The once flagship of the world ’s greatest fleet, the “Mary Rose ’’ is
hoisted from her watery grave on the 11th October, 1982, on an
ingenious 'bed of air’ developed by Atlas Copco.
The “Mary Rose,” the pride of King Henry VIII and the
greatest Tudor warship ever to set sail, was tragically lost with all
hands in the Solent, off Portsmouth Harbour in 1545.
To this time, no-one knows the real cause of the disaster,
only that on that fateful day 438 years ago, she turned into the
wind to bravely face the attacking French fleet, heeled, and sank.
Rope nets, deployed to prevent enemy boarders, trapped
the 700 crew and took them to the sea bottom with the ship.
It was not until 1967 that she was rediscovered. The team
lead by historian Alexander McKee made the valuable find and

so commenced the mammoth task of retrieving her.
The raising was the result of a twelve year operation by a
team ofarchaelogists, with support from enthusiastic individuals
and companies.
Atlas Copco was among the earliest supporters of the
project, long before many knew there was a vessel worth
salvaging.
By adapting the imaginative ‘bed of air’ concept,
developed during the earlier recovery of the Swedish Galleon
“Vasa’’ and by providing air compressors, together with pumps,
turbo lamps and innumerable and varied pneumatic tools, Atlas
Copco equipment and technical knowhow has been a key factor
in the triumphant success of the project.
The importance of the "Mary Rose" is two-fold. She
represents a time capsule of life in Tudor times with beautifully
preserved artifacts ranging from weapons to domestic items.
She is of equal importance to Naval historians, being the
starting point in ship design that was to lead to four centuries of
British sea supremacy.

It was King Henry VIII who first ordered his salvage

Over one hundred years ago, in a time when man was a

was born.
Since that time, Atlas Copco has been the forerunner in

Today, Atlas Copco technology is working on the more

Lange’s economic summit
a coup against the odds
Having opened to grim portents, the New Zealand economic summit ended up providing
David Lange’s Labor government with a launching-pad for national reform and, reports
IAN TEMPLETON
also marked a fresh stage in the PM’s evolution as a politician.
AGAINST the run of play, New Zea-
land’s Lange government achieved a
considerable coup with its economic
summit. The portents had not been
bright when the conference was mooted.
The concept had been plucked
straight from Canberra where Prime
Minister Bob Hawke had achieved na-
tional consensus for the economic poli-
cies of his new Labor regime. That had
been based on an understanding
reached previously with the trade union
movement on prices and incomes.
David Lange came to power in July
without any such accord.
Yet, once the summit conference had
been scheduled, trade unions and em-
ployers worked virtually non-stop
under government prodding to arrive at
an accord on wages policy.
With that accord under its belt, the
government moved into the talks at
least assured of goodwill from the trade
unions. The problem is that it will take
months to have the wage-fixing reform
legislated and then implemented.
The unions have been without a
negotiated pay rise since 1982 and, fol-
lowing devaluation in July, prices are
rising sharply. The lift in the food price
index last month was sufficient to give a
projected annual rate of 18 percent. The
unions would like at least some cost-of-
living adjustment before the end of the
year but the government has steered
clear of any suggestion of indexation.
The whole thrust of the summit was
directed at persuading the nation that
further sacrifices are essential to lay the
foundation for economic recovery.
The government is committed to pro-
viding assistance for low-income famil-
ies in the budget (now delayed even
longer, until early November) through
revision of tax scales and re-targeting
social welfare benefits. But given
Labor’s equally firm commitment to re-
duce the fiscal deficit and so ease infla-
tionary pressure through the money
supply the only route to finance aid to
the poor is through widening the tax
base, soaking high-income earners and
reducing tax expenditures.
Finance minister Roger Douglas: can plan the budget with confidence
For the first two days of the summit,
it seemed that the debate would de-
generate into a dogfight over whose belt
would have to be tightened most.
For those who recalled other nation-
al conferences, the omens at that point
looked dark.
The 69-year-old chairman of the In-
dustries Development Commission, Ted
Tarrant, noted that this was the fifth
time New Zealand had sought to get to
grips with its economic problems. It had
been in 1951, he said, that a government
had first decided it was time to do some-
thing about the state of the economy.
Summit exercises had over the succeed-
ing 30 years identified problems,
diagnosed causes and refrained from
taking any action. “This time, you stand
on the verge of making the break-
through,” he told the conference.
Tarrant said he believed that New
Zealand was more receptive to urgent
change in the economy than it had been
during previous summits. But, he
warned, governments had little to do
with it: Change would happen only
when the community was convinced of
the need for it.
The latest summit has in effect
topped off the sudden awareness of
New Zealanders that they are no longer
a rich society. That awareness has been
hammered home by the discovery that
their dollar is worth only 60 Australian
cents and 50 American cents. Only five
years ago it was worth slightly more
than an American dollar. So, where pre-
vious conferences could fight over how
the national income could be sliced up,
redistribution of a diminishing cake is
no longer a fashionable argument.
The real message and Lange has
succeeded in communicating this to the
nation is that New Zealand must be-
come more efficient at all levels.
The summit gave Lange a platform
from which to launch essential econ-
omic reforms. It also marked a fresh
stage in his evolution as a politician.


David Lange: evolving politically
His final summary on the third day
was nothing less than majestic. For
business and farming leaders previously
sceptical about a Labor government
and its leader, this was the moment of
consensus.
Now, Lange and his finance troika
led by Finance minister Roger Douglas
can plan their budget with confidence
that the nation will accept change. □
IRIAN JAYA
Killer disease
fears in PNG
border region
By DENIS REINHARDT
AUSTRALIAN quarantine officials are
monitoring a disease outbreak among
pigs in the remote Baliem Valley of
Irian Jaya which may have caused the
deaths of more than 200 people.
Uncertainty exists over whether the
outbreak is of a virulent form of an-
thrax, a highly infectious disease
characterised in all mammals inclu-
ding humans by rapid death. Known
for its zoonosis (the ability to spread
from other animals to humans) capa-
bilities, anthrax was used in British
germ warfare tests which rendered one
Scottish island uninhabitable.
Australia’s quarantine authorities re-
gard Papua New Guinea’s long land
border with Irian Jaya as the weak link
in the geographical disease buffer sur-
rounding the continent.
Officers based on Thursday Island
conduct daily helicopter missions and
regular animal and plant checks in an
effort to ensure that diseases com-
municated along the Indonesian archi-
pelago do not enter Australia across the
narrow Torres Strait.
Rabies and foot and mouth disease
are endemic in the major eastern islands
of Indonesia and transmitted to Austra-
lia would destroy meat export markets
and, in the former case,
threaten human life.
The seriousness with which
disease entry through the
strait region is treated is
measured by an announce-
ment from federal Health
minister Dr Neal Blewett last
week that a three-year pro-
gram to survey and destroy
citrus trees on the islands will
follow the recent discovery of
citrus canker. Little citrus is
growing in the Thursday
Island area but the canker
could endanger commercial
orchards if it spread through-
out Australia.
In an endeavor to control
the spread into Australia of
human diseases across the
strait, health officials have es-
tablished a system of regular
checks.
“We are now conducting
monthly clinics on all the
islands and the first thing the
health officer looks for is new
arrivals,” a senior federal
Health Department official told The
Bulletin.
“In the case of anthrax now, the doc-
tor would also be alert for pusticles. (An
early sign of anthrax in humans is ma-
lignant eruptions on the arms.)
“The locals are well genned up to the
health hazards and, even if the health
officer doesn’t see the new arrival, the
local chiefs will let the doctor know if
someone new has been through.”
Chloroquine-resistant mutant strains
of malaria have been detected recently
in the Torres population, marking the
spread of the dangerous new strain
from the Papua New Guinea mainland
where it is endemic.
Australian officials have been able to
put together only sketchy details of the
disease outbreak in Irian Jaya, mostly
from newspaper reports in the In-
donesian capital Jakarta. The reports
give confusing accounts of symptoms in
the human sufferers, some describing it
as “meat intoxication” while others say
that it is influenza.
The reports began appearing late last
September when Jakarta daily Sinar
Harapan said an epidemic among eight
villages in the Oksibil district of the
Baliem Valley had led to the deaths of
166 people and hospitalisation of a fur-
ther 764. A later report put the death toll
at 220 and attributed deaths to “eating
of pigs that had died of intoxication.”
Uncertainty over the outbreak has
led Irian Jayan exile groups in Holland
to accuse Indonesian authorities of a
cover-up. “The symptoms must have
been as clear as daylight: dark blood
running from the nose and ears,” one
group, Stichting Werkgroep Nieuw
Health minister Neal Blewett: problems up north
Guinea, claimed in a recent circular re-
futing Indonesian suggestions that the
deaths were caused by influenza.
Australian quarantine officials have
not been prepared to discount a major
human anthrax outbreak.
Under a tripartite agreement with
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, vet-
erinary officials from the three countries
are supposed to meet bi-annually. A
scheduled meeting is overdue and the
Australian side is hoping that it will be
convened in Irian Jaya so that the an-
thrax reports can be evaluated.
“We’ve seen the reports of large
numbers of people dying,” one official
told The Bulletin. “It is probably a dis-
ease called pig bell which is caused by a
group of bacteria growing in a mam-
mal’s gut and killing by the release of
toxic poison.”
Even if the disease is not anthrax but
pig bell, its appearance in epidemic
proportions in the highlands of Papua
New Guinea would be enough to worry
animal health officials. □

Dramatic turnarounds
spearhead corporate surge
Toyota commercial vehicles landing in Australia: helping a profit turnaround for Australian Motor Industries
From the hundreds of companies that have lodged figures for their past financial
year, the picture that emerges is of a profits boom.
DA VID HASELHURST
reports on many dramatic turnarounds and the few that have faltered.
THE FLOOD of corporate profit re-
ports flowing into stock exchanges re-
veals most encouraging improvement in
1983-84 over the previous year.
Almost 80 percent of companies
examined in an exclusive Bulletin-
Statex survey show increased earnings
over last year. Most heartening is that
15 companies which collapsed into
losses totalling $41.4 million last year
have turned around to report aggregate
profits of $29.1 million. Yet only five
companies surveyed have fallen from
profits last year into losses.
The survey covers listed companies
with annual balance dates since March
31, 1984. For the crop of June 30 bal-
ancing companies, the survey was up-
to-date to the beginning of last week.
Since, June 30 balancers have until the
end of september under stock exchange
rules to lodge their preliminary final fig-
ures, it is too soon to get the full picture
on overall company results and
“shockers” traditonally delay the bad
news until last.
Nevertheless, the trend so far is too
positive for much reduction from the
profit improvement now apparent
among the 189 companies included in
the current survey; albeit, they are im-
proving off a generally low base from
1982-83.
Two widely-published surveys which
appeared in October last year after all
the september quarter reports were in
showed a fairly dismal picture:
■ J. B. Were’s Top 200 survey for
June 30, 1983, showed an average net
profit fall of 4.8 percent following a 12
percent rise in 1982.
■ The Melbourne Age’s broader sur-
vey of 291 companies with turnovers of
more than $lO million showed an 11
percent fall in corporate profits in 1982-
83.
Both organisations’ surveys, when
they come out next month, should show
a reversal of the unhappy past.
The Bulletin survey is based on the
September draft of Statex Research
Studies produced by the Sydney Stock
Exchange. After excluding companies
showing continuing losses, the remain-
ing 189 companies in the survey show
15 returning from losses to profits, 136
improving their profits, 33 showing
profit declines and only five moving out
of profits into losses in the latest year.
The tables beginning on page 111 list
the turnaround companies first, then
rank the profit improvers from one to
136. For reasons of space, the 33 profit
decliners a third of which were
miners are omitted. The five former
profit-makers which fell into losses are
Hill 50 Gold, Joe White Maltings, Mar-
tin Properties, the tin miner Great
Northern Mining and property devel-
oper Jack Chia Australia Ltd.
Of the companies to report increased
earnings, the median increase was a
21.26 percent gain in profit.
In absolute profit terms, BHP stands
out for its 154 percent lift to a massive
net $622.25 million for the year to May
31. Yet in terms of percentage gain it
ranks only No 21.
The biggest percentage gain (11,560
percent) went to the little-known J. N.
Taylor Holdings one of the smallest
companies in the Holmes a Court
group. The company operated as a
ship’s chandler until a year ago when it
was injected with the operations and
assets of the Albany Woollen Mills and
the Perth electric motor assembler
Westate Industries both part of the
Bell Group. Sales in the full year
doubled to $34.7 million and net earn-
ings soared from $5OOO to $583,000.
Shoe manufacturer Julius Marlow
scored the next-best improvement, fol-
lowed by Dermide Holdings, a supplier
of PVC-coated fabrics to the vehicle in-
dustry; Keywest Investments, the dealing
and investment arm of English financier
Garnet Harrison; Rover Holdings, an-
other Harrison-linked property inves-
tor; and Eagers Holdings, a Queensland
GM-H dealer.
Among the heavyweights, Western
Mining was the best profit improver
with a 462 percent lift to rank it No 7
largely due to its interests in gold and
aluminium.
The best major industrial performer
was National Consolidated Ltd, with the
diversified metals manufacturer lifting
net profit 381 percent to $17.76 million
after a restructuring program initiated

by the group’s 48 percent owner, the
Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd.
Among the more impressive per-
formances in the latest year, however,
are those companies that staged dra-
matic swings out of losses into profits.
Kinnears Ltd - the rope, carpet and
garden products group reversed a
1983 loss of $2.03 million to a profit of
$2.53 million as it is about to go under
to a takeover bid from engineering
group Johns Perry Ltd.
A turnaround from $6.8 million in
losses to a net $3.6 million profit was
scored by Bruck Australia, the yarns,
weaving and knitwear group controlled
by Joe Brender (who sold his Katies Ltd
retail operations to G. J. Coles and Co
this month). The turnaround followed a
large-scale plant modernisation which
had disrupted operations in the pre-
vious year.
Builders’ hardware supplier Mcll-
wraith Davey turned a loss of almost $2
million into a profit of $6.04 million and
several other building-industry-linked
companies turned losses to profits.
The big white goods appliance
maker Simpson Holdings also came out
of the red to convert a loss of $5.96 mil-
lion to a profit of $1.46 million. Austra-
lian Motor Industries Ltd - the Toyota
assembler turned a loss of $10.2 mil-
lion into a profit of $9.55 million. (That
performance is in contrast to that of its
non-listed opposition, the Nissan-
Datsun assembler Nissan Ltd, which last
week reported a $22.6 million loss for
the year to March 31.)
Among the profit improvers, two
agricultural equipment makers stood
out Ralph McKay (up 209 percent)
and John Shearer (up 118 percent).
Among the media stocks, 11 reported
improved profits - led by Lismore pub-
lisher Northern Star (300 percent), John
Fairfax and David Syme (100).
Interestingly, two of the few listed
wine companies also produced substan-
tial gains Mildara (up 270 percent)
and Seppelt (up 83). □
THE CHARTIST
MIM remains a fallen idol
by Russell Lander
THE Bridge Data bar charts on MIM
give a 10-year overview plotted monthly
and a weekly profile replete with a 20-
week moving average.
To say that MIM has been out of
favor in recent months could be a prize-
winning understatement as this stock,
still cherished by many investors, has
fallen from $4.85 to as low as $2.45 in 14
months. The monthly chart shows that
the share price is back to a level at
which the great slide of 1981-82 was ar-
rested. However, as illustrated by the
weekly chart, the stock shows no signs
of throwing off its downtrend or of
having established a consolidation base.
These charts do not lend themselves
to any clear downside projections on
MIM but the long-term graph shows
that, if the stock fails to hold the line at
its present low of $2.45, the next line of
support lies in the range $1.40 to $l.BO.
It would not be surprising were such a
major price adjustment to occur, as the
stock is pitched at 48 times earnings and
shows a dividend yield of only 1.9 per-
cent.
Agreed, MlM’s earnings are de-
pressed by abysmal prices for copper,
lead, zinc and nickel and difficult mar-
ket conditions for coal. If a recovery in
these markets were imminent, it could
be argued that MlM’s current dividend
and earnings yields were a temporary
aberration but there are no indications
on the charts that the oft-talked-of
metals price recovery has arrived.
Investors are not in the mood to
value mining stocks on the value of ore
in the ground or the replacement cost of
their mines and facilities.

WILDCAT
Plea for more ‘permanent’ Japanese
A SMALL Sydney company has joined
the immigration debate. Darrell
Bresnahan, managing director of the ex-
panding duty-free, opal and Australian
souvenir retailer Darrell Janies Ltd, is
preparing a submission to Canberra ar-
guing for the relaxation of the restrictive
rules on Asian immigrants. Specifically,
Bresnahan is plumping for easier per-
manent residency attitudes to Japanese.
His concern stems from the com-
pany’s dependence on Japanese tour-
ists. Bresnahan told Wildcat that they
account for 85 percent of the company’s
turnover of $6.6 million. Most of the
tourists cannot speak English, so the
company needs Japanese as sales staff
and in public relations and other jobs.
Bresnahan said that 40 of his com-
pany’s 70 employees were Japanese but
almost all had only temporary visas
with “no hope of renewing them.”
He said: “You can’t spend any
money in training staff when they are
with you for such a short time.” Austra-
lians who speak Japanese normally
shoot for more elite, higher-paying jobs
with bankers or trading companies.
Darrell James is riding on the popu-
larity of the east coast of Australia as a
destination for Japanese particularly
tourists under 25. In 1980, 48,813
Japanese visited Australia but arrivals
grew to an estimated 72,000 last year.
More than 80,000 are expected this year.
Bresnahan claims that the “average
Japanese tourist spends around $5OO,
mainly on Australian products koala
bears, kangaroo and sheepskin prod-
ucts, opals and other jewellery and sou-
venirs.”
Darrell James has grown with the
tourist traffic. Bresnahan opened his
first store selling opals and sapphires in
the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne
and four years later moved across the
street. Since then he has opened up two
Sydney shops and one each in Brisbane
and the Gold Coast.
Bresnahan points out that Japanese
visiting Honolulu for an average one-
week stay increased from 72,000 in 1969
to 1.1 million in 1983. He sees similar
potential on the Gold Coast. A return
Tokyo-Brisbane ticket costs $lOOO. The
Japanese travel to and from the Gold
Coast in coaches.
Showing the benefit of new outlets,
Darrell James’ profit for the year ended
June 30 rose 90 percent to $605,000 on
sales 80 percent up to $6.6 million. The
result was after establishment costs of
the outlets and incorporates full write-
off on the closure of mining operations
at Inverell in NSW, a legacy of the busi-
ness of Arrawatta Holdings Ltd. Darrell
James gained the operations in a reverse
takeover early last year.
Star shines
REGIONAL media group Northern
Star Holdings Ltd can expect last year’s
roll-up of 150 shareholders to be beaten
at the annual general meeting in the
northern NSW coastal town of Coffs
Harbour on October 29.
Last week the company announced a
net profit of $5 million for the year
ended June, more than four times the
$1.24 million the previous year. Annual
dividend was up from 5 to 11 cents a
share. Chairman Bruce Gordon said
that the company would be “consider-
ing the possibility of further shareholder
benefits in addition to the increased
dividend.” The betting is that a bonus
issue will be announced at the AGM.
Northern Star’s dividend yield of 3.1
percent based on a last sale price of
$3.60 is modest but there appears to be
plenty of potential for further price rises
given the continuing demand for media
stocks.
Earlier this year, on its disappointing
1982-83 result, Northern Star was
trading on a price/earnings (PE) ratio
of around 50. But the latest result has
produced earnings (over the company’s
19.9 million shares) of 25.1 cents a share
at the share price of $3.60. That’s a PE
multiple of 14.3. At $4 a share the PE
rises to 15.9.
One broker believes the company
could earn $6.5 million in the current
year which, at $3.60 and $4 a share,
would mean PE multiples of 12 and 13.3
respectively. Media stocks have traded
at PEs as high as 30 this year, many in
the 20s.
Northern Star’s future looks bright
following a substantial capital expendi-
ture program and introduction of new
technology to most of its interests.
Northern Star holds the licence for
two northern NSW TV stations, NRN-
-11 and RTN-8, and publishes 11 news-
papers in rural NSW and Queensland.
It also operates radio 2LM in Lismore,
has a third interest in the Gold Coast’s
4GG and 31 percent of Tweed Heads
station 2MW.
Managing director John McKenzie
said the Southport-based Gold Coast
Bulletin had returned to the profit levels
of 1981-82 when the company earned $4
million. The newspaper was now the
most profitable in the group with circu-
lation of 30,000. McKenzie told Wildcat
newspapers still provided around half
of pre-tax profits.
As part of its capital program,
Northern Star spent $4 million on a
seven-unit Goss Urbanite press in 1981
and more recently installed a com-
puterised typesetting system for the
Northern Star newspaper in Lismore.

To an accountant it’s black.
It’s one thing to buy a new
truck. Quite another to keep it
running. Maintenance. Fuel. Parts
and service. They all eat into your
profit margin and can land you in
the red.
In the interests of you
staying on the right side of your
accountant we suggest you take
a good look at the new ACCO
1950 C. Its performance on paper
is as good as it is on bitumen;
turning in a lower total cost of
ownership year in year out. And
that’s what keeps you in the
black. It’s also made the ACCO
Australia’s favourite truck in the
ten tonne 6x4 class.
The ACCO was designed,
tested and built in Australia. It
prefers to be big on dependability
and performance than gimmickry.
Keeping to simple and straight-
forward design, cuts costs and
enables a light tare for maximum
load capacity.
The Cummins VTI9O
turbocharged diesel delivers
the optimum power for top per-
formance. It isn’t over specified
and its massive torque offers your
driver incomparable power and
reliability. While offering your
accountant economy and a 2 year/
160,000 km warranty.
Truck and Bus had this to say
about the new ACCO 1950 C. “... it
is a truck that has been built to a
price to serve the needs of fleet
owners and one truck buyers who
require a straightforward design
with driveline and under-carriage
strength well-qualified to handle
many tasks.”
The continued dominance
of the ACCO 1900 Series in its
class is made possible by the
fortitude of the ACCO-Cummins
partnership. The backing of
Australia’s biggest dealer
network and a ready, realistically
priced parts supply.
Well there it is in black and
white. A sound case for some
owners dubbing this big red truck
“the paying power”. And why it
lands your account in the black.

group has spent $3.5 million over the
past three years on a new transmitter
and studio. Lismore’s RTN-8 also has a
new transmitter.
McKenzie says the company also ex-
pects to move into new headquarters at
Goonellabah between Lismore and
Ballina next year. A new building,
expected to cost up to $2 million, will
house RTN-8, 2LM and the Northern

Northern Star is not entirely safe
from stock exchange predators. Most of
its 2500 shareholders live on the NSW
north coast. Locals hold two-thirds of
the stock. However the top 20 share-
holders hold only 34 percent of the
stock, the largest being Tweed River

erator of radio station 2MW) with 3.6
percent.
Jobs under survey
WESTPAC’S Marilyn Peck could find
some embarrassments in the bank’s per-
sonnel structure over the next few
months.
Peck is the newly-appointed man-
ager, affirmative action, in the bank’s
personnel division, charged with
examining Westpac’s employee struc-
ture and the opportunities it offers for
both men and women.
Westpac is one of the 28 companies
in the Federal Government’s pilot pro-
gram on affirmative action. The corpor-
ate participants will report their
findings to the Australian Business
Council which will confer with a gov-
ernment working party.
Peck said she was first undertaking a
statistical analysis of positions held by
men and women, their length of time
and where they were located in the
bank. She said: “We might find there
are barriers to women in certain areas.
In the long run, appointments come
down to the person who is competent.
There will be no pushing women
through for the sake of it.”
There are no conclusions from the
Westpac study yet. It appears, though,
that most of the appointments for
women stop at junior or supervisory
levels.
The bank’s highest positions held by
women are a regional managership in
career banking and a managership in a
specialist area.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The twins take a turn
THE TWIN companies of Stellar-
Kratos have battled on since the early
1970 s under the direction of boatbuilder
and furniture maker Alex Pongrass and
his associates. They have been survi-
vors, if not successes, as mineral ex-
plorers. But both companies have taken
a new turn this year with a massive
plunge into oil and gas exploration.
They have interests in tenements spread
over many of the most prospective basin
areas in Australia.
Pongrass remains
chairman of Stellar and
Kratos but both come
under the umbrella of
Coronet Resources NL,
the company put
together by geologist
Hector Ward who has
moved out in favor of a
group headed by Syd-
ney accountant lan Joye. The ac-
companying diagram shows the new
group structure. Each company has
different oil interests but I’m buying
into two of the stable:
■ Coronet Resources (market capi-
talisation $9.65 million) because it has
interests in both Stellar and Kratos and
its own oil interests. It is also equal part-
ner with Sundowner Minerals in the Si-
beria Consuls gold find in Western Aus-
tralia, enabling me to switch out of Sun-
downer into Coronet.
■ Kratos Minerals because its low-
priced contributing shares and options
offer the best leverage in the event of
field success, because the company will
figure in four wells going down within a
month and another seven before the end
of the year and because it has plenty of
cash.
In July, Jackson Graham Moore and
Partners under wrote a three-for-one
share and option issue which raised net
funds to $6.3 million and another share
placement to be made this month will
raise $3.75 million. About $5 million
will go to acquire new interests on the
Eromanga Basin and the balance is
sufficient to fund its oil and mineral
commitments to the end of next year.
All those issues have blown Kratos’
issued capital out to l. 16 million fully-
paid 50c shares, 116.6 million paid to
10c (with a pledge of no calls before
1987) and 112.4 million January 1987
options. The shares are valued at $9.73
million, with the lightly-traded fully-
paids at 35c and the contribs at Bc. On
what the company holds, they look
cheap.
Space precludes a full catalogue of
the tenements but the four areas in
which the company will participate in
wells soon are:
■ Carpentaria Basin NT-P3O a
10 percent working interest in the
Duyken No 1 to be drilled by Canada-
NW within the 30,000 sq km permit area
in early October.
■ Eromanga Basin ATP3O3 a 5
percent interest in the block adjacent to
the Tintaburra find where a well will
spud at the end of Sep-
tember.
■ Eromanga Basin
ATP299B - a 12.5 per-
cent working interest
and 2.8 percent royalty
interest in a block
where Western Mining
is to spud the Row-
legan Creek No 1 well.
■ Surat Basin ATP 253 a 5 per-
cent working interest in a well to be put
down by Petro-Energy in October.
Kratos’ other interests beyond
Queensland include 10 percent partici-
pations in the Esso blocks EPIBB-189 on
the Carnarvon Basin of WA.

It performs even better
on paper.
To stay in business these days
a truck has to perform as well on
paper as it does on the road. And
no truck typifies that more than
the new ACCO 1950 C. Its ability
to consistently turn in a lower total
cost of ownership often means the
difference between making money,
or not.
The ACCO’s on-road perform-
ance is exemplary. And now with
the new Cummins VTI9O turbo-
charged diesel aboard it is set to go
one better.
Some characteristics of the fuel
efficient 8.3 litre VTI9O are its
massive torque rise capability and
its peak torque in low rev range.
This extra bottom end torque
means fewer gear changes.
The 4-valve head allows for
more efficient engine breathing.
While camshaft actuated fuel injec-
tion makes for easy adjustment
avoids the complication of an
injection distributor or pipes.
The VTI9O can be fitted with
a Jacobs brake which uses engine
compression to slow the vehicle.
That effectively means less wear
on brakes and added safety on
steep runs.
These subtle changes in engine
design make for dynamic
performance and enviable
dependability. There’s even a
2 year/160,000 km warranty to
prove our point.
The outstanding success of the
ACCO 1900 Series has consolidated
the International/Cummins
alliance. But rather than rest on
their laurels they keep striving for
that extra fuel efficiency or lower
tare to give their trucks a
competitive edge. An edge that
extends to parts and service with
Australia’s biggest dealer network
at your disposal.
In this business no other truck
performs better on paper.

THE MODEST FARMER
Back to the wilderness
by Bert Kelly
CLYDE CAMERON, in his book
Unions In Crisis when discussing our
centralised arbitration system, says:
“No Australian alive today can remem-
ber having lived as an adult under any
other system. Australians are accus-
tomed to it and they accept it because
‘custom breeds preference.’ It will be re-
formed but it is safe to say that it will
never be abolished by an act of parlia-
ment, for no politician will ever forget
the lesson given to the Bruce-Page gov-
ernment in 1929. Even though Prime
Minister Bruce was not proposing the
abolition of commonwealth concilia-
tion and arbitration laws but merely the
transfer of commonwealth power to the
states in order to do away with overlap-
ping, he suffered political annihilation
including the loss of his own blue rib-
and seat of Flinders. That lesson will
never be forgotten and no future prime
minister will ever be tempted to test his
fate on that issue.”
That certainly has been the conven-
tional wisdom up till now: the arbitra-
tion system, as we know it, is supposed
to be here to stay.
During 19 years in parliament, I
never heard it seriously questioned
though, of course, there were many at-
tempts to improve it. But increasing
numbers of voices have been raised re-
cently questioning the very foundations
on which the system rests.
The most authoritative of these was
that of John Stone, in his Shann mem-
orial lecture in Perth, just before his re-
tirement as head of Treasury. I shall be
quoting from this lecture for years, so I
shall not try to summarise it today.
However, I want to deal now with one
aspect of the reception that Stone’s lec-
ture received. I am very critical of the
many sneering comments from some of
the top-ranking commentators, such as:
“It is all very well for Stone in his ivory
tower in Canberra to speak like that,
criticising our centralised wage system.
Surely he must know that Bruce tried to
alter it in 1929 and, ever since then, it
has been regarded as sacred. Why
should Stone start crying in the wilder-
ness about it when the electorate wants
it to stay as it is?”
Well, the way to persuade the elec-
torate to change an attitude is to ques-
tion what we do. This usually involves a
good deal of crying in the wilderness
at least at the start. If you are right and
have a bit of luck and can keep going,
you may win out in the end. But you
usually have to start in the wilderness
and this is not much fun for the first 20
years or so, as many people have dis-
covered.
Stone can take comfort from the
knowledge that many people who have
become highly regarded made their
starts crying in the wilderness. That is
where the prophet Isaiah set up his cam-
paign headquarters when he was trying
to persuade the Israelites to make their
crooked roads straight and that kind of
thing. I guess the clever commentators
brushed him aside because few would
listen to him in the cities where most of
the people lived but I bet today’s Israel-
is wish he had been listened to then.
Churchill, too, did a lot of crying in a
different kind of wilderness when he
was warning the British electorate of the
need to arm to meet the fascist wrath to
come. His wilderness was much more
comfortable than Isaiah’s, being well
provided with creature comforts such as
whisky, but he had to put up with the
sneers of colleagues and commentators
because he could not muster much pol-
itical support.
“Why should we listen to him?” the
wise ones said. “He is crying in the wil-
derness.” But we came to rue the day
when we did not listen to him.
At a much lower level, I too am
somewhat of an expert about crying in
the wilderness.
When I started in 1959 trying to have
tariffs reduced, I was sneered at by all
the wise ones in the gallery in Canberra
except for Alan Wood and Max
Newton. My political colleagues and
opponents thought I was a bit queer and
the Country Party was certain of it,
though supposed to be the farmers’
party. Now, almost everyone except the
economic troglodytes knows that tariffs
must gradually but certainly be reduced
(though there is plenty of disagreement
about the speed with which this should
be done). But we would have escaped
much inevitable pain if more people
had listened to me 20 years ago, instead
of making me do all my crying in the
wilderness.
I have found out the hard way that
all the easy and popular tasks have been
done by people far more clever than I
and only the hard ones remain. I have
an uneasy feeling that one of these is
going to be altering our centralised arbi-
tration system. So, out into the wilder-
ness I go with Stone and other hardy
souls. (Copies of Stone’s lecture can be

light at the End of the Tunnel?
Inmates at a Vietnamese ‘re-education camp’: Shultz proposes to bring them to America, but just how —or how quickly—is unclear
The United States and Vietnam take steps to settle two emotional issues.
Of all the moral issues surrounding U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam War, two
cut especially close to many hearts: the
plight of mixed-race children left behind by
their American GI fathers, and the fate of
former U.S. employees and South Vietnam-
ese officials still being detained by the Viet-
namese. Last week there was good news out
of Washington for both groups. In testimo-
ny before congressional refugee commit-
tees, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
announced a proposal to resettle Amerasian
children and Vietnamese political prisoners
in the United States. Washington and Ha-
noi clearly want the issues resolved. But
precisely how—or how quickly—that may
happen is still uncertain.
The Shultz proposal came amid other
signs last week of a small thaw in
otherwise icy postwar relations between
Vietnam and the United States. In an
interview with a Japanese news agency,
Hanoi’s Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach said that Vietnam was prepared
“unconditionally” to discuss the with-
drawal of its troops from Cambodia. An
agreement, he suggested, could be based
on a proposal by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which has called for a United Nations-
supervised withdrawal of the Viet-
namese forces. Washington reacted
promptly—and positively. “Vietnamese
willingness to negotiate a genuine po-
litical settlement,” said a State Depart-
ment spokesman commenting on the un-
official Japanese report, “would be a
welcome development.”
For the moment, however, the Shultz
plan seemed a more realistic hope. As out-
lined in Congress last week, the proposal
would provide for transfer to the United
States of both the Amerasian children and
the political prisoners through the U.N.-
sponsored Orderly Departure Program.
The estimated 10,000 prisoners could be
flown to the United States within two years
and the 8,000 Amerasian children within
three years. Details will be discussed at a
session of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees next month in Geneva.
The goals of the Shultz proposal may be
overly ambitious, however. If families are
included—as they almost certainly will

be —the number of would-be refugees
would skyrocket. To date, the largest num-
ber of people moved in a single year through
the Orderly Departure Program is barely
26,000. To make matters worse, nearly a
half-million other Vietnamese have already
qualified for the program; presumably they
would have to be allowed into the United
States first. And there are other refugee
groups to consider, including thousands of
Cambodians and Laotians still in limbo in
camps in Thailand.
Vietnam and the United States have long
bickered over the question of resettling the
political prisoners, many of whom are in “re-
education camps,” where they have been
starved, beaten and forced into hard la-
bor. Hanoi has repeatedly offered to turn
them over; last May, Vietnamese Prime
Minister Pham Van Dong told News-
week that Vietnam was “quite prepared
to allow all of those left in the camps to
leave tomorrow for the United States.’’
But Hanoi insists that Washington un-
conditionally accept everyone in the
camps, which could include common
criminals with no ties to the American
war effort. In turn Washington demands
that inspections of the camps be allowed,
a condition Hanoi has always refused.
Discrimination: The two sides are clos-
er on the question of resettling the
Amerasian children, who face humiliat-
ing discrimination in Vietnam because of
their mixed ancestry. Shultz has ac-
knowledged the “undisputed ties” the
children have to the United States. But so
far, mutual recriminations have prevent


ed progress on their emigration. American
officials contend that the Vietnamese drag
their feet on the preparation of exit papers
for the Amerasians. The Vietnamese coun-
ter that U.S. documentation requirements
are needlessly stringent, delaying an other-
wise simple process. They want the children
handled outside U.S. guidelines and quotas
for Indochinese refugees.
Those disputes will not be easy to over-
come. But the Shultz proposal comes at a
time when the overall refugee situation in
Southeast Asia is looking brighter than it
has in years. The 600,000 people who were
awaiting resettlement in Thailand five years
ago number just 125,000 today. “I think we
are coming closer to the end of the prob-
lem,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
gees Poul Hartling said two weeks ago. At
the same time, he admitted that his organi-
zation had “no forecast as to how many
months or years it will go on.”
Over the past decade, most refugees with
family ties abroad or clear-cut fear of politi-
cal persecution have been processed, leav-
ing behind thousands of people no country
wants to claim. In Thailand, for example,
there are hundreds of former Khmer Rouge
soldiers, remnants of the murderous Pol Pot
regime. Says one refugee official in Thai-
land: “We are down to the dregs.”
Seeking Escape: Then too, there is the
constant threat that there could be a new
exodus of refugees. As one Western diplo-
mat in Bangkok put it: “Just because the
numbers go down in one place doesn’t mean
we’re anywhere near the end of the prob-
lem.” Relief officials and the Thai govern-
ment have recently been alarmed by a surge
in refugee arrivals from Laos, where high
taxes, military conscription and forced-la-
bor programs have sent thousands fleeing
across the border. At current rates, officials
say, there may be 18,000 new Laotians in
Thailand by the end of the year. Few of
them, however, are likely to meet U.N.
qualifications for refugee status, which re-
quire proof that an individual faces the clear
threat of political persecution. More often
than not, such judgments are highly subjec-
tive. But no matter what their official status,
most of Indochina’s continuing stream of
refugees will still be desperately poor people
seeking escape from one of the world’s most
unhappy regions.

Harding: ‘I Don’t Give Up Hope’
Poul Hartling, 70, has been the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) since 1978, just before the
peak of the refugee exodus from Indo-
china. Last week, after a two-week visit to
Thailand and Vietnam, he spoke with
Newsweek’s Frank GibneyJr. in Bang-
kok. Excerpts:
GIBNEY: In Vietnam, did you discuss
the American offer to move people out of
the country’s re-education camps?
HARTLING: This is a bilateral issue
and it was not discussed. But it is the clear
wish of the Vietnamese that this would be
over and above the Orderly Departure
Program (ODP) exercise.
Q. According to Secretary of State
Shultz’s statement, the U.S. ODP alone
will have a ceiling of 10,000 people for
1985, while it is hoped that all Amerasian
children and 10,000 political prisoners
will be out within three years. Is that a
realistic new development?
A. The new development is that the
United States clearly has said it will ac-
cept all these people. That’s good. What
we see now is that each week about 500
people are leaving—so percent for the
United States, 50 percent for other coun-
tries around the world. The Vietnamese
authorities said clearly that they want
that number to increase.
Q. Will the Vietnamese allow the depar-
tures to go on for as long as it takes to move
all of these people?
A. The Vietnamese are prepared to go
on. There are many obstacles but they
have cleared the way and now the process
is functioning week after week. We are
prepared to do whatever we can to pro-
vide the necessary facilities so that there
will be no delay.
Q. What the refugees go through may be
most dramatically demonstrated by the
“boatpeople’s”plight. Your group helped
the Thai government organize an anti-
piracy program, but the problem goes on.
A. One year ago three-quarters of the
boats were attacked; in the last year that
has gone down to 50 percent. But if [there
is any way] that can help refugees from
being robbed, raped and killed, then we
will be making the proper effort.

BERNARD GOTFRYD—NEWSWEEK
Q. The Khao I Dang holding center,
which has about 37,000 Cambodians still
awaiting resettlement, is scheduled to be
phased out early next year. What is the
significance of that?
A. Three or four years ago there were
130,000 people there —it was the biggest
Khmer city in the world. Now there are
fewer than 40,000 people in the camp.
What we are [asking] the authorities is
that nobody be forced out of the camp
against his will. If the refugees can be
resettled, excellent. If they want to be
repatriated, fine. I think I can say we have
reassurances that they will not be forced
out against their will.
Q. At least half of those people will not
be resettled. Where will they go?
A. We hope they will go back to the
villages where they came from. It is a
viable possibility and I don’t give up hope.
We are still negotiating in Phnom Penh to
overcome the political obstacles.
Q. Former Khmer Rouge soldiers have
come out of refugee camps and resettled in
the United States. As a result, refugee offi-
cials from America and other countries
are screening resettlement applicants even
more carefully than usual. Do you consid-
er this a problem?
A. We have only one premise: that refu-
gees should be resettled if that is what they
want. Anyone has the right to have politi-
cal and religious convictions and beliefs.
But these people, whoever they are,
should be treated as human beings. I
know it is said that [Khmer Rouge sol-
diers are there] and this might upset the
plans of some receiving countries. What I
do not like is that some people are saying,
“We will take you and you but we don’t
lik eyou.”
Q. You were recently quoted as saying
that the end to the refugee problem in
Southeast Asia may be in sight. Yet given
the continuing trickle of refugees, is that
realistic?
A. If you look at the trickle it’s doubtful.
But if you look at the situation now,
compared to 1979, it is obvious that
something has changed. Many refugees
came, they were helped; other refugees
come, they will be helped. It would be
naive to say that in my lifetime there will
be an end to the refugee problem any-
where. But each time we can help one, or
100, or 100,000, to start a new life, it is
encouraging.


WORLD AFFAIRS
NORTH KOREA
Pyongyang’s Outward Look
As South Korea’s President Chun Doo
Hwan went back to business as usual in
Seoul last week after his landmark visit to
Japan, North Korea’s fiery propaganda
mills continued to attack his “sellout” to
Japanese capitalists. Behind all the bom-
bast, however, the government of President
Kim II Sung launched a diplomatic trial
balloon of its own: an invitation to foreign-
ers to invest in a wide range of North Kore-
an industrial and commercial enterprises.
The overture was extraordinary enough for
a country steeped in three dec-
ades of repression, xenophobia
and strident insistence on na-
tional self-reliance. But it also
reflected the Pyongyang gov-
ernment’s pressing need to re-
vive its sputtering economy—
and to narrow the gap that has
been opened up by its rapidly
industrializing archrival.
North Korea’s surprising
overture gave every sign of be-
ing a carefully timed atttempt
to try to match Seoul’s diplo-
matic success. Intentionally or
not, the offer followed an en-
couraging comment by Japan’s
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Na-
kasone in the midst of Chun’s
three-day visit. Nakasone said
that new efforts should be
made to “move North Korea
from its position of isolation.”
In fact, as early as January of
this year North Korea’s rub-
ber-stamp Parliament, the Su-
preme People’s Assembly, had
called for closer ties with
“friendly” capitalist countries
in the West, without specifying
what forms those ties might
take. Last week’s move, said
one Japanese official, “is the
first tangible sign that North
Korea [actually] means to pro-
mote relations.”
Seoul seemed willing, if somewhat tenta-
tively, to show some flexibility toward the
north. Last week Chun’s government an-
nounced that it would accept a recent North
Korean offer of relief aid for victims of
heavy flooding that killed 139 people in the
south earlier this month. The actual goods
involved are relatively modest: an estimated
$lO million worth of rice, cloth, medicines
and other supplies, which Seoul last week
suggested could be shipped to the South
Korean ports of Inchon and Pusan by the
North Korean Red Cross. In the past, both
governments had always rejected such of-
fers out of hand. There are still some details
that remain to be worked out. If they are,
the shipment would mark the first open
exchange of commodities between the two
sides since the Korean War.
Despite that apparent breakthrough,
there was no sign that Pyongyang would
take the next step and accept the offer that
Chun made last month for South Korean
trade and technical assistance. The north’s
new investment regulations, as broadcast
by official radio last week, encourage joint
ventures “based on the principles of equali-
ty and reciprocity” between Pyongyang’s
North Korea’s Kim waving to a crowd in Peking: A Chinese example
AP
state-run firms and foreign companies. The
five-chapter, 26-article law seems clearly
patterned on a 1979 joint-venture code
that was enacted by Peking as part of
“open door” efforts to promote China’s
modernization.
Advice: The similarities with Peking’s ef-
forts may not stop there. During the past
year North Korean officials have been
flocking to China for a firsthand look at
Peking’s current fling with a free-market
economy. During one such visit this sum-
mer, North Korean Foreign Minister Kim
Yong Nam publicly praised China’s prag-
matic policies. His hosts had some friendly
but pointed advice: pay more attention to
producing consumer goods and scale back
on the military-oriented heavy industries
that are suffocating the economy.
Against the backdrop of North Korea’s
$3 billion foreign debt, sagging exports and
aging industrial plant, such advice from a
powerful—and increasingly prosperous—
neighbor and ally may well carry weight.
Japanese businessmen who recently visited
Pyongyang say that the North Korean gov-
ernment is studying plans to establish a
Chinese-style “special economic zone” at
Nampo, a port city near the capital. Similar
enclaves offering special incentives to for-
eign investors are reportedly being consid-
ered in the cities of Chongjin and Wonsan
on Korea’s northeast coast.
But even an ironclad list of assurances is
unlikely to set off a stampede of business
executives eager to make deals
with one of the world’s most
isolated and unpredictable re-
gimes. Even though Japan re-
mains North Korea’s largest
noncommunist trading part-
ner, the level of trade between
the two countries has slipped in
the last several years after peak-
ing in 1980 at $5 54 million. Part
of the reason is Pyongyang’s
failure to repay $360 million in
commercial bank loans from
the 19705. North Korea had
hoped to use those funds to im-
port factories and equipment in
an attempt to shore up its erod-
ing industrial base. Although
the debt was rescheduled in
1978, Japanese sources say that
Pyongyang has stopped mak-
ing the required interest pay-
ments and is technically in de-
fault. The issue is a touchy one
for the Japanese. “As long as
the foreign-debt problem re-
mains unresolved,” says one
Japanese official, “the im-
provement of economic rela-
tions can’t get under way.”
A Window: Given Tokyo’s
hope to reduce tensions be-
tween the two Koreas, Japan
may soon be willing to relax
some of the sanctions it im-
posed on the north following
the bombing attempt on Chun’s life by
North Korean agents in Rangoon last Octo-
ber. And Japanese Foreign Minister Shin-
taro Abe recently said that he would soon
request that both Koreas be admitted to the
United Nations. Even so, during the sum-
mit talks in Tokyo a fortnight ago Japanese
officials repeated their standing pledge not
to upgrade the still-unofficial diplomatic
contacts with the Pyongyang government.
“The window seems to be opening a crack,”
one Japanese specialist on North Korea said
optimistically last week. But it could just as
easily—and suddenly—be closed.

So it’s most useful that one can cov-
er both shorter and longer distances so
quickly and comfortably with Swissair.
And that Swissair has such an exten-
sive route network: 98 destinations
worldwide, 48 of them in Europe
alone.
It’s hardly conceivable, therefore,
that you should have to do without
Swissair on a European business trip.
And with Swissair you certainly don’t
have to do without anything at all.
Neither First Class if you want to fly
luxuriously, nor Business Class if
you want to fly very comfortably, nor
Economy Class if you want to fly at fa-
vourable fares. Because Swissair has
equipped all its aircraft with three
compartments. (On a few routes, how-
ever, government approval has not

to providing specially friendly, courte-

And since a meal in your business
partner’s favourite restaurant may

which pleases the palate instead of

However, Swissair doesn’t take all
the credit for one of the big advantages
it offers business travellers: Switzer-

so very favourably placed with regard
to transport facilities.
And that’s something extremely

better than anywhere else.

SYRIA
Assad: His Brother’s Keeper
Syria’s President Hafez Assad has a repu-
tation for ruthlessness, but would he
condemn his own brother to exile? Last
spring, after defusing a power struggle that
had broken out during his recent illness,
Assad sent his younger brother, Rifaat As-
sad, 47, and two rival Syrian military com-
manders on face-saving trips abroad. The
two generals eventually returned to Damas-
cus; Rifaat has been in Geneva since June.
Members of his entourage insist that he is
there for medical reasons, but last week
Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas gave
a considerably different version. “When our
president tells someone, ‘Get out of here to
Geneva,’ he goes to Geneva,” Tlas told the
West German magazine Der Spiegel.
“Whoever says ‘no’ to President Assad is
likely to find himself a head shorter.”
Rifaat Assad denied that he was any sort
of political outcast. While Tlas said Rifaat
had “become persona non grata forever
here,” a press spokesman in Geneva said
that Rifaat would return to Syria
“very soon” to resume his official
duties —he is one of the country’s
three vice presidents. He added that
Tlas himself said he had been mis-
quoted in Der Spiegel. That did not
square with the magazine’s account.
The interview was conducted in Da-
mascus Jast month by two members
of its staff, one of whom, Adel Elias,
was born in Lebanon and speaks flu-
ent Arabic. Elias said in Hamburg
that Tlas had seen and approved the
edited version of the interview and
that the only one who had disavowed
the defense minister’s words was Ri-
faat Assad’s spokesman. According
to Elias, Tlas told him last week, “I won’t
take one word back from what I said.”
Tlas has a reputation for shooting from
the lip—he once warned that kamikaze
planes would attack U.S. naval vessels off
the coast of Lebanon —but he is also a confi-
dant of Hafez Assad. It was at least con-
ceivable, therefore, that he had learned of
Rifaat’s fate from the president himself. But
that was guesswork. “Who can say?” re-
marked one Damascus-based diplomat.
“Only three or four people really know
what is going on in this country.”
Personality Cult: There was no question,
however, that Rifaat had jockeyed openly
for power after his brother was sidelined
with heart trouble late last year. At one
point during the struggle for succession,
wall posters of Rifaat appeared in Damas-
cus, suggesting that he was nurturing a
personality cult of his own. At the height of
the political crisis last spring, troops from
Rifaat’s 30,000-man Praetorian Guard con-

fronted those of two rival military units in
the streets of the capital. But Hafez Assad
managed to put a stop to the maneuvering
before it could lead to bloodshed and, possi-
bly, to his own fall from power. As his
health stabilized, the ailing Syrian president
assumed personal control over the restive
units and sent their squabbling leaders —the
so-called three “crown princes” —out of the
country, ostensibly on diplomatic missions.
In Geneva, Rifaat Assad moved into a
secluded villa overlooking Lake Geneva. He
told Swiss authorities that he had come for
medical treatment and applied for three-
month tourist visas for himself and his entire
retinue —which included 180 bodyguards.
The Swiss were less than happy to play host
to so many gunmen. Rifaat’s armed guards
are “equivalent to two companies of Swiss
soldiers,” complained Guy Fontanet, Gene-
va Canton’s minister of justice and police.
“We are always ready to receive foreign
visitors, but not if they expect to bring along
what can only be called the basis for a private
army.” Rifaat later settled for 50 body-
guards; Swiss authorities have suggested
that 15 or 20 would be adequate.
Whether Rifaat Assad was in per-
manent or temporary exile —or just
playing a waiting game —no one dis-
puted that his brother the president
seemed more firmly in control now
than at any time in his 14 years in
power. All the same, the question of
who will one day replace him still
fascinates Damascus. And even in
exile, Rifaat Assad could still remain
a contender. “The only person who
knows with any degree of certainty,”
said one U.S. diplomat, “is Hafez As-
sad.” And as usual, the Syrian leader
was keeping his secrets to himself.

Squaring off with the genie: Moscow’s revolving-door leadership created ‘a problem that no other president has faced’
WRIGHT— MIAMI NEWS
Arms Control: Man-to-Man
Reagan will meet Gromyko next week, but who’s in charge at the Kremlin?
Vladimir Lomeiko wouldn’t answer the
question. Foreign journalists wanted
to know what had become of Soviet Presi-
dent Konstantin Chernenko, who had
dropped out of sight again. Lomeiko, a
spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
has had long practice in fending off such
uncultured inquiries, and reporters have
learned to grasp at whatever straws he offers
them. They recalled that when Lomeiko
was asked the same question at the end of
August, he replied blandly that Chernenko
was “engaged in his duties.” Last week the
spokesman refused to say anything. Of such
feathery distinctions are rumors born in the
Soviet Union. Lomeiko’s silence reinforced
the opinion among foreigners in Moscow
that Chernenko was seriously ill and that
his term in office would not be a long one. “I
think he could go quite soon,” said a West-
ern diplomat. But of course no one outside
the Kremlin really knew. The riddle of who
was running the Soviet Union still had no
reliable answer.
That issue assumed particular impor-
tance when Moscow agreed to a meeting
between Foreign Minister Andrei Gromy-
ko and Ronald Reagan on Sept. 28. It will be
Reagan’s first contact with a top-ranking
Soviet official —and, for that matter, the
Politburo’s first look at Reagan in the flesh.
The Soviets must have realized that by
agreeing to the meeting, they were giving a
boost to Reagan’s re-election campaign;
their willingness to do so sug-
gested that Moscow expected
the president to win anyway
and was cautiously preparing
to do business with him, at
least on a limited basis. In
that case, the next few
months could determine the
tone and content of the super-
power relationship through-
out a second Reagan term. If
each side likes what it sees
and hears next week, it might
just be possible, for starters,
to revive the stalled negotia-
tions on nuclear weapons.
But who will make the decisions in
Moscow, and will he have enough authority
to implement them? “I’ve been facing a
problem that no other president has faced,”
Reagan complained last week, referring to
the fact that “in three years of my term in
office, we’ve had three leaders there.” Now
the status of the third man, Chernenko, was
in doubt. And the outside world still had no

satisfactory explanation for
the sudden dismissal two
weeks ago of Marshal Nikolai
Ogarkov, the armed forces’
chief of staff.
No mention was made last
week of the “other work” to
which Ogarkov supposedly
had been assigned. In the ab-
sence of any official clarifica-
tion, rumors and guesswork
proliferated concerning the
status of the entire Soviet
leadership. Some analysts in
Washington suggested that,
without waiting for Cher


nenko to die, Gromyko might assume his
duties as chief of state or that Mikhail Gor-
bachov, 53, the young powerhouse of the
Politburo, might replace Chernenko as
head of the Soviet Communist Party. An
even wilder theory came from New York
Times columnist William Safire, who
claimed that Ogarkov had made a “bold
bid” to replace Gorbachov as Chernenko’s
successor. According to Safire, Ogarkov
had represented the “antibureaucratic fac-
tion of the KGB and the Red Army,” and he
had been slapped down by the “party stal-

warts” on the Politburo, led by Gromyko
and Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov.
Ogarkov seemed an unlikely Bonaparte.
On the Politburo, and in the upper reaches
of the military, everyone is a party stalwart;
there’s no other way to fly. In Moscow and
Washington, Kremlin-watchers were com-
ing to a rough, preliminary consensus about
the Ogarkov affair. It suggested that two
factors may have converged to do him in: a
policy dispute and a power struggle. The
policy disagreement may have concerned
the military budget. Analysts suddenly
were paying close attention to an interview
published last May by a Soviet newspaper,
in which Ogarkov hinted that the Soviet
Union was lagging behind the West in non-
nuclear military technology and needed to
spend more money to catch up. Normally,
that kind of agitation would not be enough,
in itself, to cost a chief of staff his job. Some
Kremlinologists thought Ogarkov also had
become entangled in the struggle to succeed
Chernenko, and that one faction had struck
a blow at another by seizing the opportunity
to get rid of the marshal.
There was circumstantial evidence to
suggest that Gorbachov was in a strong
position for the time being. The communi-
que issued after last week’s Politburo meet-
ing devoted three paragraphs to his recent
visit to Bulgaria; such recognition normally
doesn’t warrant more than one paragraph,
Apparently Gorbachov had done an effec-
tive job. When he arrived in Sofia, Bulgar-
ian party leader Todor Zhivkov, one of
Moscow’s most devoted allies, was making
plans for an icebreaking official visit to West
Germany. It took Gorbachov only a few
hours to turn that decision around—a
breathtakingly blunt intervention, even by
the standards of the Warsaw Pact,
According to Western intelligence re-
ports, Chernenko’s health—he suffers from
respiratory trouble, among other things—
took a turn for the worse
during the summer. The
best guess was that the
country was being run by
the Politburo acting as a
body. Tass, the Soviet
news agency, said that
when Ustinov made a
visit of his own to
Czechoslovakia, he had
conveyed greetings from
“Konstantin Chernenko
and all of the members of
the Politburo.” The usu-
al custom is to report
that the visiting digni-
tary brought greetings
from the head of the
Soviet Communist Par-
ty, with no mention of
anyone else. The all-in-
clusive message implied
that the Soviet leader-
ship was even more col-
lective than usual.
Despite its internal
distractions, the Kremlin had good reasons
for wanting to meet with President Reagan.
Soviet leaders probably decided weeks or
even months ago that Reagan was likely to
win the election. Their visceral dislike for
the president has not abated, but they must
know that, if they want to improve East-
West relations, they will eventually have to
look for some mutually acceptable ground
on which to deal with him. Since the start of
this year, Reagan has taken a conciliatory
line in most of his comments about the
Soviet Union; Moscow needs to find out
whether he really means it.
Self-respect: “People tend to forget that
[the Soviets] come to these meetings for
their own good reasons,” argues a Reagan
adviser, “and what’s in it for them is not just
the chance for a better relationship with us,
but also to get some self-respect back. They
haven’t done well lately. They want to be
seen as a world power, and if their foreign
minister can meet with the president of the
United States, to their mind that’s a plus.”
In years past, Gromyko regularly touched
bases with U.S. leaders during his visits to
New York for the fall session of the United
Nations General Assembly. That custom
was interrupted by the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan in 1979, and the resumption of
meetings was thwarted last year when the
Soviets shot down a Korean airliner.
The negotiations aimed at getting Gro-
myko back onto the White House calendar
began several weeks ago. The Reagan ad-
ministration had been pressing for a meet-
ing all along, but there was no decision on
the Soviet side until Gromyko returned
from his vacation early this month. First the
word came out that the foreign minister
would talk to Secretary of State George
Shultz; then it was announced that Gromy-
ko would call on Reagan two days later. At a
news conference last week, the president
said he hoped his talk with Gromyko would
The foreign minister: A Dutch uncle?
“maybe convince him that the United
States means no harm.”
The meeting may not settle much, by
itself. U.S. officials won’t be surprised if
Gromyko does some grandstanding before
his arrival at the White House. At the United
Nations, or in some other public forum, he
may renew the Soviet proposal for an imme-
diate moratorium on weapons tests in space
or for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban
treaty, ideas that Washington has rejected
before. In private with Reagan, however,
Gromyko is expected to listen carefully and
firmly restate existing Soviet positions. He
may try out the stern, Dutch-uncle act that
he likes to use on statesmen less experienced
than himself. But U.S. officials do not expect
him to display much initiative.
Arms in Space: Nonetheless, the Soviets
want something from Washington. Since
June they have been pushing for a moratori-
um on weapons tests in space, a field in
which the Americans have forged ahead.
Earlier this year a Minuteman rocket was
used successfully to shoot down an incom-
ing missile. The United States also has test-
fired a rocket that would be launched
against satellites in low orbit. A test of the
antisatellite (ASAT) weapon against an ac-
tual target in space was scheduled for No-
vember. According to sources in Washing-
ton, technical difficulties have forced


postponement of that test until early next
year. The delay might give Reagan time to
consider a moratorium on tests in space.
Indeed, Shultz has said that Washington
would be willing to discuss a moratorium in
space if Moscow returns to the strategic
arms reduction talks (START) and the ne-
gotiations on intermediate-range nuclear
forces in Europe (INF), both of which were
halted by a Soviet walkout last year.
Hard-liners in the president’s own camp
were worried that Reagan would accept an
unfavorable “precondition” for resumption
of the Geneva talks, surrendering Ameri-
ca’s edge in space. To blow cold air on any
potential thaw with Moscow, conservative
senators pressed the administration to
make public a year-old report that details
alleged Soviet violations of existing arms-
control treaties. But the White House de-
cided to withhold the report until after the
meeting with Gromyko. And at his news
conference, Reagan nearly disavowed the
document, which has been described as a
worst-case view of Soviet activities. “I
haven’t had a chance to study it as yet,” he
said, adding that publication of the report
“isn’t some choice of mine. This is some-
thing required by the Congress.”
Settling Grudges: So far, the thaw that is
so dreaded by American conservatives has
not yet begun. Just last week, Tass wailed
that “relations between the superpowers
have fallen to their lowest level in their
entire history.” The complaint was itself a
new low; usually the Soviets say that things
haven’t been this bad since the Cuban mis-
sile crisis of 1962. If Reagan and Gromyko
get off on the right foot, they may begin to
repair the damage done by Afghanistan,
Poland, the Korean atrocity, two Olympic
boycotts and last year’s showdown over
missiles in Europe. That’s a lot of grudges to
settle. And even with all the good will in the
world, Moscow and Washington still would
face enormous difficulties in resolving the
tangled issues of arms control. But if Rea-
gan is re-elected, his second term may be the
last chance for the old men in the Kremlin to
have a positive effect on East-West
relations.

A Delicate Balance
For the 2,000-member congregation at Leningrad’s House of
Prayer, it was an answered prayer. Two years after turning an
old and unused Russian Orthodox church into a sparkling white
Baptist sanctuary, they were gathered for a sermon by the Rev.
Billy Graham. Bible held aloft, his fervent voice resonating from
the pulpit, Graham invited the Russians to let Christ “into your
hearts, your family and your great country.” Many wept, and
perhaps 150 raised their hands to affirm their new commitment.
Then, as Graham was leaving, several young men unfurled
banners calling attention to 200 Soviet Baptists who have been
jailed for proselytizing. The preacher said nothing—and quickly
followed his official escorts out of the church.
The scene underlined the delicate balance of Graham’s 12-
day trip to the Soviet Union,
which began last week. The very
fact that the Kremlin was allow-
ing a foreign evangelist to travel
around the country and preach
showed that the Soviet state has
eased somewhat its traditional
hostility toward the church. But
just as they did during his first
trip to Moscow in 1982, Soviet
officials carefully structured Gra-
ham’s tour to suit their purposes.
There were no dissidents on his
itinerary, but lots of “peace activ-
ists” reciting the party line that
Washington, not Moscow, is to
blame for the current U.S.-Soviet
chill. For his part, Graham vol-
untarily refrained from speaking
out publicly against the contin-
ued violations of religious free-
dom in the U.S.S.R.
Graham’s tour did serve to

demonstrate that the era of aggressive Soviet atheism is over. In
Leningrad, according to church officials, there are now 22 active
churches, including Russian Orthodox, Protestant, Roman
Catholic and Jewish congregations. Nationwide, Western diplo-
mats estimate, as many as 30 million Soviets practice some sort
of faith. Moscow still keeps tight reins on religious activity,
however: it remains a crime to proselytize, to belong to a church
that has not registered with the government or to publish
religious material without the approval of a special government
committee. And although churchgoing is now tolerated for the
masses, the careers of party members and young professionals
can still be hurt if they are found to belong to a church.
During his visit to Leningrad, Soviet authorities took pains to
make sure that Graham preached only to the converted —not to
any ideologically correct atheists. They did not permit news of
his appearances to be published in local newspapers, for fear that
nonchurchgoers might try to hear him. When he spoke at the
Baptist church, tickets were distributed only to members of the
congregation. And when he laid a wreath at the Piskaryovskoye
Cemetery, the burial site of hundreds of thousands of Lenin-
graders who died during the 1941-43 Nazi siege of the city,
uniformed Soviet policemen kept everyone but the official 40-
member party at least 60 yards away.
The desire to display a measure of religious tolerance was not
Moscow’s only propaganda aim. Within 30 minutes of his
arrival in Moscow, Graham listened to three speakers proclaim
that the Soviets want peace with
the United States. In Leningrad,
Graham was taken to the local
office of the government-sanc-
tioned Peace Committee; Viktor
Pogorelov, a committee official,
told Graham that the demise of
detente is not “the Soviet Union’s
fault” and that “we’re for peaceful
coexistence.” Graham replied by
citing original sin as the root of
human conflict —a theological re-
sponse that diplomatically avoid-
ed taking sides in the superpower
war of words.
Distorted Views: Graham
brought along an independent
camera crew to film his visit for a
one-hour television special. He
also had his speeches recorded for
his “Hour of Decision” radio
show. In the long run, his mes-
sage to the Soviet Union will
probably be heard by more Americans than Russians. But that
may be just as well. For several years, Americans have heard
distorted views of the state of religion in the U.S.S.R. from
evangelical conservatives like Jerry Falwell. Graham refuted
those views last week, saying that “the Devil, not any country
or ideology,” is the source of evil in the world. If nothing else,
Graham’s trip showed that at least some determined Soviet
citizens can go to church —no matter how many obstacles are
placed in their way.

FRANCE
Mitterrand’s Political Budget
French autoworkers demonstrating: ‘Taking with the left hand and giving with the right ’
AVENTURIER—GAMMA-LIAISON
First came the good news about the
French national budget for 1985.
In what President Frangois Mitterrand’s
spokesman Roland Dumas called “the big-
gest cut in direct taxes ever recorded in
France,” the government last week an-
nounced a 5 percent across-the-board re-
duction in personal income taxes. Then
came the bad news. Before the taxpayer
ever pockets that saving, much of it is
likely to vanish because of higher sales
taxes on items such as gasoline and tele-
phone bills. As Paul Marchelli, a trade-
union leader, complained: “The govern-
ment is taking back with the left hand what
it gives with the right.”
In fact, Mitterrand’s strategy amounted
to more than a simple reslicing of the tax pie.
This budget was blatantly political, a last-
chance blueprint for putting the French
economy right before the 1986 parliamen-
tary elections —a campaign his Socialists
are widely expected to lose. It was also a
bold gamble; by some accounts it is the
toughest austerity budget in France since
World War 11. For the first time in at least a
decade, state spending in 1985 will rise more
slowly than the projected increase in eco-
nomic growth. That, in turn, will be
achieved through cuts in almost all public-
spending programs except education,
investment in industrial research and
defense —the key priorities for a strong,
modernized France. As the respected left-
wing daily Le Monde summed up, it is “an
unprecedented squeeze on spending.”
It was also the latest act in a remarkable
political turnaround. After Mitterrand
came to power in 1981, he tried to raise taxes
and spend France into prosperity. The re-
sult was rampant inflation and three humili-
ating devaluations of the franc. By mid-
-1983 he was forced to reverse course
completely. Taking his cues from more con-
servative leaders such as Ronald Reagan,
Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl, Mit-
terrand decided, somewhat belatedly, to
lower taxes and reduce government spend-
ing. His newest budget calls for even more
austerity. “Too much tax chokes our econo-
my, limits production and limits incen-
tives,” Mitterrand said last week.
The French president had little choice
but to prescribe stiffer medicine. Although
austerity has reduced France’s inflation
from 14 percent in 1981 to 7.5 percent to-
day, there is still a long way to go. The
inflation rate in West Germany, France’s
main trading partner, is about 2 percent,
and that difference continues to threaten
another forced devaluation of the franc.
Next year Mitterrand wants to bring infla-
tion down to 4.5 percent, cap the budget
deficit at $l5 billion and eliminate the for-
eign-trade deficit, which now stands at $3.5
billion. The only way to do all that is to cut
state spending.
‘Not Organized’: So far, Mitterrand seems
to have played his political cards adeptly.
France’s right-wing opposition has been
singularly ineffective in its attempts to at-
tack the president’s conversion to supply-
side socialism. Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist
mayor of Paris and Mitterrand’s probable
opponent in 1988’s presidential election,
said the new budget represents “a 180-de-
gree turn” in government policy. He called
the move “forced” and “not organized.”
In short, Chirac criticized style, not sub-
stance. That may reflect the right’s recogni-
tion that it would have been forced into
taking similarly stringent measures to cope
with France’s economic ills.
Another factor in Mitter-
rand’s favor was the net reduc-
tion in the overall tax burden
for 1985, which should coun-
terbalance the hefty cuts in
public spending to some de-
gree. Reductions in person-
al income taxes, company pay-
roll taxes and social-security
contributions —as well as in-
creased charges for gas, elec-
tricity and public transpor-
tation bills —leave a net benefit
to taxpayers of about 1 per-
cent. Said Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy, “It is the
first time since 1971 that we see
such a trend.”
But the left had harsh criti-
cism for the new budget. “It’s a
bad budget,” said Communist
Party economist Philippe Her-
zog. “It doesn’t contribute to
the creation of jobs.” Even gov-
ernment spokesmen admit that
they are vulnerable on thejobs issue. Unem-
ployment in France has risen from 8.5
percent to 10 percent in the last year. As a
result of the new budget, the number of
unemployed, now 2.3 million, is likely to
rise to 2.5 million by the year-end. That is
hardly a source of pride for a president who
came to office promising to put France back
to work. The government’s rationale now is
to try to recoup by saying that, in time, wise
investment and a wholesale restructuring of
French industry will create jobs. The Com-
munists, however, are not inclined to wait.
The Communist cabinet members resigned
in July in a protest against the austerity
measures and are now free to stage poten-
tially crippling strikes against government-
approved layoffs. The first likely targets are
Citroen, the troubled automaker, and Creu-
sot-Loire, the bankrupt engineering firm.
Dollar: The Communists may not be Mit-
terrand’s largest problem. According to
Finance Minister Beregovoy, the new
French budget assumes that the U.S. dollar
will weaken moderately on foreign-ex-
change markets during the coming year.
But at this moment, what Prime Minister
Laurent Fabius last week called the “crazy
dollar” continues to go through the roof.
Last week it went to 9.29 francs, a record
high. Every time the dollar rises by 1 franc,
France’s inflation rate jumps 1.5 percent,
largely because France must pay for im-
ported oil in dollars. The stronger dollar
could therefore wreck Mitterrand’s plans to
reduce inflation and wipe out the trade defi-
cit in 1985. The president is sending Berego-
voy to the International Monetary Fund
meeting in Washington this week with a
new plea to the Americans to clip the wings
of their high-flying currency. That bid prob-
ably won’t work —but the currency prob-
lem would provide a convenient scapegoat
if Mitterrand’s latest budget strategy fails.

BRITAIN
A Furor Over Keeping Secrets
Last July, Clive Ponting, a senior bureau-
crat in the British Defense Ministry,
came across documents that seemed at odds
with Britain’s official account of the sinking
of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano
during the 1982 Falklands war. Ponting was
routinely privy to such sensitive government
information, but this time he decided to
make the documents public. He sent them to
Tam Dalyell, a Labor member of Parlia-
ment, who said publicly that they supported
his contention that Prime Minister Marga-
ret Thatcher’s government had withheld
information about the Belgrano incident
THE GUARDIAN
Tisdall arriving at court, publication of ‘confidential’government documents: Attempts to protect embarrassing information?
from the lawmakers. Angered by the embar-
rassing disclosure, the Tory government
quickly charged Ponting with a breach of the
73-year-old Official Secrets Act.
The case is the latest cause celebre in a
growing movement to abolish —or at least
water down —the act, which allows the gov-
ernment to declare virtually anything a
state secret. Ponting, who now may go to
jail, says he did nothing wrong. In fact,
because of his actions the country knows
more about the attack on the Belgrano, in
which 368 Argentine crewmen were killed,
and about the British government’s han-
dling of the Falklands war, which gave
Thatcher a substantial political boost. “A
civil servant,” Ponting said recently in a
published statement, “must ultimately
place his loyalty to Parliament and the pub-
lic interest above his obligation to the inter-
ests of the government of the day.”
Many Britons seem to agree. Although
the Secrets Act has long been despised by
civil libertarians, its frequent and harsh ap-
plication by the Thatcher government has
come under increasing attack. Des Wilson,
the head of the 1984 Campaign for Freedom
of Information, calls Thatcher “the most
secretive prime minister we’ve had for many
years.” Since last spring, when Sarah Tis-
dall, a clerk in the Foreign Office, was sen-
tenced to six months in prison for giving the
press a secret memorandum on the arrival
date of American cruise missiles in Britain,
several major British newspapers have ar-
gued for liberalization of the law. They have
been joined by leaders of opposition parties.
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock says that a
more open flow of information would “en-
able the House of Commons to scrutinize the
government more rigorously.” Liberal Par-
ty leader David Steel charges that the “level
of secrecy in Britain today has reached pro-
portions that seriously undermine the
health of our democracy.”
The act is perhaps the most restrictive
government-secrecy law still in force in a
Western democracy. It was passed as an
emergency action by Parliament in 1911 in a
fit of frenzy after only 30 minutes of debate,
just as war with Germany seemed imminent.
The act’s all-embracing Section 2 applies to
anyone possessing a “sketch, plan, model,
article, note, document or information . . .
which has been entrusted in confidence to
him by any person holding office under His
Majesty.” Those who run afoul aresubject to
criminal prosecution. “It is just about the
most panicky, ill-advised and ill-thought-
out piece of legislation ever to go on the
statute books,” says Tory M.P. Jonathan
Aitken, who as a journalist was prosecut-
ed —but acquitted—under the act in 1971
for writing an article based on a confidential
report about the Nigerian-Biafran war.
The law is most often criticized as an
undemocratic license for the government to
withhold potentially embarrassing informa-
tion from the public. Only rarely, say some,
is it invoked to protect information crucial to
national security or other vital governmen-
tal functions requiring secrecy. “Very of-
ten,” says Des Wilson, “information of pub-
lic interest and public matters is denied to the
public by people who think they know bet-
ter, or who wish to cover up their mistakes,
corruption or embarrassment.”
The act does seem to lead to excessive
government secrecy. Aitken says he recently
was denied “innocent information” about a
constituent’s housing benefits by a junior
official who said the material was covered by
the Secrets Act. Wilson, who also heads an
environmental group called Friends of the
Earth, says the Ministry of Transport in-
PLUS: Smack and sensationalism • Blackpool: the
last resort • Miners and the TUC
•Edinburgh Festival • NS poetry award
voked the act to turn down the group’s
request for a study on bicycle safety. Ironi-
cally, Britons in search of such “secret”
information can sometimes get it from the
U.S. government through the Freedom of
Information Act if they have an American
contact who will submit the request. Friends
of the Earth used the tactic to uncover re-
search on nuclear-reactor safety done by
Britain’s Atomic Energy Authority.
Power: Despite support for reform, the
expected attempt to push through changes
in the legislation is likely to fail, partly be-
cause the opposition is fragmented. Steel
and Wilson are campaigning for passage of a
British Freedom of Information Act based
on the American model. Aitken and others
simply ask for a repeal of the Secrets Act’s
restrictive Section 2. Thatcher remains
steadfastly opposed to any weakening of her
power to prosecute those who leak sensitive
information. And with a commanding Tory
majority at her disposal, the prime minister
should handily defeat her foes, and Britain’s
veil of secrecy will remain in place.

Mondale’s
Desperate
Hours
In Endicott, N. Y.: Posing a showdown between the Fourth of July and April 15
WALLY McNAMEE —NEWSWEEK
Scene 1: Ronald Reagan onstage at the
Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tenn. The
occasion is a glittery gathering to celebrate
the 81 st birthday of singer Roy Acujf, a living
legend in country music. “This feller, Mr.
Reagan, has put our country back in order,
where it should be, ” Acuff declares—and
Reagan, not missing a beat, jokes that the
Grand Ole Opry is no place for Democrats
because “all they do is sing the blues. ”
Scene 2: Walter Mondale marking time
outside a Procter & Gamble plant in Green
Bay, Wis. The plan is to stage the tradition-
al candidate-at-the-factory-gate shot, but
something has gone wrong: although upward
of 300 P&G workers were expected to pass
this way during the afternoon shift change,
only about a dozen appear. The minutes drag
by, and finally one man approaches the can-
didate to hand him an oddly familiar bun-
dle. “This is a package fresh off the line, and
I sure would like you to test the quality for
us, ” the man says. Mondale squeezes the
package: it is toilet tissue.
If Walter Mondale’s presidential candi-
dacy wasn’t actually headed down the tubes
early last week, virtually everyone, from his
nervous supporters in Congress to Ronald
Reagan’s delighted aides, seemed to sense
impending disaster. Mondale’s dogged ef-
fort to sell the deficit issue seemed to be going
nowhere; at the same time, Geraldine Fer-
raro was floundering through the second
successive week of a no-win debate on abor-
tion with the hierarchy of the Roman Catho-
lic Church. On Tuesday, Mondale’s hopes of
painting Reagan into a corner on strategic
arms control were suddenly undermined by
the Kremlin itself, which agreed to send
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
to the White House to meet with Reagan on
Sept. 28. And Newsweek’s latest poll
showed Mondale and Ferraro are now fully
18 points behind Reagan and George
Bush —which is the largest margin, at this
stage, of any recent presidential contest ex-
cept the Johnson-Goldwater blowout of
1964 and the Nixon landslide of 1972. With
less than eight weeks remaining until Elec-
tion Day, Mondale reshuffled his team and
began a desperate search for tactics that
would cut Reagan down to size—while his
allies wondered if it all might be in vain.
Clearly, Week Two of the general-elec-
tion campaign of 1984 wasn’t Walter Mon-
dale’s week. Candidate Reagan, wrapped in
the mantle of his incumbency and sporting a
halo of patriotic optimism, floated effort-
lessly above the fray, flinging well-turned
one-liners at his painfully earnest opponent.
When Mondale, with an array of colored
charts and a professorial command of detail,
unveiled his much-touted plan to reduce the
federal deficit, Reagan sniffed that it was
“nothing new” and proceeded to blame
Congress for the deficits. “We see an Amer-
ica where every day is the Fourth of July,” he
told a boisterous crowd in Endicott, N.Y.
“[The Democrats] see an America where


every day is April 15.” Dazzled
by the Republican tide in the
polls, a few Reagan aides gave in
to hubris. Mondale, one of them
scoffed, “is a klutz.” Meanwhile,
Reagan told his audiences, “You
ain’t seen nothing yet.”
Strengths: To Democrats, the
trend lines were chilling. As
the Newsweek Poll found, it
is Reagan—not Mondale —who
seems to be benefiting from Mon-
dale’s biggest issue, the federal
deficit. The poll (which was com-
pleted before Mondale outlined
his deficit plan last week) shows
that 81 percent of the voters agree
with Mondale that federal taxes
are likely to go up—but at the
same time it shows that Reagan is
still regarded as better able to
keep the country prosperous and
reduce the deficit. “It’s not that
people aren’t willing to hear talk
about increased taxes,” said Rea-
gan polltaker Richard Wirthlin.
“[lt’s just that] most Americans
don’t give a lot of credibility
to Walter Mondale’s rhetoric.”
Reagan’s commanding advan-
tage is based on his perceived
strengths as a forceful, decisive
leader; in recent weeks he has
even surpassed Mondale on the question of
who is better able to keep the country out of
war. And —ominously for the Democrats—
the N ews week Poll suggests Reagan’s lead
may now have a coattail effect on congres-
sional campaigns. If Reagan’s handlers are
convinced victory is assured, says one Re-
publican strategist, they will “go all out” to
elect “a better Congress”—a prospect that
already has House Democrats “panicked.”
Mondale and his men were plainly edgy
too —and after a series of dismal days, the
candidate exploded. The fizzled photo op-

portunity in Green Bay was probably the last
straw; the White House announcement of
Gromyko’s pending visit, which occurred
the same day, didn’t help. In Davenport,
lowa, that night, Mondale blew up—at him-
self, and at the sloppy staff work that had
repeatedly blurred his public appearances.
He convened his brain trust —campaign
chairman James Johnson, longtime aide
Michael Berman and senior adviser John
Reilly—in Tupelo, Miss., the next night.
The result: a mini-shake-up that placed old
hand Berman in charge of day-to-day sched-

uling and campaign advance
work—and a decision to scrap
what one aide called “the cutesv
photo opportunities.” Instead,
the campaign will focus on what
Mondale does well: taking ques-
tions from small groups and ad-
dressing large rallies. “We’re go-
ing to find a group of people and
put Mondale in front of them to
say his message—period. We’re
going back to basics,” said one
participant.
Fight: Will that turn things
around? No one can say. The
nearly unanimous opinior
among Democratic strategists
outside the campaign is that
Mondale needs desperately to
take the fight to Ronald Rea-
gan—and quickly. The problem
with that, from the Mondale
staff’s point of view, is the risk of
venturing personal attacks on an
opponent who is as popular as
Reagan seems to be, and whose
personality and character are so
well defined in the public mind.
Reagan, they say, is not Gary
Hart; whatever the voters think
about the president’s policies,
they seem to like his style, and a
direct assault is likely to backfire.
Ferraro, on the other hand, must back away
from her confrontation with the Roman
Catholic Church. “You just can’t pick a
fight with the church and win,” says
one Reagan aide, savoring the spectacle.
“Every time she makes a speech, there's
another bishop willing to stand up and say
she’s wrong.”
Late last week, as he has so many times
before, Mondale seemed to bounce back. He
attacked Reagan as “the most isolated presi-
dent in American history” and criticized his
campaign “by cameo appearances and
photo opportunities.” He de-
fended Ferraro vigorously, and
aides downplayed the potential
impact of Reagan’s meeting with
Gromyko. The crowds seemed to
respond, and Mondale’s staff be-
gan to smile again. With negotia-
tions for the presidential debates
nearly complete—Reagan and
Mondale will meet twice, prob-
ably on Oct. 7 and Oct. 21—they
predicted that Mondale’s insist-
ent hammering on the deficit
would finally begin to work. In-
deed, even Reagan’s advisers
thought the race would tighten
up sooner or later. But the ques-
tion was how much, and when—
and whether Mondale had begun
his final drive too late.

Could Fritz Pull an Upset?
PHOTOS BY ROBERT R.McELROY —NEWSWEEK
Facing an uphill climb: Is a victory scenario just a flight of fancy?
Is the 1984 election all but over? Judging
from the polls, Walter Mondale is in deep
trouble. But presidential elections often
hinge on events that no one could foresee.
The following fictional scenario—based on
informed speculation and the views of
Democratic insiders—is just one way to il-
lustrate that Mondale could still pull off the
greatest political miracle since 1948:
“. . . awarded Oregon’s seven electoral
votes to Mondale, putting him over the
top in one of the narrowest and most
dramatic . . .” Cheers, popping cham-
pagne corks and flashbulbs drowned out
the three giant television screens in North
Oaks, Minn. With a neon grin, the presi-
dent-elect rushed toward John Reilly, his
closest confidant —an over-age Irish pixie
appropriately positioned at the center of
the bedlam. A triple-pump handshake and
then Mondale shouted, “You want to be
ambassador to someplace warm—with
great beaches? Or maybe I’ll just send you
back to Tupelo.”
The victor and his vicar laughed over the
inside joke. Tupelo, Miss., had really been
the low point of the campaign. Reilly re-
membered that awful night in mid-Sep-
tember, sitting in a dreary motel room
trying to plot strategy, even though they
feared —but never said—that it was all
going down the tubes. Somehow Fritz got
bet er after that —the sound-bites for TV
were snappier, the delivery was sharper
and the jokes were funnier. But, thought
Reilly ruefully, we were still mostly treat-
ing Reagan as if he were Queen Elizabeth.
It wasn’t until late September that we
damned the egos and went full speed
ahead. We canned that high-minded
theme-a-week routine and Fritz started to
show genuine passion. And we finally gave
one person total control of media. David
Sawyer was the perfect choice: nobody’s
ads could have been tougher.
Sawyer’s hearing-aid spot was a classic.
Quick shots from various press confer-
ences of Reagan, his hearing aid visible,
saying, “What?” Then the devastating
voice-over: “Hearing loss is common
among men in their mid-70s. But a presi-
dent needs to hear the voice of the people.
President Reagan—will he listen to you in
1985?” Sure, it was nasty —and a lot of the
campaign staffers thought it would back-
fire on Fritz. But it got the guys in the bars
talking about his hearing aid —and that
tied right into the whole disengaged
presidency.
Standoff: Across the Mondale living
room, the ebullient pres-
ident-elect was leading
something that looked
like a cross between a
conga line and the bunny
hop. Reilly was sprawled
on a couch, smoking an-
other cigarette and re-
viewing the campaign.
Reagan’s meeting with
Gromyko, for instance.
We just couldn’t imagine
that being a plus for
us—unless Reagan fell
asleep. But our polls de-
tected real disappoint-
ment among the voters
when the talks ended in
pretty much the same
standotf that existed before. That barely
cordial handshake at the end made it a lot
easier to argue that Reagan wasn’t making
any headway on arms control. Hard to
believe, Reilly mused, that the first de-
bate—the one we literally begged for —
turned out to be a bloody bore: Reagan
doing his nightclub act and Fritz so solemn
and serious I thought that any second he’d
start reading from one of his position pa-
pers. We labored over the debate jokes and
they all bombed.
Innuendo; The morning after, we were
12 points down in our own polls. But the
Ferraro debate saved us: that was the real
turning point. George Bush gave Gerry
an opening with that innuendo about her
finances and her husband’s business con-
nections. She turned that into an immi-
grant-pride number you wouldn’t believe.
“George, you wouldn’t understand about
discrimination,” she said, staring right
into the camera. “You don’t know what it
means to an Italian-American every time
someone makes a joke about ‘The Godfa-
ther.’ George, let me tell you something
about my family’s finances. We got our
money the old-fashioned way—we earned
it.” The campaign got a real uptick from
that in the polls, Reilly mused—and per-
haps most important, a big psychological
boost: we stopped feeling like the charge of
the damn light brigade.
Reilly wandered over toward the conga
line, collected an exuberant kiss from the
First Lady-elect, and caught a fragment of
the TV commentary: “Somber Reagan
aides blamed their narrow defeat on the
Stockman memo.” The odd thing, Reilly
thought, was that it really wasn’t Dave
Stockman’s fault. You just can’t get a
budget ready for January unless you start
putting things on paper in October—and
that all but guarantees leaks to the press.
Of course, nobody forced Reagan’s budget
director to propose huge cuts in student
loans, farm programs and Medicare. But
suddenly, we had what looked like proof of
a new Reagan “secret plan” for the coun-
Excoriating the deficits: A ‘secret plan ’for a second term?


try —and Fritz rode the fairness issue from
the cornfields to the campuses. Sawyer
came through with a tear-jerker ad about a
freckled kid slumping off the train home
from college after Reagan killed his stu-
dent loan.
In a corner of the living room, Mondale
aides Bob Beckel and Mike Berman loudly
squabbled over the second debate —each
claiming he had come up with the famous
Four Questions. Actually, Reilly snick-
ered, we stole the idea from an old Senate
confirmation hearing. Back in 1981, Wil-
liam Clark (now the interior secretary) was
up for a top State Department job and
fluffed a whole series of name-that-world-
leader questions. So we figured, why not do
the same thing to Reagan?
Comeback: The setup in the debate was
perfect: Reagan launched into one of his
predictable tirades about Marxist-Leninist
subversion in Central America. Fritz had
his comeback perfectly memorized: “Mr.
President, I wonder how much you really
know about poverty, injustice and the
death squads in Central America. In fact, I
wonder if you even know the names of the
leaders of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Hondu-
ras and Guatemala.” Well, we never found
out. Reagan spent his three minutes effu-
sively praising Jose Napoleon Duarte —
and conspicuously ignored the rest of the
question. But you could see that the Four
Questions had unnerved him, Reilly re-
membered with a smile. For the rest of the
debate, Reagan was defensive and unpresi-
dential, even stumbling over that little girl’s
letter (about God and the Grand Ole Opry)
that he used in his closing statement.
Still, Reilly recalled, we were 6 points
down on Halloween. Of course, the polls
never fully picked up what was going to be a
record black turnout in the South. We were
desperate for some dramatic way to show
that Fritz could be a leader. Funny, I’ll bet
no one ever learns about Lane Kirkland’s
real contribution to the campaign. Imagine
the president of the AFL-CIO suggesting
that Mondale denounce the GM settlement
as excessively greedy—and quietly clear-
ing the whole thing with the UAW leader-
ship. God, I wish I could have seen their
faces in the White House when they saw the
TV clips of Fritz lecturing that union rally
in Flint about “shared sacrifice” and “hav-
ing the guts to say no.”
The president-elect beckoned Reilly to
his side. The Mondale grin was still there,
but so was a new intensity. “John,” he said,
“we’ll meet tomorrow morning to start
planning the transition. We’ve got to start
getting the options papers ready.” Reilly
was half tempted to make a crack about
spending half his life in meetings in North
Oaks. Instead, he was startled to hear him-
self say, “You can count on me, Mr.
President.”
WALTER SHAPIRO
More Debate on Abortion
He called himself a Democrat and de-
nied he was engaging in partisan poli-
tics. But James Timlin, Roman Catholic
bishop of Scranton, Pa., could not have
picked a more pointed time or place to criti-
cize Geraldine Ferraro’s views on abortion.
In a press conference just after her speech in
the heart of the right-to-life movement, Tim-
lin likened Ferraro’s stand on abortion to
saying, “I’m personally opposed to slavery,
but I don’t care if the people down the street
want to own slaves.” Ferraro, Timlin said,
should “do all that she can ... to stop the
slaughter of innocent human beings.”
Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan had
sworn off mixing religion and politics, but
last week the abortion issue refused to die. It
was kept alive largely by Catholic bishops.
Archbishop John J. O’Connor of
New York accused Ferraro of er-
roneously claiming, in a 1982 let-
ter to congressional colleagues,
that Catholic views on abortion are
not monolithic. (Ferraro said she
was referring to Catholics as indi-
viduals, not to church teaching.)
Cardinal John Krol of Philadel-
phia, meanwhile, praised Ronald
Reagan for supporting tax cred-
its to parochial schools. Amid
charges that the bishops were tacit-
ly endorsing the GOP ticket, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, the Democrats’
Catholic elder statesman, declared
that “people of faith should not
evoke the power of the state to
decide what everyone can believe
or think or read or do.”
‘Sin’: Ferraro’s most thoughtful
defense came from New York’s
Catholic Gov. Mario Cuomo. In a
speech at the University of Notre
Dame that might have been
dubbed Governor to Bishops
Three, Cuomo declared that public officials
who are Catholics need not and should not
work to enact church teachings into laws.
“The price of seeking to force our beliefs on
others is that they might some day force
theirs on us,” he warned. Noting that a ban
on abortion might be “Prohibition revisit-
ed,” Cuomo said Catholics should strive
instead to set an example by their actions.
“Are we asking government to make crimi-
nal what we believe to be sinful because we
ourselves cannot stop committing the sin?”
he asked. Cuomo, who personally opposes
abortion, planned to donate his $1,500
honorarium to a Catholic home for unwed
mothers. But directors of the home rejected
the funds, saying they concurred with
O’Connor’s view that Catholics cannot in
good conscience support freedom of choice.
In Washington, however, 55 Catholic
theologians issued a statement declaring
that committed Catholics could indeed dis-
agree with church hierarchy on abortion.
They also suggested that O’Connor was in-
consistent for not seeking a similiar ban on
contraception. Meanwhile, a political-ac-
tion committee called the Christian Voice
Moral Government Fund unveiled three
anti-Ferraro TV ads featuring former Miss
America Cheryl Prewitt. In one of the spots,
Prewitt declares, “When you’rea symbol for
America, you must set an example beyond
reproach.”
While avoiding the topic themselves,
Reagan’s men were privately gleeful over
Ferraro’s troubles. But even Vice President
George Bush was dogged by questions on the
issue. Asked if he still supported abortion in
cases of rape—unlike Reagan—Bush said,
JACQUES M. CHENET— NEWSWEEK
Ferraro with O’Connor: Can good Catholics disagree?
“Personally . . . yes.” Then he refused to
answer more questions, insisting he was ex-
ercising “my rights as an American” not to.
Ferraro was also refusing comment on
abortion at the weekend. But she seemed to
have reached an uneasy detente with O’Con-
nor at an Italian-American dinner in New
York. (Cuomo demurred at the last minute,
citing a rough plane ride from Indiana.)
Ferraro joked, “I wish my governor was
here.” O’Connor professed not to have read
Cuomo’s speech. Taking the podium just
after the vice presidential hopeful, O’Con-
nor quipped, “This isn’t the first time Joan
the Baptist preceded the Messiah.” His
meaning was not immediately clear, but
some dinnergoers could not help recalling
John the Baptist’s fate and wondering if
O’Connor had the same in mind for Ferraro.

MOVIES
The Shining Stars of France
An array of actresses —beautiful and brilliant —take on tough, complicated roles.
They were among the great sex symbols
of French film. Simone Signoret was
“the ideal mistress,” Jeanne Moreau “the
slithering sensualist.” And, of course, there
was the sexiest sex symbol of them all, Bri-
gitte Bardot, who was once called “the best
undressed woman in Paris.” They were the
femmes fatales whose sensual lips, smolder-
ing bodies and romantic adventures gave
them an aura of sexual allure and sophisti-
cation that rivaled Marilyn Monroe and
Sophia Loren—and launched an entire in-
dustry. The images of sex kittens and world-
ly women, of lacy lingerie and sultry eyes,
still linger. But the sex symbols of 30 years
ago have been replaced by a new wave of
femmes fatales, actresses who are taking on
challenging, complicated and often unflat-
tering roles —and doing them well.
The new breed of French women film
stars are actresses first; that many are also
good-looking, sexy—and usually manage
to take off their clothes at least once in every
film —seems almost incidental. The latest
French stars have another quality that pro-
ducers love: bankability. Put any of the Big
Three —Isabelle Huppert, Isabelle Adjani
and Nathalie Baye—in a film and it almost
always makes money. Just behind the Big
Three is a second tier of stars: Miou-Miou,
Fanny Ardant and Sabine Azema. They are
also proven moneymakers, as are a bevy of
newcomers —strong actresses ranging from
28-year-old Arielle Dombasle to two teen-
age starlets, Sophie Marceau and Sandrine
Bonnaire. “It’s been like wine,” says Do-
minique Besnehard, a leading casting direc-
tor. “A vintage year for really beautiful,
talented women.”
The versatility of France’s leading ladies
has helped to make French film a booming
business these days. With 150 to 170 full-
length films a year, France is one of the
world’s largest film exporters, second only
to the United States in movies distributed
abroad. “Our only hope of competing
against the American giant is not by trying to
make their kind of big-budget macho film,”
says Daniel Toscan du Plantier, chief execu-
tive of France’s giant film company, Gau-
mont. “We haven’t the resources. We
survive through charm, seduction and in-
vention. These are feminine weapons.” Such
talent not only enables France to export
pictures, it helps to “export” actresses as
well. In recent years several French ac-
tresses have appeared in American pictures:
Marie-Christine Barrault in Woody Allen’s
“Stardust Memories,” Marie-France Pisier
in “The Other Side of Midnight” and Hup-
pert in “Heaven’s Gate.”
As a result French producers are increas-
ingly making films that are good vehicles for
women. In “Coup de Foudre” (“Entre
Nous” in the United States), for example,
Huppert and Miou-Miou play housewives
who develop an emotionally close and sex-
ually ambiguous friendship. In “L’Ete
Meurtrier” (“One Deadly Summer”) Adja-
ni turns the part of a sleep-around strumpet
into that of a touching, tragic heroine. Ar-
dant, a favorite of filmmaker Franqois Truf-
Baye, with Depardieu in ‘Martin Guerre':

faut, plays a comic sleuth in “Confidential-
ly Yours.” And the versatile Baye followed
her effective portrayal of a quiet 16th-
century farmer’s wife in “The Return of
Martin Guerre” with that of a tough, gum-
chewing prostitute in “La Balance,” a role
that last year won her a Cesar, France’s
Academy Award.
Puppy Love: The up-and-coming stars
have also had strong roles. Best known is
Dombasle, who followed her 1982 role as
the beautiful blonde best friend in Eric
Rohmer’s “Le Beau Mariage” with a por-
trayal of the self-dramatizing Marion in
another Rohmer film, “Pauline at the
Beach.” Younger actresses seem to get
roles about teen-age girls coming of age. In
last year’s mindless comedy “La Bourn,”
for example, Marceau, 18, has her first,
very innocent, puppy love affair, much to
her parents’ consternation. In a far more
realistic and pessimistic film directed by
Maurice Pialat, “A Nos Amours,” Bon-
naire, 17, plays an alienated teen-ager who
sleeps around hoping for the love that she
cannot find at home.
For the most part the films have done
well abroad, and none of them was made
simply to titillate. “French films are far less
interested in showing sex than they are in
telling an interesting story with complex
female characters,” says Annette Insdorf, a
professor of film at Yale and Columbia
universities. She attributes the change to the

Foudre': Good-looking, sexy—and a real pro

influence of France’s large number of wom-
en directors. “They have helped to make
women the subjects of films rather than
objects of desire,” she says.
Sex kittens have not left France entirely,
however. There are still some French ac-
tresses who were clearly cast for their bodies
and not their acting talent. In one of the
worst movies of the year, “Heat of Desire,”
former fashion model Clio Goldsmith, 27,
plays an irresistible beauty who seduces “the
first clown who comes along,” and then
spends most of the film undressing for him in
a Barcelona hotel. Last year, in an American
remakeof Jean-Luc Godard’s “Breathless,”
a gorgeous French newcomer, Valerie Ka-
prisky, 22, made her film debut by sharing a
shower with Richard Gere, an aging juven-
ile delinquent on the run. This year she had
several daring nude scenes in “La Femme
Publique”—a critical flop but a box-office
smash —making her one of the most talked-
about women in French filmdom.
It is the Big Three, however, who make
the money. Baye and Adjani each earn
about $250,000 a picture and Huppert gets
slightly less. Of the three, the most “export-
able” are Adjani and Huppert. Adjani has
been a superstar since the age of 19 when she
portrayed the obsessed daughter of Victor
Hugo in Truffaut’s “The Story of Adele H.”
At 29, Huppert is a veteran. She has made
an extraordinary 32 films, seven in one year
alone. In just the last two years she was in
such box-office successes as Diane Kurys’s
“Entre Nous,” Bertrand Tavernier’s “Coup
de Torchon” (“Clean Slate”) and Bertrand
Blier’s “My Best Friend’s Girl.” Her latest
film, “La Garce,” directed by Christine
Pascal, was the No. 3 box-office draw in
Paris last week. And she has begun work on
a new film directed by her sister Caroline.
Sadly, both actresses have been going
through rough times of late. Huppert broke
offher relationship with Gaumont’s Toscan
du Plantier. She recently went through a
mild depression, had arguments with jour-
nalists and sometimes shut herself up in
darkened rooms for days at a time. She has
now cut back on her workload, a relief to
many of her friends who believe she was
overtired. Still, she remains extremely sen-
sitive about her personal appearance. “If I
come across a photograph of myself that I
don’t like, I resent it,” she told an interview-
er. “I feel it’s a rape.”
Adjani has had different problems. Her
quirky behavior has made her the bane of
theater and movie producers alike. In 1982
she stormed out of Jean-Luc Godard’s
“First Name: Carmen” after only 10 days of
shooting, leaving the role to an unknown
Dutch actress, Maruschka Detmers, who
received strong reviews—and a promising
start as an actress in France. Then, last year,
Adjani abruptly left a Paris stage produc-
tion of August Strindberg’s “Miss Julie,”
and recently she reneged on a contract to
play the lead in a film by Polish director
Andrzej Zulawski, “L’Amour Braque.”
Such behavior is not entirel} out of charac-
ter. Ten years ago she landed the part of
Adele H. only after she angrily quit La
Comedie Franqaise. “She needs to get a grip
on herself if she wants to remain in the top
three,” says a leading agent in Paris.
Inner Strength: By almost anyone’s yard-
stick, the top actress in France today is
Baye. “She has a fantastic range, she’s
bright, she never forgets her lines and she
knows exactly what directors want on the
set,” says Philippe Labro, who recently di-
rected Baye in “Rive Droite, Rive Gauche”
(“Left Bank, Right Bank”). Daniel Vigne,
who directed “The Return of Martin
Guerre,” couldn’t agree more. “She has
such an inner strength, such a range there,”
he says. “She is an introvert who suddenly
exhibits her strength and surprises you.”
And Bob Swaim, the American director
whose film “La Balance” gave Baye inter-
national acclaim, is equally enthusiastic. “I
had her do things she basically didn’t want
to do,” he says, “like swearing, speaking
with her mouth full, looking the part with
bags under her eyes. She really fit the bill.”
Baye seems to have come to stardom
from obscurity. The notion is both incor-
rect —and a tribute to her acting skills. For
10 years she was a dutiful supporting ac-
tress, a chameleon who blended into the
background. Her road to the top has been a
long one. As a teen-ager, she did poorly in
school, perhaps because her upper-middle-
class parents were breaking up. At 15 she
turned to ballet, enrolling at a leading ballet
school in Monte Carlo, near her family’s
home in southern France. She worked five
to six hours a day, learning ballet —and also
developing some important character traits
that have helped considerably in her film
career. “I learned everything at that
school —discipline, the need to concen-
trate,” she says. “I learned never to expect
praise.” After her parents’ troubles grew
worse, she pulled up stakes and moved to
New York. There, she continued to study
ballet and worked as an au pair girl on
Manhattan’s Upper East Side. She was 17.
“She worked very hard,” said her employer,
Marian Blow. “She had a very good sense of
what she wanted to do.”
Ash Blonde: When Baye returned to Par-
is, she found that she couldn’t do what she
wanted to do. “The French don’t really love
ballet,” she says. “There aren’t many out-
lets.” Out of work, she auditioned for a
leading French acting school, the Cours
Simon, and won a scholarship. From there
she was admitted to the prestigious govern-
ment-run theater school, Conservatoire
National Superieur d’Art Dramatique.


Then she landed a contract with a talent
agency and got a walk-on part in an emi-
nently forgettable Robert Wise film with
Peter Fonda called “Two People.” “He
made me become an ash blonde,” she re-
calls. “I was a fright.”
The role had one saving grace, however;
it led to the part of the script girl who does
everything in Truffaut’s 1973 bouquet to
the film industry, “Day for Night.” On the
surface it was Baye’s big break, the first time
she got widespread attention. “She was so
good, so credible, that I thought she must be
a real-life script girl,” says director Maurice
Pialat, who immediately signed her up for
“La Geuele Ouverte.” “I really thought she
cuuld help me with details as well as act,” he
,;ow admits. But that didn’t help Baye at all.
“I didn’t get a feature-film offer for more
than 14 months,” she says. “Writers can
continue writing despite rejection slips,
painters can paint even if they can’t sell. But
D. ISSERMANN— SYGMA
all we actors can do is declaim Phaedra in
the bathroom in front of the mirror.”
It was not until 1978 that Baye began to
hit it big. She starred in a production of
Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” onstage in Paris,
then got her first starring role, in Truffaut’s
“The Green Room,” considered by many to
be the great filmmaker’s worst movie. It was
no great success at the box office either but
Baye, who played a woman who sells an-
tiques, fared well. She made two more pic-
tures that same year and at least two each
year after that.
In 1980 she won her first Cesar for best
supporting actress in Godard’s “Every Man
for Himself”; in 1981 she received a second
Cesar, this one for best actress in Tavernier’s
“A Week’s Vacation.” And then she landed
the part of the wife in “The Return of Martin
Guerre.” “Nathalie’s part was offered to
Isabelle Huppert, to Adjani and then to
Miou-Miou,” recalls France’s leading Lead-
ing Man, Gerard Depardieu, who played the
title role. “All turned it down because they
felt that since the part called for someone to
keep a secret, with a limited speaking part, it
wasn’t interesting enough. Nathalie was
smart enough to see right off the kind of
dimension the role could have.”
Gossip Columns: Despite “Guerre’s”
worldwide success, it still did not make Baye
a superstar. That came with “La Balance.”
Not only did she exhibit the extraordinary
acting talent that brought her yet another
Cesar for best actress, she exploded into the
gossip columns because of her personal life.
Her costar was Philippe Leotard, whom she
had lived with for many years. She had been
seeing actor Christopher Lambert, who
played the title role in “Greystoke: The
Legend of Tarzan.” And then she surprised
nearly everyone by moving in with French
pop singer Johnny Hallyday. Even though
she and Hallyday are not married, they have
a baby girl named Laura. “I have an in-
explicable aversion to signing papers,” Baye

The Women in Charge
Three directors, Kaplan, Akerman, Kurys:
“LaTriche,” which opened in 35 French
movie theaters last month, is about a bisex-
ual policeman who must investigate his
lover’s involvement in a murder case. “Sac
deNoeuds,” described by Warner Brothers
executive Myron Karlin as “the best script
I’ve read in the last 10 years,” is a satiric
comedy to be filmed in Paris this month.
“La Garce,” starring Isabelle Huppert as a
woman who fakes her own rape to get even
with an unwanted amoureux, could well be
a major hit this fall. The films have one
special thing in common: they were all
directed by women.
Elsewhere in the world, female film-
makers are as rare as roses in winter. There
is, of course, an occasional Lina Wert-
muller but, for the most part, women direc-
tors are a negligible minority. In France,
however, women directors have come into
their own. There are at least 20 female
directors with more than one movie to their
credit and another five will complete their
first feature-length films by the end of the
year. Their critical and box-office successes
have, at times, gone way beyond France.
Under the title “Entre Nous,” for example,
Diane Kurys’s “Coup de Foudre” has been
playing—and playing well —in New York
for more than six months. “It makes no
difference anymore whether the director is
a man or a woman,” says Daniel Toscan du
Plantier, chief executive of France’s mega-
conglomerate, Gaumont. “It’s not even a
conversation piece.”
Successes: Many of the women direct
their own scripts. Others have turned to
the business side of French moviemaking.
There are more than a score of full-time
independent female producers in Paris,
turning out films ranging from feminist
tracts to the avant-garde to commercial

In France, female filmmakers have come into their own, behind the camera and on the business side as well
successes. Irene Silberman produced
“Diva,” the top French moneymaker in
New York last year. Vera Belmont co-
produced the international hit “Quest for
Fire,” and Christine Beytout’s first film,
“L’Ete Meurtrier” (“One Deadly Sum-
mer”) won four Cesars last year, France’s
top award for film. “There’s something
very feminine about making films. It’s like
having a baby,” says producer Albina du
Boisrouvray. “There’s the gestation peri-
od, there’s the business of preparing for it,
carrying it, then the birth and the essential
care and attention in the immediate after-
birth period. It’s all very maternal. And
today’s liberated women now combine
those maternal instincts with the qualities
of authority and decision making required
in any business.”
Melodramas: It is not entirely clear how
or why French women have succeeded in
the film business while women in other
countries have not. But there are some
theories. “Women are best in films dealing
with human relations, where the emphasis
is not on macho action,” says veteran
French director Agnes Varda. “Since most
French films fall into this category, women
obviously get more of a chance to do them
than elsewhere.” There are also historical
reasons. It is now known that most of the
silent movies attributed to French film
magnate Leon Gaumont early this century
were, in fact, directed by his secretary,
Alice Guy-Blache. Prior to World War 11,
Germaine Dulac was a prominent director
of highly commercial melodramas. Before
she retired in the early 19505, Jacqueline
Audry had directed more than 30 films.
The spiritual “mothers” of most French
women directors are Varda, Marguerite
Duras and Nelly Kaplan. Originally a
novelist, Duras, 70, is best known in the
film world as the scriptwriter for “Hiroshi-
ma Mon Amour.” But her avant-garde
films of the 1950 s and 1960 s are still stud-
ied in university, museum and feminist
circles, and she continues to write highly
intellectual “plays of ideas” that explore
political and social concepts. Kaplan, 53,
came to Paris from Buenos Aires and
worked for the great filmmaker Abel
Gance. Her last film in 1981 was a full-
length documentary on her mentor. And
Varda, 56, first achieved fame in the early
19505, predating even Jean-Luc Godard as
a wunderkind of the New Wave school of
films. In the 1960 s and 1970 s she estab-
lished her reputation with movies such as
“Cleo From 5 to 7,” a look at a woman
awaiting the results of medical tests, and
“One Sings, the Other Doesn’t,” a decid-
edly proabortion tract that won praise for
its ideas but was attacked by some critics
for its shallow characterizations. Today
Varda is somewhat out of fashion and has
trouble raising money for full-length pro-
jects. “I could make solid commercial
films by the dozen,” she says. “But I’m not
going to cop out and join the system. At my
age, I’ve got to do something I want to do.”
Statements: The tradition of films with a
message is a long one. Women’s rights,
abortion, immigration, racism and homo-
sexuality are frequent themes. Christine
Gouze-Renal, sister-in-law of President
Francois Mitterrand, has produced 25
movies in 30 years, most of them with
political or social themes. “Without being
didactic, my movies make some sort of
statement on today’s society,” she says.
One reason Chantal Akerman moved from
her native Belgium to Paris was to make
didactic films. “In France movies don’t
have to make money, so it’s easier,” she
says. “You can make something that’s not
just for 15- to 18-year-olds.”
Still, Akerman is also now turning to the
commercial film. She has moved temporar-
ily to Hollywood and is working on a new
screenplay, a musical comedy about “love
and business” in a shopping mall. “I used to
make films that you would call art mov-
ies—you know, lots of slow motion and
very formalized. But in the last few years I
changed my mind and decided that I want
to make comedies. I knew I had a good
comedic sense. You can express many
things in comedy and reach the public,
too.” She is not alone; several French wom-
en directors have now begun making main-
stream commercial films as well. The most
successful so far is Kurys, now at work on
the script for her fourth film. Others in-
clude Aline Issermann, 36, whose “Juliet’s
Destiny” last year established her as some-
one to watch, and Yugoslav-born Josiane
Balasko, a former underground come-
dienne whose “Sac de Noeuds” will star
Huppert and leading French actors Jean
Carmet and Thierry Lhermitte.
Most of the successful films are still
about women, their friendships, their con-
cerns. “I don’t think that anyone will ever
ask a woman to direct a great epic like the
‘Indiana Jones’ films,” says Varda. “I am
sure a woman director could do it, but it is
unlikely that any big-time producer will
ever take that kind of risk.” Producer Tos-
can du Plantier of Gaumont sees a different
trend. “Women directors and script-
writers have begun dealing with themes
once thought to be masculine preserves,”
he says. “They no longer deal exclusively
with women’s themes.” If that trend con-
tinues it means the term “woman director”
will become obsolete. The new word will
simply be “director,” period. And France
will probably have more of them.

says. “I’m not the marrying kind.”
At 36, Baye plans a lengthy career. “I’ll
never give up the theater,” she says. “I’ve
seen too many film stars age badly. The
theater is a great place to survive once you’ve
turned 50.” There is a precedent for that
view. Many French actresses seem to go on
and on. Signoret, 63, recently starred in a
well-received dramatic series on French
television called “Therese Imbert.” Leslie
Caron, 53, who starred in “Gigi,” “Lili,”
“An American in Paris” and “The
L-Shaped Room,” recently toured the Unit-
ed States in “On Your Toes,” a musical that
required her to do two ballet numbers. Mo-
reau, best known for her role in “Jules and
Jim,” has turned to directing, most recently
a series of television documentaries on
American actresses, starting with silent-
screen star Lillian Gish. Anouk Aimee, 52,
star of “A Man and a Woman,” focuses
much of her attention nowadays on promot-
ing the fashions of her designer Emanuel
Ungaro —and working on films. Her latest,
Claude Lelouch’s “Twenty Years Later,”
will be released next year.
Of the well-known French film veterans,
only Bardot is not working at the moment.
She turns 50 this month, a prospect that has
left her apprehensive and feeling somewhat
lonely. She has turned down countless of-
fers to star in television commercials and
now confines most of her activities to a
crusade against cruelty to animals; she is
deeply involved in a campaign to stop the
killing of baby seals. Bardot lives quietly
near Saint-Tropez where she looks after a

floating population of at least 40 cats and
dogs—all strays.
Two other important—and glamorous—
French actresses conjure up a nostalgia of
their own. In recent years Stephane Audran
has played Laurence Olivier’s loyal mistress
in the British television series, “Brideshead
Revisited,” and Philippe Noiret’s unfaith-
ful wife in “Coup de Torchon.” She will
soon shoot a film in Canada and does not
like to talk about her age —51. Catherine
Deneuve, however, has been advertising

hers. She has been on American television
commercials touting the fact that she looks
pretty good for a 40-year-old. Deneuve ac-
tively promotes a line of expensive jewelry
and watches of her own design. She is also
making films. Her latest, “Fort Saganne,”
with Depardieu, Noiret and Marceau, was
one of the hottest films at the Cannes Film
Festival earlier this year.
‘No Shortcuts’: At the other end of the age
spectrum is a vast array of talent, all young,
all beautiful —all ambitious. “It’s a little
embarrassing,” Baye says. “Up-and-com-
ing actresses ask me what the most likely
path is to success. I invariably tell them there
are no shortcuts —that the public can be
fickle and even cruel and that the best way of
insuring there will be no hard knocks is to
perfect one’s craft. I’m always puzzled and
somewhat distressed by the fact most of
them don’t want to hear that kind of talk.
They want to learn how to deal with the
media in order to attract the maximum
attention.”
The newcomers have a response to Baye.
It’s an important part of the job, says
Azema, 31, whose latest film, “L’Amour a
Mort” (“Love Unto Death”), opened earli-
er this month. “It would be false to say I
don’t enjoy seeing my name in the papers,
having people talk to me, going to Cannes,”
she says. “But all of it is only to help me land
good roles.” The competition for parts is
tremendous, and one important factor that
a director still must consider is the nude
scene —a given in most French movies.
“The way films are shot these days,” says
agent Georges Beaume, “they can’t fake it.”
Fortunately for the French film industry
there seems to be no limit of ac-
tresses who are willing to play
nude scenes —or any other scene
for that matter. Talent is every-
where and new faces abound. Tee-
tering on the brink of stardom is
Isabelle Pasco, 18, whose first
film, “Ave Maria,” comes out this
autumn. She already has impor-
tant parts lined up in two other
films. Some of the new talent is
equally at home on the stage as well
as the screen. Blonde Gabrielle La-
zure, 27, who recently appeared in
Alain Robbe-Grillet’s erotic mys-
tery, “La Belle Captive,” has been
playing Scarlett O’Hara in a stage
version of “Gone With the Wind.”
“It used to be difficult to cast a
picture,” says Besnehard. “It was
always the same little group. Now
there’s almost too much choice.”
It is an enviable problem, one
that France fortunately will have
for many years. Its superstars
show no sign of stopping—and its
newcomers have every promise of
becoming international stars in
their own right. It is an enviable
problem indeed.

IDEAS
Annals of the Ordinary
View of Renaissance Venice by Luca Carlevaris: Out of bustling commerce came the rise of Europe
SCALA— ART RESOURCE, N.Y.
Braudel’s epic histories resound with everyday life.
Once upon a time, writing history
seemed simple. A scholar studied the
archives preserved in the great institutions
of the past. Armed with the appropriate
documents, he tried to reconstruct the poli-
cies of the men who ruled these institutions.
If the historian was a patriot, he might
choose to dramatize the glories of his own
nation’s past. And if he had a flair for prose,
he would delight his readers with spellbind-
ing stories, bringing a distant era to life by
recounting the foibles, feats and conquests
of a bygone time.
Contrast this traditional approach to his-
tory with Fernand Braudel’s “Civilization
and Capitalism.” Revolutionary in scope,
scale and ambition, the three-volume work,
which took 27 years to complete, is a pano-
ramic treatise on the growth of capitalism
in the preindustrial world as seen from
multiple perspectives—economics, sociolo-
gy, even geography. A “subterranean histo-
ry,” as Braudel has called his from-
the-ground-up studies, “Civilization and
Capitalism” includes abundant charts and
statistics on things like population growth,
price fluctuations and global trade. There is
speculation about the impact of long-term
economic cycles on the rise and fall of cities
like Venice and Amsterdam. But perhaps
most striking of all to the nonspecialist, the
book glories in an almost constantly divert-
ing flow of images and anecdotes illustrat-
ing the flavor, tempo and tools of everyday
life in the early modern world.
Instead of kings, queens and diplomacy,
we learn about foodstuffs and droughts.
“Traditionally,” writes Braudel in one typi-
cally puckish passage, “Sir Walter Raleigh
is supposed to have introduced the potato to
England... in 1588, the year of the Spanish
Armada. This prosaic event, it could be
argued, probably had more consequences in
the long run than the clash of the two fleets
in the English Channel.” We see Moscow’s
winter fairs on ice, held whenever the
Moskva River froze over. We watch a group
of girls hard at work making lace in 1775,
stopping only “to pick up a piece of bread or
a boiled potato sprinkled with salt.” We
observe a Portuguese colonist in Africa in
1667 suggest that nakedness be proscribed
in order to ensure a brisk trade in imported
cotton loincloths. And we discover an early
instance of planned obsolescence in the
17th-century silk trade of Lyons, where
merchants parried Italian competition by
hiring “silk illustrators” to create different
patterns every year.
Methods: A masterpiece of modern schol-
arship, “Civilization and Capitalism” be-
longs beside the great histories of Thucydi-
des and Jacob Burckhardt —and beside the
great treatises on social theory by Karl Marx
and Max Weber. It is the crowning achieve-
ment of Braudel, 82, a former president at
the prestigious Ecole Pratique des Hautes
Etudes in Paris. Arguably no one has done
more to transform the writing of history in
our century. Certainly no other work of
Braudel’s, not even his influ-
ential “The Mediterrane-
an and the Mediterranean
World in the Age of Philip
II,” matches the sweep of
this magnum opus, first pub-
lished in France in 1979
as “Civilisation materielle,
economic et capitalisme”—
and now complete at last in
a lavishly illustrated new
English translation. (“Civi-
lization and Capitalism,

The roots of Braudel’s
approach to history can be
traced to the “Annales
d’histoire economique et so-
ciale,” the influential jour-
nal founded in 1929 by
Marc Bloch and Braudel’s
mentor, Lucien Febvre. The Annales
school, as it is sometimes called, threw open
historiography to new methods, new topics,
new influences. Attempts were made to ap-
ply the latest findings of geography, psy-
chology, sociology and economics to the
study of the past. Instead of writing edify-
ing patriotic dramas, the Annales histori-
ans took the world as their province and
swept away the old conceit that Europe
supplied the heartbeat of world history.
Looking beyond the visible history of the
ruling classes, the new historians tried to
reconstruct the life of the anonymous
masses of men.
This kind of history demanded the devel-
opment of fresh new approaches to a host of
unconventional and previously ignored
documents: parish registers of births and
deaths, etymologies of key words, accounts
by travelers, the logs of ships at sea. In
attempting to date the appearance of differ-
ent dining utensils, for example, Braudel
turns to the evidence in a 16th-century art
work: “As far as I know, Jacopo Bassano
. . .painted one of the first forks to figure in a
Last Supper.”
The Annales school has had a profound
impact on a number of scholars, from the
philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel
Foucault in France to the sociologist Im-
manuel Wallerstein in America. A host of
brilliant and unconventional recent Eng-
lish-language historical works owe a large
debt to the pioneers of the Annales school:
one thinks, for example, of “Plagues and
Peoples,” William H. McNeill’s history of
the impact of different diseases on society.
Still, the willingness of historians like Brau-
del to embrace mathematical techniques of
analyzing social structure, coupled with

their readiness to jettison conventional
chronological narrative, has produced a
backlash. One critic scoffs at “the pitter-
patter of everyday life.” Another decries the
use of social-science methods as “essentially
unhistorical.” In a widely discussed recent
essay, Princeton historian Lawrence Stone,
himself deeply influenced by the “new his-
tory,” applauded what he
called “the revival of narra-
tive” and the appearance of a
“new old history” that turns
from the abstract analysis of
social structure back to the
literary evocation of indi-
viduals and their actions.
Epic: In fact, “Civiliza-
tion and Capitalism” has a
kind of narrative structure,
although that structure is
one of digressions and a
sometimes bewildering pro-
fusion of highly speculative
hypotheses. Braudel’s plot
hinges less on men and
events than on the larger
drama of the rise of Europe-
an capitalism to world pow-
er. His work amounts to an
epic odyssey through the
different “storeys” of soci-
ety. He starts with the largely unchanging
subsistence economy of the peasantry —a
brake on growth in all of the preindustrial
economies of the world. From this “worm’s-
eye view of the poor,” Braudel moves on in
volume two to the bustling world of the
marketplace, with its many peddlers, ar-
tisans and shopkeepers—one source of
change and innovation. Finally, at the sum-
mit of society, he shows how a handful of
merchants and bankers, by monopolizing
trade and maximizing profit, helped create a
series of world economies centered in Eu-
rope—and so extended the growing power
of European capitalism.
Unlike Adam Smith and Marx, Braudel
finds the archetype of capitalism neither in
the free market nor in modern industrial
production, but rather in such multinational
combines as the House of Fugger of 16th-
Bruegel’s ‘Peasant Wedding’: ‘A worm’s-eye view of the poor’
BETTMANN ARCHIVE
century Augsburg and the East India com-
panies of the 17th and 18th centuries. The
puzzle is that Europe before the Industrial
Revolution lacked the population and
wealth of the ancient civilizations —of Chi-
na, India and Islam —that it succeeded in
conquering. How, then, did Europe manage
“to devour, to digest the world”?
Less a sustained argument than an episod-
ic exploration of that riddle, “Civilization
and Capitalism” focuses on a number of
different possible explanations, from the so-
phistication of European forms of credit and
techniques of navigation to the suffocating
power of the Chinese bureaucracy. Braudel
discounts the role of religion, since Roman
Catholics as well as Protestants managed
powerful capitalist enterprises in early mod-
ern Europe. Pace Weber, he finds the essence
of the capitalist spirit not in rational cal-
culation but in bold risk-
taking. And he concludes by
stressing the overriding im-
portance of long-term eco-
nomic cycles and by ex-
pressing an almost mystical
conviction that “human his-
tory obeys all-commanding
rhythms which ordinary
logic cannot explain.”
Lawrence Stone may well
be right about the need for
renewed emphasis in his-
torical writing on the drama
of individual human action.
But Braudel’s book compels
us, above all, to appreciate
“that force of inertia which
is one of the great artisans of
history.” His special talent
surely lies in his careful ex-
cavation of the lower depths
of “a history that is slow,
mute and complicated. ” As never before, he
shows us man as a creature of routines,
blindly making “himself into their uncon-
scious prisoner, in front of his bowl of rice or
slice of bread.” It is Braudel’s great achieve-
ment as an imaginative writer that on many
pages of this marvelous masterpiece we can
almost smell the rice, taste the bread—and
so share in Braudel’s excitement at discov-
ering, beneath the flux of familiar events, a
lost continent of history.
JIM MILLER
Sailing History’s Seas
Born in 1902 in Luneville, France, in the province of Lorraine,
Fernand Braudel came naturally by his interest in the almost
changeless routines of everyday rural life. “I recall as a child
watching the wheelwright making cart wheels in a village in the
Meuse,” he once wrote. “An iron hoop, expanded to red heat,
was fitted round the wooden wheel which immediately began to
smolder: the whole thing was thrown into the village pond and as
the iron cooled with a hiss it clamped on to the wood. The entire
village turned out to watch.”
Braudel’s early career, it has been suggested, could serve as a
“history of 20th-century historiography itself.” A dissertation
begun by Braudel in 1923 as an orthodox diplomatic history of
Phillip IPs Mediterranean policy in the last half of the 16th
century became, under the influence of the great historian
Lucien Febvre, a breathtaking panorama of the Mediterranean
Sea, its mountains and coastal plains, its seasons and changing
climate, its cities and currents of trade, its empires and their
policies of state. “I navigated mentally through these fifty
years,” Braudel has recalled, “putting in to port, bartering and
trading.” A prodigious feat of erudition that Braudel complet-
ed while a prisoner of war in Germany during World War 11,
“The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age
of Philip II” has been widely hailed since its publication in
1949 as a masterpiece as well as a path-breaking example of “a
new kind of history.”
“The past always counts,” Braudel has written. “The inequal-
ity of the world is the result of structural realities at once slow to
Braudel: From the ground up
RULLAUD— COLLECTIF
take shape and slow to
fade away.” He is un-
blinking in his depiction
of injustice but no radi-
cal in his politics: “A
clear-sighted revolution,
if such a thing is possible
. . . would find it very dif-
ficult to demolish what
should be demolished,
while retaining what
should be retained: free-
dom for ordinary people,
cultural independence, a
market economy with no
loaded dice, and a little
fraternity.”

Mixing Memory and Desire
Marguerite Duras has long reigned as
the grande dame of the French
avant-garde. She is a novelist, playwright
and filmmaker who won widespread ac-
claim for her screenplay of “Hiroshima,
Mon Amour.” Duras has also won the
admiration of French intellectuals through
the decades for her haunting, experimental
writing. Samuel Beckett considers her
France’s greatest living writer; so do phi-
losopher Maurice Blanchot and leading
literary critc Gastan Picon. But for all her
renown in intellectual circles, Duras, 70,
has never enjoyed a large, popular follow-
ing. That has changed with the publication
of her 17th novel, “L’Amant,” (The
R. GIBSON
XAVIER LAMBOURS
The young Duras with her brother, the author today, on the set of ‘India Song’: ‘Grande dame’ of the French avant-garde
Lover), {Editions de Minuit, $5.20). With-
in 10 days of going on sale this month in
France, the book won rave reviews and hit
the best-seller list. “It’s the Picasso phe-
nomenon,” says Jerome Lindon, Duras’s
publisher. “The public is gradually catch-
ing up with Duras.”
Duras believes that “there can be no
great books unless their authors deal with
self,” and in her new novel she has done
just that. A deceptively simple book, “L’A-
mant” is an autobiographical account of
Duras’s first love affair at 15—and its
lingering impact. The time is 1930, the
setting is French Indochina. The affair
seems doomed from the start. The lovers
are separated by age (he is 35), by class (he
is from a wealthy family, she is poor) and
by race (he is Chinese, she is French). The
result is a confusion of passion, venality
and violence that ends abruptly when the
lover’s father sends his son to Paris.
“L’Amant” serves as a lyrical coda to the
dominant themes of Duras’s earlier works.
As in “Hiroshima,” and two other films,
“Moderato Cantabile” (based on her 1958
novel) and “India Song,” this new book
focuses on the fabric of human relation-
ships, skillfully intermingling past and pre-
sent. As the mature Duras examines the
adolescent Duras, memory and analytic
narrative subtly harmonize. The prose has a
detached quality, more like that of a scien-
tist describing a failed laboratory experi-
ment than of a grandmother narrating a
tour through an old scrapbook.
But it is clear that for Duras, the impres-
sions of the volatile adolescent love affair
still remain vivid —as they evidently did for
her Chinese lover. Decades after the affair,
as Duras writes in “L’Amant,” he phoned
to say he thought of her constantly and
“would love [me] until he died.”
The years since that youthful liaison have
been colored by personal and political dis-
appointments. Duras’s marriage to a little-
known French writer named Robert An-
thelme produced a son and then ended in
divorce. Like many French intellectuals of
her generation, Duras joined the French
Communist Party, only to be expelled for
bohemianism and antiparty behavior. “In
1945 one joined because the Communist
Party seemed to be the only party worth
joining,” she says. “It appealed to one’s
romantic idealism. But we should have
known better. The 1933 Moscow trials
should have warned us.”
Duras now supports the Socialist left —
French President Frangois Mitterrand is
one of her closest friends and greatest ad-
mirers—and she is outspoken in her criti-
cism of the communists. “Communism,”
she says, “acts as a magnet for all those who,
for various reasons, hate themselves and
feel dissatisfied with their own lives.”
Duras knows well about dissatisfac-
tion —and self-destruction. For several
decades she fought a losing battle against
alcoholism. She gave up drinking in 1964,
only to resume the habit 10 years later.
Two years ago she lay close to death with
cirrhosis of the liver. She checked into the
American Hospital in Paris for a “cold
turkey” treatment and spent the next three
weeks hallucinating, crying and trembling
with the D.T.’s. “If it had gone on much
longer, I would have killed myself,”
she says. “I felt I would never be able to
write again.” Not long after her cure she
began work on “L’Amant,” completing
the book in less than four months’ time.
Today, Duras divides her time between
a sea-front apartment in the northwest of
France, a rural cottage and a small dwell-
ing on the Left Bank in Paris that she has
rented for the last 40 years. Her live-in
companion is Yann Andrea, a 30-year-old
writer who last year published an
account of Duras’s struggle with alcohol-
ism. The book shocked the many of Dur-
as’s friends who had never known she had
a drinking problem.
Her triumph over alcohol addiction and
the enthusiastic reception of her new book
excite Duras. She is greatly pleased that
“L’Amant” has expanded her audience.
Her new readers will undoubtedly want to
hear more from her, and there seems to be
little doubt that they will. “L’Amant was
probably the easiest book I’ve ever writ-
ten,” Duras says. “I have lots more to say.
I’m not through with anything yet.”

BOOKS
Lovers and Other Strangers
Foreign Affairs. By Alison Lurie. 291
pages. Randon House. $15.95.
Alison Lurie’s wit is robust enough to
give the so-called academic novel a good
name. The two principal characters in
“Foreign Affairs” teach in the same Eng-
lish department, and both come to London
on sabbatical. Vinnie Miner is “fifty-four
years old, small, plain, and unmarried —
the sort of person that no one ever no-
tices.” But Lurie notices that she is a
pilferer and a disadvantaged, highly sexual
being. Vinnie is a great character, whom
one at once likes. Her junior colleague
Fred Turner is “classically sculptured,
over-finished, like the men in Charles
Dana Gibson’s drawings. If he had lived
before World War 11, he might have been
more grateful for his looks; but since then
it has not been fashionable for Anglo-
Saxon men to be handsome in this style
unless they are homosexual,” which Fred
decidely is not.
These two fall incongruously in love:
Vinnie with Chuck Mumpson, a salt-of-
the-earth sanitation engineer from Tulsa,
Oklahoma, who first strikes her as “a
hopeless nincompoop.” Fred becomes in-
volved with an aristocratic British televi-
sion actress, Rosemary Radley, eight years
(maybe more) his senior. Lurie traces these
dual and equally insuitable love affairs in
alternating chapters; throughout her nov-
el, Henry James looms in the background.
A BBC serial of a James novel is turned on
in one scene and recurs to Fred when he’s
invited to a house party that James might
have relished. This is a wonderful comic
idea. The Jamesian expatriates who once
had the money to trip through British
society have become academics, on lim-
ited budgets, whose heads are stuffed with
literary notions of England as The Great
Good Place.
Peremptory Maimer: “Foreign Affairs”
is good enough to argue with. One of the
pleasures of Lurie’s fictions is her habit of
commenting tartly on her story in Jane
Austen’s peremptory manner. But some of
her asides on the love affair of Vinnie and
Chuck have the schoolmarmy click of a
pointer tapping on a blackboard: “The
media convention is that people like Chuck
and Vinnie—especially Vinnie —don’t en-
joy sex very much or experience it very
often ... In books, plays, films, advertise-
ments, only the young and beautiful are
portrayed as making love. That the rela-
tively old and plain do so too, often with
passion, is a well-kept secret.” Isn’t that
just a little preachy?
Another objection: at the climax of Fred
and Rosemary’s love affair, Lurie explodes
a plot contraption that has been so elabo-
rately prepared that while one may ap-
plaud its cunning one never does wholly
believe in it. It involves a charwoman
named Mrs. Harris, a boldly Dickensian
clue. I confess that I was had. I was so busy
spotting schoolday Eng. Lit. references in
the higher realm of Henry James that I was
suddenly hit in the back of the knees when
Lurie snuck up and pulled a piece of
Agatha Christie humbuggery. High and
low, this is a very literary comedy.
But it’s an ingenious book and, surpris-
ingly for Lurie, a touching one. She has not
been famous for mercy. I liked “The War
Lurie: Falling in love on sabbatical
THOMAS VICTOR
Between the Tates” for its fury, which won
her Gore Vidal’s accolade as “the Queen
Herod of modern fiction.” Here she does a
magnificent number on an awful baby as
terrible as the monstrous teen-age children
of the Tates. But acidulous, snobby Vinnie
Miner is granted a moving acknowledg-
ment of love. Vinnie is an entirely success-
ful creation and Lurie’s portrait of Chuck
is almost as good. Rosemary is an unstable
compound. A plain woman’s (Lurie’s)
meditation on the problems of beauty, she
has a stinging scene with Vinnie. “You
think a lot of men want to sleep with me,”
says Rosemary. “Men don’t want to sleep
with me, they want to have slept with me.”
While I don’t quite accept what Lurie
finally does with Rosemary, I still keep
thinking about her. I’ll be surprised
if another novel this year amuses and
bothers me so.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Bringing Satellite Navigation Down to Earth
Modern-day navigators, like their predecessors, are look-
ing to the heavens to chart their course. Their tools are as
exotic as astrolabes and sextants once were, and the new
instruments could alter navigation just as radically as those
early star-seeking devices did. By 1990 many private and
commercial ships, planes and land-based vehicles may be
guided by computerized navigation systems that use radio
waves beamed from ground stations or globe-circling satellites.
The military has used satellite navigation systems for several
years, and some shipping firms and airlines rely on satellite
signals to position their craft. But high costs have kept land-
based vehicles from using such lofty technology. Recently,
however, several automobile manufacturers have developed
microcomputer-operated navigation systems that receive ra-
dio signals directly and use them to chart a vehicle’s path on a
video display screen. Similar navigation systems using two-
way radios are being developed to dispatch and monitor fleets
of trucks, taxis, armored cars and ambulances.
Many current navigation systems rely on Loran, a world-
wide radio-transmission system developed during World War
11. But Loran’s terrestrial coverage has many gaps, and its
accuracy declines at sunset. Future systems will most likely
depend on Navstar, a global network of 18 satellites run by the
U.S. military. Navstar is expected to be fully operational by
1988, though Washington may charge for the service. But
Navstar could face stiff private competition. Geostar, Inc., of
Princeton, N.J., plans to launch three geostationary satellites
by 1987 that can track locations of planes and vehicles in the
United States. Geostar’s satellites will relay information about
a vehicle’s location to a central computer network. That data
can then be sent on demand to simple receiver-transmitters in
vehicles, which will display information on small video screens.
Computerized Maps for Space-Age Cars
Even a limousine would be cluttered if it had to cart around
more than 10,000 maps, and the most diligent driver-navigator
would be hard put to pinpoint a car’s location down to 300
yards. But soon those capabilities may be available to any
automobile buyer as a result of a space-age navigation system
that uses computerized maps and radio transmissions from
satellites to pinpoint the exact location of a vehicle. Already,
most major car manufacturers are considering satellite-based
navigation. The three principal American automobile manu-
facturers —General Motors, Ford and Chrysler—as well as
Japan’s Mazda and Nissan have developed prototypes.
The most obvious advantage of the futuristic navigation
systems is that they make it nearly impossible for a driver to
get lost. The systems also give the driver instant access to a
computerized equivalent of a massive road atlas. Depending
on how the systems are programmed, they can deliver the
sort of guidebook information that a vacationer would find
helpful. In addition, the computers can help drivers plan trips
by showing the best route to a particular destination.
The navigation systems consist
of a receiver for satellite radio
transmissions, a cathode-ray-tube
(CRT) display screen and a com-
puter that acts as an interface be-
tween the two. Road maps are
stored on either a laser videodisc or
a videotape cartridge, and the driv-
er can call up the appropriate map
on the display screen by touching a
button. The receiver pulls in radio
signals from three satellites, which
thecomputer then uses to calculate
the vehicle’s location on the map.
For now, the major stumbling
block to full-scale production of
satellite-guided cars is the price,
which is prohibitive. Ground-
based receivers can cost as much as
$lOO,OOO, though that figure
should drop quickly once they go
into mass production. In addition, an inexpensive CRT screen
suitable for cars still needs to be developed. Despite those
obstacles, however, most firms seem confident that the bugs will
be ironed out and that a $5OO car-navigation system could be
available by the mid-19905. By then, it is possible that no
motorist will ever have to ask directions —or tackle a clumsy
paper road map—again.
Tracking Trucks With High-Tech Signals
Trucks stand to gain more from satellite-based navigation
systems than any other vehicle. Trucking fleets now often have
on-board microprocessors that monitor dozens of functions;
future systems may even chide erratic drivers or warn them of
impending collisions. Once such microprocessors are in place,
adding navigation technology is easier, and the benefits are
considerable. By knowing exactly where their vehicles are at all
times, truck dispatchers can plan shorter routes and supervise
errant drivers. They can even detect stolen vehicles and stop
them by cutting olf their fuel supply by remote control.
One major electronics firm with close ties to the U.S. space
Steering by satellite: Lofty technology
and defense industries, TRW of
Cleveland, Ohio, is currently de-
veloping prototypes of low-cost
satellite receivers for trucks.
Drivers equipped with a TRW
system will be able to trace their
routes on maps projected on a
CRT screen. Coded signals de-
scribing the vehicle’s path can be
sent via transmitter to dispatch-
ers. Eventually drivers may be
able to relay advisory or distress
messages to dispatchers on the
transmitter as well. Cost is still a
major barrier, but TRW expects
that by 1990 a large percentage of
long-distance trucks will be nego-
tiating their routes by satellite.

SUPER RESPONSIVE


FACT TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
“Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity* but all of mouth-
watering configuration." The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning." The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact
SR engines
feature fuel
efficiency in-
novations, ad-
vanced elec-
tronics, new
mechanisms,
and sophisti -
cated engine
analysis tech-
niques.
Special
aser holography of the engine block
led to huge weight cuts. New materials cut
V
va
friction and reduced inertia. With design innova-
tions such as pent roof combustion chambers and
swirl control
valves.
In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!

Literature no longer taken for granted
FOR THOSE who support the
policies of Australia’s arts es-
tablishment in general and of
the Literature Board in par-
ticular, some disconcerting
news comes from the United
Kingdom: Britain has axed
grants to authors. The govern-
ment has stopped giving
money to writers of fiction,
non-fiction and poetry.
This to the writing lobby
apocalyptic decision comes
after years of bitter debate on
the efficacy of subsidies to
writers.
It is a debate, however,
which in Australia has had the
opposite result.
Since the Whitlam govern-
ment founded the Literature
Board in 1973, something
around $lO million has been
handed out to hundreds of
Australian writers in various
types of grants.
In the first year, $861,000
was allocated to direct grants
to authors. By 1982-83, under
the Fraser regime, the sum
had risen to $1,051,000. Last
year, following the return to
government of Labor, it went
up to $1,408,000 and board
chairman Tom Shapcott (who
rightly points out that, in real
terms, the value of authors’
grants has declined since
1973) wants to see that figure
increased.
Why has the UK adopted
the contrary philosophy?
The short answer is that the
British grants authority the
Arts Council, through its sub-
sidiary Literature Panel has
come down on the side of the
argument that such grants are
neither the best nor the most
cost-effective way of promo-
ting literature. It has thus re-
jected the argument for grants
to which successive Austra-
lian regimes have cleaved in
essence, that people relieved
of the necessity to earn a liv-
ing might be free to write
good books or poems.
The British decision is in
some ways political. It has
been taken by an Arts Council
whose chairman and chief
executive are Tory ap-
pointees. And it has been
taken in a climate in which
disbursement of government
funds for good social pur-
poses is in retreat.
Yet, it would be incorrect
to allege that the decision is
purely political. The people
involved in taking it are not
Friedmanites. Rather, the
nub of the decision has been
final rejection of the idea that
government through its arts
quangos has an other than
philanthropic role in the
world of book publishing.
The decision to end all
grants goes back to a report
commissioned by the Arts
Council in 1978. Sociologist
Jim McGuigan was asked to
review grants made to British
writers between 1964 and
1977 to find out if “directly
grant-giving (sic) individual
writers is a fruitful form of
subsidy of literature.” (The re-
view was ordered after some
trenchant attacks on the sys-
tem from, among others, the
Times Literary Supplement
which alleged that grants
swelled “the pack of dunces,
charlatans and scroungers
that swarm over all literary
horizons.” And the sup-
plement added: “It is not the
supply of literature that needs
stimulation, only the de-
mand.”)
The McGuigan report,
while criticising the grants
system as “closed and inequi-
table,” favored its retention
and reform. The Literature
Panel, however, decided in-
stead to cut the number of
grants to five a year a de-
cision greeted by writers’
groups as “monstrous.” Lit-
erature department director,
Australian Charles Osborne,
responded by claiming that
the authors’ case seemed to be
that the panel had a duty to
prop up as many writers as
possible “good, bad or in-
different.”
Caught on hop
A NEW book of anecdotes re-
calls Noel Coward’s response
when a Sydney radio reporter
poked a microphone in his
face during an airport inter-
view and asked him: “Mr
Coward, can you say anything
for Australia?” The Master
obligingly replied: “Kanga-
roo.”
Motives put
to the sword
The Age, September 8
ANIMAL libbers are used to
being attacked. But even their
opponents would be surprised
by the latest criticism of ani-
mal liberation that it is anti-
God.
The attack comes in a col-
umn called Sword Thrust,
published in the fundamental-
ist (and Ulster loyalist) Aus-
tralian Beacon.
The columnist hits at state-
ments from animal libbers
that they are concerned about
moral issues. “What morals
does an animal have?” the
columnist asks. “This move-
ment would place animals on
the same level as human kind
which totally disregards the
teaching of holy scripture .. .
“These people who be-
come involved in the saving
of animals and the saving of
Earth are often the same
people who favor abortion,
homosexuality and every
other gross sin that can be
imagined. All these move-
ments must be labelled for
what they are humanistic
and anti-God. For that
reason, Christians ought to
give them a wide berth.”
The columnist also rants
about some bumper stickers
he/she has seen. One of the
stickers supported peace.


The realities of
Operation
Job Hunt
THE federal government has
found the perfect way to boost
Commonwealth Employment
Service job figures without
necessarily increasing the
amount of work available. It
is called Operation Job Hunt.
The next stage of the “op-
eration” will be launched in
Sydney’s western suburbs
next month. Its aim is to gen-
erate 5000 jobs.
Job Hunts have been
launched previously in the
Manly, Sutherland and north-
ern regions of Sydney with the
result that CES job vacancy
figures for the target month in
each region have almost
doubled.
Bulletin sources, however,
have been informed that the
only useful result likely to
come from the western

Dangling
the carat
IN THE highly competitive
world of public relations, it
must be becoming in-
creasingly difficult to attract
blase journos to attend the
many media functions for
product launchings and other
occasions.
For a long time, the more
successful lure has been
luncheon at one of the better
restaurants in whichever city
the launch occurs some-
times several. Obviously,
even the attraction of haute
cuisine is starting to wane and
the additional titbit to keep
numbers up is the good old
“lucky door prize.”
Recent contenders in the
PR giveaway stakes have in-
cluded Canon with a lucky
draw for some portable elec-
tronic typewriters, Kuoni
Travel with a trip to Vanuatu
and De Beers with a one-
carat diamond.
Putting it
succinctly
PERTH’S brand-new and
ultra-swish Merlin Hotel has
an uncanny feature: a sim-
ulated male voice in the lifts
announces the floors in sepul-
chral tones.
Last week, as a public rela-
tions lady was showing the
hotel off to a group of West
Australian editors, the lift
suddenly took it into its com-
puter to go down instead of
up and propped just above the
sixth level. While those inside
looked uncertainly at one an-
other, the voice did not help
by intoning: “We have a small
problem.”
The lift dropped to the
floor, the door opened and the
white-faced PR lady led the
exodus.

Last Week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
LOOK at the illustration the
game has one more roll to go;
White to roll doubles is it a take
or not? It’s not sufficient to play
hunches when there are clear-cut
logical and mathematically sound
solutions.
If White bears-off both men
with this roll, he’s won; if he
misses, he’s lost. What are the re-
spective chances? To bear-off,
White must roll either a 5 or 6,
double 4s, 3s or 2s. He has 23 good
rolls and 13 bad ones his
chances of winning, therefore, are
exactly 23:13 in favor.
We know that White is almost
2:1 on to win, so it’s obvious he
should double the stakes. Black is
in the unfortunate position of be-
ing offered even money for what
in effect is almost a 2:1 shot.
Should he accfept? “Of course
not,” you might say, “he’s a 2:1
against shot.”
But Black has no chance at all
of winning if he rejects the offer.
Suppose, in 36 games when
this situation arose, Black always
dropped. If the stakes were $1 a
point, Black would loose $36. As-
sume now that he accepted every
time. It’s logical to state that he
would lose 23 of the games and
win 13 of them. At $2 per game
(after the double), his net loss
would be $46 $26 = $2O. So he
saves $l6 by accepting each time.
Black knows he should lose
most of the time but cuts his losses
by accepting the double. The vital
question is: Where is the cut-off
point? You accept a double when
you’re up to a 3:1 against shot;
more than 3:1 against, reject.

Opening lead queen of
hearts.
WEBSTER defines a coup as a
sudden, successful move or ac-
tion; a brilliant stroke; a clever
strategem. It is therefore not
suprising that a bridge play that
satisfies this definition is called a
coup. There are many different
types of coups but the hand with
which we are dealing here features
what is called a trump coup.
Let’s say South gets to seven
spades, as shown, and West leads
the heart queen. Declarer sees im-
mediately that his only concern is
whether he will lose a trump trick.
He begins by winning the heart
with dummy’s king and leading a
spade to the ace. If both defenders
follow low, South plans to con-
tinue with the king because that is
the normal percentage play. But,
when West fails to follow on the
first round of spades, it appears
that declarer must ultimately lose
a trump trick and go down one.
But our hero, South, is familiar
with trump coups and realises he
must reduce his trump length to
equal East’s trump length in order
to try to bring home the grand
slam. Accordingly, he leads a low
diamond to the 10, finesses the
jack of trumps, then ruffs a low
heart. Next comes the jack of dia-
monds to the queen and another
heart ruff, followed by the king of
diamonds to the ace.
Now, at trick nine, declarer
ruffs dummy’s ace of hearts, re-
ducing his trump holding to the
K-10 while East still has the Q-8.
South then cashes the club ace and
overtakes the club queen with the
king.
Declarer’s mission is now ac-
complished because, when he
leads the six of clubs from dummy
at trick 12, East’s Q-8 of trumps
succumb to the K-10. The trump-
reducing process works like a
charm.
