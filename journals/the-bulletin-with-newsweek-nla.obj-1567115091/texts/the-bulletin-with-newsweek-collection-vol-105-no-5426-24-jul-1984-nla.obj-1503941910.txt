At BMW, the search for ultimate
quality is never ending.
For example, several times a day
a satellite in outer space links a precision
computer in Rochester, USA, to
computerised machine tools in the BMW
factory. The single aim being, to achieve
absolute precision in the machining
of parts for engines, transmissions and
final drive assemblies.
In a few minutes, over the satellite
link, we can discover the exact profile
corrections needed fora set of gears
so that it matches our quality requirements
exactly.
The BMWS2Oi is a product of this
multi-million dollar investment. No other
car in its class is built to the same exacting
standards.
The engine combines all the power
and turbine-like smoothness of BMW’s
superior six-cylinder inline concept with
the economy of a 2-litre power plant.
It is, in fact, one of the very few 2-litre six-
cylinder engines in the world.
The L-Jetronic engine of the 520 i
incorporates an energy saving fuel cut-off.
The fuel supply is stopped when you lift off
the accelerator at over 1200 rpm. So now
you could travel at lOOkmh without using
a drop of petrol. An accurate fuel
consumption meter shows how much
fuel, in Itr/lOOkm, the car is currently
using.
Now the 520 i is available with a
revolutionary four-speed automatic
transmission. It achieves the economy
you would only expect from a 5-speed
manual gearbox.
The overdrive gear actually reduces
engine revolutions and so the amount of
fuel needed. In fact, a 17% improvement
over the previous automatic transmission
The 520 i. A bombination of
outstanding engineering and meticulous
attention to detail to bring you the
ultimate in performance, economy
and safety.

We’ve made a detailed study
of business travel, and what we
learned amounts to this: attention
to details not only offers you the
comforts of home, but also the
confidence of home ground.
And when you’re not batting on
familiar territory, it’s too easy to
feel somewhat disadvantaged.
So the advantages of staying at
The Regent should never be taken
at face value.
The imported soaps, fresh
orchids, and the luxurious robes;
three telephones in every room;
the business desk; staff who smile
sincerely and know your name
when you call.
All that attention to small
details is carefully designed to do
more than make you feel at home.
It’s been designed to give you
home-ground confidence when
you are a long way from home.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Premier position
The Bulletin, by its incorporation of
Newsweek, has taken a spectacular step
which can only enhance its reputation
as Australia’s pre-eminent news maga-
zine.
While I don’t always agree with the
political viewpoint expressed in your
magazine, I believe that in recent years
The Bulletin has developed a deserved
reputation for its reportage.
It has proved the journalistic adage
that you don’t have to be dull and self-
important to be regarded seriously.
It has been an important step in
achieving maturity that The Bulletin has
moved from promoting only right-wing
causes to providing generally well-re-
searched articles of interest to a wide
spectrum of readers.
I congratulate you for that achieve-
ment.
BRIAN BURKE
Premier
Perth WA
Congratulations
I contemplated the publication of the
latest Bulletin with some trepidation.
However, having read the results of the
magazine “marriage,” I can say, quite
freely: “Well done.”
I have no hesitation in paying a little
more for a further year’s subscription.
The standard of color photography is
particularly high.
Keep up the good work.
MAX A. HERRON
Norwood SA
Reid and Farmer
I am writing to congratulate you on the
very high standard of articles appearing
in the first combined issue (July 10).
Before I read the satirical sketch
headed “Hawke faces strong left jabs at
a bruising conference,” I was firmly
convinced that good old Aussie political
bush-humor had perished with the de-
mise of Smith's Weekly. Here’s hoping
that you have had the foresight to put
the comedy duo of Reid and Farmer
under iron-clad contract.
For all his faults, Prime Minister Bob
is smart enough to know a good thing
when he reads it, and with these two
humorists on staff to write the gags for
his election speeches, both Hawke and
Labor would bolt in!

Subscription enhanced
Having been a subscriber to The Bul-
letin since Pierpont was a schoolboy, I
feel that the Newsweek addition can
only enhance the publication.
My only regret is that I used to enjoy
reading my daughter’s Newsweek for a
one-page feature, “New Products and
Processes.” Is there any chance we
could get it included in our new
Newsweek section?
JAMES HEMS LEY

PS: Loved Pierpont’s Mining right.
Keep up the good work!!
Dr Hemsley will be pleased to note
New Products and Processes was inclu-
ded in our second issue of Newsweek

Fair exchange
I have been a regular subscriber to
Newsweek for a decade and an irregular
purchaser of The Bulletin for several
years. I therefore found the combined

SIEMENS
How today’s discoveries
become tomorrow’s
way of life
Solving tomorrow’s problems today
and discovering new and better
ways of doing things are all very
much part of Siemens business. So
much so that in worldwide research
and development Siemens spends
$1.6 billion annually. That is
$6 million each working day.
Around the world we employ
30,000 people in research and
development. More than half our
turnover is derived from products
developed during the past five years
making us a very forward-thinking
company.
In Australia, Siemens Ltd. maintains
two separate development groups;
one of which is involved with
communications equipment for
Telecom Australia and private users,
while the other group specialises in
industrial electrical equipment.
Our activities involve development
of new products as well as
adaptation of German equipment
for Australian conditions. Our
objective is to offer customers
proven products and systems
adapted to their needs which
correspond to the state-of-the-art.

The innovativeness of Siemens
R&D engineers will lead to new

us to serve our customers even
better, today and tomorrow, in
Australia and around the world.
That’s what makes Siemens
research and development
investment so important. It’s what
the world has come to expect from
a leader in R&D.
Siemens is one of the world’s
leading companies active in all
fields of electrical engineering and
electronics. The company employs
over 313,000 people in 123 countries
and achieved sales of around
$2O billion in 1983.

magazine I received today an excellent
combination.
There are two deficiencies, though.
The Letters to the Editor section of
the Newsweek section has been omitted.
Although the letters section has been re-
tained in The Bulletin, I find it very in-
teresting to read what people in other
countries think about world issues.
One of the most interesting regular
features in Newsweek was an advertise-
ment by The Chartered Bank showing
the foreign exchange rates. This is also
lacking from the combined volume.
Possibly an Australian bank would be
interested in taking up this idea and giv-
ing quotes on a wide variety of
currencies against the Australian dollar.
WA R WICK J. CA R TER
Jamboree Heights Qld
(Thanks for the suggestions. We took a
small poll of Newsweek readers before
the merger to guide us in determining
which Newsweek features should be in-
cluded and omitted. We welcome re-
sponse from readers telling us whether we
are on the right track or not, although
obviously we are not going to be able to
satisfy everyone completely. Of course,
both The Bulletin and Newsweek want
to retain the Newsweek features which
are of most interest to Australian readers.
- Ed.)
Big Sister watching
Katharine West (B, July 3) was absol-
utely right in identifying the swelling
ranks of Australian “have-nots” as com-
prised of middle-class parents “strug-
gling to rear dependent children with
inadequate income and inadequate
family tax concessions.”
Unfortunately, it is the stay-at-home
wife and her breadwinning husband
who are most savagely discriminated
against both socially and economi-
cally by recent legislation.
Since there will be fewer jobs avail-
able in the future, the feminist push to
herd more and more women into the
workforce can only exacerbate this
problem because this will obviously
take jobs from such men.
One way to free Australian mothers
from the necessity to make ends meet by
seeking paid employment would be to
increase the spouse rebate dramatically
and to allow husband and wife to “tax
share” (that is, to file separate returns
spreading income and deductions over
both for the least taxable income on
each).
Members of a family business do this
already.
Katharine West is also correct in per-
ceiving that the “new radicals in Austra-
lian politics will cross party lines” to
“Look! This is who you’ve been confusing me with!”
challenge the alleged consensus of the
Hawke government.
The concept of consensus, as writers
such as Alvin Toffler have noted, is
doomed as a politically viable mechan-
ism simply because we have become
as a nation such a complexity of min-
ority pressure groups that no politician
can truthfully claim to represent a ma-
jority on any issue. “Popularity” is a
poor substitute for this.
The danger is that powerful minority
groups can and will exert sufficient
pressure to have legislation enacted
which could be detrimental to national
social and economic interests. The pass-
ing of Big Sister’s Sex Discrimination
Act 1984 is a glaring example of this
danger.
Orwell had the year right but got the
sex wrong!
Probably the only way to get true
democracy in government is by con-
tinuous national referenda. We now
have the technology but politicians will
continue to resist this vehemently, for
obvious reasons.
CLIFFORD F. BOYD
Lockleys SA
Disturbing trend
I declare Pierpont not guilty of “inflam-
matory racism.” I also declare P. J.
O’Shane (B, July 10) guilty of having no
sense of humor for picking on poor old
Pierpont for his poking fun at the
Sacred Sites industry.
Nothing should be sacred for the sat-
irist not sites, not race, nothing. Any-
way, a little levity can be a healthy ad-
dition to an argument, for those whose
minds are open enough to enjoy it.
Laughter is a great moderator.
One would have to be acutely para-
noid about race to believe that the
Mining Right degraded the Aboriginal
people in any way.
It has got to the stage recently that
even mentioning race is taboo. What sex
was to the Victorian era, race is to ours.
The reaction to Professor Blarney’s re-
marks on immigration was quite ridicu-
lous but it is evidence of a disturbing
new political trend.
This trend is one of guilt by associa-
tion, toward a new McCarthyist era
with racism replacing communism. Fic-
tion is again forcing out fact in the
witch-hunt.
In Melbourne recently, a lecture by
Sir Robert Muldoon was interrupted by
anti-racist protestors because he al-
lowed the Springbok rugby team to tour
NZ, which apparently makes him a sup-
porter of apartheid.
A few weeks ago, the Victorian Lib-
eral Party was the centre of a political
storm because one of its members spoke
at a meeting also attended by a repre-
sentative of the racist League of Rights.

It is high time the word “racist” was
used a lot more carefully, instead of just
thrown at anyone who even un-
intentionally questions the views of an
ethnic group or happens to be seen with
a known racist.
In all too many cases the word is em-
ployed just to confuse an issue, to dis-
tract attention from the really important
points like the social effects of increased
immigration and the legal, economic
and political consequences of large-
scale granting of land rights.

Doleful jocularity
At a recent press conference, Sir Robert
Muldoon seemed to be quite pleased
that New Zealand’s unemployment
compared to Australia’s was quite low.
He even managed to be jocular by say-
ing that NZ had no intention of catch-
ing up. Quite hilarious.
I suggest that Mr Muldoon, on his re-
election, should give amnesty to all
Enzeders in exile on Australian beaches
and in dole offices so that they can re-
turn home. The result would be a rever-
sal in the unemployment trend and stop

Moved to dissent
To Mr Terrey Shaw’s assertion (B,
Chess, July 10) that “On der Hans be
Gezitten” is an old German expression
meaning (roughly) “Don’t make the first
move you think of,” one can only reply
with a current German expression,
“Mist,” meaning (roughly) “bullshit.”
Mr Shaw’s expression may well be old
but German it aint.

Signs of mythology
There is scarcely a newspaper or maga-
zine which does not feature a column or
a page with a title such as “Your life by
the stars.” No doubt there is an enor-
mous reading public or it would not ap-
pear. One wonders how many people
really believe that stars can control their
lives? The famous 12 are, of course,
Aries, Aquarius, Cancer, Capricorn,
Gemini, Leo, Libra, Pisces, Sagittarius,
Scorpio, Taurus, Virgo.
I suppose I would be sticking my
neck out if I claimed that the whole
business is a colossal myth. But, after
much research, I have come to this con-
clusion for the following reasons:
1. None is within our solar system (vide
Reader’s Digest World Atlas);
2. None is a “star” within the meaning
of that word but all are groups of stars
or constellations ( Webster’s Dictionary );
3. Each group is millions of kilometres
away in outer space, with a vast vacuum
between them and Earth;
4. No astronomer or scientist has come
up with any theory but that they are
“dead” worlds;
5. It is claimed that certain stars have an
effect on the life and activity of human
beings born within a certain period of
time. As my birthday occurs in April, I
am under the influence (?) of Aries
which bears sway between March 21
and April 20. One wonders what hap-
pens to Aries before and after that
period? Does it veer off out of range, go
to sleep, take a long vacation? The fir-
mament was formed millions of years
before Man was thought of, or the cal-
endar, as we know it, was evolved;
6. None is classified as the largest planet
in the heavenly spheres;
7. Allied with this subject, is the zodiac.
This is described in Webster’s Dictionary
as “an imaginary belt in the heavens;

Land rights impact
Pat O’Shane’s vehement attack on
Pierpont’s Mining Right (B, June 19)
goes a long way toward confirming the
view that bureaucrats in Sydney/ Can-
berra know as much about the impact of
current land rights legislation on mining
and exploration activities, as the cap-
tain and officers of the Titanic knew
about icebergs.
The bitter tone of her reply, written
in truly “articulate bullying” style, sure-
ly results from a reluctant recognition of
the fundamental flaws within this legis-
lation as satirised by Pierpont and a
desire to preserve this comfortable
shiny-bum niche disguised as the De-
partment of Aboriginal Affairs. To in-
corporate an attack on the “conserva-
tive, liberal” press borders on the hys-
terical.
Mining industry leaders have repeat-
edly stressed that there is no opposition
to “the rights of Aborigines to land,” on
the same terms as all other Australians.
To grant the right to deny access to that
land “carte blanche” is not within those
“Don’t tell me anything. What I don’t know the neighbors
can’t beat out of me"
terms and illustrates an ignorance of the
exploration industry.
We can but hope that at least one of
the incoming directors within the De-
partment of Aboriginal Affairs (21 ad-
vertised positions The Weekend Austra-
lian, June 30/July 1) has a genuine con-
cern for the economic wellbeing of all
Australians and initiates moves toward
the removal of anomalies in the present
land rights legislation which are truly
“inflammatory” to racial relations in
this country.

Blarney’s View
Without doubt, Professor Geoffrey
Blainey is a fine and noble man. Since
Professor Blainey (in the public interest)
drew attention to how the federal gov-
ernment’s migration policy is out of step
with public opinion, he has been a tar-
get for vilification, abuse and misrepre-
sentation.
At all times Professor Blainey has
acted reasonably, objectively, logically
and in the best interests of Australia.
Part of the poem If, by Rudyard
Kipling, reads: “If you can bear to hear
the truth you’ve spoken ... twisted by
knaves to make a trap for fools.”
Professor Blainey has not fallen into
the traps laid by his numerous critics
and detractors and continues to demon-
strate all the qualities which make him a
great Australian.

Defence priorities
Congratulations go to John Stackhouse
on his forthright and lucid appraisal of
Australia’s defence requirements (B,
July 3).
As a former member of the ADF and
now a member of the army reserve, I
believe his suggestions in most cases
offer reasonable and practical solutions
to the complex question of Australia’s
defence.
Being a serving member of the army
reserve, I agree that we are the poor re-
lation. His suggestions that to utilise
manpower along the lines of an initial
training period, followed by service as
an LV (latent volunteer) would go a
long way to overcoming the second-rate
soldier or “cut-lunch commando” im-
age we enjoy.
However, there is one recently-in-
troduced monumental blunder that
should be redressed immediately: the
taxing of army reserve pay. Stackhouse
is correct we do the job not only out
of a sense of loyalty but also because we
enjoy the excitement, challenge and re-
sults we achieve. It seems ludicrous to
work, in some instances, a 24-hour day
(ie, on patrol), be paid for six hours,
then be taxed and in most cases have to
wait three months for your quarterly
cheque.
Stackhouse goes on to suggest a com-
plete overhaul of our ideas on Austra-
lia’s defence industries. I agree. We
would do well to take a leaf out of our
western allies’ books, to encourage the
private sector to analyse our defence
needs in anticipation of potential busi-
ness and then encourage them to com-
pete for it. This would create Australian
jobs which, in turn, would give rise to
Australian expertise. Perhaps the high-
tech industries should be encouraged
somewhat along these lines?
If there is one inherent trait in Aus-
tralian soldiers, it is their ability to make
do with what they have at hand im-
provisation, I’m sure, is a military
cliche. Alas, we are being asked to do a
technical job with obsolete equipment,
because there appears to be no immedi-
ate potential threat. “She’ll be right”
seems to be the military catchcry. Now
is the time for change. Tyranny of dis-
tance is no longer an excuse. We have a
popular and charismatic leader of a ma-
jority government. How about you
characters in Canberra, both civil and
military, getting your act together to
take the issue by the horns and mould a
plan that will bring together civil and
military, bushman and Aboriginal, bu-
reaucrat and private investor as well as

You’re just the person we want.
There’s no recipe for success
like hard work. But hard work means
long hours, impossible deadlines and
snacks replacing proper meals.
Work can become the master
before you know it. The only
exercise you get is rushing to
meetings or running your finger
down columns of figures.
Certainly success might be just
around the corner. But will you be
here to enjoy it? It’s not our intention
to alarm you, but if you recognise
yourself in this, clearly you should be
doing something about it, and now!
The human body is an
amazing recuperator so it’s never
too late to change. The Warburton
Health Centre has been helping
people just like you for over 70
years. At the foot of Mount Donna
Buang, 77 easy kms from
Melbourne, the Centre is set in the
forests of the Great Dividing Range.
With a staff of 130, including
physiotherapists, health specialists,
nutritionists and exercise instructors,
it specialises in preventative medicine
and health education.
There’s daily massage and
hydrotherapy. Tasty, nutritious,
carefully balanced meals are served.
The rooms are large and comfortable.
In your free time you’ll be able to
relax in the pool or sauna, use the gym,
play tennis or badminton or just enjoy
a stroll in the landscaped gardens.
The Centre offers specialist
1 week residential courses in □ Stress
Management □ Stopping Smoking
□ Weight Management □ Five Point
Lifestyle □ Rest& Relaxation and
□ Executive Health & Fitness.
Courses are supervised
and begin with a complete health
and fitness assessment. Then
programmes are planned to meet
special needs. Because Warburton
is non-profit-making the courses are
modestly priced.

Tarago GL and DX, or 4-speed automatic including
overdrive.
In luxurious Tarago GLS, automatic is standard.

Tarago's ultrastreamlined nose is stylish as well as
practical. The sloping front and roof line cuts down drag
whilst exerting a downforce for increased stability at high-
way speeds.
Coil spring rear suspension gives a magic ride.
Coil spring rear suspension provides magic handling and ride.

Public relations problems
Since private enterprise (and mining en-
terprise in particular) is now in the sit-
uation so ably described by Western
Mining Corporation executive director
Hugh Morgan in The Bulletin (July 10),
it is regrettable that WMC apparently
takes such pride in its lack of a publicity
department. (This pride seems evident
in the profile of WMC’s director of op-
erations, Keith Parry, in the latest
Mining Review of the AMIC).
Because WMC is so prestigious in
our mining industry, it would be reason-
able to expect that company to contrib-
ute to improving wider public under-
standing and goodwill toward the in-
dustry.
That it does not is further suggested
to me by the fact that WMC was the
only company of 15 written to for infor-
mation by my son a few years ago to fail
acknowledgement.
I suggest WMC review its own efforts
to improve public perception of private
enterprise, exemplified by itself, as well
as its belief (seemingly expressed by Mr
Parry) that organised public relations
lead to corporate ruin. Considering the
adverse climate so successfully created
for mining enterprise by conserva-
tionists and others, it seems more likely
that disorganised public relations may
lead to corporate ruin.

Gold price puzzle
Where to the gold price? Bulletin Char-
tist Russell Lander (June 26), after
citing factors which could affect the
price of gold, concludes that the prob-
lem is too complex to resolve and that
“mortals are left with little choice but to
seek guidance from the charts and the
occult.”
Using different charting techniques,
he then goes on to say that if the price of
gold goes up a little bit (to SUS4IO/oz)
it could go up a little bit further
(SUS4SO/oz) but that if the price falls a
little bit (to SUS36S/oz) it could fall a
bit further (to SUS3OO/oz).
Profound? Methinks the emperor
has no clothes.
I will opt for the occult. Any chance
of giving Ron Saw’s seer a column in
the financial pages?

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
ALP left loses
THE Australian Labor Party
left suffered defeats on a var-
iety of issues at the party’s na-
tional conference in Can-
berra, notably on uranium
and East Timor. The bitterly
contested uranium debate
ended 55-44 in favor of new
contracts for the existing
Northern Territory mines,
Ranger and Nabarlek, and
gave the go-ahead for South
Australia’s Roxby Downs
mine. The softer new policy
toward Indonesia does not
call for an act of self-determi-
nation by the Timorese but
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden
still termed it “fairly provoca-
tive.”
• See page 28 for conference
report, page 130 for Indonesia.
Abortion vote
THE ALP supported women’s
right to have abortions. How-
ever, parliamentary members
will be allowed to vote on the
issue according to conscience.
Combe back
THE ALP conference also
took back into the fold David
Combe, former party secre-
tary turned lobbyist, who was
banned from government
contacts over the Ivanov
affair.
Bomb funeral
JUDGE Ray Watson of the
Family Court, injured when a
bomb blasted his house, went
from hospital by ambulance
to the funeral of his wife Pearl
who was killed in the explo-
sion.
Health costs fear
THE Federal Health depart-
ment warned that costs would
jump dramatically in the next
20 years barring strong action
to curb a growth in doctors’
numbers. The department es-
timated that the national
health bill could rise by 20
percent in real terms from the
current estimate of $l2 billion
a year. It estimated that the
supply of doctors would in-
crease by 63 percent between
the years 1981 and 2001
from 28,650 to 46,680.
THE WORLD
Muldoon defeated
SIR Robert Muldoon’s
National Party which had
governed New Zealand for
the past nine years suf-
fered a crushing defeat at
last weekend’s general elec-
tion. Victory went to the
Labor Party led by David
Lange, 41, a lawyer. In the
new 95-seat Parliament Labor
will have 56 seats, Nationals
37, Social Credit 2. In 1981
the distribution was: National
47, Labor 43, Social Credit 2.
Besides economic problems
inherited from the Muldoon
Administration the new gov-
ernment is faced with a for-
eign relations crisis concern-
ing the ANZUS alliance.
Labor’s platform excludes nu-
clear-powered ships and ships
carrying nuclear weapons
from calling at New Zealand
ports.
• See page 136 for lan
Templeton's report.
ASEAN plan
FOREIGN Ministers of the
Association of South-East
Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which groups Indonesia, Ma-
laysia, Singapore, the Philip-
pines, Thailand and Brunei,
held a ministerial meeting
with the United States, Japan,
Canada, Australia and New
Zealand in Jakarta. The 11
countries agreed to co-operate
to help development of the
Pacific region’s poorer
nations. The plan is to start
with providing managerial
and vocational training to
those island states which wish
to take part in the program.
Polish trial
THE most important political
trial in Poland since the sup-
pression of Solidarity in 1982
opened at the Warsaw
Military Court. Four free-
labor movement leaders
Jacek Kuron, Adam Michnik,
Henryk Wujec and Zbigniew
Romaszewski face charges
of aiming to overthrow the
Polish political system by
force and to weaken the
country’s defensive power by
breaking the alliance with the
Soviet Union. The charges, if
proved, carry a 10-year jail
sentence.
Border movement
PAPUA New Guinea sent a
company of 120 men from the
Second Battalion, Pacific
Islands Regiment, to the
northern border with Irian
Jaya to mount an operation
against the anti-Indonesian
Free West Papua Movement
(OPM). The move was or-
dered as an answer to the kid-
napping of a teacher from a
PNG village by the OPM.
“The government,” said De-
fence Minister Sali,” won’t al-
low the OPM to engage ih ter-
rorist activities on Papua New
Guinea soil.”
Apartheid check
THE South African parlia-
ment is taking a closer look at
two pillars of the country’s
apartheid policy the Pro-
hibition of Mixed Marriages
Act of 1949 and Section 16 of
the Immorality Act of 1957
both banning sexual relations
across the color line. A parlia-
mentary select committee has
been allowed to “study” the


desirability of repealing the
laws on condition that it
consider the “continued so-
cial, educational and constitu-
tional ordering of society.”
Poll for Canada
CANADA’S new Prime Min-
ister, John Turner, who took
office at the beginning of this
month, called a snap election
for September 4 after a short
trip to London to ask Queen
Elizabeth to postpone until
September a Canadian visit
planned to begin last week.
Turner’s Liberal Party has
governed Canada almost
without interruption for 21
years. Its strongest rivals are
the Conservatives, now led by
Brian Mulroney.
Sakharov report
THE Soviet Union’s best-
known dissident, Nobel Prize-
winning physicist, Dr Andrei
Sakharov, reportedly is being
treated forcibly with mind-
altering drugs at a hospital in
the city of Gorky where he has
lived in internal exile since
January 1980. Sakharov’s
step-daughter Tanya Yanke-
levitch, who lives in New
York, said the report in-
The rubble inside England’s historic York Minster
UPI
dicated that Sakharov, 63, was
still on a hunger strike which
he began on May 2 to try to
pressure authorities into
granting his wife a visa to
travel to the west for medical
treatment.
Cathedral blaze
FIRE, probably started by
lightning, seriously damaged
one of Britain’s most import-
ant historic buildings the
eight-centuries-old Gothic ca-
thedral of York Minster. Parts
of the roof collapsed but the
ancient stained glass windows
survived the blaze. Damage
was estimated at nearly 2 mil-
lion pounds ($3 million).
BUSINESS
Aust dollar sags
THE Australian dollar con-
tinued to lose ground against
the US currency, reaching a
new low of 81.3 US cents.
After the low the $A fluctu-
ated widely, at one stage re-
covering to 84.1 US cents be-
fore settling around 83.1 US
cents. The $A has fallen more
than 10 percent from a level
of 93.4 US cent£ in early May.
Burns, Philp change
CHIEF executive of Burns,
Philp and Co Ltd, Philip Best,
announced his retirement
after 32 years with the com-
pany. National general man-
ager Andrew Turnbull will
take over.
Potter Partners coup
MELBOURNE stockbroker
Potter Partners scored a coup
when it secured a deal to sell
its unit trusts through the
1395-branch Australia Post
network.
Westpac ‘wedding’
THE strongly-rumored mar-
riage between Westpac and
leading stockbroker Ord
Minnett eventuated when the
bank took a 50 percent share
in the firm. The move means
that the Commonwealth Bank
is now the only member of
the four major banks which
has not established a broker
link.

CELLARING WINE
One of the great pleasures is opening a fine red you
| have put away for some years to discover it has
matured magnificently But how do you know when
a wine in your collection is at its best and ready to drink?
Firstly there is the winemaker’s indication 4
of cellaring potential, often necessarily broad.
Secondly you should look to the history of the
maker’s wine style and his reputation and
reliability Fortunately older vintages of better
known wines are often tasted regularly and the
results publicised.
But the most reliable guide is to regu-
larly taste the wine yourself. That might dictate
putting a dozen aside untouched for a couple of years
before your first look but you’ll have the opportunity
of seeing the wine improve and have sufficient
bottles left when it is at its best, to capitalise on your
investment in pleasure.

THIS MONTH’S RECOMMENDATION
BIN 389 CABERNET SHIRAZ
T\he Bin 389 wine style was developed
from experimental wines made in the mid
1950’s at the company’s Magill cellars,
alongside Grange and St. Henri.
A blend of premium cabernet sauvig-
non with shiraz, Bin 389 is always matured in
the same American oak casks that held the
previous vintage of Grange Hermitage and so
picks up some of the flavour of this wine.
The selection of premium fruit has
been an important factor in maintaining this
wines consistent high quality vintage to
vintage. Bin 389 is a very attractive medium
bodied style.

AUSTRALIA
Our new Parliament House:
too small already
An artist’s model of the new Parliament House in Canberra: extensions planned before it is completed
Extensions are being planned already for our new Parliament House because provision
was not made in the plans for the number of MHRs and Senators to increase.
FI A CUMMING tells how this could add nearly 10 percent to the cost of the complex.
EXTENSIONS to Canberra’s new Par-
liament House are being planned four
years before its scheduled opening.
A proposal before federal cabinet
would add almost 10 percent to the al-
ready costly project.
The controversial edifice taking
shape on Capital Hill, behind the pre-
sent Parliament House, simply will not
be big enough to hold the extra mem-
bers designated under government elec-
toral reforms. Unless more money is
provided for the project in the next
budget, 35 MPs could be left on the
doorstep when the move occurs in 1988.
The extra members are to comprise 23
in the House of Representatives and 12
senators.
The Parliament House Construction
Authority has asked for at least $4O mil-
lion to cover extensions.
The latest cost estimate on the origin-
al plans is $430 million plus outfitting.
To make matters worse, the extensions
would require tearing down some parts
of the building which have just been
completed.
The chairman of the statutory con-
struction authority, Gordon Peatey, ad-
mits that extensions are an awkward
problem. He says that the fault lies in
the specifications for the competition to
choose a design for the building in the
late 19705. Plans submitted had to cater
only for the present number of MPs:
125 MHRs and 64 senators.
The design had to show how the
building could be extended for a further
40 members of the lower house and 24
senators but this was merely a concept
which was not part of the original con-
struction.
Architects Mitchell Giurgola and
Thorp are working hard on designs for
extensions. The Joint Parliamentary
Committee on New Parliament House
has approved several alternative con-
ceptual designs but cabinet approvals
are needed before putting any into
place.
To save time, however, the architects
are proceeding with detailed plans.
Peatey says: “Obviously, it’s a pressing
matter and we quite frankly have been
proceeding with a design anticipating
that it will be approved. Rather than
hold off and lose time that we can’t
really afford, we are taking the risk that
cabinet does not approve it which, of
course, is possible.”
Subject to cabinet, excavations for
extensions will begin within two weeks.
The authority hopes that, all being well,
the extensions will be completed at the
same time as the rest of the building
in time for the rescheduled official
opening date of May 9, 1988. (May 9
was the opening date of federal parlia-
ment both in Melbourne and at the in-
terim house in Canberra.)
Although constituting a major
change, the extensions would affect only
the office wings and not the main body
of the building.
In contrast to the offices where not
one extra member could be squeezed,
the chambers were approved on a grand
scale for up to 500 members in the
House of Representatives.
As well as more offices for MPs,
room must be made for staff members
(four for each member); more car
parking space; furniture and art works;
electronics and communications and
other amenities.
But it would not all be additions.
Room could be made by widening the
wings to put offices on both sides of the
corridors, instead of on just one. Says
Peatey: “It’s hard enough getting it all
finished in time; it’s certainly a nuisance
when you have to start re-doing what
you have already done.”
The plan under cabinet consider-
ation and favored by the authority pro-
vides for more than the immediate
needs. The authority wants flexibility to
allow, for example, for fluctuations in
the distribution of ministers between the
Reps and Senate. Ministers need more
space for their staff, as well as larger
personal offices. □


COMMENT
Four days in the negative
by Alan Reid
PRIME MINISTER Bob Hawke won,
Foreign Affairs minister Bill Hayden
starred and the pair beat the left consist-
ently on a range of issues with the po-
tential to be damaging electorally for
the Hawke government. These are the
results of the ALP national conference
last week in Canberra.
The conference mirrored the manner
in which the ALP has
changed. Old ALP leaders
sought to give the im-
pression that the party was
a united body. Today, fac-
tionalism is institution-
alised. In fact, it was obvi-
ous that as far as confer-
ence delegates were con-
cerned Hawke was not so
much leader of the ALP as
leader of the right faction.
The star of the confer-
ence undoubtedly was
Hayden. He was vigorous,
convincing and pungently
destructive of his oppo-
nents’ arguments. He did not hestitate
to take on the left’s spokesmen, ridicul-
ing them on occasions most tellingly.
It is puzzling why Hayden looks so
much better as Foreign Affairs minister
and leader of the centre left faction than
he looked when he was ALP leader be-
fore Hawke. It has been suggested that
the formation of the faction has given
him a confidence and an assurance that
he lacked while party leader.
It was a negative conference. Leav-
ing out the entry of foreign banks, the
conference set out mainly what an ALP
government should not do. The Hawke
government should not look specifically
at a capital gains tax or pull out of
ANZUS or bar American 852 s from
using Australian airspace and facilities
or close down US bases.
Much of this negative approach
probably can be attributed to the ALP
having so many single-issue members.
They are not really interested in any-
thing other than their pet subject. This
keeps the party leaders damping down
issues which could prove to be elector-
ally disastrous.
There is a side effect to this single-
issue attitude. In earlier ALP confer-
ences the emphasis was on bread and
butter issues of concern to the blue-col-
lar workers jobs, working conditions,
social security provisions, tariffs, na-
tional superannuation possibilities and
such topics.
Alan Reid
At this conference, the bread and
butter issues got abbreviated treatment
compared with the time allocated for
uranium mining not its employment
prospects but its social implications
the sad position of the indigenous
people of East Timor, the existence of
American bases on Australian soil,
abortion on demand and the threat to a
rain forest in Queensland.
It was such matters that
produced the lengthy and
sometimes impassioned
debates.
I was pleased to see one
bread and butter issue get
an airing during the debate
on defence, even though it
appeared to get up against
the opposition of the
groups controlling the con-
ference. Jack Kidd, nation-
al secretary of the Amal-
gamated Metal Foundry
and Shipwrights’ Union,
asked the conference to
call for the Hawke government to order
immediately the construction of the sec-
ond fleet replenishment vessel at Cocka-
too Dockyard in Sydney to save hun-
dreds of jobs.
Defence minister Gordon Scholes
said nothing doing; his department did
not have the financial resources.
Only in the dying hours of the con-
ference did protection for Australian in-
dustry get a gallop. Arthur Gietzelt, the
minister for Veterans Affairs, took the
opportunity to declare himself an un-
ashamed advocate of the type of protec-
tion that had produced jobs 1.6 mil-
lion, according to Science minister
Barry Jones and had enabled Austra-
lian workers to drive around in cars and
to own holiday homes.
Gietzelt at least had the satisfaction
of hearing the conference endorse the
proposition that there was no economic
sense in reducing protection in the
midst of high unemployment.
Some of the success of the confer-
ence must be attributed to the manner in
which the ALP’s national president,
NSW Premier Neville Wran, acted as
chairman. He gave everyone a fair go
and interpreted the standing orders with
common sense and flexibility.
The conference revealed clearly that
the ALP, far from being a single unit, is
run by a coalition between Hawke’s
Labor unity grouping and Hayden’s
centre left. □'

SUPPORT for the Australian Labor
Party Government in Victoria fell a fur-

down 5 percent on its year’s high of 54
percent, the latest Morgan Gallup Poll
shows.
However, the approval rating of
Premier John Cain rose by 4 percent.
In the poll, 1001 electors throughout
Victoria were asked which party would
receive their first preference “if a State
election were being held today?” Of
those surveyed, only 4 percent didn’t
state their preference.

THE ALP
The left’s one
true path to
emasculation
By RICHARD FARMER
LABOR’S LEFT wing which entered
last week’s national conference with a
record number of delegates left it
searching for a new way of operating.
Despite having 42 votes out of 99 on
most issues, the left finished the confer-
ence without a victory. But this does not
mean that its influence in the party has
been crushed.
The defeats were the result of bad
generalship and nothing else. The old
guard leadership might be under chal-
lenge in the wash-up of the conference
but the left, as a faction, remains as
strong as ever.
At previous Labor conferences the
left, with smaller numbers, has been
able to win over waverers who belong
neither to the left nor to the right. It
expected to be able to do so again but
reckoned without the influence of the
Demonstrators outside the ALP’s conference hotel: negotiation the key
Centre Left group focusing on Foreign
Minister Bill Hayden.
The Hayden group provided a com-
fortable home for people whose com-
mitment to a reformist ideology stops
short of wanting to put a Labor govern-
ment at risk.
The left, if it had got its way at the
conference, would have put the Hawke
government at risk. Ending ANZUS,
halting uranium mining, dismantling se-
curity services and threatening capital
gains taxes and death duties are a recipe
for electoral disaster.
The left entered the debates on all
those key questions wearing intellectual
blinkers. There was only one true path
and it had to be followed without devi-
ation.
In the truly important conference
discussions those that took place in
private outside the hall the left very
quickly became irrelevant. A faction
that is not prepared to negotiate any
change from its holy writ has nothing to
contribute to the bargaining process.
The Centre Left, on the other hand, was
prepared to give and accept con-
cessions. It thus had an impact on the
policy which will control how Labor
governs federally for the next two years.
The left, with its all-or-nothing ap-
proach, had little.
That little left wing influence, which
has emerged was not the result of tired
speeches from the likes of Victorian
party president George Crawford and
would-be-senator Bill Hartley. It came
from the work of the new breed of So-
cialist Left members in the months be-
fore the conference in the party policy
committees.
Peter Staples from Diamond Valley,
as chairman of the caucus education
committee, was instrumental in keeping
the party committed to phasing out fed-
eral funds for the richest private
schools. This article of socialist faith
was under threat following a report
from the Schools Commission which
recommended that all schools should
continue to get at least the same grant as
now.
Staples was not himself a delegate
last week. His success was the result of
backroom work which saw him pre-
pared to compromise on some things to
get his way on the issue he believed was
of greatest importance. John Saunder-
son, the Socialist Left member for
Deakin, took the same route during the
preparation of the communications pol-
icy. And so did Peter Steedman, the


member for Casey, on industry policy
which saw the left and the right as allies
in keeping the party’s traditional com-
mitment to protection for manufac-
turing industry.
Steedman was undoubtedly one of
the most interesting and interested ob-
servers at the conference. His 16 months
in the House of Representatives have
not yet blunted his somewhat coarse
language and his deliberately rebellious
manner of dress. But it was possible to
detect in him a disappointment as the
uncompromising approach of his fac-
tional colleagues led to defeat after
defeat.
Being in parliament is not much fun
if you cannot influence events and
Steedman is not a man prepared to put
up with a miserable life for the sake of a
comfortable income and the promise of
a pension to come.
He is sure to be pressing for changes
within the Victorian heartland of the
Socialist Left that will help turn num-
bers into victories at future federal con-
ferences.
At the heart of those changes is the
need to accept the new fact of Labor
Party life that compromise with the
Centre Left is necessary. But the more
dramatic illustration of the clash be-
tween the old and new guards of the
faction will come with the pre-selection
ballot for Labor’s Senate team. Hartley
is running hard to become a parliamen-
tarian but, as the symbol of the “baddie
left,” there is a danger that putting him
on the ticket would result in Labor win-
ning only three Senate seats. Steedman
would prefer not to take the risk of both
the Socialist Left and the party as a
whole missing out on a senator and is
heading the search for another Socialist
Left member to be endorsed instead of
Hartley. □
Immigration minister Stewart West: determined, almost stubborn, and ready for a fight
PROFILE
The wharfie who
worked hjs
way to cabinet
By ANTHONY HILL
on which to join forces with the ALP
political mainstream, even if immigra-
tion does carry as many electoral risks
as it does advantages.
But with Stewatt West having to
carry the burden of the debate for the
government, at least on the floor of the
parliament, it’s timely to ask: what sort
of a man is he?
A tall, thick-set man of 50, with a
mop of steel-grey hair and obliged by
short-sightedness to wear heavy spec-
tacles, West is not a public speaker of
rapier-like wit or delivery. Rather is he
determined stubborn almost rely-
ing on his physical presence to carry
him through.
In this, he no doubt reflects his back-
ground of years on the Port Kembla
wharves and intra-party branch battles
where perseverance counts for as much
as skill in the arts of debate and argu-
ment.
Indeed, while the opposition may
have got the best of the coverage when
the Asian immigration row first burst
upon parliament last May (“It was the
rowdiest scene since I’ve been there,”
says West), by the end of it even West’s
critics within the government conceded
he had got his act together and handled
himself pretty well.
West’s personal history can be briefly
told. He was born to the land at Forbes
(NSW) but economic depression forced
the family to move to Wollongong when
he was seven. He left school at 15 and
took a job in a bank but, unable to cope
with the “stultifying” pen-pushing of
those pre-computer days, tried metallur-
gy and the steelworks before moving to
the waterfront. Incidentally, father and
son joined the same gang on the same
day.
The job gave him the chance to move
about the country ... he’s worked on
the wharves from Cairns to Fremantle.
Returning to Wollongong in the mid-
60s, he involved himself in the union,
eventually becoming president of the
Port Kembla branch from 1972 to 1977
the year he entered parliament fol-
lowing the death of one-time mentor
Rex Connor.
West also used his time to refine his
ideological position. Always drawn to
the left of the ALP, he was a voracious
IT WAS A RARE moment of unity at
the ALP national conference. There
were Prime Minister Bob Hawke, the
apostle of pragmatism, and Stewart
West, Immigration minister and the
only left representative in cabinet, joint-
ly sponsoring a resolution acknowledg-
ing the contribution to Australian life
by migrants “regardless of race, religion
or ethnic background.”
A motherhood issue perhaps. But,
with Hawke going on to flail the Lib-
erals in general and opposition spokes-
man Michael Hodgman in particular,
for again “dredging the gutters of
racism,” it’s clear that immigration will
be the dominant and most divisive ques-
tion between the parties in the run up to
the election.
For the left that repository of
Labor conscience it’s not a bad issue


reader of journals and periodicals, often
going through five newspapers a day.
“I was one of the few wharfies,” West
recalls, “who regularly took the Finan-
cial Review to work every day.”
He still reads widely economics,
politics and departmental submissions
in the line of duty; Steinbeck, Ray
Bradbury and works on archaeology for
relaxation. He’s visited most of the sur-
viving classical sites in the Mediter-
ranean world.
As a novice MP, West resisted urg-
ings by friends to take a part-time econ-
omics degree. He says: “As a political
activist and working member of parlia-
ment, without trying to be egotistical
about it, I think I knew enough.”
Instead, with only 36 ALP members
in the House, West used his time and his
opportunity to speak on a range of
issues health, uranium, the coal in-
dustry, unemployment, oil and energy
policy and thus to make himself
noticed within the parliamentary party.
It had the desired effect. When Labor
came to power last year, West was the
only one of the ministers from the left of
the party to be appointed to cabinet...
and, while he would probably deny it,
one suspects that for a committed mem-
ber of the left the realities of office are
beginning to catch up.
For example, a few years ago he ar-
gued passionately for the abolition of
all Australia’s security agencies. Today,
he’s not so sure.
“I wouldn’t take that view now,” he
says. “We do need to screen people
coming into Australia either as residents
or visitors. There have been bombings. I
don’t argue against the need for a se-
curity service but not one based on
fear, intimidation or political bias.”
The left’s own resolution at last
week’s conference implied the need for
some form of intelligence-gathering op-
eration responsible to parliament. It got
rolled as did most of the faction’s
other moves but at least it was a shift
in position that can only be explained
by the transition to government.
Not that the left has wholeheartedly
embraced the politics of pragmatism.
West stood down from cabinet for five
months over that key issue of con-
science, uranium and cabinet solidarity.
Yet even here, while West describes
his decision as “dreadfully hard,” he’s
grateful to colleagues from all factions
who supported the move to bring him
back last April.
“There is no ambiguity about my
position,” he says. “But, if the left had
kept saying they would not abide by
cabinet solidarity, we would virtually
have been shut out from cabinet forever
and it is important in my view that there
be other ministers from the left in cabi-
net. It is absolutely crucial when there
are 35 left votes in Caucus.
Foreign Minister Botha: what Australia says is irrelevant
“I believe it will be redressed in the
fullness of time.”
West strongly disagrees with the view
that because so few of the left’s resol-
utions got up at the national conference
it is both beaten and inconsequential.
With a solid vote of 42 delegates and 46
on one issue, it was only eight votes
away from a majority.
Says West: “The left has increased its
vote marginally, conference by confer-
ence. It is incredible. It takes two other
organised factions to do them over.
“I don’t say a hard, dogmatic left will
be making all the far-out decisions but
there is every likelihood that in future
the left and its supporters will start to
take decisions.
“Certainly, I don’t think the left is
beaten and cowed. I don’t say we are
automatically correct in everything we
do but I challenge the view that we are
rigid, dogmatic and authoritarian.
“The centre really do have some
problems despite their alleged suc-
cesses. If there is little to distinguish
them from the conservatives, well, there
is really little need for their existence in
terms of political issues other than the
need to hang together themselves.
That’s the big problem for the centre.”
All of which is for the longer term.
As of now, West is concentrating on the
politics of immigration and preparing
the barricades for what promises to be
an ugly session of parliament.
The Liberal campaign, he says, “is
the epitome of political opportunism of
the vilest possible kind.” This is some-
thing on which the left, the centre and
the right of the ALP can all agree. □

Australia ‘missing
the boat’ on
African reform
By DAVID McNICOLL
“WHAT YOUR government says of us
has become completely irrelevant. Not
merely in my view as a South African
check with the African leaders as well.
They just think you’re funny; they
think, quite frankly, that you’re ga-ga.”
Pik Botha, South Africa’s Foreign
Minister and the second-most-powerful
man in the republic, was in full flight.
We were in his Cape Town office, seated
comfortably at a table on which coffee
cups were being placed. In front of the
minister was my tape recorder; at his
right elbow was his shorthand writer,
taking down every word said a nor-
mal political precaution against being
misquoted.
Botha is a large man, moustachioed,
with piercing eyes, a deep voice and an
appearance of extraordinary determina-
tion.
The questioning had turned to Aus-
tralia’s inflexible attitudes toward South
Africa attitudes which, Botha said,
are held only by Australia among
“white” nations.
“What is so ironical to us is that your
government shouts at South Africa and
condemns us but offers no solution to
the terrific dilemma of Africa. More

“It astonishes me that people in your
Australian government are not willing
simply to see the facts of the matter. I
have offered Australia all the ANC
(African National Congress) personnel
(expelled by Mozambique after the
signing of the recent Nkomati accord)
and the one and a half million black
immigrants in South Africa.
“This is not being spiteful on my part
I would really be grateful if you
would ask your government how many
they would take.
“What worries me is this: the ordi-
nary Australian people do not think like
your government; they are much the
same as our people the same sense,
the same inadequacies. In Britain, in
Portugal, in Italy (the last two with so-
cialist governments, incidentally), while
they are critical of aspects of our poli-
cies, have a profound understanding of
our problems. But your government
doesn’t at all.
“Far from assisting those who would
like to see more trade, your government
plays the opposite role. In doing so, it
only makes it more difficult for us to
effect change.”
The changes in South Africa, which
Botha says the Australian government
will not recognise, are very apparent to
the visitor. The changes, as Botha
pointed out to me, have resulted in a
split in the ruling National Party a
split which could have brought it down.
“My party was prepared to allow a
split in its ranks because we were pre-
pared to share power for the first time in
our history,” said Botha. “Color is no
longer the determining factor in alloca-
tion of political rights.”
The political splits in South Africa
have sorted out the ultra-conservatives
from those wanting change or, at least,
recognising that change was inevitable.
“Ten years ago,” said the Foreign
Minister, “you couldn’t wine or dine
with a black man. Nobody thinks any-
thing of it today. It is not strange to see
white spectators applauding black ath-
letes and black boxers beating white op-
ponents. This is improvement, this is
progress.
“All movement must be measured
from a starting point. It is completely
irrelevant to say we should have moved
faster unless you tell us where the start-
ing point was.”
Botha does not underestimate the
problems facing South Africa. He fore-
sees, in the reported crumbling of the
ANC, a stepped-up program of sense-
less indiscriminate terrorism. He sees
the Namibian campaign as a continuing
headache, one which cannot be cured
until the thousands of Cubans in An-
gola are withdrawn from that country.
But, on the brighter side, Pik Botha and
his Prime Minister P. W. Botha were
encouraged and greatly stimulated by
the reception they received on their re-
cent visit to Europe.
Pik Botha sees the Mozambique
agreement as one of continuing friendly
dialogues with neighboring states. With
most countries in Africa in chaos of
varying intensity, the countries near
South Africa are looking more to what
benefits they can draw from the proxim-
ity than to what they can do to destabil-
ise the republic. Botha has a dream for
southern Africa which must have appeal
to an increasing number of black lead-
ers.
“The sad fact is that Africa is worse
off today than it was 80 years ago,” he
said. “Infrastructure, in the main, is dil-

Justice Watson at his wife’s funeral in the inner Sydney suburb of Newtown
apidated; there is a dearth of tech-
nicians; food production is declining;
human diseases are on the increase
and countries are spending half their
budget in interest on their foreign
debts.”
Where would the southern African
line be drawn for a new-look Utopia.
Perhaps the Limpopo, perhaps the
Zambesi, says Botha. “Within this sub-
continent, you would have reasonably
developed infrastructure ports, rail-
ways, airports, medical services, young
entrepreneurs in the private sector. Plus
our technology, which is remarkable.
“If stability can be achieved and the
dangerous intervention of the Soviet
Union stopped, then I believe that in
perhaps 16 or 17 countries with a popu-
lation of 60 to 70 million we could have
a large internal market and the sub-con-
tinent could be saved.
“Many European private sector el-
ements are interested in coming here if
our neighbors can guarantee no nation-
alisation of their property, that there
would be water and power and that they
would be able to take out some divi-
dends.
“This can happen,” said Botha, eyes
riveting the interviewer. “I do believe
there is an emerging pattern in terms of
which African leaders do recognise the
whites of this country as being indeed
Africans and that without them they
would be lost. Not because they are
black we do not believe in that. I do
not believe in race superiority or inferi-
ority but I do believe in observable his-
torical facts and ‘know-how’. This we
can supply. And Europeans, Americans
and. Japanese (he excluded Australians)
will help provide the technology to
make a well-developed South Africa to
help our neighbors.
“My vision is a developing southern
Africa with states working together to
combat disease animal, farm and
food; extending railways, building
bridges and dams, irrigating, putting up
factories and an industrial explosion of
mineral wealth perhaps to an extent
where we can feed all of Africa. It’s all
there; it is there!” □

Official concern
over ‘target’
court delays
By ANTHONY HILL
IN THE WAKE of mounting govern-
ment concern over Family Court
atrocities, a few very uncomforable stat-
istics have come to light: in nearly all
areas of custody and property litigation,
delays at the Parramatta court in Syd-
ney’s western suburbs are among the
worst in Australia ... and are bound to
increase.
All the attacks on judges and the
bombing of the court house itself, have
involved that registry.
Justice David Opas who was shot
dead outside his Woollahra home in
1980 sat in the Parramatta court, as did
Justice Richard Gee whose Belrose
home was bombed last March.
An explosion badly damaged the
Parramatta court building in April.
And this month the Greenwich home
of Justice Ray Watson, the head of the
court at Parramatta, was bombed.
Watson’s wife, Pearl, was killed instant-
ly and the judge wounded severely.
All these attacks occurred in Sydney
suburbs.
The latest figures taken out by the
court show that it takes on average two
years in many cases longer for con-
tested property cases to go before a
judge for decision at Parramatta, com-
pared with just over 16 months in Mel-
bourne and little more than a year in the
Sydney city registry.
Custody cases take a little longer to
reach a judicial ruling in Melbourne
28 months against the 27 at Parramatta.
But this is because it takes a full year in
Melbourne between the court ordering
a custody welfare report and the liti-
gants getting an appointment. At Par-
ramatta, that takes only six months.
In most other areas, though, delays
at Parramatta are equal to, if not signifi-
cantly longer than, those in any other
Family Court jurisdiction.
There was a 16-month wait on the
Parramatta defended list at the end of
May, against 12 months in Melbourne
and Townsville and nine months in
Brisbane and at Sydney.
Parramatta, set up as a regional
court, had 641 cases on the defended list
which was about double the 341 on the
Sydney and Brisbane lists and not far
behind Melbourne’s 715.
Not all defended cases get into court.
Most are settled if not always ami-
cably long before a judicial decision
would have to be imposed.


The only
real bargain
in a fleet car
bone that
keeps on
running.
Downtime has become very
expensive indeed. So no matter how
good a deal you make on your next
fleet purchase, it could turn into very
false economy if your cars spend more
time in service bays than
expected.
Which is why the extra built-in
reliability and maintenance-saving
features in Nissan Bluebird are qualities
a fleet operator can appreciate.
Like Nissan Bluebird’s Hi Energy
System with electronic ignition.
This not only ensures a hot,
perfectly timed spark for
increased performance and fuel
savings... it also increases
reliability by doing away with
points that wear out or need
servicing. In fact, Nissan Bluebird
now needs so little attention that
routine service intervals are extended
to every 10,000 km, saving downtime
and money.
By now, we hope it's obvious:
everything about Nissan Bluebird
is designed to make your fleet more
dependable and help you lower costs.

The bomb damaged Parramatta Family Court: interminable delays have become the norm
Staff shortages are the reason behind
the delays at Parramatta.
The court had only 48 “operatives”
to handle the 4120 applications last year
for such matters as custody, mainten-
ance and access. Sydney had 78 to
handle 5676 “Form 6” applications and
Melbourne 95 to cope with 6460.
The shortages have led to rolling
strikes by court staff and prompted chief
judge Elizabeth Evatt to urge the federal
government to increase overall numbers
from about 450 to at least 480. It’s a
battle which Attorney-General Gareth
Evans has been fighting in the budget
cabinet.
Of the staff increase of 25 announced
late last week with hopefully more in
the budget only some will be going to
Parramatta. Others will be needed else-
where, with a new regional court open-
ing at Lismore (NSW) next month and
Dandenong (Vic) in September.
Increasing staff numbers and even
the $500,000 reward are only one part
of the government’s response to the
sense of urgency surrounding commu-
nity perceptions of the Family Court.
The Family Law Council, chaired by
Mr Justice John Fogarty, met in Sydney
last week to consider a letter from
Evans outlining three possible moves:
■ A media campaign to familiarise
the public with the family law system,
based on “thorough market research.”
■ An increase in experienced salar-
ied legal lawyers, possibly involving a
system of accredited practitioners.
■ Giving judges in Family Court
hearings the option to resume wearing
traditional robes.
Said Evans: “It is thought in some
quarters that certain litigants might be
better able to accept the decisions of a
judge who is traditionally attired in a
way that physically emphasises his auth-
ority.”
He says that he is not committed to
any of the suggestions but had brought
them to the council’s attention “in the
context of your overall consideration of

The Jackson to Moonie Pipeline project, Queensland...the day the oil stood still.
“AND THEY
SAID IT COULDNT
BE DONE...”
Well, they said the Jackson to Moonie pipeline
couldn’t be done.
We did it. And they said it couldn’t be done in
less than a year.
We did it. In 10 months, 800 kilometres of it,
through drought, flood, and the remotest parts of the
Never-Never.
And then, when the unforeseen happened and
freak weather conditions caused the oil in the new
pipeline to coagulate...they said it was too far from
anywhere to get help in time. We got our men there
in a matter of hours. And because of their experience,
knowledge, and the teamwork that has made
Williams Brothers famous, they knew just what to do.
And they did it...in time.
Teamwork and experience are the intangible
assets that have involved Williams Brothers in every
major pipeline project in Australia for the last 13 years.
Teamwork and experience are the qualities
that make the big difference to deadlines and budgets.
And often they are the qualities that make the
impossible, possible.
If you’ve got a project in mind that they’re saying
can’t be done, whether it’s because of its complexity,
its budget or its deadline, talk to us. We can do it.

the need to improve the public percep-
tion of the Family Court.”
The letter was written in June after
the bombing of the Gee home and the
explosion outside the court premises but
before the Watson murder.
While some preliminary response
will be sent to Evans this week, the
council decided to set up a sub-commit-
tee to look at the long-term issues of the
family law system. It’s due to report
back to the Attorney-General by
November at the latest. □
TRANSPORT
Commission
reveals possibile
export fiddle
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE INTERSTATE Commission, a
body enshrined in the constitution but
put on hold for three-quarters of a cen-
tury, is not only alive and well but
kicking.
The commission was disbanded in
1912 but remembered as a plank in the
Australian Labor Party platform in the
gasping days of the Whitlam era in
1975. Then Transport Minister Charlie
Jones piloted legislation through parlia-
ment re-establishing the commission
but it lay there, deliberately forgotten,
in the Fraser years.
Late last year Transport Minister
Peter Morris resurrected the organisa-
tion, named its first members and
charged it with inquiring into the diffi-
cult problem of the Tasmanian freight
equalisation subsidies.
These payments run out at around
$35 million a year. They are designed to
compensate Tasmania for the problems
involved in sending freight across Bass
Strait.
But the intent, spelled out in the
legislation, was to balance Tasmania in
relation to the mainland states’ trade.
Some of the evidence the commission
has been taking points to payments
having been made for export trade as
well that is Tasmanian products being
sold outside Australia.
If the commission finds this has been
done, it will be embarrassing to the gov-
ernment internationally. Trade sub-
sidies are frowned on under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and,
should the occasion arise, they could
lead the Americans into determining
that we are dumping exports in the US
by subsidising them.
First president of the revived com-
mission is Tasmania’s Justice Mervyn
Everett, a former state minister who
now assumes the status of a federal
judge.
The sole member at this stage is Pro-
fessor Helmut Kolsen, formerly of the
University of Queensland, a transport
economist.
Morris has tabbed the third member
of the commission who is likely to be
named this week. He is described as an
executive from private enterprise who
will bring a transport industry perspec-
tive to the board, which is now strongly
weighted towards legal and academic
considerations.
During the Tasmanian inquiries
some witnesses from the private sector
have grumbled at the convoluted forms
the examination has taken. Transcripts
show that some of Kolsen’s questions,
for instance, could be described as ram-
bling: they are considerably longer than
the answers they elicit.
The commission is seen in the gov-
ernment as an investigatory, not a regu-
latory, body (as was the emphasis of the
original Interstate Commission). Morris
sees the need for a small, expert group
to dig out facts and put the evidence on
the table in confused situations.
The commission has the powers of a
royal commission and can demand evi-
dence. However it has wide discretion
to rule evidence confidential and
Everett has been punctilious in clarify-
ing whether private enterprise witnesses
want details of their business made pub-
lic or treated as private.
Morris plans to give the commission
another investigation when it completes
this one. It could well be some matter
pertaining to road transport, for in-
stance the commonality or otherwise of
state regulations and conditions that
cause considerable confusion and ex-
pense to operators at present.
Keith Wright: facing the acid test
The commission has a small support
staff of about a dozen. This will eventu-
ally expand to about 30. Morris is ada-
mant that he does not want to create a
new regulatory empire.
If the first inquiry can shed some
light on the murky freight equalisation
system and establish a streamlined sys-
tem of hearings and analysis, it could
prove to be an adjunct to the efficiency
of Australia’s jumbled transport indus-
try and not the monster that some seg-
ments of industry have feared it might
become. □
QUEENSLAND
Lib by-election
win big danger
to government
By DENIS REINHARDT
ON AUGUST 4, the Queensland Na-
tional Party desperately needs to reverse
established political theology that gov-
ernments don’t win seats at by-elec-
tions.
A Liberal win could mean defeat of
the government.
All three major parties are scram-
bling for the Brisbane seat of Stafford,
vacant following the death of former
Australian Labor Party state president
Denis Murphy, who won the seat by 39
votes at the state elections on October
22 last year.
Until then the seat had been held by
the Liberal Party’s Terry Gygar since
1974. But in last year’s election, Gygar
ran third to Murphy and the Nationals’
Pat Blake, an insurance broker and fun-
damentalist Christian. As well as swap-
ping conservative sides to give Blake
4525 primary votes to Gygar’s 3923,
Liberal voters allowed 15.1 percent of
their preferences to drift to Murphy,
thus ensuring his narrow election.
Labor is fielding a popular 33-year-
old ABC talks show compere, Janine
Walker, against Blake and Gygar.
The Labor Party’s leader Keith
Wright, who took Labor to within 10
seats of winning government in
October, is staking his reputation on
Walker’s winning.
“Stafford is the big test the acid test
for Keith Wright, we have to admit
that,” one of his advisers told The Bul-
letin.
Walker is supremely confident. “It’s
a marginal seat and the conservatives’
chances are marginal,” she says.
Unflatteringly, the Liberals are
describing Walker as a “white wine so-
cialist.”

Gygar, an ex-Vietnam veteran,
would have been odds-on to retake his
old seat until late last Friday when Col
Miller, one of the six-member Liberal
rump in the Queensland parliament,
heralded a re-enactment of the party’s
October slaughter. Miller, pleading
commitment to true Liberal philosophy,
announced his resignation from the
party and his intention to sit as an inde-
pendent voting with the Bjelke-Petersen
Government.
Privately, Miller attributed his deser-
tion to Gygar’s endorsement. In the co-
alition parties room, Gygar was one of
Bjelke-Petersen’s most vitriolic critics.
Gygar told The Bulletin: “Against
me, Blake has no show this time.”
If Gygar wins it will change the pol-
icy within the Liberal caucus to co-oper-
ation with Labor to defeat the Nationals
on the floor of parliament. The
Nationals at present rule with a ma-
jority of only one, before the speaker’s
casting vote.
The Nationals will be campaigning
hard for a win by their candidate. Sir
Johannes Bjelke-Petersen enters the
campaign on July 20 with a launching at
the local Italian Club, followed the next
day by an American-style motorcade
through Stafford streets and shopping
centres, aiming to press as many hands
as possible.
A Morgan Gallup Poll taken during
May and June indicated that the
Nationals would have won on pref-
erences if an election had been held at
the end of June.
Support for the Nationals had
dropped 4 percent to 35 percent while
the Liberal Party support was up 2 per-
cent to 14 percent, and ALP support
was up 1 percent to 47 percent.
The following table compares the
latest result with the October 22 state
election result and previous Morgan
Gallup Polls.

PUBLIC OPINION
Labor still a
winner in NSW
despite doctors
SUPPORT FOR the New South Wales
government at the end of June fell 2
percent but it would have been returned
if an election had been held then, the
latest Morgan Gallup Poll shows.
At the time the poll was taken, the
government was locked in a bitter dis-
pute with doctors.
These findings came from interview-
ing 1395 electors throughout the state.
They were asked which party would re-
ceive their first preference “if a state
election were being held today?” Of
those surveyed, 8 percent didn’t state a
preference.

AGRICULTURE
You may find a thrill on blueberry hill
By WILLA McDONALD
EXOTIC FRUITS are risky business.
Avocados, guavas, macadamias and
lychees have been tried by urban inves-
tors seeking tax breaks and high returns
but rarely have the schemes lived up
to expectations. Inexperience, untried
markets, oversupply and elusive tax de-
ductions have left their bruises.
Now promoters are pushing blue-
berries, small, blue fruit with a taste de-
scribed as a cross between blackberry
and pineapple. Blueberries are popular
as a fresh fruit in North America and
Europe, where they grow wild, but also
appear in pies, jams and ice-cream.
It is the fresh blueberry market both
here and overseas which local pro-
moters are trying to crack.
The name connected most strongly
with blueberries in Australia is Johnson
Farm Management Pty Ltd (JFM), a
company based at Coffs Harbour on the
north coast of NSW. JFM has ad-
vertised extensively in recent months.
One advertisement asks potential in-
vestors: “So why mess about with tax
shelters! Buy a farm ...” It continues:
“Not only do you invest in your own
personal farm in Coffs Harbour’s balmy
sub-tropical climate but $57,000 in-
vested now presents you with
an immediate $48,000 deduc-
tion; with capital gains and
future income.”
The company claims that it
will become Australia’s main
fresh blueberry producer, sup-
plying 60 percent of both the
domestic and export market.
It is establishing 62 blueberry
farms on the Corindi plateau,
about 30 minutes drive north
of Coffs Harbour.
They are part of a cluster
project, a method of farming
which is the brainchild of
JFM managing director Tony
Johnson. His concept is that a
large number of investors
with small adjoining farms
save money and avoid prob-
lems by sharing machinery,
dams and irrigation systems.
For operational and market-
ing purposes, the cluster is
treated as one large farm.
For an initial outlay of
$57,000, rising to between
$77,000 and $87,000 at the end
of the second year, investors
can purchase a blueberry farm
of between 3ha and 9ha
Fresh blueberries for the table: the market the promoters want to build
planted with 1000 blueberry plants. A
further 1500 plants are put in in the sec-
ond year. Most of the farms have the
capacity to expand to 5000 plants.
JFM is committed legally, at the
owner’s option, to provide expertise
and advice for a minimum of 25 years.
Jeremy Morris and Tony Johnson
According to Jeremy Morris, the gener-
al manager, the fee is included in the in-
vestment figure. Company policy is that
no profit should be made from land
transactions. JFM’s role is that of con-
tractor, manager and supervisor.
In 1977, Johnson was approached by
friends who sought his advice on buying
and establishing farms at Coffs Har-
bour. Realising there was a market and
wanting to return to Coffs Harbour, he
sold his Sydney civil engineering busi-
ness and became a farm management
consultant.
Beginning with small, scattered
macadamia plantations he and his
brothers moved on to cluster farming
planting stone fruits between the
macadamia rows to provide early re-
turns on investment. They have estab-
lished 136 macadamia farms in the
Coffs Harbour area, the 62 blueberry
farms are being set up and a further 48
farms are planned mostly under blue-
berry.
Cluster farming is a good idea but
there are still drawbacks to blueberry
farming. Fresh blueberries are virtually
unknown in Australia and the markets
are untried. The small amounts avail-
able have sold quickly, reaching prices
as high as $l2 a kg before last Christ-
mas, the peak sale period, but dropping
to $4 a kg in February.
The Johnsons used the lower figure
to estimate the projected rate of return
of the blueberry farms as 15 percent a
year after eight years. In comparison,
the projected rate of return according to


the Bureau of Agricultural Economics,
which gave blueberries a top investment
potential rating in its Occasional Paper
No 87, is 27 percent a year.
Yet according to both JFM and the
Australian Blueberry Growers Associa-
tion, projected rates of return will de-
pend on the establishment of reliable
domestic and export markets. Nobody
wants to see blueberries go the way of
mangos, guavas or avocados.
Don Broadbent, the chairman of the
Central Coast (NSW) region of the
growers’ association and a member of
the federal board, points out: “It’s no
use us just coming on the market with
blueberries and expecting them to sell.
We need an integrated industry and we
are going to have to create the market. If
we create over-demand we are going to
kill the market just as effectively as if we
grow and don’t sell.”
Australian growers are expected to
produce 35 tonnes of blueberries by the
end of 1984. That is expected to increase
to 250 tonnes in four years. Such a rapid
growth in production should make in-
vestors wary of oversupply.
Rex Sweedman, the principal
horticulturalist, stone and berry fruits,
for the New South Wales Department
of Agriculture, says the more estab-
lished markets for frozen blueberries
are not really available to Australian
growers because of a-current world sur-
plus of berries.
He said the prices on overseas mar-
kets for frozen berries were compara-
tively low, “possibly lower than we
could produce them for.” Frozen Am-
erican blueberries, which are subject to
a minimal tariff, sell for about $l.BO a kg
in Australia.
Australia does have the potential to
tap the more established overseas mar-
kets for fresh blueberries. With the ad-
vantage of producing fruit in the north-
ern hemisphere off-season there are pos-
sible markets in Canada, the Middle
East, Europe and South-East Asia.
According to Broadbent, fear of fruit
fly infestation has prevented Australian
growers from obtaining the necessary
approvals to export to Japan and the
US. Australian growers of varieties
which bear fruit late in the season also
face competition from New Zealand
producers for overseas markets.
Both the growers’ association and
JFM have set up marketing organisa-
tions to tackle these problems. Although
by all accounts the association’s market-
ing arm is performing well, JFM de-
cided to set up its own organisation: the
Australian Blueberry Company Pty
Limited.
Following the New Zealand
kiwifruit marketing example, the
Johnsons decided large amounts of
money were needed to promote
blueberries. The Australian Blueberry
Company will receive $2OOO a farm
from the initial investment plus 10 cents
a kg (on today’s prices) as a pro-
motional levy in subsequent years to put
toward marketing,
According to JFM, this means there
will be $400,000 at the Australian Blue-
berry Company’s disposal in the years
leading up to production.
“Your typical small farmer has small
cash flow and can’t allocate that sort of
money to the association,” said Gary
Prattley, community development co-
ordinator with JFM. The Association
levies 2.5 percent of the wholesale price
for marketing but this means the fruit
must be sold before funds are received
for promotion.
Another potential problem for inves-
tors is obtaining classification as pri-
mary producers for tax purposes, '’inves-
tors must satisfy the Commissioner for
Taxation that their farming activities
amount to a business and these days
that is not easy.
According to a senior taxation offi-
cial, “the commissioner is challenging
all tax avoidance-type arrangements
which includes blueberries.” Whether
investors in blueberries would be eli-
gible for tax benefits, the tax man said,

Tony Johnson (left), Dave Johnson and Frank Johnson transplant a seedling
depended “on the way they structure it
... my initial reaction is to say they are
not.”
But the question is by no means
settled. Johnson said that an officer in
the Sydney branch of the Taxation
Office who inspected the blueberry pro-
ject told him that “... all blueberry
owners who were about to exchange
contracts had been accepted by the de-
partment as being in the business of pri-
mary production.”
The officer had said that the office
“had agreed to give a pre-ruling on the
basis that it would not be used in any
form of advertising.” Johnson said he
had agreed in turn to submit to the office
on July 1 a list of investors who pur-
chased farms before June 30.
The initial investment of $57,000 in
the JFM blueberry scheme includes the
cost of the land but, until the land is
rezoned, investors cannot obtain free-
hold title and are merely tenants in
common.
John Stone, health surveyor, princi-
pal building surveyor and planning offi-
cer with the Ulmarra Shire Council, said
the project was before the Department
of Environment and Planning but the
final decision on rezoning lay with the
minister.
Stone said the council and depart-
ment were wary of people who “never
intend to make any real sort of income
from these properties. That sort of de-
velopment over the years has affected or
colored the thoughts of these officers.”
On the other hand, unemployment
runs high in the Coffs Harbor area and
the JFM blueberry project promises to
create 30 permanent jobs and 230 sea-
sonal jobs. The council also is im-
pressed with JFM’s claim that by the
end of the 1980 s they will have agricul-
tural production of about $4.2 million a
year, doubling the present figure in the
region.
According to Stone, these factors
probably will sway the minister to allow
the rezoning which would then take at
least 18 months.
Diseases and pests are yet another
problem to be taken into account by in-
vestors. Sweedman said that insufficient
long-term experience with blueberries
meant that growers were ignorant of the
problems.
It was discovered only last season
that the crop is subject to fruit fly. It is
not known how much of a problem
Australian birds and flying foxes will be
but many NZ growers have found it es-
sential to net the crop.
Netting would increase considerably
the establishment and maintenance
costs of the farms.
However, Broadbent feels that po-
tential investors could establish blue-
berry farms for less than the amounts
stated by JFM. “I believe a person
could buy the block of land and set it up
much cheaper than this.”
The initial investment of $57,000 in
the JFM blueberry scheme consists of:
$
Land clearing & establishing 1000 plants 11,000
Fencing 1000
Fertiliser 4900
Mulch 4100
Irrigation 18,400
Dam 5200
Drainage 4800
Electricity 2100
Miscellaneous and contingency expenses 5500
An additional $4OOO to $14,000, de-
pending on the farm chosen, is payable
on rezoning to fund electricity reticula-
tion to the house, roadworks and the
extra costs of better-quality house sites.
A further $16,000 is invested in the
second year for 1500 more plants, ad-
ditional irrigation, fertiliser, mulch,
maintenance costs to June 1985 and
miscellaneous expenses.
In the following years, investors face
estimated maximum maintenance costs
of $7900 for:
$
Equipment lease 1500
Equipment running costs 1200
Irrigation running costs 375
Maintenance materials 675
Wages 2250
Supervision 750
Insurance 150
Land rates and administration 300
Service entity charges 700
Broadbent detailed his costs in es-
tablishing his own blueberry farm,
broken down to o.sha planted with 1340
bushes, in a paper he delivered to a sem-
inar at Port Stephens, NSW, in early
June on Successful Blueberry Farming.
Broadbent’s farm is on river flats
which did not need clearing. He made
no attempt to include in his figures the
cost of the land, amortisation of equip-
ment, his personal labor costs or on-go-
ing maintenance or management.
He got quotations for the supply and
installation of an irrigation pump and a
mini-spray for each bush. He was

Broadbent estimated his cost for
each blueberry bush was $14.05. JFM
said their costs were a comparable
$14.68. But JFM’s Morris said there
were fundamental problems with
Broadbent’s comparison:
■ Essentially, he was comparing a
hobby farm approach with professional
commercial production. His basis
assumed that a person would have suit-
able land available with adequate water
supply and that the farmer would have
the time, expertise and desire to under-
take much of the development himself.
■ Broadbent’s figures did not include
the cost of land or the cost of water
storage.
■ JFM’s figures were based on es-
tablishing 2500 plants over two years
and the irrigation system and infrastruc-
ture had the capacity for 5000 plants if
owners wished to expand.
■ JFM used top quality durable irri-
gation equipment and other machinery.
■ JFM’s figures made provision for
construction of access and the provision
of water to each house site.
■ JFM’s figures allowed for the pro-
vision of permanent on-site advice from
horticultural, managerial and mechan-
ical experts.
■ $2OOO from each JFM farm was al-
located to marketing.
Morris said: “It is quite irrational to
compare the development of half a hec-
tare of blueberries on an existing larger
property as the essential fact is that we
are creating a 3 to 4 ha block with free-
hold title and established plantings.”
Blueberry production is a new indus-
try and Margaret Tucker, president of
the association, warns: “There has been
a glossy picture painted and people
have had their fingers burnt in the past.”
If investigators “go ahead willy nilly,
they could get into trouble.” □

Toshiba introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisy wheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-H||HHHH||
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. PerfectR f
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you
most of the features of the other two,
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

American Express interviews Carla Zampatti
“SUCCESS PER SE
IS NOT IMPORTANT,
IT’S THE INDEPENDENCE
IT BRINGS.”
Amongst American Express
Cardmembers today, one finds
the names of people who have
achieved success. Invariably,
they are interesting and well
travelled.
This profile gives insight
into one such person. She
started her company in 1965
and is now one of Australia’s
best-known fashion designers
with twelve retail outlets
throughout Australia.
The first woman to win
the Bulletin/Qantas Business
Woman of the Year Award
talks to American Express.
ARLA ZAMPATTI: An
appealing and attractive
woman. Her manner and
expression are animated and warm.
She is relaxed and comfortably at
ease in the Italianate atmosphere of
her Sydney home.
“Success to me is definitely the
independence it brings. It is the
feeling of freedom and being able to
do what you want with your life and
to direct your business in whichever
way you want without restrictions.
Of course, for your business to
be independent you have to have
independent finance. If you are
reliant on other sources then you find
a subsequent loss of independence.
It’s very important to raise your
own money. Providing your idea is
good and well-planned, the finance
is usually available.
Starting your own business is
always a gamble.
To succeed you must have
determination and single-minded-
ness. You have to decide what it is you
want to do and never be deterred.
“When you have achieved
one goal, move on to the next.”
Once you have started then the
sky’s the limit. It’s like a step ladder.
Start at the bottom and move up to
the next step. That’s very important,
you must never stand still. Achieve
one goal and move on. I think for me
growth is a critical thing. To grow
and succeed.
To do that, you have to have
time to think ahead. It amazes me
how little time some people spend
thinking and planning. Thinking
ahead enables you to foresee prob-
lems and stay in front of them.
When do I have time to think? I
do it all the time. But perhaps my
best thoughts are in a relaxed
situation like weekends.
It is amazing what you can
achieve without the interruptions of
the office. In the office you often
don’t have time to analyse properly. I
have a pad around, and when an idea
occurs I jot it down.
“Travel to me is a very
therapeutic thing.”
Sometimes when I’m travelling
ideas occur. Whoever said travel
broadens one’s mind was very
definitely right. It is not just seeing
different things, people, cultures.
Travel to me is freedom. It’s a release
from daily routine and stimulates
the imagination.
When I travel my mind is
unfettered. It absorbs new thoughts
freshly, clearly. Puts things into per-
spective. To me it is a therapeutic
thing and a very important part of my
life. Success per se is not important.
It’s the independence it brings.
Travel is part of that.
Carla Zampatti on the
American Express Card.
Yes I do have an American
Express Card and I got it for a very
good reason. Early in my career I
once travelled overseas without one.
It taught me a lesson I won’t forget. I
overspent. By the time I got to Rome
I had virtually run out of money. I
can still see the look on the hotel
manager’s face when I told him after
I checked in that I had no money.
I couldn’t even afford to eat. He
finally cashed me an Australian Bank
Cheque. But I felt embarrassed for
the three days I was there. The first

THE ARTS
Arthur Miller the Salesman
comes back to life
Playwright Arthur Miller has known success and failure, acclaim and
condemnation. Right now he is savoring success again and loving
it, as SUSAN ANTHONY reports from New York.
ARTHUR MILLER has had his ups
and downs, a spectacular four-decade
roller coaster ride from international
acclaim to critical and public rejection.
But the playwright is on top again
and loving every minute of it.
“Oh, it’s terrific. Oh, it’s wonderful,”
he says candidly. “You couldn’t ask for
anything more.”
In the past few months, the pendu-
lum of success has swung back in
Miller’s favor. At 68, he is giving his
critics something to think about.
His most famous play, Death of a
Salesman, has just finished a successful
run to packed houses on Broadway with
Dustin Hoffman in the lead role; his
book Salesman in Beijing, about produ-
cing the play in China, has just been
released; and his most recent play, The
American Clock, opened recently in a re-
vised version in Los Angeles.
As well, A View From The Bridge was
received warmly on Broadway last year;
the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas, re-
cently produced his early play All My
Sons-, and Frank Langella, an actor
whose name means big box-office busi-
ness, seems ready to star in a Broadway
production of After The Fall, once dis-
missed as a poor and thinly-veiled ac-
count of Miller’s stormy five-year mar-
riage to Marilyn Monroe.
Miller wrote Death of a Salesman
when he was only 33 and it won him a
Pulitzer Prize. However, his subsequent
plays did not share Salesman’s sensa-
tional success and several were panned
brutally. There were times when he
thought about giving up.
His second-most-popular play, The
Crucible, which opened in 1953 at the
height of the McCarthy era witchhunts,
got him into trouble with the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.
Its pointed attack on the intolerance of
the 17th century Salem witchhunts did
not amuse his anti-communist accusers.
The experience convinced him that
“whatever psychological security one
has had better come from within be-
cause the social support for it is very
chancy.”
In Death Of A Salesman (l to r): John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, Stephen Lang as
photographed by Miller’s wife Inge Morath
In addition, at that time, the drama
of social realism Miller’s drama
was being swept aside by the more mod-
ern work of writers such as Edward
Albee and Samuel Beckett. “For a while
there I felt pretty lonely,” Miller recalls.
In 1964, after a nine-year spell of in-
activity, After the Fall was produced. It
did almost as much damage to his play-
wright’s reputation as had his highly-
publicised marriage to Monroe which
broke up a year and a half before her
suicide in 1962.
More recently, The American Clock
was dismissed on Broadway and closed
after only 12 performances although its
production at the 1980 Spoleto Festival
won rave reviews.
Miller has weathered the storms. He
never thought he could make a living as
a playwright but he did. “My plays are
done all over the world, all the time, and
that’s how I’ve managed to stay afloat,”
he says. The success has enabled him to
buy a retreat a rambling farmhouse in
the wooded countryside of Connecticut,
just outside New York, where he lives
quietly with his wife, photographer Inge
Morath, who married him a year after
Monroe got her divorce.
Both practise their professions on the
property Miller in a wood cabin on a
hill near the house and Morath in a
photo lab she has set up in the barn.
“I’ve always loved the country,” Miller
says. “Never wrote a play in the city. I
don’t know what it is. Just a deep con-
nection with the country.”
Miller is a passionate carpenter and
has created many of the wooden fur-
nishings in the house. As Willy’s son
Biff says in Death of a Salesman : “A
carpenter is allowed to whistle.” (When
Miller wrote Salesman he used to iden-
tify more with Biff, the rebellious son,
than with Willy. Now, with children of
his own, he says he has “crossed the line
from Biff to Willy.”)
Like Willy and most of the charac-
ters about whom he writes, Miller
nourishes a dream though not the
American Dream he takes to task in his
work. He longs to see a national theatre
supported by a system of government
subsidies, that would nurture and sup-
port artists.
“We have no real theatre,” he says.
“We have shows, which isn’t really the
same thing. And I can say this now, in
possession of a hit of phenomenal pro-


portions, that it isn’t healthy. It’s wrong
that for a show to be a hit it has to be
sold out. The theatre can be healthy
when a play can run half or two-thirds
full.
“When I came into the theatre, it was
a rare thing that you went in and it was
full. Now, if you’ve got four empty seats
unbought, you know your time has
come.
“The number of elements that have
to go into a hit would break a computer
down. It has to be the right season for
that play, the right historical moment,
the right tonality. And think of the
chances of getting the right person it
depends on who’s available, on whom
the director may have seen or at what
dinner party he might have been and
heard of a certain person. This is why
the theatre is so endlessly fascinating
it’s so accidental. It’s so much like life.”
Miller’s life was moulded perma-
nently by his experiences in the Der
pression. As a teenager he witnessed the
1929 crash and its effects on his family,
friends and the people around him. His
father, a Jewish Austrian immigrant
who had become successful in New
York, went broke. To make enough
money to continue his education, Miller
worked at menial jobs. In The American
Clock he tries to come to grips with the
period.
“Being a Jew of a certain kind, you
developed an attitude,” he says. “If you
were going to survive, you were going to
have to work at it. Well, I think that
becomes part of your personality. I
dunno. Maybe that’s some of it.”
Miller recalls that the Depression
created a dangerous psychological at-
mosphere. “People were desperate for a
dollar. They had to be. They were
clawing at one another.” In addition, he
was influenced deeply by the feeling
that an individual’s effect on his fate
was limited.
“Suddenly you looked around and
you were all in the same boat, whether
you’d been honest or dishonest, whether
you’d worked or you hadn’t worked.
That was something that got completely
cast aside by the time the great boom
years began, the 50s and the 605.”
It left Miller with an abiding interest
in sanity and survival. “It’s part of san-
ity to remember what happened the day
before yesterday. Life is finally a
story, isn’t it? First this happens, then
that happens and then the other thing.
But we lose sight of the idea that the
pigeons come home to roost.
“But it catches up with you. From the
start, my plays have been about that:
finding the hidden system that rules us.
How can you adjust life so that you
don’t get clouted in the neck when you
make the wrong step? I’m still at it.”
Still at it and, right now at least, ad-
justing very well. □


‘Our agent in Los Angeles can easily
arrange that regional conference for you.
fll tell him to expect you.’
That was
most welcome
news for me.
The truth is I had been a little nervous
about setting up such a meeting. I had
imagined having to make a number
of phone calls and quite possibly a lot
of wasted time. After all, Los Angeles
is a big city and, as an individual,
I could hardly expect a big reception.
So what a relief it was when my
ANZ Business Travel consultant took
the whole problem off my hands and
turned a potential ‘Sorry too busy’
into a ‘Welcome to LA for me.

AUSTRALIANA
Doing the right thing by Napoleon
Sydney, 1803: a French engraving showing “the capital of the English colonies in Australia, at the mouth of the Parramatta river”
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
IF GEOGRAPHICAL place names fol-
lowed the same rules as those which ap-
ply to the naming of plant and animal
species, the good citizens of South Aus-
tralia and Victoria would be extremely
confused. It is a rule of scientific taxon-
omy that the discoverer who first de-
scribes and names a species takes pre-
cedence over any later names applied,
even though these may have become
commonly used in the interim.
A book on the French exploration of
Australia, just published in London,
will re-open the early 19th century con-
troversy on place names along the Aus-
tralian coast. At that time, the country
between South Australia’s Streaky Bay
and Victoria’s Wilson’s Promontory
was named by French explorers (in hon-
or of their patron) Terre Napoleon.
Spencer Gulf was Golfe Bonaparte and
St Vincent Gulf, on which Adelaide
stands, was Golfe Josephine.
Many Australians do not realise that
a French expedition led by Nicolas
Baudin charted this coast, including
Kangaroo Island (which they named lie
Deeres ), during a scientific expedition
which attracted immense interest in the
salons of Napoleonic Paris. And the
man who emerged as the scientific lead-
er of the expedition Francois Peron
was the first to publish charts and ac-
counts of the exploration of much of the
Australian coast, which should have
given these names priority.
British navigator Matthew Flinders
explored much of the same region, in
Investigator , at about the same time. The
parties met in Encounter Bay, which is a
name they agreed on. But Flinders,
somewhat unfairly detained by the
Le Wombat: phascolomys wombat, as captured by Francois Peron
French on his way home, was not to
publish until years later.
For political and ethnic reasons, the
Flinders nomenclature prevailed and
Australian books treat the Baudin expe-
dition as little more than a footnote. As
the Australian Encyclopedia notes: “The
publication of Flinders’s A Voyage To
Terra Australis, together with the defeat
of Napoleon, put an end to these
claims.”
Even so, the French left many names
on the coast and also described species
of plants and flowers which bear their
nomenclature to this day.
The new book in Britain (The Lost
Australia Of Francois Per on, by Colin
Wallace, Nottingham Court Press)
available on order from the publisher
for about $25 sets out to set the record
straight. It focuses on Pe'ron and,
through him, on the achievements of the
Baudin expedition which was ill-fated
through what appears to have been the
commander’s incompetence.
But The Lost Australia provides a
long-overdue re-assessment of the
French exploration which was signifi-
cant but overlooked by colonial attach-
ment to all things British.
There was a strong French interest in
the exploration of Australia. Louis de
Bougainville’s 18th-century voyages
created great interest in pre-revolution-
ary France. After him came La Perouse
who surprised Governor Arthur
Phillip’s First Fleet by turning up in
Port Jackson only days after Phillip had
landed his convicts and soldiers. La Per-
ouse arrived in Botany Bay on January
26, 1788 a coincidence which hope-
fully will be remembered in bicentenary
activities. The French explorer was to
vanish on his way home and his fate
obsessed the French for decades.
The interest remained alive through

the revolution and the days of terror
which followed. The return of stability
with the accession of Napoleon
Bonaparte brought a revival of scien-
tific, cultural and social life. Napoleon,
it turned out, had a secret fascination
about Australia and, although he had
embarked on the wars which altered the
face of Europe, he found time to spon-
sor a purely scientific expedition to the
mysterious southern continent.
Peron flowered during this period.
He had volunteered for the revolution-
ary army as a youth and, in battles and
sieges against German states, was
promoted to sergeant before being
wounded severely and captured. He was
invalided out at the age of 20, worked
briefly as an official and then, with the
sponsorship of a rich man in his home
town, went to medical school at the
newly-named Sorbonne in Paris. He be-
came an avid student of the natural sci-
ences and quickly established a name
for himself. When he heard about the
expedition, his influential friends
secured him a berth.
Peron’s quality of leadership, which
he had demonstrated in the army, was
honed during the four-year Baudin voy-
age. He emerged as the scientific leader
and took virtual command on the way
home when Baudin died at Mauritius.
Back in Paris, although Napoleon had
moved on to other enthusiasms (and
disasters) and official interest had
cooled, Peron played the major part in
having the botanical and zoological col-
lections classified properly and put into
order for study and in having the ac-
counts of the voyage and the charts pub-
lished.
He had not been a well man. His
wounds and the ordeals of the voyage
weakened him even further. Peron died
of tuberculosis at the age of 36. He re-
mains a scientific hero in France. But, as
Wallace points out, he is almost un-
known in the English-speaking world.
To a modern reader, the interest in
Peron lies in his realisation that the
Le Kangourou Oualabat,
as seen by the French
Echidna Australis: an engraving published in Paris after the Baudin expedition
complete natural environment is the key
to studies of plants and animals and
their associations. He had a feeling for
what we call ecology and pleaded for
the conservation of plants and animals
which even then he believed were rare
and threatened.
Napoleon’s patronage had assured
Baudin of two ships Geographe and
Naturaliste for the expedition which
left in 1800 to carry out his mission of
exploring the western and southern
coasts of Australia. Baudin was not a
good choice as commander; he was er-
ratic, issued confusing orders and then
failed to carry them out himself and also
seemed to have the sort of traveller’s im-
patience of the long-distance car driver
who just wants to press on and never
stop. On a couple of occasions, he went
close to abandoning members of his ex-
pedition who had been landed on the
West Australian coast for studies and
who were only hours late for the agreed
rendezvous.
The expedition made its Australian
landfall on the south-western coast of
Western Australia which carries the
names Baudin bestowed Geographe
Bay and Cape Naturaliste
near what has become the
town of Busselton.
Winter was approaching
and Baudin, who had clear in-
structions from Napoleon first
to chart the southern coastline
of Australia, ignored his or-
ders and sailed north towards
Shark Bay. It was late May
1801 and Baudin was wary of
the southern storms. But the
fact remains that the southern
coast was largely unknown.
Flinders had been commis-
sioned to explore it but was
still in Britain (he was to de-
part on July 17 from Spit-
head). Had Baudin stuck to
his orders, the priority of the
discoveries would have been undis-
puted and the reputation of the expedi-
tion made.
What was even stranger was
Baudin’s action in making a rendezvous
for his command ship, Geographe, to
meet the slower Naturaliste at Rottnest
Island. The seas were rough and Baudin
ignored the rendezvous and sailed north
alone.
However, during this first landfall,
Peron began the first of his many studies
of Aborigines.
Wallace lays claim for Baudin to be
recognised as “the father of anthro-
pology.” Certainly his work with Abor-
igines in many parts of Australia can be
regarded as one of the first anthropo-
logical studies, encompassing the physi-
cal characteristics as well as social struc-
tures, culture and the assessment of ar-
tefacts.
Later in the voyage, when
Geographe was in Tasmanian waters,
Peron’s records of Tasmanian Aborigi-
nes provided a valuable record of the
people whom he liked and got on well
with but who were to be wiped out by
British settlers within a few decades.
It was in June and July 1801 that
Geographe made its way through the
tricky waters off the central West Aus-
tralian coast where the Dutch had been
and where many had come to grief.
Baudin entered Shark Bay through
Geographe Channel. The party landed
on Bernier Island where Peron and his
fellow scientists studied plants and ani-
mals, including the huge jellyfish of that
region.
Peron, in his enthusiasm for the
strange and new, captured wallabies.
He was confident they could be bred as
a food animal and described their meat
as having a flavor much like the wild
rabbit of his home province in France.
The expedition moved on slowly,
charting the islands and reefs and fin-
ishing up in Bonaparte Gulf. Water

supplies were low, food was stale and
running out and scurvy was rampant.
So Geographe headed for Kupang in
Dutch Timor.
In September, Naturaliste turned up
there, with its officers and scientists
somewhat worried as to why Geographe
had not kept the Rottnest rendezvous.
The second ship had spent three months
there, putting the time to good use in
charting the Swan River region and the
coast to the north.
On November 12 the rest period at
Timor ended and the expedition sailed
south. Illness had begun to take a heavy
toll of scientists and crew and many
deaths occurred as the ships ran down
the Roaring Forties to Van Diemen’s
Land. They made many contacts with
the Tasmanian Aborigines and sailed
around the island, stopping at smaller
islands on the way.
After more mishaps and a second
separation of the two ships, Geographe
began the long-postponed exploration
of the coastline west of Wilson’s Prom-
ontory. On almost the first day, on April
8, the French ship came across Flinders
in Encounter Bay. Flinders sailed on
east to Sydney and the French began
exploration to the west. The survey of
South Australia’s coasts had been com-
pleted some 12 weeks later and Baudin
in turn decided to head for Sydney for
rest and refit. Inexplicably, he headed
south around Tasmania adding to the
crew’s misery through the extra weeks
this took.
Geographe by this time was in piti-
able condition. It reached the entrance
to Port Jackson but the winds were un-
favorable and the ship’s crew was not
able to bring it into the nearby port.
Governor King eventually sent a ship
out to help bring the distressed French
vessel in to rejoin Naturaliste, which
had arrived first, and Investigator which
also was in port.
The French spent six months in the
infant town of Sydney and left to re-
sume exploration of the Tasmanian
coast. King heard a rumor that they
planned to start a settlement there and
hurriedly sent after them a small ship
which carried out before the eyes of the
startled French a ceremony affirming
the British possession of Tasmania. The
French sent back a message declaring
that their interest was purely scientific
and the Sydney party returned.
Baudin had sent Naturaliste back to
France by this time and had bought a
smaller, locally built vessel, Casuarina,
for coastal exploration. On January 2,
1803, they reached Kangaroo Island.
While the scientists studied animals and
plants ashore, Baudin sent Casuarina to
explore the main South Australian
gulfs.
Again he betrayed his characteristic
impatience. He put a time limit of three
weeks on the exploration. On the 21st
day, when Casuarina hadn’t shown up,
he started to depart amid near-mutiny
among his crew and the scientists who
were shocked at abandoning their com-
rades. Fortunately, after they had been
at sea a few hours, Casuarina appeared
behind them.
Both ships sailed on to King
George’s Sound, near the site of today’s
town of Albany. They then reached the
path of the initial voyage to Timor, on
the way coming across a Malay fishing
fleet which recorded for the first time
in European annals the Malay contact
with Australia.
Baudin made one more attempt to
resume exploration of northern Austra-
lia, after another rest at Timor. But
again illness struck and he turned
Geographe round, heading for home.
When Baudin died at Mauritius, Peron
was instrumental in leading the survi-
vors home.
The party expected a heroes’ wel-
come. But Napoleon’s military fortunes
had changed in the four years they had
been away and the brief cultural flower-
ing of 1800 had been forgotten.
It was a hard task to complete the
work of the expedition, sorting out the
records and collections and getting pub-
lication of the material. Peron threw
himself into this effort which was to oc-
cupy him until his death in December
1810.
Had he lived, perhaps Pe'ron’s un-
doubted scientific ability and drive
would have made him much more
prominent in the English-speaking
world as well as the French. But it was
typical of the tragedy of the mis-
managed Baudin expedition, the ignor-
ing of orders and the impatience of the
commander that Baudin’s explorations
were made too late and are virtually
unrecognised. Wallace’s book helps re-
dress the balance. But the harsh fact is
that honors in science and exploration,
as much as in war, go to the victors who
can make their claims stick. The French
could not and, but for a scattering of
names, left little to show for what
started out as a sacred endeavor. □

Disaster
from a
‘committee’
Patience (Marilyn Allen) in The Boiling Frog: a model of common sense
BRANCO GAICA
By BRIAN HOAD
DESPITE the recent popular spectacle
of Boy George skipping around the
country precipitating unbridled scenes
of hermaphroditic frenzy, the Australia
Council is going to persist with, indeed
insist on, the sexual democratisation of
the arts.
The council’s latest document on the
subject is entitled Women in the Arts: A
Strategy for Action. It gives warning that
over the next five years all major arts’
organisations must be seen to have de-
veloped equal opportunities for women
at every level and in every area or
else.
Although women dominate such
areas as dance and crafts, no draconian
action is as yet being considered to
force more men to take up ballet or bas-
ket-weaving.
The male chauvinist world of music
is the area for most immediate concern.
To be sure, through the natural course
of events, women and men are now
more or less equally represented when it
comes to the performance of classical
music. But the council is not prepared
to wait for the natural course of events
in other fields. It has investigated the
entire spectrum of musical perfor-
mance, including rock, and discovered
a disgraceful imbalance in which
women make up a mere 15 percent of
the work force.
Boy George and the emergence of
hermaphroditic rock in general has cer-
tainly thrown up extra difficulties in
sorting out this inequitable situation
but, if needs be, the council can resort to
steroid tests to sort the girls from the
boys and ensure that its required quotas
are being satisfied.
The Australia Council’s sexist ap-
proach to the arts first came into public
prominence in 1981 when it provided
$107,000 to set up a women-in-theatre
project centred on Sydney’s Nimrod
Theatre. With women making up 46
percent of the acting force and 31 per-
cent of directors and designers, theatre
was by no means the most sexually im-
balanced area of the arts. The stage,
however, proved particularly attractive
as a soap-box for the militants involved.
They took advantage of it. The re-
sults of that tumultuous experiment
threw Nimrod into a state of financial
and artistic chaos and little else of dra-
matic interest was achieved.
Now, just as it seemed the company
was settling down again, up pops The
Boiling Frog, a new work by Alison
Lyssa who last left her mark on Nimrod
back in 1981 with Pinball, a shouting
match for a couple of lesbian mothers
embroiled in bitter argument over child
custody.
The Boiling Frog takes on a broader
theme. It attempts to explore the uses
and abuses of technology through the
eyes of a team of time travellers whose
itinerary includes the Great Plague of
London, an explosive coal mine of the
Industrial Revolution and a faulty nu-
clear reactor of the present day. They
try to lighten their burden of socio-
scientific concern with song and dance
along the way.
The three leading characters are
women: Joan (Susannah Fowle), a
dreamy idealist; Sally (Madelaine
Blackwell) a happy-go-lucky whore;
and Patience (Marilyn Allen), a model
of common sense.
They take a male with them, a lusty,
good-natured fool called Tom (Tom
Considine).
And to make up the correct numbers,
according to the dictates of the Austra-
lia Council, a couple of wicked modern
male scientists (Peter Collingwood and
Robert Morgan) are dragged into the
action from time to time.
The Australia Council also will be
pleased to note that the director is male
(John Bell) and his assistant, female
(Alison Summers); the stage designer,
female (Anny Evason) and the lighting
designer, male (James Henson); the
composer, male (John Shortis) and
the choreographer, female (Chrissie
Koltai).
Despite such ideological correctness,
everybody concerned is seen to bog
down from the start in the self-con-
scious earnestness of the writing and the
grotesque contrivances of the plot.
A little insight into the ensuing the-
atrical disaster is provided by play-
wright Lyssa who takes up two pages of
the program to thank a host of helpers,
including members of her “writers’
group” who aided her creative struggle.
It seems that neither the women-in-
theatre movement nor the Australia
Council nor even Nimrod itself is aware
that, despite endless efforts in such
places as Russia or China to prove
otherwise, art cannot be created by
committee. □


Having an ordinary personal computer in your
business is about as efficient as having to share one pencil.
After all, a computer is just another office tool. And
waiting in line to use it is doing no one any good. Least of
all you.
That’s why we have developed the new ICL Personal
Computer.
It handles four people at once. So you could have your
secretary working on the word processor, your accountant
running a spread sheet, your storeroom handling the
inventory, and the sales department filling an order. All at
the same time, without waiting or confusion.
Really, it’s a very simple concept. But it took ICL to
make it work.
You see, ICL is Europe’s leading, and one of Australia’s
major, computer companies. And over the years, we’ve
gained an enviable reputation as a mainframe expert.
ICL have designed computer systems for organisations
like Woolworths, the Swan Brewery and Parliament House,

Indy’s back
and pace still
a cracker
By SANDRA HALL
CRITICAL RESPONSE to Indiana
Jones And The Temple Of Doom has so
far implied the worst that Steven
Spielberg’s audacity has turned to
blood, gore and sensationalism; that he
is no longer witty, merely
mechanical; and that young
children see Indiana Jones at
the risk of suffering a week’s
nightmares a warning that
has done nothing to deter
audiences in America where
the film did more than $lOO
million business in its first
four weeks of general release.
So, what’s all the fuss
about? Is it a case of over-re-
action or has Spielberg really
lost his sense of humor, along
with his flair, and settled for
horror instead of thrills?
For me, there’s no argu-
ment. As Spielberg says, this
new Indiana Jones adventure
is no Temple of Roses. None-
theless, its breakneck pace, its
hints of impending tragedy
(never quite realised), its won-
derfully overblown scale and
its ability to keep the frissons
coming all confirm an awe-
some ingenuity of Spielberg and pro-
ducer George Lucas as mythmakers ex-
traordinary. Like all mythmakers worth
the label, they know how to revive old
tales with new tricks. They also know
what made them memorable in the first
place.
Indiana Jones And The Temple Of
Doom has drawn criticism because it’s
about children children stolen from
their parents by a wicked tyrant to work
in a treasure mine. Echoes of the Pied
Piper of Hamelin, the children’s cru-
sades and of Dickens. There is, too, the
much-talked-about human sacrifice
scene in which a heart is plucked from a
chest in the manner of old Saturday
afternoon serials about invented South
American Indian tribes a scene which
all those indignant descriptions don’t
really describe at all since there is more
magic in it than blood and gore. It is all
sleight of hand even the victim looks
more amazed than pained and there is
none of the shocking suddenness of the
climactic face-melting scene in Raiders
Of The Lost Ark.
The violence of the action may be
more sustained this time but it’s also less
explicit more a matter of hints and
associations, all of them reinforced by
the fact of the kidnapped children and
their grieving parents.
But all this makes the film sound
much more serious than it’s meant to
be; above all, it’s a perfectly chor-
eographed romp with no pauses for
thought. From the opening sequence,
which introduces Harrison Ford’s co-
star, Kate Capshaw (in a neatly
deadpan performance as a dizzy
blonde) singing Anything Goes in
Chinese in a Shanghai nightclub, the
speed never slackens. And those who
would argue that such speed signifies a
Harrison Ford in Temple of Doom: heroic in spite of himself
lack of wit would also be taking every-
thing very literally and ignoring the fact
that each cliff-hanger is in itself a
beautifully designed bit of burlesque.
It is not merely Spielberg’s way with
car chases, crash landings and encoun-
ters with broken bridges across yawning
chasms; it’s his instinct for inflating
movie cliches to precisely the right pro-
portions. Timing is part of it and a
perfectly pitched sense of the outra-
geous.
The rest is a matter of scale, together
with a conviction as to film’s ability to
turn dreams into visions. It’s as if
Spielberg were entering into a con-
spiracy with his audience. He conjures
up all the terrors of childhood in a form
spectacular enough to acknowledge
their potency even as it laughs at them.
And in Ford’s Indiana Jones, with
his doggedness, his battered looks, his
snake phobia and his way of losing
every second fight, he has found the per-
fect guide through these terrors fal-
lible, irascible and heroic in spite of
himself.
THAT OTHER Hollywood specialist in
the art of the blockbuster, Francis
Coppola has moved lately in very differ-
ent directions from Lucas and Spiel-
berg. His new film, Rumblefish (seen
during the festival season and now in
commercial release), is a bleak tribute to
the “teenage rebel” films of the 50s, shot
in black and white and drenched in
“style” another exercise in film for
film’s sake by a director so fascinated
with the history of cinema that all other
considerations have to fit as best they
can.
Like The Outsiders, Coppola’s pre-
vious film, the story is by the popular
American author of books for “young
people” S. E. Hiton and it’s
about the relationship be-
tween two brothers The
Motor Cycle Boy (Mickey
Rourke), a former gang war
hero past his prime, and
Rusty-James (Matt Dillon)
who is trying to fight his way
to a reputation as large as his
brother’s.
In one of the many echoes
of the 50s, Dennis Hopper is
the boys’ deadbeat father.
And Stephen H. Burnum’s
high-contrast black and white
photography harks even fur-
ther back, to the 40s.
The theme is that old
favorite, the difficulty of es-
caping your origins.
The Motor Cycle Boy, ren-
dered slightly deaf by old
wounds and wholly color-
blind as well (hence the black
and white) knows that it’s too
late for himself but he has
hopes for Rusty-James whose predica-
ment is symbolised by the rumblefish of
the title Siamese fighting fish which
will attack even their own reflections.
Photographed in color as flashes of
blue and red against the monochrome
(presumably as an expression of their
suicidal vitality), they ceaselessly circle
the tanks of the local petshop.
If they can reach the river, The
Motor Cycle Boy reasons simplistically,
they’ll be all right and all that pent-up
anger will be just a bad memory.
The parallel is obvious and as el-
egant as the rest of the film. But all the
elegance doesn’t disguise it’s being cold
and academic, as well. □

Skellig Michael, County Kerry: from A Writer’s Ireland, a landscape in literature by William Trevor
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
A Writer’s Ireland, by William
Trevor. Thames & Hudson, $29.95.
A SEQUEL to Margaret Drabble’s A
Writer's Britain, in a sense, A Writer’s
Ireland is a beautiful but somehow mel-
ancholy book too heavy to be taken in
a rucksack on tour, although it might
raise the spirits as effectively as a glass
of brandy after a day of small churches
and large ruins. It is, perhaps, an ideal
book to be read while seated in a canvas
chair on a sunny afternoon when the
journey is over and the people and
places half-forgotten.
This is not a scissors and paste book
but a thorough search into the relation-
ship between Irish landscape and Irish
writing from the time of the sunny-na-
tured Giraldus Cambrensis who led the
literary way in the 12th century as the
first commentator to record an appreci-
ation of Irish landscape that sought to
include every aspect of his subject and
even extended to a landscape of people,
to John Millington Synge, Yeats, James
Joyce, Oliver St John Gogarty, Kate
O’Brien (but not Edna) Benedict Kiely,
Elizabeth Bowen, Frank O’Connor. It
even takes in Somerville and Ross, two
women writers of Castletownshend and
Ross House in Galway whose Experi-
ences Of An Irish RM made a recent
television series on the ABC.
Trevor is better known to his devoted
fans as a novelist author of, among
others, The Children Of Dynmouth, The
Ballroom Of Romance, Beyond The Pale
and Fools Of Fortune, his latest, re-
viewed recently in these pages. Trevor is
not at all sentimental. He does not go in
for Irish mist or “faery.”
The first two chapters include poems
by anonymous authors translated from
the original Gaelic and stories of chiefly
contests often between men and
women and bulls and horses.
As in Greek mythology, blood
abounds in these early stories and bal-
lads. They were transcribed by monks,
some of them in The Book Of The Dun
Cow, in the 12th century.
It was in that century that the
Normans moved from their occupation
of Wales to lay the foundations of what
was to become England’s Ireland. There
were to be 800 years of conquest and
colonisation, during which the
Normans lost their identity and were to
be replaced by the adventuring Tudors,
bickering Stuarts and then by
Cromwell’s men whose puritanism was
further purified in Irish bloodbaths.
In the 18th century, the English aris-
tocracy and gentry attempted to tame
the Irish landscape with gardens and
the 19th century brought the first of the
tourists from the United States, Canada
and Australia seeking romantic ancestry
or simply remembering songs their
mothers sang at the piano. □
A cry for
help from
Russia’s Jews
By EDMUND CAMPION
The Jews of Hope: The Plight of
Soviet Jewry Today, by Martin
Gilbert. Macmillan, London,
$17.95.
WHEN Bill Hayden was in Moscow,
one of the questions he raised was the
problem of Soviet Jews who wish to
emigrate to Israel. More than 380,000
have invitations to go. But they cannot
get permission from the Soviet author-
ities to leave.
The worst pressed of them are the
10,000 refuseniks who have applied for
visas and will not give up trying despite
official refusals of their applications.
They learn Hebrew hopefully, and im-
merse themselves in Jewish history.
More and more of them take up Jewish
religious practices. They give their chil-
dren Hebrew names.
Their Jewishness is a growing bond
between them.
Soviet officials try to break their will
by taunting them with the fear that they
will never get out; one of them has been
waiting for his exit visa for 18 years. The
secret police tail them. They are jailed
on bogus charges. Their meetings are
broken up. Their mail is intercepted and
their books confiscated. Still they con-
tinue to hope.

Churchill, Martin Gilbert himself a

Jew travelled last year to the Soviet
Union to make contact with them.
Jews are discovering their identity
under the heavy hand of the Soviet
state. In Leningrad, Gilbert is taken on
a guided tour by Mikhail Beizer who
uses the buildings of that loveliest of cit-
ies to tell the story of Jewish life in
Czarist Russia. Beizer used to take
groups of 20 or more on his historical
tours but the police have stopped that.
Gilbert meets Evgeni Lein, a doctor
of technical services, who served a year
in Siberia after police broke up a lecture
on the relevance of the Jewish sabbath.
He was charged with kicking a police-
man. Back in Leningrad, Lein works as
a stoker in a boilerhouse. He still hopes
to get to Israel one day.
These are the heroic people about
whom Gilbert writes. It is clear that
their adversities have only toughened
their determination. Despite difficulties,
their assiduity in learning about their
Jewish heritage is remarkable. Soviet
brutishness is making their Jewishness
firmer. In an unfriendly world, they are
proud to be known as Jews. □

Movement
toward a
black solution
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Something Out There, by Nadine
Gordimer. Jonathan Cape, $21.95.
IT IS difficult to know what readers
might feel when coming to the South
African writer Nadine Gordimer for the
first time, at this stage of her work. They
might want more from her than this
spare prose some kind of concession,
perhaps, rather than to be left to them-
selves to fill in background of the
characters while the author simply pro-
ceeds with the story. But those who have
been reading her work for years eight
novels and, with this book, eight collec-
tions of short stories will have ab-
sorbed her attitudes, have acquired a
bank of knowledge of the urban blacks
and whites about whom she writes.
Gordimer had a limited number of
devoted readers in Australia when she
visited Adelaide a few years ago as a
guest of the Festival of the Arts but she
made a strong impression when, early in
Writers Week, she delivered a lecture on
what it was like to be a dissenting writer
in the political climate of South Africa.
The house was full with the then
premier, Don Dunstan, in the chair. He
fielded written questions from the audi-
ence and read them out for her re-
sponse. I can’t off-hand think of another

premier, then or now, who would do the
same.
The stories in her latest collection are
not all directly about what it is like to
live in South Africa but they are all
about pressure even the least interest-
ing story, which takes the form of a let-
ter from Kafka’s father to Kafka setting
a few things right.
A City Of The Dead, A City Of The
Living is about a family compromised
by the visit of a man who is either a ter-
rorist or has escaped from prison; in At
The Rendezvous Of Victory a black gen-
eral, hero to his countrymen and free-
dom fighter, is given a token portfolio
when his friends take over government
and revenges himself in his own jolly
way; Blinder is about a black servant
who loses her lover; Correspondence
Course, on a theme to make your blood
run cold, traces the effects of a well-
meaning woman’s interest in a jailed
dissident; the lover in Crimes Of Con-
science has reasons other than passion
for taking his girl to bed; in Sins Of The
Third Age the most pessimistic of the
stories a couple married 40 years sud-
denly confront one another; Rags And
Bones is also not distinctly African a
woman finds love letters exchanged be-
tween two unnamed celebrated people
and tries to trace them; Terminal is,
as the title may suggest, about radical
surgery.
Something Out There is the outstand-
ing story in the collection and the
longest. It is in this story that Gordimer
presents her view of the slow, inevitable
movement of her country toward a
black solution.
There are parallel movements; one
quite comic, the other deadly serious. A
boy in the family swimming pool sees a
mysterious animal in a tree. He takes a
picture but it is for blurred movement.
Partners in an illicit love affair are
startled by scratchings at a window, a
policeman’s wife loses a haunch of ven-
ison hanging in her kitchen, golfers en-
counter an unidentified intruder in the
bushes. The Johannesburg papers re-
port a panther, a wild cat, a baboon
“something out there.”
Meanwhile, a respectable young
couple have taken a house in an outer
suburb and are harboring two blacks
who have no papers and no identity.
They accumulate a stock of hand gren-
ades, limpet mines, guns and take them
all to a cave near a power station.
The two whites and one black vanish
and the baboon is shot by a householder
and lies rotting in a lane. But there is
still “something out there.”
To read Gordimer’s novels and
stories is to read past and present his-
tory related in her bare, elegant, almost
chilly style. When the news headlines
about South Africa fail to move us, her
stories will. □

Let’s hear it for the ancien riche
by Patrcia Rolfe
IF YOU are feeling tres riche, why not
buy a copy of Abrams’s facsimile
edition of Les Tres Riches Heures du
Due de Berry at $7950 a copy?
Macmillan are Australian agents for the
US publisher and are confident that
they can sell as many copies, to libraries
and collectors, as they are allotted by
the publisher. Print run, however, is
only 980 copies and Macmillan think
the English-speaking countries will
share only about 350. Macmillan expect
to have their copies around October and
are asking for a deposit of $BOO with
customer orders.
Les Tres Riches Heures, a book of
hours illustrated beautifully by Pol de
Limburg and his brothers in the first
decades of the 15th century, was the fi-
nal flowering of Jean de Berry’s patron-
age. This edition was prepared by Fac-
simile Editions of Switzerland. Special-
ist craftspeople did the lettering, the
capitals, the application of four kinds of
gold and silver. Accompanying the
book is an unillustrated translation of
the Latin text. Abrams will take Les Tres
Riches Heures on its own publicity tour
of the US, holding receptions in its hon-
or. Macmillan suggest you get in early.
The price will rise to $9450 next June, if
copies remain.
THE DEATH of American playwright
Lillian Heilman will mean the end of
her battle with writer Mary McCarthy
which was shaping up into one of the
longest and nastiest literary lawsuits of
recent years. Heilman had only recently
won the first round of her $2.5 million
libel suit against McCarthy, based on
what McCarthy is alleged to have said
on a TV talk show more than four years
ago.
McCarthy is alleged to have said that
Heilman was “tremendously overrated,
a bad writer, a dishonest writer” and,
for good measure, to have added,
“Every word she writes is a lie, inclu-
ding ‘and’ and ‘the’.” McCarthy had
asked the court to dismiss the suit, argu-
ing that her statements were expressions
of opinion about a public figure. The
judge ruled that to call someone dis-
honest went beyond what he called “the
marketplace of ideas.” He also ruled
that Heilman was not in law a “public
figure.”
Heilman, during the Joseph
McCarthy period when she was black-
listed following her forthright evidence
before the Un-American Activities
Committee, was indeed a public figure.
WHY WOULD a longish Italian novel,
set in a 14th century Franciscan friary,
rush to the top of the paperback best-
seller lists in The New York Times and
Publishers Weekly. Umberto Eco’s The

fixed there, which is nice for Picador
which will release it here in late Sep-
tember.

Name of the Rose for The Bulletin last
February he saw its merits but decided it
was in many ways a flashy book. But
Heinemann, agents for publishers
Seeker and Warburg, say the hardcover
book did well here and they had to re-
order.
“It was all word of mouth,” said a
spokesperson. “For a while you
couldn’t go to a dinner party in Sydney
unless you had read it.” Well, let’s not
say “read” it; to have heard of it would
have done.
Umberto Eco was the star of the re-
cent American Publishers’ Association
conference, with his US publishers War-
ners staging a lavish reception at the
Italian ambassador’s residence. A repre-
sentative of the huge Italian publisher
Mondadori said at the conference that
Eco’s success had made it easier to sell
any Italian book in the US and
Mondadori isn’t even Eco’s publisher.

Olympic gold: our best
chances in Los Angeles
The withdrawal of the Eastern bloc countries from the Los Angeles Olympics has
greatly enhanced Australia's medal chances. LENORE NICKLIN tells who are
the best prospects.
BLESSED and farewelled by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke, Australia’s 250-
strong Olympic team is in Los Angeles
wearing gold and preparing to win it. At
the previous Los Angeles Olympics, in
1932, Joe Lyons was prime minister and
only 12 were in the Australian team.
Their medal-winning record, however,
was outstanding; they quarried three
gold, one silver and one bronze.
With the withdrawal of Russia and
its eastern bloc allies, Australia’s medal
hopes are once again high. Murmurings
of a black boycott are coming from
Third World countries over the inclu-
sion of South Africa’s Zola Budd in the
British team in which case Australia’s
expectations would climb higher still.
The Americans who have spent $76
million on their games preparation
will be the ones to beat.
Traditionally, swimmers have been
Australia’s main medal source they
have accounted for more than half the
nation’s 65 gold medals. This year,
though, our best chance of gold is the
hockey team. Yachtsmen and shooters
also are strong gold medal chances. As
they flew off to America, swimming
coaches were predicting a possibility of
25 medals but this was put down to hype
and water on the brain.
In recent years, Australia’s gold
medal score has been meagre two at
boycotted Moscow (both swimming)
and none at Montreal four years before.
Had the Soviet bloc competed at Los
Angeles, Australia could have hoped for
only one gold medal in swimming in
the 4 x 100 m men’s freestyle relay. Indi-
vidual swimmers Glenn Beringen,
Georgina Parkes, Justin Lemberg and
Anna McVann all are chances now.
There are other gold medal prospects
in athletics, rowing, boxing, cycling,
weightlifting and equestrian events. The
contenders with the best chances are:
HOCKEY
Australia’s hockey team is ranked num-
ber one in the world. It beat India in the
1982 Esanda World Tournament in
Melbourne and won both the world
Weightlifter Dean Lukin: gold could be his destiny in LA
PETER FISHER


Heptathalete Glynis Nunn: a Commonwealth Games repeat is possible
Dimity Douglas (white cap) and Anna McVann: multiple chances
JOHN ELLIOTT
Robert de Castella: under pressure
tournaments in the Asian area in 1983.
Captain is Ric Charlesworth, the only
member of parliament in the team (not
counting Hawke who has been given a
team jacket by swimmer Lisa Curry).
Charlesworth has represented Australia
more times than any other hockey
player 168 appearances at latest
count. He played at both the Munich
and Montreal games and was selected
for Moscow where the team did not
compete because of federal government
pressure over events in Afghanistan.
Charlesworth is 31, a doctor of medi-
cine from Western Australia.
The women’s hockey team also has a
good chance. Only six countries are to
take part in the first women’s Olympic
tournament and Australia is ranked sec-
ond, behind the Netherlands.
SWIMMING
The Mean Machine is expected to win
the men’s 4 x 100 m relay.
Twenty-one-year-old Mark Stock-
well (Qld) is Australia’s fastest swimmer
and broke the Commonwealth 100 m re-
cord with a time of 50.55 to win the Aus-
tralian title in Brisbane in February.
This was one of the fastest six swims in
the world over the past 12 months.
Stockwell is set to crack the 50 second
barrier in Los Angeles. Neil Brooks
(WA), once famous for his shaven head,
now sports lots of spikey blond hair. He
was leader of the Mean Machine team
that won the Commonwealth games
gold in Brisbane in 1982. Greg Fasala
(Vic) is a former Commonwealth re-
cord-holder over 100 m and, like
Brooks, an eccentric.
Eighteen-year-old Michael Delaney
comes from Sydney but trains in Bris-
bane with Laurie Lawrence, the Olym-
pic team coach. Delaney clocked 50.62
in Olympic trials.
Glenn Beringen has a good chance of
winning the 200 m breaststroke. The 19-
year-old South Australian has clocked
two of the world’s fastest times for the
event over the past 12 months, each just
outside the record held by Canada’s
Victor Davis.
Georgina Parkes, 19, could win the
200 m women’s backstroke. She finished
second behind East German Cornelia
Sirch in the 1982 world championships.
Parkes’ training times in Canberra have
been particularly impressive and she
has stripped off skg.
Baby of the swimming team is 14-
year-old Dimity Douglas, nicknamed
the Canberra Comet, who is to compete
in the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke
races and possibly the 4 x 100 m medley
relay.
Fifteen-year-old Adelaide schoolgirl
Anna McVann won the 100, 200, 400,
800 and 1500 m freestyle events at the
Olympic trials in Brisbane and not since
the Konrads kids had such a perform-
ance been seen at that stage. She is the
eighth-fastest woman in the world over
800 m. She will also be competing in the
400 m freestyle event.
Justin Lemberg, the 17-year-old Bris-
bane schoolboy who has modelled him-
self on United States star Don
Schollander, is a medal prospect in
either the 400 m or 1500 m.
ROWING
The young Australian eight (average age
under 23) has strong prospects. It fin-
ished third in the world championships
last year, about a length behind New
Zealand and East Germany. The team
comprises two electricians, two electri-
cal engineers, two fitter-and-turners, a
medical student from Melbourne’s


Toorak, a microbiologist and an agri-
cultural scientist. Stroke is 23-year-old
Steve Evans, from Sydney, one of the
electricians. Evans first represented his
country more than 10 years ago as cox
of an Australian women’s four against
New Zealand. This is different.
The east Europeans were first, sec-
ond and third in the women's coxed
fours at last year’s world champion-
ships. The Australians Karen
Brancourt (NSW), Sue Chapman,
Margot Foster, Susan Lee and Jacqui
Marshall (Vic) and Robyn Grey-Gar-
diner (SA) are now in with a chance.
THE MARATHON
Rob de Castella, under great pressure,
will start favorite for the race the last
event on the program. A Morgan Gal-
lop Poll has rated “Deek” second only
to Hawke as the country’s most admired
man. “Deek” has been trying to warn
his fans that the favorite has never won
the marathon before.
WEIGHTLIFTING
Dean Lukin is a South Australian tuna
fisherman, a millionaire and Australia’s
best-ever weightlifter. He weighs 135 kg
and won a gold medal at the Brisbane
Commonwealth games. His trainer,
Leon Holme, describes Lukin as “a
genuine old-fashioned amateur.”
“If I was a clerk, I might be world
champion now,” Lukin once said. “But
fishing is my destiny. Weightlifting is
just a hobby.” With the big Bulgarians
and Russians out of the Olympics,
Lukin's destiny may be a gold medal.
The Mean Machine of (L ro R) Fasala, Delaney, Stockwell and Brooks
NEVILLE WALLER
HEPTATHLON
Glynis Nunn, a physical education
teacher, is another with a much better
chance following the withdrawals. The
heptathlon consists of seven events
100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put,
200 m sprint, long jump, javelin and
800 m run. Nunn, a Queenslander who
moved to Adelaide when she married
decathlete Chris Nunn, beat Common-
wealth champion Judy Livermore for
the gold medal at the Brisbane games.
The winning tally of 6282 points estab-
lished a new Australian standard.
YACHTING
Australia’s yachting team has medal
chances in all seven classes. Best bet for
gold are Chris Cairns, 27, and Scott An-
derson, 30, of NSW in the tornado cata-
maran class. They have been world
champions for the past two years. They
teamed up two years ago. Cairns was
the national Stingray champion in 1979
and in 1981 finished fourth in the world
titles for A class catamarans.
BOXING
Jeff Fenech seems to be Australia’s best
hope for an Olympic boxing medal
since Tony Madigan competed in Rome
in 1960. Madigan had the misfortune to
come up against a young American
named Cassius Clay and came back
with bronze and a black eye. Clay, soon
afterwards, became more widely known
as Muhammad Ali.
Twenty-year-old Fenech is a fly-
weight (51 kg) who began his fighting ca-
reer in the streets of the inner-Sydney
A Norm’s guide to the best of the games
LOS ANGELES is the one place I
wouldn’t want to be during the 1984
Olympics this month. The games simply
are not quite the fun and pleasure they
used to be. Politics, professionalism,
hypocrisy and the risk of sheer terror-
ism or simple madness have all con-
spired to make LA during the games
one of the least attractive places in the
world outside of Tehran, Bagdad or
Beirut perhaps.
As a games “groupie” of 30 years
standing, 1 didn’t think I could ever
consciously avoid going to any games
anywhere. Yet I don’t think I'll suffer
many withdrawal symptoms by not be-
ing in LA.
The things I’ll probably miss most
are the personal contact with other old-
time groupies such as myself and the
quadrennial meeting of the loosely-
organised but highly entertaining Inter-
national Society of Joke Tellers where
some of the finest dirty stories no doubt
will be told again.
To compensate for this, the tele-
vision coverage in Australia will be
much better and more comprehensive
than any games tourist will get even
after paying anything from $4500 up for
generally poor seating, crowded condi-
tions, heat, smog and humidity not to
mention exorbitant and grossly
upgraded costs for accommodation, ser-
vices and meals. Even the anticipated
awful commentary on Channel 10 can
be avoided simply by tuning in to the
authoritative ABC on radio simul-
taneously, to provide the best of both
worlds.
Los Angeles should not have been
selected as a games site but power poli-
tics and possibly sentiment relating to
1932 combined to bring about its selec-
tion. Or was it simply that no other cit-
ies really wanted or could afford the
costly Olympics?
When it held the games in ’32, LA
was not the sprawling, ugly metropolis
crowded with hyped-up crazies which it
seems to be today. The Olympics were
in trouble then, too, because of the De-
pression, but LA found the funds from
public subscriptions and gave the move-
ment renewed vigor.
Among the innovations of the first
LA games was the village where com-
petitors lived in friendship and har-
mony or so we’re told. Today, they
require three separate villages with se-
curity of a degree seldom seen else-
where.
You could get around LA by car, on
foot or by bus with considerable ease in
the 30s. Today, LA is a city designed
solely for the motor car. With no urban

suburb of Marrickville. One brawl at-
tracted the attention of the law, and of
Constable Pat Jarvis in particular, who
took him to the Newtown Police Boys’
Club to meet trainer Johnny Lewis.
Somebody is probably already writing
the script for the movie. Fenech won a
bronze medal in last year’s World Cup.
CANOEING
Liz Blencowe (Vic) took up canoeing in
1977, after discovering that her chosen
sport of swimming wasn't going to lead
her to Olympic gold. She is the only fe-
male member of the canoeing team and
her world ranking is considerably
higher than that of fellow canoeist
Grant Kenny, film star and iron man.
At the world titles last July in Fin-
land, 23-year-old Blencowe finished
seventh and all six ahead of her were
from eastern bloc countries. Not only is
the opposition up the creek and without
a paddle but Blencowe also has
improved.
SHOOTING
No Australian Olympian has yet won a
medal in shooting but, with a Phillip
Adams (NSW, pistol) in the team, there
has to be a chance. Best chance for gold
is Jim Ellis in the trap shooting. In the
past three world championships Ellis
has finished second, 20th and seventh.
He was the Commonwealth games gold
medalist. A shooter who has never been
coached, Ellis has been on the dole for
the past 16 months since his employer
refused him time off to compete in tour-
naments.
TRACK
Mike Hiliardt, a 23-year-old Queens-
lander who now lives in Melbourne, is a
medal hope in the 1500 m. A big im-
prover, he has had recent victories over
Olympic gold medallists Steve Ovett
from Britain and John Walker from
New Zealand.
Also coming good at the right time is
18-year-old Darren Clark (NSW) (see
story over page), winner of last month’s
400 m British AAA championship in
London. The British athletics commu-
nity was astonished to learn that Clark
had been selected originally for the 4 x
400 m only. That team, headed by Ric
Mitchell second in Moscow, 1980 is
one of the best chances in track events.
FIELD
Twenty-eight-year-old Ken Lorraway
(ACT) is ranked second in the world
behind England’s Keith Connor in the
triple jump. And Lorraway runs fast
enough to fill in as a sprint relay runner
in international company. He won a sil-
ver medal at the Brisbane games. He
trains at the Australian Institute of
Sport in Canberra with his wife, Robyn,
who will represent Australia in the long
jump in Los Angeles.
Long-jumper Gary Honey will be up
against the world’s most spectacular
athlete, American Carl Lewis. Honey, a
24-year-old physical education teacher
from Melbourne, won the long jump
gold medal at the Brisbane games and
Track and Field rates him fifth in the
world. His best jump, of 8.15 m at the
Australian championships in March,
rapid rail transport system, its roads
and highways will literally overflow and
sometimes may become stagnant for
hours during these Olympics.
British miler Steve Ovett last year
speculated along the lines that the most
difficult aspect of training for LA would
not be with an eye to running your race
but coping with the possibility of spend-
ing six hours travelling 10km through
snarled traffic from the village to the
main stadium.
Australian officials who have been
games groupies such as myself have told
me that they would not be going unless
they were team members living in the
village, with all its facilities and the best
possible access to everything.
For a journalist, trying to interview
competitors or officials could be almost
impossible. Security arrangements have
put daily passes to enter the village at a
premium, with the 10 Network and the
Overseas Telecommunications Com-
mission claiming the bulk of them. The
scramble for the rest could be more in-
teresting, exciting and gruesome than
some of the official events.
I weep for the Olympics as I knew
them but that was way back in the more
idealistic 50s.
Security, while necessary, still
enabled you to sneak companions into
quarters without too much trouble. Boy-
cotts were not the international power
ploy they have become. Competitors,
while capable and tough, did not earn
the big money a Carl Lewis or Robert
de Castella can command by winning
titles this year in LA. We only had hon-
est shamateurism whereby you couldn’t
get really rich but could still meet your
main training and racing expenses.
Good luck to Deek and to Lewis,
and everyone else seeking real gold in
LA. For myself, I’ll sit at home, cold
tinnies within easy reach, video and
tape recorders ready for the highlights,
watching a plethora of coverage from
every venue. No traffic, no crazies or
terrorists. And, unless my spouse goes
commercial like the Olympics, eating
food and drinking grog at normal
supermarket prices.
I’ll save my energy and money for
the Commonwealth Games in Edin-
burgh in 1986 because they are still the
best of the friendly games unless the
African bloc votes to omit England and
possibly the entire United Kingdom be-
cause of the Lions’ rugby tour of South
Africa or because of controversy over
England’s adoption of South African-
born Zola Budd.
Oh for the good old days.
Mike Agostini


would have won him a bronze medal at
last year’s world titles in Helsinki but
three Americans have been jumping
8.20.
CYCLING
Kenrick Tucker (Qld) finished seventh in
the 1000 m sprint in the Moscow Olym-
pics and won the event at the Brisbane
games. An attack of glandular fever put
him out of action for four months last
year but he is once again very fit and a
medal prospect.
The road team headed by national
champion Gary Trowell (Vic) is ex-
pected to perform well. The team cut an
impressive 6 minutes off the Australian
record last November.
EQUESTRIAN
Australians won both the team and indi-
vidual gold medals in Rome in 1960 and
have strong chances in Los Angeles.
Vicki and Wayne Roycroft (NSW) will
make history as the first married couple
to represent their country in an Olympic
equestrian team. Other members are
Mervyn Bennett (bronze medal in 1976)
and Andrew Hoy, both of NSW. The
show-jumping squad, headed by Guy
Creighton also has medal prospects.
One Australian medal chance who
may be competing at Los Angeles but
not for Australia is horseman David
Green. When the 26-year-old Brisbane
rider could not afford to fly himself and
his horses home to Australia from
England for the March Olympic trials,
the Australian selectors told him he
would not be considered for the team.
Green, who is married to Britain’s
top horsewoman, Lucinda Prior-
Palmer, promptly applied for and was
granted British citizenship. He is now
on the reserve list for the British team. □
Sydney ‘horse’ could be a world champion
DARREN CLARK, 18, is Australia’s
most exciting running prospect for
years. He is being tipped widely as a
possible winner of the 400 metres title in
Los Angeles.
A minor medal seems to be the least
many people expect of this prodigy
from Putney in Sydney.
Few Americans have rated Clark
anything more than a potential finalist
so far but in England, where he won the
British Amateur Athletic Association
400 metres title for the second success-
ive year in June, many regard Clark as a
distinct Olympic medal possibility and
even a potential winner.
The 400 metres is regarded as one of
the toughest running events. Too short
to be called a middle distance race, it is
also just a little too far for pure sprint
speed.
Sprinters race anaerobically. That
means they run up oxygen debts as
South American nations do loans.
Sprinters pay off their debts, unlike the
South Americans, when they stop run-
ning. That’s why they breathe so hard
for so long after finishing.
Man is said to be able to run a maxi-
mum of about 270 metres at full speed,
creating a considerable oxygen debt. So
men who run 400 metres in world-class
time today between 44.5 and 45 sec-
onds create massive oxygen debts.
With this comes considerable pain and
even agony, particularly over the final
100 metres after normal limits have
been passed.
Sprinters who run successfully in
Olympic-level competition have to be
born with a special combination of
muscle tissue (red and white) as well as
exceptional aerobic capacity. This en-
ables the heart and lungs to pump oxy-
gen-filled blood to the hardworking
muscalature while removing the lactic
acid and other waste products which
Four-hundred-metre hope Darren Clark: potential for greatness
cause the pain and sometimes cramping
of the muscles.
Such talents are inborn, even if they
can be enhanced and improved by
training. “Horses” is the athletic termin-
ology used to describe such naturals.
Clark is a “horse.” He has been run-
ning competitively since before he was
10. Like sprinter Debbie Wells he was a
capable and successful Little Athlete,
often winning events up to 800 metres,
indicating his unique combination of
endurance and speed.
Through a succession of coaches,
Clark performed moderately until he
teamed with Alan Hawes about three
years ago. Then Clark’s talent began to
blossom into what looks like potential
greatness.
Whether this blossoming occurred as
a result of the Hawes training secrets or
simply because its time had come is a
moot point. What is interesting is that
Hawes and Clark seem to believe that
the coach has some special methods and
secrets which made the “horse” the
champion he has become. Hawes refers
to special styles of running, changing
gears, post-race pulse rates and psycho-
logical techniques which make his
champion so special.
The media and the public seem
to need to believe in magical men with
miraculous formulas for making super-
heroes for instance, Percy Cerutty
jumping the moat surrounding the
Rome Olympic stadium to wave a white
towel telling Herb Elliott to pour on the
pressure over the final few hundred
metres in his world-record Olympic
1500 metres victory in 1960.
Interviewed afterwards, Elliott said
he hadn’t seen Cerutty jumping around
and waving his towel. But the public
and the media did and they preferred
to believe in the magic having its own
special effects.

0.K., so you travel to Sydney a lot. And you want to stay somewhere
that’s comfortable. Obviously. All business executives do.
But you want it to be central so you save on time and taxi fares.
And you want the staff to take good care of you.
Naturally you’d like all these things to come at a price that doesn’t affect
your budget.
Then consider the following proposition.
The Southern Cross is Sydney’s newest hotel. It’s centrally located near
all public transport and en route to the airport, too.
Comfort? Australia’s foremost decorators, the guys who do a lot of
boardrooms for our major corporations took care of it, so they have a pretty
good idea of what a business executive wants.
Relaxed colour schemes, plush carpets, good lighting, comfortable
oversized beds. Large desks and phones at the ready.
Most visitors even go so far as to describe our rooms as luxurious but
we’ll leave that for you to decide.
Other Southern Cross touches that could be described as “luxuries,”
but we’d prefer to call them “little extras,” include a garden and heated
swimming pool on the roof, a first class restaurant and valet parking.
But as you’re a business executive we imagine that the thing that will
appeal most are our rates.
Staying at the new Southern Cross in Sydney may well seem like a
luxury to you. But it will never look like that on your expense report.
We could promise you that when you stay with us you’ll be “cradled in
the lap of luxury.”
But, really, we’d prefer just to say that The Southern Cross
represents probably the best value for money of any hotel in town.

And how to make them
come true.
If it’s always been your ambition to become a leader and achieve success in
a challenging, mentally-stimulating professional career, you’re obviously a young
man with great expectations.
The question is whether you’re willing to wait years for them to come true.
Or whether you’re already getting impatient.
In January, 1985 eighty young people will commence an intensive
44 week training course at Officer Cadet School, Portsea. When they graduate with
a commission as a Lieutenant, each Officer can expect to command men in areas as
diverse as Armour, Artillery, Engineering, Survey, Signals, Transport, Infantry,
Intelligence and Aviation.
They can also expect to be constantly involved in learning and mastering
new skills. Using their experience and training to help team members achieve the
best possible results. Realizing their full physical and mental potential. Gaining
recognition for their ability to lead men in a responsible, constructive manner.
And, of course, meeting every expectation their parents ever had for them to
succeed in a leading profession.
Life as an Army Officer is exhilarating, varied and very satisfying. Simply
because it’s one career where your great expectations can become a reality instead
of‘pie in the sky’.
If you’re aged between IBV2 and 23 on the first day of the month in which
the course commences (or up to 25 with a degree or diploma), have your HSC or
equivalent, (at a level
acceptable to the Army),
and expect a lot from
yourself, contact your
nearest Army Careers
Recruiting Centre or fill

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Minding your pees in queues
I HAVE NOTHING against
Boy George; he is the prettiest
English pop star we have had
here in a generation. He is in-
finitely more wholesome than
the Beatles. Also, I am quite
moved by Marilyn. His lan-
guid pallor is appealing.
It’s just that ... well ... I
was brought up in a terribly
heterosexual household and
went to a boarding school that
was so guiltily male that we
didn’t even allow females to
wait on the tables. Now, the
trendy word is “androgyn-
ous” and we are told what a
beautiful thing it is to sink the
difference between the sexes
for all of us to be one.
I can understand all that
and I think it puts life on an
elegant, serene plane. Alas, I
cannot get these beastly urges
out of my system: I like to
know that’s MALE and that’s
FEMALE. Creatures in the
animal kingdom have an in-
stinct for these matters. For
example, male and female
crocodiles may look exactly
the same to you and me but I
am assured that a boy croco-
dile knows instantly when he
sees a girl crocodile.
I have a male friend who stood in a
queue last week outside the Melbourne
Cricket Ground. He was hoping to get
into a lavatory. It was only after he had
been in the queue for five minutes that
he realised that he was waiting for the
lavatory of the wrong gender.
You used to be able to tell by clothes.
Not any more. Boy George has fixed all
that: The males are wearing dresses.
You used to be able to tell by smell;
Messrs Chanel, Lanvin, etc made sure
of that. Not any more. The male de-
odorants are so divine that all the girls
are going for them. My daughters love
the latest after-shaves.
You used to be able to tell by shape.
Not any more. Two out of three females
are now bigger and stronger than I am.
When I bicycle, they bicycle past me.
When I jog, they jog past me with the
speed of light. I did manage to overtake
a female last Tuesday but I think she
had stopped to do up a shoelace.
You used to be able to tell by their
narrow shoulders and their wide hips.
Not any more. You see hips that are
curiously narrow and, what with women
Boy George: thanks to him, males are wearing dresses
going to muscle-building gyms, they
have shoulders like Mr Barry Round’s.
Maybe some of you folk out there,
like me, are losing your grip so to
speak. Well, I have organised a guide to
form, a sort of set of clues which enables
me to identify male from female croco-
diles.
Jeans: Females wear them shorter up
the calf. Furthermore, the female of the
species can endure much more pain
than the male so tends to wear the gar-
ment much tighter particularly about
the crotch.
Tops: Very sloppy. This makes it im-
possible to identify breasts. The I-have-
just-escaped-from-Afghanistan look is
very popular with females this week.
Both sexes tend to wear shirts hanging
out but trendy South Yarra males like to
have the cuffs of their shirts unbuttoned
and slightly rolled. The males are also
going for holes in the elbows of their
sweaters. Females are deep into harness.
They are wearing a lot of leather around
their middles.
Sneakers/joggers: Female gym/jog-
ging shoes are just slightly more vulgar.
Male sneakers are bigger and dirtier. If
you can stand the cold, it is
considered proper not to wear
socks.
Smoking: The young crea-
ture with a cigarette is more
likely to be female. Look par-
ticularly for the angle. If it is
held up in the classic little
finger teacup style, three to
one on it’s female.
Hair: Not easy. Both sexes
are going for Apaches, both
are going for lavatory brush
styles, spikes, candy colors.
However, male hair tends to
be more aggressively bleached
and longer.
Earrings: Very good clue.
Most males, still, are wearing
only one earring. There are
certain messages to be read
from which ear but I am told
that this is notoriously unre-
liable.
Newspapers: Males almost
invariably start reading the
newspaper from the back
page. When not reading, fe-
males tend to talk about sex
more but their conversation is
often more intelligent.
Posture: Now, this is a
delicate subject. I once knew a
hostess who said that you
could always tell where males had been
sitting because crumbs were left in the
middles of their seats. What’s more, my
mother used to say that a lady never
went outside unless she wore hat, gloves
and, most important of all, always kept
her knees together. That knee business
doesn’t apply now. I mean, have you
noticed some of the dummy models in
the shop windows? However, males do
stand with their legs apart more often.
Handbags: Another excellent clue.
Male handbags are much neater and
smaller than female handbags. But, alas,
many females are not carrying them at
all.
Make-up: The females definitely are
better at it. Not many chaps are skilled
at doing up their eyes. And it is still
considered not done for a male to make
up his face in public.
Not one of these clues will prove
anything. Consider yourself like a de-
tective in the CIB; amass and sift all the
evidence. Then, when it is all put
together, I think I can guarantee you an
accurate result.
I find now that I am right better than
90 percent of the time. □

Dazzling?
Well, would you expect anything less from
a totally new car?
A car whose appearance reflects a purpose-
lul V 6 fuel-injected engine.
A car that doesn’t address the concepts of
design and styling with stock solutions.
But with fresh avenues of thought.
So you’ll note the lines of the Volvo 760
GLE aren’t blurred by “me-tooisms”.
And the aerodynamic body doesn’t cheat
interior room or passenger comfort to achieve
a 39 drag coefficient.
Not bad, considering the wind-cutting
Porsche 928 S rates a 38.
Again, would you expect anything less
than “dazzling” from a car whose refinements
point to the contentment of the driver instead
of the satisfaction of the financial bosses?
Here, inclusions like metallic paint, sun
roof, automatic climate control and leather or
plush upholstery are yours as standard.

All reasons why the 760 fairly shines in the
showroom.
But cast your eyes back to the photograph.
You see our finest road car yet.
And a car, we suggest, that out-performs
sedans at twice the cost.
A tall claim? Consider this, it is backed by
an engineering breakthrough.
Namely, the new Volvo Constant Track
Rear Suspension System.
It’s one-of-a-kind (yes, it’s patented) and it
delivers more than stability and smoothness.
It allows you to corner a large luxury sedan
with sports car-like precision.
Now, if that begins to stir your emotions,
why not test-drive the 760 GLE.
That way you’ll discover something that
makes Volvo a little different from the rest.
The distinction of our car doesn’t finish
with the metal.

Flying at treetop level for safety’s sake
DAVID M c NICOLL
7.30 AM, EROS Airport, Windhoek,
Namibia, formerly South West Africa.
The sun just starting to peep over the
hills, and the cold Kalahari wind
blowing wisps of dust along the tarmac.
A lone Cessna Centurion 11 drawn
up near the hangar, and a young man
standing alongside. “Are you my pas-
senger?” he asked. “My name’s Steve.
All I’ve been told is, someone will be
here before 8 am and I’m to take him to
the border.” “Well, I said, I’m your pas-
senger.” We climbed in and, while he
warmed the engine, he pointed out the
two-hour route we would take to the
Namibia-Angola border.
We cleared the hills which surround
Windhoek and I glanced at the alti-
meter 9000 feet (aeroplanes don’t use
metres) which really only meant 3000 ft
as Windhoek, like Johannesburg, is up
round the 6000 ft level. The countryside
covered with scrubby trees, the hills
brown and occasionally a glimpse of a
stream. Then, up ahead, I saw what ap-
peared to be a huge lake. “The Etosha
Pan,” explained Steve. “It’s nearly 100
kilometres long and generally dry. By
the way, as soon as we cross the pan, we
have to come down to treetop level for
the rest of the trip.”
“Good God,” I said, “Why? I hate
flying at treetop level.”
“Security. Absolutely im-
perative. It takes the SWAPO
boys seven seconds to ‘lock
up’ an RGP 7 missile ready
for firing and, if we’re at tree-
top, they haven’t time to get a
shot at us.”
“Say no more,” I said. We
came down to four metres
from the ground and whipped
across the alternating scrub
and grass areas. Birds
wheeled up from the soaks,
cattle ambled away in fright
and an occasional black face
would glance up at us as we
went across the increasing
number of native kraals. Then
I saw buildings, lines of tents,
towers all the paraphernalia
of an army headquarters. We
circled and landed at
Oshakati, headquarters of
Sector 10 of the South African
army.
THE SITUATION in An-
gola-Namibia is more like a
can of scorpions than like a
can of worms. There are vari-
ous trouble areas within trouble areas.
The Angolan Government is fighting off
the forces of UNITA and depends on
the support of 34,000 Cubans in Angola.
Angola-based SWAPO forces infiltrate
Namibia. South Africa is concerned
about the Cuban presence and is insist-
ing on their withdrawal from Angola.
But the Angolan Government depends
on them to remain in control. It’s a mad
merry-go-round but the situation in
which I was interested was the border
raids, infiltration and indiscriminate
murder being carried out by SWAPO
against peaceful inhabitants of northern
Namibia and the South African army.
“WHY THE towers?” I asked an offi-
cer. The towers round Oshakati serve
several purposes but one is to let
SWAPO know that the army is awake
and alert. Flares go up each night round
about midnight and anti-aircraft guns
on the towers open up and shoot down
the flares. It gives the message to
SWAPO and ruins everyone’s sleep
for kilometres around.
Isolation and sanctions have made
South Africa’s army and armaments ex-
traordinarily hard-hitting and efficient.
The 155 mm gun has been modified in
South Africa so that it can be trans-
ported over almost any terrain at 100
South African troops check SWAPO dead and wounded
AL VENTER/SCOPE FEATURES
km/h; the Buffalo troop carrier, devel-
oped in South Africa, can survive mine
blasts for its crew and combatants.
My guide round the forward areas
was a dark moustachioed full colonel
named J. C. Swart. When I told him that
I wanted to see the Black Battalion
the 101 he sent for his car and ushered
me in alongside him. Then he jumped
out, muttering, and came back with a
very efficient-looking burp gun. “In case
we have some problems on the way,” he
said cheerfully. On the way, he pointed
out where there had indeed been prob-
lems: the mangled cars in which some
visiting Americans were blown up; the
damage to a water tower caused by a
SWAPO man in civilian clothes who got
through the South African lines (there
is, in many ways, similarity to Viet Cong
harassment in Vietnam).
THE BLACK Battalion was an eye-
opener. Already famed for their fighting
qualities, they presented the picture of a
wonderfully trained and equipped unit.
All officers are white, all NCO’s black.
But the first blacks are just about to
emerge from officers’ training school
and receive their commissions. Such is
the pride in and popularity'of the
Black Battalion that, when last there
was a recruiting drive, 2700 aspiring
black soldiers were waiting at
the gates on the nominated
day.
How do blacks feel about
killing other blacks? They
have no sympathy for
SWAPO, for SWAPO has
been merciless in torture and
killings among the peaceful
Ovamba from whom most of
the soldiers are drawn.
The pay is good, the condi-
tions are excellent. The black
soldiers are incredibly
efficient with handling of
arms, except that they are not
particularly good shots and
need plenty of target practice.
But if ever I saw a collection
of enthusiastic, morale-high
soldiers it was the 101 Bn at
Ondangua.
I flew back to Windhoek
convinced of one thing the
South African defence forces
will be able to deal very ad-
equately with any oppression
from across their northern
borders, even with a few thou-
sand Cubans throw in. □

In Australia for a few weeks to coincide
with Spike Milligan’s current tour: his
biographer, Pauline Scudamore. The
wife of a former doctor and mother of
three boys, Scudamore is a graduate of
London Polytechnic and a literary re-
searcher. She met Milligan by chance
and became interested in his work. The
biography, she insists, is not “official.”
She has the sole say over its contents.
She agrees that Milligan is a comic ge-
nius but believes his writings, especially
his poetry, are greatly underrated.
Moreover, she says, Milligan may have
missed his true vocation. “He should
have been academic ... he would have
become one of those glorious eccentrics
who are part of the traditions of the
great universities.”
According to the US business magazine,
Forbes, long-time Washington operator
Clark Clifford was having dinner one
night seated next to a lady he knew
vaguely. Their conversation went like
this: “Did I get your name correctly?”
Clark said. “Is your name Post?” “Yes,”
was the response. “Is it Emily Post?” he
said. “Yes,” she replied. He said: “Are
you the world-renowned authority on
manners?” She said “Yes,” then added:
“Why do you ask?” “Because,” he said,
“you have just eaten my salad.”
What next? Robyn Mackenzie and
Eileen Austin have been appointed to
the Commonwealth Car Pool in Can-
berra, bringing to NINE the number of
female drivers employed by the Depart-
ment of Administrative Services. Next
thing you know they’ll be letting them
get rid of their “P” plates.
In Adelaide the Paul McGuire Maritime
Library is still at it, thanks to the inde-
fatigable Frances McGuire, now an-
nouncing a new award: for maritime
achievement in navigation, sea and
ocean behaviour, hydrography and
methods of sea rescue. The whole thing
is named after the late Paul McGuire, a
former Australian Ambassador to Italy
and delegate to the United Nations. The
sea had fascinated him ever since he
missed being a naval cadet in World
War I. At the University of Adelaide he
met his wife. She was to become a bio-
chemist, a researcher into insulin, a
member of the Australian delegation to
the League of Nations in 1939, a big
wheel in the National Council of
Women, an author and a journalist.
Matters McGuire, under a $lOO,OOO
trust fund administered by the SA Gov-
ernment, seem to grow still more im-
pressive.
John McEnroe: sour thoughts on Da Vinci
John McEnroe has acquired an interest
in art: “What I want to know is, why
does everyone rate the Mona Lisa? Why
don’t people come out and say that’s
one picture that stinks?” No doubt
Leonardo Da Vinci, had he put his hand
to it, could have given Superbrat a
game.
After 25 years in the army, Donald
Graham (sometimes known formally as
Major Donald Graham) decided that
enterprise need not always be of the
martial kind. So he and Sydney barris-
ter Timothy Daniell developed a plan
named Port Folio to sell Portuguese
port to Australians while it was still in
Portugal. You could, they said, bring it
here right away and scoff the lot but to
do that would be to miss the point: this
port, Warre’s, was not so much grog as
gold. If you took their advice you would
leave it in Portugal to develop still more
character for at least five years and ...
The Wine Society gave its blessing but
inevitably some of the 13,000 members
asked what on earth an ex-soldier
would know about port. Graham was
ready for that. Warre’s, he said was
started in 1670 by the family of Lt-Gen-
eral Sir William Warre; and he, shrewd
fellow, encouraged the drinking of the
stuff ever after by bringing it to the at-
tention of yet another warrior: His
Grace the Duke of Wellington.


Last year Hornsby, NSW, portraitist
Margaret Woodward won the pres-
tigious Portia Geach Memorial Art
Award with a self-portrait. That was
worth $4OOO to her. This year Wood-
ward did it again with a portrait of fel-
low-artist Madeleine Halliday and this
time, thanks to the Permanent Trustee’s
painstaking trusteeship, the award was
worth $5000; which at least shows nice
co-operation between one or another of
the nine Muses and good old Mammon.
The works of Margaret Ackland, who
painted Professor Leonie Sandercock,
and Suzanne May, who painted
Ackland, were commended by the
judges.
What John Clunies-Ross, the bare-toed
king of Cocos, thinks about it is any-
body’s guess but of 54 Australians
awarded Churchill Fellowships this
year (at a cost of nearly $400,000) two
are his former “children” from the
Home Island of the far-flung atoll.
Rababu bin Anthoney is to spend 12
weeks studying “the work, responsibil-
ities and organisation of local govern-
ment councils” in WA; and Woren bin
Dedian will spend the same time learn-
ing how co-operative societies get things
done in isolated areas of the same state.
In France where there are nine million
dogs eight million of them called
Pitou and seven million cats almost
all of them called Minou there are 60
cats and seven dogs who live at Saint
Tropez. Barricaded against intruders
such as cheap-meat restaurateurs and
high-handed sterilisers, safe from' the
clutches of French Minister for Agricul-
ture Michel Rochard, the animals are the
property of France’s, and possibly the
world’s, leading domestic-pet-fancier,
Brigitte Bardot. Bardot gave up the cin-
ema 11 years ago and now, at 50, round-
ly curses the medium that made her a
fortune, made her the most famous
European star of her generation and
made it easy for her to indulge herself in
one of the most worthwhile of all
pleasures: fancying and protecting our
wordless friends.
An honored guest at this year’s centen-
ary women’s Wimbledon was Alice

greatest woman tennis-player ever,
whose brilliant career was cut short by a
larger concern namely, World War 11.
The 1939 Wimbledon women’s cham-
pion actually beat Jack Kramer 7-5, 7-5

The saga of the flying sorcerers
PHILLIP ADAMS
IT IS Tuesday, June 24, 1947. Kenneth
Arnold is flying his private plane above
the Cascade Mountains of Washington
State, US. A former football hero in his
middle 30s, Arnold uses his plane for
distributing fire-fighting equipment. In
the next few hours, he will be respon-
sible for some of the most blazing head-
lines in newspaper history.
As he nears Mount Ranier, Arnold,
sees or believes he sees nine circular
objects, in diagonal formation, streak-
ing past his plane at high speed. He esti-
mates that they are 40km away, that
they are slightly smaller than a DC-4
(one of which is also in vision) and they
are flying “as if linked together.” He de-
scribes them as swerving in and out of
the high mountain peaks with “flipping,
erratic movements.” He would add later
that the objects “flew like a saucer
would if you skipped it across the
water.”
A few hours later the wire services
told America the story, using the word
“saucer” to describe what Arnold had
seen. Thus began a wave of mass hys-
teria that, 40 years later, has grown into
an industry, perhaps a religion. Books,
documentaries, feature films and organ-
isations abound, with the mythology of
the UFO becoming ever more baroque.
But to begin at the beginning. Within
a few days of Arnold’s reports, flying
saucers became the frisbees of the hu-
man imagination. Newspapers across
the US received a crescendo of calls
from citizens who’d seen saucers over
their farms, homes or offices. Within a
few weeks saucers had been seen in
every state, as well as Canada, Austra-
lia, England and Iran.
Not that everybody saw saucers.
Some say flying ice-cream cones, soar-
ing hub caps, giant donuts or balls of
fire. And one wingless, cigar-shaped
craft with “rows of lighted windows and
a long orange-red exhaust” was re-
ported.
American scientific columnist and
fellow sceptic Martin Gardner recalls
how the military tried to brush aside the
flying saucer mania. Clearly, it was a
mass delusion. “But after the reports
grew to vast proportion, the [US] Air
Force set up a ‘Project Saucer’ to make
careful investigation. After 15 months
they reported they had found no evi-
dence which could not be explained as
hoaxes, illusions or misinterpretations
of balloons and other familiar sky
objects.”
But in this age of rising cynicism
about official pronouncements, the
more Washington sneered at saucers,
the more the public believed in them.
Well, what had triggered off the
whole affair? Jungian psychiatrists ar-
gued that saucers were a part of man-
kind’s collective unconscious, that we’d
been seeing them in the skies for cen-
turies. Social psychologists suggested
they were symptomatic of cold war
neuroses, projections of nuclear
anxieties. The truth was embarrassingly
simple.
In February 1951 the Office of Naval
Research distributed a 10-page report
on the navy’s huge Skyhook balloons,
used for cosmic ray research. The report
detailed the ease with which these giant
plastic bags —30 m diameter could
be mistaken for flying discs. They
reached a height of 30,000 m and often
were borne by jetstream winds at speeds
of more than 320km/h.
At a distance, such a balloon loses its
three-dimensional aspect. It looks like a
disc. From beneath, the instruments
hanging below could easily be mistaken
for a hole, giving the disc the shape of a
donut. And the plastic composition of a
Skyhook balloon offers a surface that
seems highly metallic in reflected sun-
light. And sometimes the large
Skyhooks were replaced by a group of
smaller plastic balloons.
As it happens, the first Skyhooks
were launched in 1947, when Arnold
was flying above the Cascade Moun-
tains.
One of the few points on which all
observers of flying saucers agreed was
that they were silent. Well, that sounds
like a balloon. But observers often in-
sisted that what they saw couldn’t be a
balloon “because it was moving against
the wind.” But wind directions in the
stratosphere often are opposed to wind
directions on the ground.
Of course, the Skyhook balloons
weren’t the only culprits. There were
and are many other types of balloons
riding the skies: weather balloons with
steady or blinking lights; radar-target
balloons trailing aluminium foil.
In addition, Gardner reminds us,
one must consider a score of possible
illusions arising from faulty observa-
tions of planes, birds, the planet Venus,
reflections of light on clouds and similar
phenomena.
Lastly, there are lies and semi-lies.
Any number of case studies have been
published about flying saucer hoaxes
perpetrated by pranksters, publicity
seekers and psychotics. Unfortunately,
the exposure of the hoax seldom catches
up with the original story.
Now there are UFO societies on
every continent and hardly a month
passes without a learned conference on
some distant campus. In recent years
Professor J. Allen Hynek has emerged
as the major guru of the movement (he
was technical consultant to Steven
Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the
Third Kind) although lately he’s rejected
the hypothesis of intergalactic travel in
favor of the interlopers being visitors
from another dimension.
Thus what began as a misidentifica-
tion of a few balloons has grown into
one of the largest, longest-running ex-
pressions of human foolishness. □

And now, the word for today ...
RON SAW
lAN LESLIE, the 60 Minutes reporter,
started it all by demonstrating himself
to be quite unable to manage the word
nuclear.
In a film about a praise-the-lord-and-
pass-the-ammunition-type of bomb-
fancying priest, he started out by saying
“nukular” and got steadily worse; so
that, by the time he’d had about eight
cracks at the word, it was less a word
than a snuffle followed by two or
three gloomy glottal stops.
Now, it would be offensively
clumsy to criticise a man for be-
ing unable to wrap his tongue
around a word. Some people
have troubles with enunciation
and there’s an end to it. I once
had a postman who was enthusi-
astic about the works of the late
W. Somerset Maugham, but
found it impossible to pronounce
his name: for Maugham, he said
“Morn.”
So what? it is reasonable to
ask. He was not supposed to
know his m’s from his n’s. He
was a postman. He could have
plodded the streets of Padding-
ton shouting “Somerset MORN”
from dawn till dusk and I
daresay nobody would have
cared a row of beans.
But Leslie is a highly-paid and
very professional figure on what is per-
haps the most respected program on
Australian TV. It is astounding that his
producer, let alone his executive boss
Gerald Stone, allowed him to make
such a howling ass of himself. Astound-
ing? Well, no, not really. There is so
much asininity, howling or just mildly
noisy, on TV lately that a nukular or
two is hardly more than the norm.
For instance, on the same night as
the nukulars were let loose, a Channel
10 (Sydney) announcer told us that we
were to see a movie about a deadly
snake called a black mambo. It’s pos-
sible, of course, that there is a whole
family of African serpents writhing
under names to do with the dance: the
green-eyed rhumba, the rattle-tailed
doh-si-doh, the diamond-bellied Sir
Roger de Coverley. But I doubt it; and
even were it the case it would have been
simpler to call the thing a mamba.
For the next few weeks I kept a note-
book beside me whenever I watched TV
and spent so much time shouting indig-
nantly, then triumphantly, that my wife
found an interest in gardening by night
despite the Arctic weather.
On every channel, needless to say,
there were commercials for “Nissen”
motor cars and why the Nissan com-
pany doesn’t cut loose with a judo chop
or a banzai I’ll never know.
There has been, too, a commercial
for something called “chickin’’ gar-
nished with herbs and “spicis” and a
Channel 10 sportscaster talking about
the Queensland footballers, whose
jumpers are maroon, called them the
“maroans.”
Channel 7 has the Leyland brothers
and they, with their “thee cat sat on thee
mat” dialogue, are usually so dreadful
that one can only believe that they’re
doing it on purpose. Still, it’s only fair
to draw attention to “Feburey” and
“Sinny” (a pronunciation they share
with Channel 10’s Kate Lee in Sydney),
to “avery” for aviary and “papparus”
which was either a father walrus or a
kind of reed called papyrus.
Lee, incidentally, referred to Pinot
and I thought we must be on to wine-
fancying until it became clear that she
meant P and O. Her partner in these
frightful crimes, Tim Webster, told us of
a mountain near Orange, NSW, called

tell the boy, or the Channel 10 writers,
that there is no D.
Channel 9’s news people like all
Australians, I’m afraid just can’t get it
together with hyphens. They gave us

Fawcett Majors, she is ever divorced,
she’ll go back to being plain Evert

I have no doubt that he knows the

But just at a time when everything
seems to be going well, when the sun is
shining (well, that may be going a bit
far: the match is nearly always in Mel-

couple of hours of good football, Landy
ruins everything by referring to “the
right (or left) half-back flank.”
Now, if it’s right or left half-back or
half-forward, how in God’s name can it
be anything else but the flank? The
word flank is unnecessary and not only
unnecessary but also intensely annoy-
ing.
“Left half-back flank” is a tautology
and tautologies are the province, exclu-
sively, personally, of him alone and no-
body else, individually speaking, par-
ticularly with respect to Rex Mossop.
And life’s too short and space is too
tight to start on HIM. □

Convention city: Pomp and circumstance
WALLY McNAMEE— Newsweek
Walter Mondale popped a dramatic question last
week —asking Rep. Geraldine Ferraro to be the first
woman ever on the ticket of a major party. But will
Mondale’s bold move help him beat Ronald Reagan?
The call came through from Minnesota
almost precisely on time —and Geraldine
Ferraro retreated to another room of her San
Francisco hotel suite to talk to the man who
would change her political life. “Gerry,”
said Walter Mondale, popping the historic
question, “will you be my running mate?”
Ferraro said yes, instantly, and it was done: a
48-year-old housewife and three-term con-
gresswoman from New York was now the
first woman ever chosen as the vice presiden-
tial nominee of a major political party.
Ferraro talked with Mondale for five or
six minutes, then opened the door and
peeked out at her aides. “How does it feel
to be a part of history?” she said quietly,
as the room erupted in pan-
demonium. Then she called
home, reaching Laura, her 18-
year-old daughter. “Well?’’
Laura said.
“It’s yes,” said her mother.
“Are you sure it’s not ‘may-
be’ ?” Laura asked.
“It’s yes,” said the honor-
able representative for the
Ninth Congressional District
of New York.
“Are you sure it’s not ‘possi-
ble’ ?” Laura persisted.
“It’s yes,” said the woman
who will help Fritz Mondale
lead the Democrats against
Ronald Reagan in the fall.
“It's yes!” Laura screamed
to her father, New York real-es-
tate developer John Zaccaro—
and the all-important election
of 1984 was finally under way.
Mondale’s bold choice for
veep, announced the next day in
a joint press conference in the
stately chambers of the Minnesota state cap-
itol in St. Paul, seemed certain to change the
face of American politics permanently—for
it declared, more plainly than any single
event since the adoption of the 19th Amend-
ment in 1920, that women have arrived.
That the nomination of a woman veep was
bound to happen sooner or later did not
matter at all: it was happening now, and to a
real person, Geraldine Anne Ferraro of
Queens, N.Y., a briskly pragmatic feminist
who has successfully juggled the conflicting
goals of family and career. That the post of
vice president is, by the testimony of nearly
every previous incumbent, a crashing cere-
monial bore did not matter either: there was

LARRY DOWNING— Newsweek
no doubting the crucial significance of Fer-
raro’s role in the coming campaign and no
doubting that if she and Mondale somehow
prevail in November, a woman will finally be
the proverbial heartbeat away from the
highest office in the land.
The news—stunning despite the soggy
three-week melodrama of Mondale’s me-
thodical search for a vice president—galva-
nized the Democratic Party on the eve of its
convention. It quelled the complaints of
those who said Walter Mondale lacks imagi-
nation and daring (although many critics
charged that he had bowed to pressure from
feminists) and it crushed the hopes of all but
the most diehard supporters of his rivals for
the nomination; Gary Hart and
Jesse Jackson could only ap-
plaud Mondale’s choice. It
gave the 3,933 delegates who
will pack the Moscone Conven-
tion Center in San Francisco
this week something to cheer
about —for it was a powerful
signal that the Democratic Par-
ty still stands for change and
opportunity. “Ya hoooo!” said
Kathy Wilson, who chairs the
National Women’s Political
Caucus. “Walter Mondale has
turned the most important de-
cision of his campaign into the
best decision of his campaign.’’
It may be that —and with
the big decision behind him,
Mondale was free to savor his
triumphal entry into San Fran-
cisco. After 24 years in the
Democratic vineyards and a
bitterly contested primary
campaign, he had the nomina-
tion and the full attention of a

The running mates with their families: Mondale’s bold choice seems certain to change the face of American politics permanently
watching nation in his grasp. The Mondale
camp had orchestrated what was likely to be
a four-day celebration of the Democratic
Party’s diversity—a convention without
the pyrotechnic rancor of other years, a
soft-edged version of the GOP’s traditional-
ly buttoned-up coronation ceremonies.
Jimmy Carter would be there, along with
Edward Kennedy, Tip O’Neill and 568 su-
perdelegates who are the potentates of the
party. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
would deliver the keynote address, San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein would
welcome the delegates to her city, and Fer-
raro —by all odds the new star of the show—
would report on the carefully balanced
product of the platform committee’s delib-
erations. Hart and Jackson would get their
chance to speak, though there now seemed
little likelihood that either would steal
Mondale’s crowning moment.
Trial Heat: None of that means, however,
that the nominee and his running mate will
be able to relax. Mondale still trails Reagan
in most national polls, although he has late-
ly reversed the ominous slippage that fol-
lowed his less-than-stirring victory in the
primaries and which suggested, at least
briefly, that the Democrats were sliding
toward disaster in November. A new
Newsweek Poll, moreover, shows that
Ferraro has definitely not hurt the Demo-
cratic ticket: in a first trial heat of Mondale
and Ferraro against Reagan and George
Bush, the Democrats trail by only 6
points—and significantly, though the fig-
ures seem to be changing almost by the day,
Mondale is now ahead of Reagan among
women voters by a margin of 8 points, 49 to
41 percent.
The convention, with its starburst of tele-
vision and press exposure, will be their
critical first step toward enlarging that
crack of possibility. Despite the potential
benefits .of her appeal for women voters,
Ferraro remains an unknown quantity on
the fast track of presidential politics—and
as a liberal, Catholic, Italian-American
from New York, she will not provide the
regional and ideological balance that some
Southern moderates, such as former party
chairman Robert Strauss, thought Mon-
dale should seek. She will have to prove her
mettle: prove that she is more than a token
candidate, that she is “qualified” for the
vice presidency of the United States, and
that she is as tough as her Queens constitu-
ency. And curiously enough, Mondale must
promote himself, too —for it is a measure of
his Norwegian reserve that he remains,
after years in public life and months of
heated battle on the primary-campaign
trail, a very private man and somewhat
colorless figure.
Winding up his preparations for the con-
vention last week, Mondale focused on some
final bits of intramural business—and stum-
bled into an llth-hour controversy. It
began when he abruptly fired Democratic
National Committee Chairman Charles
Manatt without naming a replacement and
without much explanation; aides said the
DNC’s fund raising and campaign planning
WOMEN IN U.S. POLITICS: A CENTURY OF LANDMARKS
Since the era of the suffragists, women have come a long way. But not until
recently have they been serious contenders—in their own right—for the top jobs.
1916
Republican Jeannette Rankin of Missoula, Mont.,
was the first woman elected to the House of
Representatives.
1920
Women voted nationwide for the first time in a presi-
dential election.
1924
Democrat Lena Jones Springs of South Carolina
was the first woman to have her name placed in
nomination for vice president at a major party’s
convention.
1925
Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming and Miriam (Ma)
Ferguson of Texas became the first women
state governors—both succeeding their husbands.
(Ross’s spouse died in office; Ferguson’s was
impeached.)
1932
Arkansas Democrat Hattie Wyatt Caraway was the
first woman elected to the Senate. She had earlier
been appointed to the job after her husband’s death.
1933
Franklin D. Roosevelt named Frances Perkins sec-
retary of labor—the first woman to hold a cabinet post.
1949
Eugenie Moore Anderson became the first woman
U.S. ambassador. Her post: Denmark.
1964
Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith was the first
woman to have her name placed in nomination for the
presidency at a major party’s convention.
1974
Janet Gray Hayes (Democrat) became the first wom-
an mayor of a major American city—San Jose, Calif.
1974
Democrat Ella Grasso was elected governor of Con-
necticut—the first woman governor, as she put it, who
“was not previously a governor’s lady.”
1981
Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra Day O’Connor to
the U.S. Supreme Court.


urgently needed overhaul. But Mondale
also appointed Jimmy Carter’s old chum
Bert Lance general chairman of his cam-
paign—a move intended to strengthen the
party’s efforts in the South, but one that
antagonized those who hoped to avoid any
association with the Carter era.
The behind-the-scenes accounts of Mon-
dale’s decision to choose Ferraro, which
close aides described to Newsweek’s Mar-
garet Garrard Warner last
week, reveal much about
the man and his leadership
style. For one thing, despite
the bull market in cynicism
about his interview process,
aides say Mondale was dead
serious from the start about
picking a woman, a black or
a Hispanic. “He didn’t want
to be the first candidate
who considered a woman or
a minority,” says one top
staffer. “He wanted to be
the man who first opened
the door.” For another,
Mondale seems to have had
no preconceived notions
Hart: Only ‘old politics’
about his list of candidates —and though he
joined fully in the discussions within his
inner circle, he kept his options open until
the very end. “We always knew it would be a
highly personal, instinctive choice,” an aide
says. “In the end, he was simply most com-
fortable with what Ferraro represents, and
with who she is.”
The winnowing process began in early
June, when Mondale and his people knew
that the nomination was
theirs. The veep search was
headed by old friend John
R. Reilly, the Mondale cam-
paign’s all-purpose wise
man —and when the three-
week interview process fi-
nally ended, on July 6, Mon-
dale, Reilly and Johnson
squeezed into the tiny, trap-
ezoidal study of the Mon-
dale home and argued the
merits for hours at a time.
Mondale purposely kept
the debate directionless
until the final round: new
names popped up, and old
names kept recirculating.
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was a
sentimental favorite, Mondale was im-
pressed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and
both Henry Cisneros, the mayor of San
Antonio, and Dianne Feinstein, the mayor
of San Francisco, looked promising too. So
did Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and other white males—but despite much
public speculation, participants say, neither
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo nor Sen.
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas ever achieved
the status of Mondale’s first choice. Gary
Hart, who still insisted that he was running
for the presidential nomination, was being
pushed hard by party pols. Reilly met se-
cretly with Hart in a supporter’s George-
town home one June afternoon. Reilly felt
him out on the subject, and Hart seemed to
signal his willingness to take the No. 2 spot.
In the end, however, the supposed political
advantages couldn’t make up for what the
Mondale staff" saw as Hart’s erratic behav-
ior and personal incompatibility. “We sud-
denly realized to choose Hart would be ‘old
politics’,” an adviser said.
Ferraro seemed to have slipped. She had
impressed the Mondale cadre with her deft,
decisive work on the Democratic platform
Ferraro On Ferraro
On the back deck of a rented cottage
overlooking Lake Tahoe, Geraldine Fer-
raro talked with Newsweek about her
selection as Walter Mondale’s running
mate, her political philosophy and the
campaign ahead. Excerpts:
NEWSWEEK: How are you taking all
this? How do you keep your perspective?
FERRARO: Well, I have a job to do —
and the job is beating Ronald Reagan in
November —so I’ve got a lot of work
ahead of me.
Q. Some recent polls show that the
Southerners and older men have some
problems with you. Why do you think they
are reluctant to vote for you?
A. Oh, there are people who are straight
[Republican] party people
who would consider it a sin
to vote for a Democrat in my
district... I think others are
people who are extremely
conservative and don’t
share my views on the issues,
whether it’s war, peace or
the economy or whatever.
Q. How do you change
that view, male and female?
A. If we win 73 percent of
the vote in the country [as
she has in her own district],
I’m willing to give up the 27
percent.
Q. You’ve said that Ronald Reagan was
not a good Christian ...
A. No, I said his policies . . . were not.
Take a look at his budget priorities. Re-
member, I studied the Baltimore Cate-
chism, which taught me the basic tenets of
the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is
that you have an obligation to care for
those less fortunate than you.
Q. Some of the polls reflect concern over
your ability to have your finger on the
button and world security in your hands.
A. I can’t imagine that it’s me individ-
ually . . . I’m sure that when you talk
about a woman running for vice presi-
dent, everybody gives opinions and no-
body really knows what to expect. I don’t
know how much I’d rely upon those polls.
‘I have a job to do—and the job is beating Ronald Reagan’
MIKE PETERS— DAYTON DAILY NEWS
Q. Let’s talk about government spend-
ing. What about social security?
A. We curtailed it to save the system.
[Now] the system’s in good shape [and] we
have to address the problems of Medicare.
Q. In the platform there was a foreign-
policy fight about the Gulf. What circum-
stances would warrant American use of
ground forces in the area?
A. I think you have to leave that discre-
tion to the president to make that deter-
mination . . . The Gulf is more than oil
supplies. You have a concern over what
would happen if Iran were to fall, or what
would happen with Soviet expansion. On
the other hand, if Iraq would fall, what
would happen with the expansion of a
fundamentalist group as exists in Iran?
Q. So you don’t yet know what circum-
stances would force you, if
you were president, to put
troops in there.
A. That’s right ... I
haven’t sat down and gone
through these issues in great
detail with the Mondale
people.
Q. What if you lose?
A. I’ll probably look for a
job in January with a law
firm in Manhattan or in
Queens. Then I might do
a few polls for the United
States Senate seat in
New York.


committee, and her interview with Mon-
dale, at North Oaks on July 2, went toler-
ably well. But some of Mondale’s men were
unimpressed by the fact that many of her
answers to Mondale’s questions were
couched in political, not substantive, terms.
She disappointed them further when, with
Mondale standing beside her, she told a
crowd of reporters outside that Mondale
would make his decision on the veepship
entirely on political factors; Mondale him-
self had repeatedly stressed that he was
looking for help in governing. On July 8,
with his decision only 72 hours away, Mon-
dale asked his aides to begin final back-
ground checks on Feinstein, Dukakis and
Cisneros; Ferraro was not included.
Struggles: But the next day, working on
his acceptance speech, Mondale found him-
self thinking further about the congress-
woman from Queens. Ferraro, Mondale
said later, had “worked hard for everything
she’s achieved. She has a strong family life,
deep religious convictions” and firsthand
knowledge of the struggles and the dreams
of average Americans. “He started to real-
ize that she embodied the qualities he was
trying to say would be honored and encour-
aged again if he and the Democrats were
elected,” said one top aide. Another
thought Mondale “was more comfortable,
personally and politically, with a self-made
Queens housewife of Catholic immigrant
stock” —and a third said simply that “Fer-
raro is a political animal—and so is he.”
A top aide flew to New York for a back-
ground interview with Ferraro and her hus-
band the next morning—and by the end of
the day, it was clear that Ferraro was now
uppermost in Mondale’s mind. Reilly was
sent out to ask the penultimate question —
“Is there anything in your background we
ought to know about?” —and caught up
with Ferraro in San Francisco, where she
was getting ready to give a speech before the
World Affairs Council. Satisfied there were
no skeletons in her closet, he flew back to
Minnesota. Later that same day, he called
to ask where she’d be about 6 p.m., Minne-
Anti-Falwell protest in San Francisco: A woman veep was ‘long overdue’—but ‘futile’
apolis time. At 6, after more discussion and
two long walks with Reilly through the
woods, Mondale picked up the phone,
“Here goes,” he said.
In San Francisco, the word was trickling
out. Reilly had been tracked down by re-
porters and had not denied that he was
talking to Ferraro. Ferraro herself, mean-
while, had acknowledged to friends that she
was on the verge of making history, and she
nearly gave the game away during a ques-
tion-and-answer session after her speech,
“I’m happy there is no longer a sign, ‘white
males only need apply.’ It’s our turn, folks,”
she said—then added, “I may have just lost
the job.” She hadn’t—but Reilly and Mon-
dale went to elaborate lengths to get her to
Minnesota on the sly. Flying east on a char-
tered Learjet with Mondale supporter
Thomas Rosenberg, a Chicago real-estate
developer, Ferraro observed that it was a
beautiful, quiet night. “Enjoy it,” said
Rosenberg. “When you land, your life will
never be the same.” “I know,” she replied.
Rosenberg was right, of course. Mon-
dale’s announcement in St. Paul the next
day touched off tremors of delight among
Ferraro’s supporters in the “old-girl net-
work” of feminists and women pols —and it
triggered streams of outrage from conserva-
tives. Phyllis Schlafly, the redoubtable com-
mander of the campaign against the equal-
rights amendment, derided Mondale’s “act
of desperation, caving in to a group of radi-
cal feminists” (the National Organization
for Women, which threatened a floor dem-
onstration at the convention if Mondale
picked a man). The Rev. Jerry Falwell
praised the choice as “long overdue,” but
predicted that it would be an “exercise in
futility” against Reagan. And a woman call-
er to a Boston radio show demanded to
know “what business a woman has in the
White House” —and whether Ferraro had
“been through menopause yet.”
Attack: The news seemed to unsettle the
Reagan-Bush camp as well. Reagan’s peo-
ple predicted that the voters would ulti-
mately focus on Ferraro’s qualifications for
the job, which they considered lacking, and
on a liberal voting record they say would
undercut her image as a social conservative.
But they also conceded that Mondale had,
at the least, stabilized his foundering candi-
dacy with the bold choice, and some
guessed that the fall election would wind up
being much closer than the current margin
in the polls. One countertactic now under
consideration, they said, was to attack the
Democratic nominees’ claim to represent
the average voter. Mondale has been “doing
nothing as a fat-cat lawyer” since leaving
government, one source said, and Ferraro’s
husband, John Zaccaro, is a wealthy devel-
oper; as the battle for blue-collar America
heated up, the GOP would point that out.

In a new technique developed
by Hitachi researchers, crystals
are excited by light from an alkali
vapour lamp to produce a highly
efficient “optically pumped" laser.
Almost a quarter of a century ago, Hitachi
researchers began exploring how an exciting
new form of light could be made to serve
business and industry. The complex concept:
Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation. The legacy: “Laser,” a beam
with the ability to concentrate one million
kilowatts of power in a single pulse.
Light that cuts, cures and communicates
Today, the results of Hitachi research are
in use all around you. Laser diodes that can
send your phone calls and business data
across countries through hair-thin optical
fibre. Laser memory systems capable of
storing up to 40,000 pages of text on a single
12" disk. Digital-audio pickup devices for
utterly distortion-free sound.
In fact, we are constantly coming up
with new methods of applying laser tech-
nology to products. One of the latest: A unique
structure that boosts lasing power to the
highest level ever obtained by a visible-light
semiconductor laser.
The best of worlds is yet to come
Our vision of the future includes laser tele-
communications networks that span the
globe. Undersea tunnelling and mining with
laser excavating equipment. And much,
much more.
We'd like you to share in the benefits
of our scientific research, covering the next
generation of sensors, robots and other
electronic devices. For improved business
efficiency. For a higher quality of life. Two
goals we’ve pursued for 74 years as part of
our commitment to a better world through
electronics.

Reagan himself, meanwhile, delivered a
cheerfully defensive homily on the GOP’s
concern for women, citing his appointment
of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor to the U.S.
Supreme Court and predicting that the first
woman president would be a Republican.
Basking in the boomlet of positive
publicity that his announcement had
touched off, Mondale and his happy
protege launched the fall campaign with
a visit to his old hometown—Elmore,
Minn. Escorting Ferraro and her husband
to the frame house on East Mondale Street
where he grew up, Mondale told his for-
mer neighbors that “if Gerry and John
lived in Elmore, you’d love ’em —they’re
just like we are.” Ferraro played her cam-
paign debut like a veteran, handling a
question on abortion (she is personally
opposed to abortion, but pro-choice when
it comes to the law) with easy poise and
wasting no time in challenging George
Bush to a vice presidential debate. (Bush,
at the weekend, said yes.) She also man-
aged to open up the big question—can she
capture the women’s vote? —with a deft
joke. Noting that her home turf in Queens
is famous as the “Archie Bunker district,”
Ferraro quipped that “Archie didn’t elect
me [to Congress]—Edith did.” Mondale
stood beside her, beaming—and in Wash-
ington, the White House was listening
carefully, too.

The Jackson Dilemma
Behold Dr. Jesse and Mr. Hyde. Early last week, in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times, Jesse Jackson was on the
warpath: he lashed out at Jewish leaders who want “to make me a
pariah, ” at “white women” who “purloined” from him the idea of
a woman vice presidential candidate and at “the arrogant Aryan
press.” But by the time Walter Mondale selected Geraldine
Ferraro as his running mate —a choice made possible in part by
Jackson’s own barrier-breaking campaign this year—the candi-
date was complimentary and conciliatory, ardently denying
reports he might boycott the election in the fall. “Because I’ve
gone through bitter experiences, I’m better. I’m not bitter,”
Jackson told Newsweek as he prepared to go to San Francisco.
More to the point, his op-
tions seemed to be narrow-
ing. “I think it finally
dawned on him that he’d
better get with the pro-
gram,” says a feminist lead-
er who met with him last
week. Jackson’s problem is
that his electric appeal this
year has rested not in the
“program” of the party es-
tablishment but in his own
fiery independence. Does he
want respect as a power
broker or adulation as leader
of disaffected black Amer-
ica? Accomplishing both
isn’t easy. If he cuts a deal, he
looks less heroic to his pub-
lic. But in lashing out at the
process and its nominee, he
risks being ostracized by
blacks and whites intent on
beating Ronald Reagan.
How Jackson resolves that
dilemma at the convention is
now providing the strongest suspense in San Francisco. Flow he
resolves it in the fall could affect the outcome of the election.
Suddenly Jackson has come face to face with some unpleasant
realities of the electoral game he chose to play. A CBS-New Y ork
Times poll last week showed that a majority of black voters prefer
Mondale to Jackson as the Democratic candidate in the fall —
despite having voted for Jackson in the primaries. Only 4 percent
of black voters said they would be less likely to vote for Mondale if
Jackson didn’t support him, which severely undercuts Jackson’s
argument that his supporters would wait for a “signal” from him.
One Jackson aide admitted that the poll results were “devastat-
ing” to the Jackson campaign.
Emboldened by the poll and disturbed by the L.A. Times
Time out for the papers: The Democrats wonder, what next for Jesse?
JACQUES M CHENET— Newsweek
interview, Mondale stripped off the kid gloves last week. News-
week has learned that after announcing on television that he
didn’t think Jackson suitable to serve as his vice president,
Mondale privately called Jackson to square with him. “Jesse, I’m
tired of this. I’m tired of your playing to the press,” Mondale said,
adding that from now on, he was going to “return it to you as fast
as you give it.” Mondale was especially angered by Jackson’s
repeated attacks on the vice presidential selection process and by
his contribution to a black-Jewish rift within the party. To the
bemusement of Mondale aides, Jackson reportedly told Mondale
at the end of the conversation, “You know, this is the best
conversation we’ve ever had.”
Jackson’s ability to win 384 delegates is impressive and prece-
dent-shattering, but not much of a club to hold over Mondale’s
head. By picking Ferraro, Mondale has probably scotched Jack-
son’s chances of uniting
blacks and women to win
important platform fights.
And Birmingham, Ala.,
Mayor Richard Arrington
says flatly that Jackson’s
controversial platform pro-
posals —eliminating runoff
primaries, for example, and
reforming Middle East poli-
cy—won’t win. Only a bid to
change an antiquota plank
might have a chance, he pre-
dicts. Still, neither Arring-
ton nor Atlanta Mayor An-
drew Young, both ardent
Mondale supporters, envi-
sion any bitter splits.
Heart: Jackson himself in-
sists “the ball is now in the
court of the leadership” and
the convention itself.
“We’re doing nothing dif-
ferent than [Sen. Ted] Ken-
nedy in 1980,” he says. “If
there had been a respectful
accommodation of programs of importance to him, he would not
have worked [so little]. But since he was steamrolled, he simply
walked away... his heart was broken. I have striven hard not to
leave San Francisco with a broken heart or a broken party. ”
If Jackson can avoid leaving his heart in San Francisco, he may
take it to the South for the fall campaign. “Mrs. Ferraro has no
base in the South. Mondale lost to me in the South. Some
Southern strategy by state chairmen and the rainbow coalition
must be pulled together,” he says. If they can somehow get
through convention week, bones intact, those are words most
Democrats are happy to hear.

U.S. AFFAIRS
A Team Player
Can a liberal from a conservative district make a contender of Walter Mondale?
The graduate picked up her pen and
poured out her heart. “Dearest Mommy, ”
she wrote, "God took daddy, but He certainly
knew what He was doing when He gave me a
mother like you. You 're everything I want to
be and will try to be with time. ... All my
love, Gerry. P.S. Stop crying!!!"
The winner headed for Democratic head-
quarters in Queens. She had just beaten the
machine's man in a tough little primary. But
the general election lay ahead, and after
dinner there was work to be done.
She bought a bottle of wine; her
housekeeper had fixed a batch of
fried chicken. And by the time the
peace talks were over, she had the
regulars eating out of her hand.
The three-term congresswoman
gathered her chits and went to the
speaker of the House. She had paid
her dues, risen through the ranks.
Now she wanted a seat on the Budget
Committee because she was a wom-
an and the budget was a woman's
issue. Speaker Thomas P. (Tip)
O'Neill thought about it, then gave
her the job. ‘She gets along great
with the fellas, ” he later reflected.
“Some members might say she's an
ambitious, pushy broad. But you
have to be strong to succeed. "Before
long he was telling everyone that
Geraldine Anne Ferraro would
make a great vice president.
The Founding Fathers may not
have envisioned a size 6 veep. But
male hang-ups have never stopped
Ferraro. From the melting pot of
Queens she has risen to the upper-
most reaches of the Democratic
Party, a passage accomplished on
grit, drive and an uncanny knack for
turning adversity to advantage. At
48, she has raised a family, taught school,
practiced law, minded the House. And now
she may even make a contender out of Wal-
ter Mondale. She s the universal woman,”
says Barbara Kennedy, an old friend in
Congress. She passes all the tests.’
Ferraro arrived on the Democratic ticket
as representative of a new generation of
women in Congress. Where Bella Abzug
challenged, gave abrasive witness and ulti-
mately flamed out, Ferraro has been a team
player given to such words as “process” and
“outreach.” In all important respects she
has invented herself, bringing together
equal parts schoolmarm, prosecutor, femi-
nist and cloakroom pol. She is a moderate
from Archie Bunker territory. Her politics
are therefore eclectic. She is pro-choice on
abortion (though she says she would not
have one herself), against busing, for Jimmy
Carter’s MX, against Ronald Reagan’s. “A
broad intellectual mind that spends its time
pondering and looking to the future is not
what Gerry’s all about,” says Leon Panetta,
Thumbs-up style in Queens: Steinem’s cool, Humphrey’s heat
KEN REGAN— CAMERA 5
a colleague on the Budget Committee.
“She’s a terrific nuts-and-bolts politician.”
The Ferraro style combines alternating
currents of Gloria Steinem cool with Hu-
bert Humphrey heat. Her voice betrays her
as a New Yorker; her delivery is quick, and
she has the handshake of a Hoosier preach-
er. She takes Italian lessons to keep up with
her roots and her constituents. She drops
Greek words at her stops around Astoria.
“Want to hear me kvell [boast] about my
children?” she asks chuckling Jewish audi-
ences in Forest Hills. She has three: Donna,
22, John Jr., 20, and Laura, 18. And after 24
years of marriage, she still holds hands in
public with her husband, John, 51, an ex-
Marine who made his million in real estate.
She did not come so far so fast without
bruising some feelings along the way.
“What has she done?” an older sister in the
women’s movement once asked. “She’s an
old-style, male politician who came up to
Congress from the D.A.’s office in
Queens —a very political woman.” On pa-
per, her credentials are modest: a
teacher’s certificate and a night-
school law degree from Fordham
University. Her critics say her legis-
lative accomplishments are scant,
that she has a weak grasp of foreign
policy, and that even the rags-to-
Anne Klein story of her life is a little
treacly: Shirley Temple dressed up
by Horatio Alger. But the grousing
may be sour grapes. Who else could
have turned the creaky vessel of this
year’s Democratic Platform Com-
mittee into the Good Ship Lollipop?
Crisis: The voyage started during
the worst of times back in the De-
pression. Ferraro’s father, an Ital-
ian immigrant, owned a dime store
and a restaurant in Newburgh, a
sleepy river town up the Hudson
from New York City. Her mother
was a housewife. The Ferraros had
two boys: Carl and Gerard. But in
1933 the family had been in an auto
accident that killed Gerard and
threw Mrs. Ferraro into a crisis of
faith. From her hospital bed she
ordered that her son’s toys be buried
with him. Later, she kept his clothes
pressed, and for two years she re-
fused to go to church. Finally, the
family doctor suggested that a new
baby might be her best cure. The
replacement weighed in at 1014
pounds on Aug. 26, 1935. The Ferraros
named her Geraldine, after the little boy
who was gone.
The new daughter was born to expect
things to go her way. Her father called her
“princess” and showered her with presents;
her mother would not allow her to crawl on
the floor because it was too dirty. On the fast
track of her playpen she took her first steps.
But in 1944, when she was eight years old,
Dominick Ferraro died of a heart attack.
The family moved to the Bronx, then to a

working-class neighborhood in Queens. To
eke out a living, Antonetta Ferraro was
reduced to crocheting beads on wedding
dresses and evening gowns. She boarded her
daughter with the sisters at Marymount
School in Tarrytown. For a time Geraldine
considered becoming a nun. She also asked
her mother to teach her beadwork. Ferraro
tried her hand but remained an amateur
seamstress. She didn’t have a garment
worker’s calling.
Out of necessity, Ferraro became a work-
ethic striver. Skipping the sixth through
eighth grades, she finished high school at
16. She landed a full scholarship to Mary-
mount Manhattan College, where she edit-
ed the school paper and, for a time, tinkered
with the notion of becoming a journalist.
But on the side she also took teacher-educa-
tion courses at Hunter College, and went on
to teach English in the New York public
schools, studying law at night up
at Fordham. In 1960, during the
week she passed the New York
State bar exam, she married John
Zaccaro, an old beau. But she kept
her maiden name in tribute to An-
tonetta Ferraro’s sacrifices. And
when she collected her first law
fee, she split it with her mom.
Law and Order: All through the
’6os and into the ’7os she juggled
the demands of a growing family
with the difficulties of setting up a
law practice. Sometimes she put
her shingle out on the family’s Tu-
dor home in Forest Hills; some-
times she worked on her hus-
band’s real-estate deals;
sometimes she had a cubbyhole of
her own. In 1974, when her young-
est daughter was in second grade,
she was able to practice law full
time. With help from her cousin
Nicholas Ferraro, the Queens dis-
trict attorney, she landed a pros-
ecutor’s job heading a special bu-
reau for victims of violent crimes. One of her
cases involved a five-year-old girl who had
been raped. Cradling the weeping child in
her lap, Ferraro gently took testimony. She
came away a law-and-order advocate very
much in tune with New York’s Ninth Con-
gressional District.
On that particular stretch of turf, the
pressures were heavy on women to stay in
their traditional place—the kitchen, the
church and the bedroom. The district
basked in a polyglot wealth of Italians and
Irish, Greeks, Asians and Hispanics, with
just a sprinkling of blacks. It had a Demo-
cratic congressman: James Joseph Delaney,
an honorable old mossback who had held
sway for 16 terms. But it had also voted
heavily for Richard M. Nixon. “They’re
still bragging about it,” Ferraro recalls
with amusement. It would have been safer
to try the city council. But when her hus-
band said, “Why not Congress?” the die
was cast. Ferraro never looked back.
Her assets at first were personal, not po-
litical. She had a lawyerly mind, she set
goals and she could tap a bottomless store of
energy. When Ferraro wanted her kids to
learn how to swim, she organized a class and
taught it herself at her summer place on Fire
Island, inviting all the neighbors’ kids to
join in.
Tocal Gal’: These gathering forces drove
her into what looked at first like very dubi-
ous battle. Then Delaney scanned the hori-
zon and decided to retire. That left her to
confront Thomas Manton, an Irish city
councilman, and Patrick Deignan, an Irish
district leader. “She was an attractive local
gal,” recalls Manton, “a moderate to con-
servative politically, but not very ideologi-
cal.” Manton received the nod of the Demo-
cratic organization. But working the
supermarket lots, Ferraro piled up 5,000
signatures on a nominating petition. She
outspent both regulars in a $250,000 con-

test. To assemble the kitty, the Ferraros sold
off some real estate and took out bank loans
when they ran short. The day after the
primary, Mayor Ed Koch was out helping
her hustle votes at subway stops. She faced a
conservative Republican who accused her
of sending her children to posh private
schools. She ran on law and order—em-
bodied in her slogan, “Finally, A Tough
Democrat”—and piled up 54 percent of
the vote.
She reached Washington only to find that
she still had a long way to climb. Three
times during one lame-duck session on the
Hill, House guards failed to recognize her
and turned her away from the members’
entrance. She was green, a little tense and
given to gaffes. After visiting Greek refu-
gees on Cyprus, a touchy issue among some
of her constituents, she returned to take up
the matter from the House floor. She
tripped over the word Turks. “When are we
going to get those Turkeys out of there?” she
demanded, then doubled over in spasms of
laughter that ran out the clock on the
speech. For weeks afterward the old boys
around the House called her “Gobbledine.”
Shrewder heads looked a little more
closely. “While it may be harder for women
to get here, once they’re here, the place
opens up,” says one House leader. Per-
haps—but like the men, the women who get
along are those who manage to go along.
Ferraro was her own woman, but she took
care to cultivate the leadership. She asked
tough questions, but her manner was usual-
ly relaxed. “When Gerry got here, people
were used to outspoken women,” recalls
Congressman Barney Frank of Massachu-
setts. “But some women—and men —come
here with ideologies that keep them from
being pragmatic. She just isn’t like that.”
Adds Charles Rangel of Harlem, “She has a
heck of a personality. No matter what kind
of problem, she never lost her femininity.”
Ferraro’s most important po-
litical conquest was the speaker of
the House. One thing he liked was
the way she matched her con-
science and stands to the realities
of her district. If she was a Roman
Catholic opposed to abortion, she
was also a feminist committed to
choice in such matters, a very diffi-
cult position to sell back home.
She survived by neutralizing un-
popular stands with others closer
to the district’s conservative lean-
ings. She voted against school bus-
ing; she supported tax credits for
private- and parochial-school par-
ents. She became a prime mover in
opposing economic discrimina-
tion against housewives and work-
ingwomen. “She’s as solid as a
rock,” O’Neill concluded —and
he decided to help her along.
Under the patronage of the
speaker, she rose quickly. After
her first term she was elected sec-
retary of the Democratic Caucus.
That was mostly an honorific job. By tradi-
tion, it had gone to a woman. But the same
year party rules were changed to allow her
to sit on the Democratic Steering and Policy
Committee, a genuine center of power: its
brokers controlled committee assignments,
She easily won re-election in her Queens
district in 1980 and 1982.
The gender gap of 1982, so threatening to
male politicians, provided an opportunity
for Ferraro to help friends in need—and
collect political 1.0.U.’5. “Eve done a lot of
campaigning for guys in the House,” she
says comfortably. With other congressional
women like Barbara Mikulski of Maryland
and Pat Schroeder of Colorado, she told the
Women’s Campaign Committee that year
not to make sex a political obsession. “We
told them they had to take a look at where
incumbent men were on the issues, or we
wouldn’t support their organization. We
told them when you come up against a good

incumbent Democratic man, we’re not go-
ing to support you if you support a Republi-
can woman.”
When the Democrats emerged that No-
vember with 26 new seats, Ferraro and a
number of other women called on O’Neill to
cash in their chips. She received her seat on
the Budget Committee. The others also
received their first-choice assignments.
O’Neill called the move long overdue.
“They hadn’t sought those spots before,” he
said a bit disingenuously. At the same time,
one nettled colleague braced Ferraro on the
maneuvering. “You’re really using that [be-
ing a woman], aren’t you?” he sniped.
Ferraro was incensed. But she held
her temper and shot back, “Yes,
and when you need me to be used
as a woman to campaign for you,
I am there.”
If squelching catty men comes nat-
urally to Ferraro, dealing with the
women’s movement has been a far
more delicate exercise. While she is
strong on traditional women’s re-
forms—the equal-rights amendment,
economic equity issues and abor-
tion —she has made the Democratic
Party, not the movement, her vehicle
for action. “Gerry perceives herself
first as a leader of the Democratic
Party, second as someone who can be
instrumental in defeating Reagan
and third as a leader of the feminists,”
says Karen Kessler, executive direc-
tor of the Democratic National Com-
mittee’s New York branch. Betty
Friedan, the movement’s grand-
mother, praises her (“She’s no cream
puff; she’s a tough dame”). But the
two seldom meet.
Sore Point: The difficulties of
working within and without the sex-
ual-political complex have generated
their inevitable strains. “She plays
games in the House with men,” claims
one leading feminist. “If the congress-
men were honest, they would say how
they resent it, but they aren’t going to
tell you.” One problem came up when
Ferraro served as the House repre-
sentative to the Hunt Commission, a
body charged with reforming the del-
egate-selection process for the Demo-
cratic National Convention. The sore
point was a change in the rules giving
superdelegate appointed status to gover-
nors, senators and members of the House.
Because there are so few women in that
group (1 governor, 2 senators and 22 con-
gresspeople), the formula upset feminist
hopes for splitting the delegates 50-50 across
the sex line. Ferraro delivered the superdele-
gates for O’Neill. “Do you realize she’s being
used?” exploded one of the sisters afterward.
“They’d rather promote one woman who is
going to play ball than promote a woman
who won’t.”
As things turned out, it was a little harder
to say just who was using whom. Last fall
Ferraro decided to move to the bridge on
the Democratic Platform Committee. First
she told O’Neill, then she called Charles
Manatt, the Democratic national chair-
man, and invited him to lunch. “I really
want to participate in the convention,” she
told Manatt. “In what roles and in what
order of priority?” he asked. “Convention
chair, platform chair, rules chair,” she
shot back.
But it wasn’t entirely that simple. “Actu-
ally, I always wanted platform chair, so I
put it in the middle on purpose,” she now
confesses. “If you don’t get your first choice
and you’ve worked as hard as I have, you get
In confirmation white, on the beach: Temple by Alger
My mother, myself: Smiles on high-school graduation day
your second choice.” Manatt took some
time to think over the request. Not long
afterward, she returned from a trip to Cen-
tral America violently ill. The phone rang.
“Would you take the chair of the platform
committee?” Manatt asked with a gulp.
“I’d love to,” replied Br’er Rabbit. “I’m
feeling better already.”
Foreign Trade: The trip to Central Amer-
ica had been part of Ferraro’s larger design.
Well before she took over the platform, she
energetically let it be known that she was
correcting her deficiencies in foreign affairs.
She talked about her travels to the Middle
East and Central America. She pointed out
that she was a member of a congressional
group on U.S.-Soviet relations (“I may not
be so much a contributor as a listener”). She
even admitted that she had once attended a
trade conference with Gary Hart, where it
quickly “became fairly obvious that I didn’t
know all there is to know about foreign
trade.”
For a neophyte overseas, she apparently
handled herself well. On one occasion she
and Kennedy were in Central America
when an American pilot was lost in Hondu-
ras. “It was clear that the foreign minister
did not want to get into it,” recalls Kennel-
ly. “But Gerry said, ‘Wait a minute,
we’re representative of the United
States and we should talk about
this’.” That night the delegation had
dinner with some members of the
Sandinista directorate. Pointing out
how the Soviets had misread the
American reaction to the KAL 007
atrocity, Ferraro advised them to ad-
mit what had happened and send an
apology. “She laid the cards on the
table,” says Kennedy. And Barbara
Mikulski still remembers Ferraro
working the alleys of the Sabra and
Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon.
“Gerry said, ‘Let’s get off the road
and go door to door.’ She not only hit
the books, she hit the streets.”
While Hart and Jesse Jackson were
shagging vainly through the prima-
ries after Mondale, Ferraro turned
the platform committee into her own
very visible little roadster. The main
problem was to listen sympathetical-
ly to the endless demands of special-
interest groups. She ran into one
rough patch when she seemed intent
on a platform with no sharp edges at
all (“so those running for office can
run on it, not away from it”). She hit
another when she told a breakfast
group of reporters that she saw no
reason why the party couldn’t take up
women’s issues “without using capi-
tal E, capital R, capital A.” That
looked like a flat rejection of the
equal-rights amendment, and she had
to recant quickly. But she managed to
turn her apologies into good damage
control—and won points for fallback
finesse.
Even so, the summons from Min-
nesota was never a sure thing. Ferraro was
unusually tense in the days leading up to the
annunciation in St. Paul. “She doesn’t like
not being in control, not knowing—it
makes her nervous,” explained Donna Fer-
raro. She thought her first audition with
Mondale had gone well. Then came the
press leaks saying that she was accident-
prone and too eager for the job. “Dear
God!” she thought to herself. “Did I pick up
the wrong signals?” But before long, there
was Mondale on the phone. And with that
particular call, they both made history.

THE OLYMPICS
A Fear Factor at the Games
Ever since the massacre of 11 Israeli
athletes in Munich in 1972, the threat
of terrorism has hung over the Olympic
Games. The Los Angeles Games are*no
exception, but any would-be terrorists
will have to overcome a virtual army of
17,000 law-enforcement officers —more
than twice the size of the Los Angeles Police
Department—aided by the latest surveil-
lance and antiterrorist hardware and mili-
tary weaponry. “This will be the most
security-intensive Games in Olympic histo-
ry,” says Cmdr. William M. Rathburn,
Olympic security coordinator for the
LAPD. “We will be on the ground, in the
air—everywhere. ’ ’
Last week, in a grim reminder of how
SWA T team in Los Angeles: Are the death threats real —or a Soviet disinformation campaign?
JOHN BARR—USA 1ODAY
necessary such precautions may be, ugly,
threatening letters arrived at the Olympic
Committee headquarters in Zimbabwe,
Malaysia, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Hong
Kong and the People’s Republic of China,
Purportedly written by the Ku Klux Klan,
the letters, which were postmarked in a
suburb of Washington, D.C., threatened
death to black and Asian athletes. TheZim-
babwean letter, printed on a single sheet of
yellow paper, read in part: “The Olym-
pi cs —for the whites only! African monkeys!
... In Los Angeles our own Olympic flames
are ready to incinerate you. The highest
award for a true American patriot would be
the lynching of an African monkey.”
After examining some of the letters, U.S.
officials were quick to downplay the threat.
Whoever wrote them made some curious
errors: the insignia of the Ku Klux Klan was
incorrect (with a hyphen between the first
two words), and the language struck some
experts as a poor imitation of colloquial
American speech. The letter to Zimbabwe,
said a State Department spokesman last
week, “was not written by a native English
speaker and contains errors in grammar and
syntax that a native speaker would not
make.” In addition, the State Department
considered it curious that the sender had the
precise addresses of the Olympic commit-
tees in Zimbabwe and elsewhere, suggesting
a “sophistication” that hinted at the in-
volvement of a foreign government. “It
almost makes you wonder if it isn’t a disin-
formation campaign of some sort,” re-
marked Secretary of State George Shultz,
who was on a two-week tour of Asia last
week. Shultz didn’t say who he thought
might be responsible, but a spokesman for
the State Department pointed out that the
country that seemed to gain the most by
frightening other nations’ Olympic teams
was the Soviet Union. Said this official:
“The thrust of the leaflets, that a threat
exists for Olympic athletes from U.S. ex-
tremists, dovetails neatly with the Soviet
justifications for their withdrawal.”
Whether the threats were authentic or
not, law-enforcement officials in Los An-
geles last week were putting the finishing
touches on the massive security apparatus
for the Games. “The Soviet quarrels with
our security plan have no basis in fact,” says
Rathburn. Earlier this summer the U.S.
Department of Defense built a state-of-the-
art command post in Piper Center, a con-
crete and glass warehouse on the edge of
downtown Los Angeles. The Olympic Se-
curity Coordination Center is crammed
with computers, projection screens, a status
board and a closed-circuit-television sys-
tem. As many as 100 law-enforcement offi-
cials from dozens of city, county, state and
federal agencies will man the command cen-
ter 24 hours a day. They will get a constant
stream of intelligence reports detailing the
movements of virtually every known terror-
ist group; at their disposal will be specialists
trained in handling everything from gang
violence and hotel burglaries to terrorist
incidents.
Robot: The security force has also stock-
piled a huge cache of sophisticated military
and antiterrorist equipment, including sub-
machine guns with silencers, aerial covert-
surveillance devices, underwater communi-
cations gear and photo binoculars. Bomb
threats will call forth the services of
“Felix”—a 420-pound, 4-foot-7 radio-con-
trolled robot that has tanklike rub-
ber treads to climb stairs and curbs,
remote-camera capability and a
“shotgun de-armer” that can dis-
arm a bomb by shooting it before it
explodes. The mania for security
has affected even such mundane de-
tails as the uniforms of Olympic
guards and medical personnel,
which will be kept secret until the
Games begin; to further discourage
anyone from copying them, the uni-
forms have been designed in offbeat
shades and cut from fabrics pro-
duced only in limited quantities.
No matter how well crafted the
plans, officials face a nightmar-
ish tangle of potential problems.
Some 50 law-enforcement agen-
cies—With competing jurisdictions
and conflicting egos—are involved
in the security effort. Political wran-
gling has been a constant problem,
and once the Games begin, coordi-
nating the diverse agencies will be
no easy task. Moreover, the logistics
are staggering: there will be 11,000
athletes, coaches and trainers;
75,000 workers —including medical per-
sonnel, concessionaires and construction
workers —and 700,000 spectators at 25
events scattered over 10,000 square miles in
southern California. Ronald Reagan and as
many as a dozen other heads of state will
attend the Games. Still, security officials
insist they are equal to the task —and that
despite the heavy security, the spirit of the
Olympics will remain intact. “One of the
biggest challenges,” says Edgar N. Best, a
former FBI agent who is director of security
for the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing
Committee, “has been to keep in focus that
this is the Olympics—a glorious interna-
tional athletic event —not an international
security event.”

WORLD AFFAIRS
Shultz’s Fence-Mending Tour
Washington tries to improve ties to ASEAN as the group gains in importance.
George Shultz could not stop compli-
menting his hosts. In Hong Kong last
week, on the first stop on the U.S. secretary
of state’s seven-day tour of Southeast Asia,
he called the British colony “a shining star. ”
In Kuala Lumpur, Shultz praised Malay-
sia’s rapid economic expansion. And in Sin-
gapore, he lauded the country’s robust econ-
omy, its hard-working people and the
astounding modernization of its capital.
Shultz’s glowing words were testimony to a
new recognition in Washington of the in-

creasing economic and strategic importance
of a region the United States all but aban-
doned when it withdrew from South Viet-
nam 10 years ago. “This whole area is going
like gangbusters,” Shultz said in Kuala
Lumpur. “It’s a wonderful thing to see.”
The United States has been coming on
strong in Southeast Asia for several months.
Shultz’s trip was just the latest in a series of
fence-mending visits by high-ranking U.S.
officials, including Vice President George
Bush and United Nations Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick. Shultz’s visit coincided
with a meeting in Jakarta of the six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN)* and its Pacific “dialogue part-
ners” —the United States, Japan, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the European
Economic Community. He supported a
new agreement calling for an increase in
technological, educational and cultural ex-
changes among the 11 Pacific countries.
While its goals were limited, the agreement
was a tentative step toward increased coop-
eration among Southeast Asian countries—
and the emergence of what many hoped
would become a stronger, if more informal,
Asian version of the EEC.
Commitment: There was still friction be-
tween the Reagan administration and its
Pacific Basin allies. In Jakarta, Shultz ex-
pressed concern about human-rights viola-
tions in East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony that was invaded by Indonesia in
1975 and subsequently annexed. According
to a recent letter signed by 123 U.S. congress-
men, more than 100,000 people have been
killed or died of disease and starvation in
East Timor. For their part, the ASEAN
countries criticized Washington’s economic
policies. And the Malaysian government
expressed fears that improved Sino-Ameri-
can economic relations could lead to a
dangerous increase in Chinese military pow-
er. But at every stop, Shultz took pains to re-
assure the ASEAN nations of Washington’s
commitment to the region. “Our relations
with the ASEAN countries are the corner-
stone of our policy in Southeast Asia,” he
told his hosts in Jakarta. “We do not intend
to subordinate our interests in ASEAN to
the pursuit of better relations elsewhere.”
Washington’s attention to ASEAN has
confirmed what many of the organization’s
members have long believed—that South-
east Asia has shed Its reputation as a diplo-
matic backwater. In Jakarta, the ASEAN
members began to flex their political mus-
cles by taking on their communist neigh-
bor —Vietnam. ASEAN denounced Hanoi
for “deceiving the international communi-
ty” by pretending to withdraw troops from
Cambodia. It also requested more U.S. aid
for the coalition government of Cambodia,
particularly the two noncommunist fac-
tions headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and former Prime Minister Son Sann.
Washington indicated that it would provide
humanitarian rather than mili-
tary assistance. Shultz also
condemned Vietnam’s contin-
ued occupation of Cambodia
and its refusal to provide infor-
mation about missing Ameri-
can servicemen. He said it was
still “fruitless to speculate”
about normalizing U.S. rela-
tions with Hanoi.
Pact: ASEAN’s members
have long been able to agree on
many political issues, but the
organization has never shared a
common economic outlook.
Last week’s economic-cooper-
ation pact may bring the group
closer together. The organiza-
tion had previously resisted any
notion of large-scale economic
cooperation in the Pacific Ba-
sin, fearing in part that such an
organization would be domi-
nated by the United States and
Japan. But as their confidence
has grown, the ASEAN coun-
tries have cautiously embraced the idea. A
stronger economic union could make
ASEAN’s demands for trade concessions
more difficult for the West to refuse.
Still, the ASEAN countries remain
fiercely competitive with the rest of the
world—and each other. That attitude has
slowed the drive for economic cooperation.
The organization decided to table many of
the more ambitious proposals for an active
economic union. Some ASEAN members
believe the organization has enough clout,
even if an Asian common market does not
come to pass. “The United States and Japan
have to take note of ASEAN when discuss-
ing the Pacific,” said one ASEAN official.
But the real extent of ASEAN’s influence
will largely depend on the organization’s
ability to project the same degree of unity on
economic matters as it now does in the
political arena.

The Battles Go On and On
Breaking up a student demonstration: The fiercest protests since Aquino’s death
A. GARCIA— AP
The lines were drawn last week at Men-
diola Bridge, a principal gateway to
Ferdinand Marcos’s Malacanang Palace. A
band of 15,000 opponents of the govern-
ment stood face to face with 500 helmeted
riot police, combat marines and the elite
Presidential Security Guard. Agapito
(Butz) Aquino, younger brother of slain
opposition leader Benigno Aquino, stepped
forward and demanded that the marchers
be allowed to occupy a symbolic one-half of
the bridge. After negotiations, the govern-
ment forces retreated a diplomatic 10 feet—
and the demonstrators moved forward to
claim a victory.
That tense, four-hour confrontation
capped 10 days of escalating street
protests on a scale that Manila has
not seen since the early months
after the Aquino assassination last
summer. Beginning on July 4 with
an antinuclear demonstration out-
side the U.S. Embassy, police and
protesters met in several clashes
that left scores injured. For his
part, Marcos turned to his recur-
rent theme that most opposition
groups were “infiltrated by com-
munists.” And in the mountains
north of Manila, more than 3,000
troops launched one of the largest
offensives in years against the left-
ist New People’s Army—and
claimed to have captured evidence
linking the guerrillas to main-
stream opposition groups.
Far larger anti-Marcos out-
bursts are all but certain to come
as the anniversary of Aquino’s
death approaches. The bloodiest
confrontation to date took place
outside a textile factory in subur-
ban Manila, where police last week opened
fire on an angry crowd of striking workers.
At least 60 people were injured. After an
earlier rally at the Mendiola Bridge, the
government announced that all rallies held
without permits would be dispersed. But
that did not deter the marchers from com-
ing back. “We have come closer to Mala-
canang than we have in a decade,” student
leader Leandro Alejandro told the crowd
after its symbolic advance. “We are mobi-
lizing hundreds of thousands of people who
are willing to lay down their lives to con-
front the citadel of dictatorship.”
A more savage struggle was under way
amid the rugged peaks and valleys of north-

ern Luzon’s Cordillera mountains. Govern-
ment forces moved against an estimated 600
guerrillas who operate from what has long
been one of the NPA’s most secure staging
areas. Helicopters and World War 11-vin-
tage aircraft bombed and strafed a suspected
rebel stronghold near the village of Bugnay.
In one four-day ground operation, the gov-
ernment claimed to have killed 50 guerrillas.
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Fabian
Ver last week charged that communists—
including NPA hit teams, known as “spar-
rows”—had infiltrated the opposition. Mar-
cos repeated the charges, adding that the
NPA was now “actively manipulating” stu-
dent organizations, labor unions and even
business and professional groups.
‘Tolerance’: The government also claimed
to have unearthed its opponents’ plans for a
sweeping new campaign of civil disturb-
ances —which is hardly surprising given the
string of emotionally charged dates anti-
Marcos forces can exploit in the coming
months. Last week protest leaders unveiled
plans to mass demonstrators around the
National Assembly building on July 23,
when the newly elected but largely power-
less legislature is to convene. Officially, the
government remains pledged to a policy of
“maximum tolerance” toward protests. But
palace insiders say that Marcos would im-
mediately sweep all such promises aside if
his regime’s survival seemed seriously
threatened by demonstrations spiraling out
of control. In particular, one administration
official said, serious consideration has been
given to disrupting the opposition by pre-
emptively detaining key organizers consid-
ered to be “high on the order of battle.”
In recent weeks Marcos has hinted open-
ly at the possibility of reimposing martial
law, which was technically lifted in 1981.
But late last week he stated it would not be
reimposed. A major constraint is the devas-
tating effect such a move would have on his
government’s delicate negotia-
tions for $650 million in standby
credits from the International
Monetary Fund and for a restruc-
turing of the Philippines’ $26
billion foreign debt. At the mo-
ment, IMF officials are reportedly
unimpressed with the govern-
ment’s austerity measures, and
some officials in Manila fear that
the standby approval may not
come before next March. In the
meantime, popular unrest will
continue to feed off soaring prices
and the crippling shortages of es-
sential foreign goods caused by
lack of hard cash. But one item at
least is apparently too crucial for
the Marcos government to do
without: according to Manila
business sources, an emergency
letter of credit was recently
opened to allow imports of tear gas
from the United States.

PERU
Fighting the Guerrillas
Peru’s long-running bloody war against
leftist rebels looked as if it were coming
to an end. The shooting had died down and
the guerrillas had crept back into the high-
lands. Officials in Lima announced that they
had broken the spine of the Sendero Lumin-
oso (Shining Path), and President Fernando
Belaunde Terry pledged to lift military con-
trol in 13 southeastern provinces if the coun-
try stayed calm for 30 days. But only 48
hours later the guerrillas made a mockery of
the government’s optimism. They killed 335
peasants, police and Army troops, attacking
villages surrounding their traditional
stronghold in the southeastern province of
Ayacucho and hitting towns and police
posts as far as 700 miles to the north.
The month-old offensive is the broadest
ever launched by the Sendero. It has so
enraged Belaunde that, for the first time
since his election in 19 80, he has called on the
military to fight the guerrillas. In effect, that
is a frustrated admission that his govern-
ment’s attempts to defeat the Sendero have
failed. Until now, the administration has
relied on the police to fight the guerrillas in
the countryside, while the military has pa-
trolled nearby cities, serving primarily as a
reassuring presence for citizens. During the
last 18 months, public pressure for a broader
military role has mounted. But Belaunde has
held back, fearful that an overreliance on the
military could threaten Peru’s fragile four-
year-old democracy. Even now that he has
agreed to increased military involvement,
Belaunde is fighting off calls from within his
government to declare a “state of siege”—a
euphemism for martial law.
Such calls are troubling to
the United States. Reagan ad-
ministration officials do not be-
lieve that the rebels have the
public support or the armed
strength to impose the Marxist
government they seek. But, as
one U.S. State Department offi-
cial says, “They have the ability
to contribute to making Peru
ungovernable.” Peru’s fledg-
ling democracy is already tak-
ing a battering not only from the
guerrillas, but also from harsh
economic conditions, includ-
ing a foreign debt of more than
$l2 billion and an unemploy-
ment rate of 12 percent. In addi-
tion, as many as half of Peru’s
workers earn less than they
need because they cannot find
full-time jobs. “Peru’s problem is not one
dramatic thing, like a broken leg,” said Wil-
liam Perry of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies of Georgetown Uni-
versity. “This patient is chronically sick
from a number of different illnesses.”
Some Washington officials are privately
concerned that Peru’s continuing social and
economic problems could give rise to a mili-
tary takeover. But they openly voice another
concern: even if the military remains loyal to
Belaunde, they fear Peru could take a sharp
leftward tilt in next April’s general elections
and the subsequent presidential runoff.
Their anxiety is not without foundation.

last November. Leftist candidates capital-
ized on Peru’s economic disarray to triumph
in more than half the country’s provinces
where the ruling party had been in power.
Belaunde’s party must now reverse its
lame-duck image. The president himself is
forbidden by law to seek a second consecu-
tive term. “There are many people who feel
that if the situation doesn’t improve,” says a
U.S. official, “the choice is going to be be-
tween the far left and the center left.” Such a
choice might be anathema to Washington.
But for Peru, simply going to the polls next
April would prove the country still has a
democracy—even if it’s a beleaguered one.

A Show of Friendship
The bitterness between the two countries faded slowly after
World War II ended nearly 40 years ago, and a decade ago the
presence of a uniformed Chinese general in Tokyo would have
been unimaginable. But there at the headquarters of the
Japanese Self-Defense Forces last week stood China’s Defense
Minister Gen. Zhang Aiping, reviewing a Japanese military
honor guard before sitting down to a 30-minute meeting with
Yuko Kurihara, the civilian chief of Japan’s military. The
physical contrasts between the two men were striking: Zhang
was dressed in a bright green uniform and Mao cap, Kurihara
in a trim business suit. But appearances could not disguise their
mutual interests. “The unpleasant memories of Sino-Japanese
history have disappeared forever,” Zhang told his host. “The
history of our new friendly relationship has just begun.”
Zhang’s visit was the strongest sign yet of a growing rap-
prochement between Japan and China. The two countries have
found that their shared fear of the Soviet Union’s growing
military presence in Asia is beginning to outweigh their histori-
cal and political differences. Late last year Japan and China
started exchanging intelligence on the Soviet’s deployment of
SS-20 missiles in Asia and have discussed joint diplomatic
efforts to get them removed. Zhang even went so far last week
as to praise U.S.-Japanese security agreements as “necessary
for Japan to improve its defenses.”
Since the two countries began establishing informal military
ties 10 years ago, Peking has pushed hard for better relations.
China is keenly interested in Japan’s modern weapons systems
and military hardware, but is well aware of Tokyo’s strict
prohibition of military exports. Still, other high-tech Japanese
products could be of help to China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Zhang didn’t broach the subject with Kurihara. But that same
day Zhang Jingfu, minister of China’s State Economic Commis-
sion, met with the Japanese minister of international trade and
industry to discuss the possibility of private-sector sales of
communications systems and other items.
Even if the Japanese would agree to such trade, a true
military alliance with China seems unlikely. Other Asian
countries worry about the militarization of both nations,
especially China, and neither Peking nor Tokyo wants to
offend its smaller neighbors. In the meantime, the feeling on
both sides seems to be that gestures like last week's meeting
serve a useful purpose. “Our relations with China are not so
complicated as some imagine,” said a spokesman for Japan’s
Defense Agency. “If we can do something to keep up our
friendship, it certainly can’t hurt.”

Opening Up the Crate Caper
Dikko (center) leaving the hospital after his recovery: Relations worsen after a clumsy plot to abduct Nigeria’s ‘most wanted man’
The bungled kidnapping provokes a diplomatic duel between Britain and Nigeria.
Neither Britain nor Nigeria wanted the
fight. Nigeria is, after all, a senior
member of the British Commmonwealth
and London’s principal trading partner in
Africa. But relations between the two coun-
tries took a decided turn for the worse last
week in the aftermath of the bungled kid-
napping of Umaru Dikko, the immensely
wealthy former cabinet minister who was
found drugged and unconscious inside a
large packing crate at Stansted Airport.
Scotland Yard wanted to interrogate two
Nigerian diplomats in London; the Nigeri-
ans refused, claiming diplomatic immunity.
As the anger within the British government
mounted, Whitehall expelled both men and
announced that it would be “inappropri-
ate” for Nigeria’s chief envoy to return to
Britain. To get even, Nigeria
announced that it would expel
two British diplomats of equal
rank from Lagos and also
asked for the withdrawal of
Hamilton Whyte, the British
high commissioner in Lagos.
The diplomatic duel stopped
short of an outright rupture of
relations—but the bizarre case
was bound to cause problems
for both countries in the days to
come. If that were not enough,
there was the “Israeli connec-
tion.” Among the four prin-
cipal suspects whom British
Barak: Why Israelis?
UPI
police have charged with the kidnapping
are three Israeli citizens; the fourth is a
Nigerian diplomat who is not accredited to
Britain. The governments of both Israel and
Nigeria have denied any involvement in the
plot. The Nigerian junta has not, however,
made any secret of its desire to put Dikko on
trial for allegedly stealing vast amounts of
public money when he was an official in the
previous government headed by his broth-
er-in-law, former President Shehu Shagari.
The British press has speculated that
Mossad, the Israeli secret service, might
have had reasons for helping Nigeria to
bring Dikko home. In recent years, Israel
has tried to renew its contacts with some
of the black African nations that broke
relations with Jerusalem after the 1973
Arab-Israeli War. In Nigeria,
Israel currently has 2,000 busi-
nessmen and technicians. The
Israelis have also supplied
around $6 million worth of
paramilitary equipment to the
Nigerian police. In return, the
Nigerians reportedly have un-
officially provided Israel with
much-needed oil.
Immunity: Nigeria’s gov-
ernment, and many Nigerian
citizens, are demonstrably an-
gered by Britain’s success in
blocking the plot to capture the
man their government regards
as public enemy No. 1. As one leading Nige-
rian businessman put it, “The Nigerian man
in the street is convinced that the govern-
ment planned the operation. They are just
sorry it did not succeed.” At the same time,
the British are sick of seeing terrorism car-
ried out under the guise of diplomacy on
their soil; just three months ago a shoot-out
at the Libyan Embassy left a British po-
licewoman dead. In that case, as in this one,
some suspects simply invoked diplomatic
immunity and were allowed to leave the
country. Now the newspaper The Guardian
is calling the expulsion of the two junior
diplomats “a muffled message to Lagos.”
Special Surveillance: Scotland Yard
wasted no time in unraveling the clumsy
plot. It began early one evening two weeks
ago, when residents of London’s well-to-do
Porchester Terrace noticed a bright-yellow
van lingering for hours at a time on the
block. At one point the van pulled directly
in front of Dikko’s home. The following
day, Dikko’s British secretary heard a
commotion outside; she spotted the yellow
van driving away. Within 20 minutes,
Scotland Yard’s C-13 antiterrorist branch
had moved into action. Two of Britain’s
major airports were placed under full alert,
and Nigerian Airways was placed under
special surveillance.
A few hours later a freight agent in Guild-
ford, Surrey, called customs to say that two
crates of “extra cargo” were on their way to


a Nigerian Airways flight at Stansted.
When the crates arrived at the airport a
Nigerian official was waiting for them. The
crates were addressed to Nigeria’s Ministry
of External Affairs in Lagos. Customs
agents pried open the first crate, a four-foot
cube. Dikko was lying inside the box, un-
conscious, in a pool of his own vomit. A
bottle clamped to one of the walls fed medi-
cine into his arm. A man later identified as
Dr. Lev Arye Shapiro, a well-known Israeli
anesthesiologist, was in the crate with him.
Inside the second, smaller crate were the
two other Israelis.
A senior Israeli official in Jerusalem in-
sisted that the government of Prime Minis-
ter Yitzhak Shamir is “just as puzzled as
everybody else” by the presence of the Israe-
lis in the operation. The doctor, 44, is said to
have impeccable credentials and is report-
edly well off; he is in charge of a respiratory
intensive-care unit at the Hasharon Hospi-
tal in the Israeli city of Petach Tikva.
Shapiro had told his co-workers that he
was going to London “to accompany a pri-
vate patient.”
Along with Shapiro, Scotland Yard ar-
rested two other Israelis: Alexander Barak,
27, and Felix Aboutbul, 31. Barak, a native
of Natanya, an industrial town north of Tel
Aviv, is a businessman. He is said to have
both an Israeli and a Nigerian passport.
Aboutbul is the wealthy owner of a bar and
restaurant in Natanya. The three Israelis,
along with Mohammad Yusufu, the Nigeri-
an suspect, are charged with kidnapping
and with administering drugs with the in-
tent to kidnap. If they are convicted, the
length of their sentences would be entirely
up to the court.
Dikko himself has gone into seclusion in
Britain. He is one of four multimillionaires
“most wanted” by the Nigerian govern-
ment; together the four men allegedly si-
phoned off the bulk of around $l6 billion
that the government says is missing from
the Nigerian economy. Dikko denies the
charges. The government now charges that
Dikko is trying to assemble a mercenary
army to overthrow the current regime. Last
week Nigeria filed a belated request with
Britain for Dikko’s extradition, as if to ac-
cept a suggestion by British Labor Party
spokesman George Robertson that, if Ni-
geria wants justice, it should “use courts,
not crates.” Even so, Britain isn’t likely to
send Dikko home.

Facing Hard Times in Nigeria
When senior Nigerian military commanders
overthrew President Shehu Shagari last New
Year’s Eve, most Nigerians regarded the coup as a
cause for rejoicing. The Punch, a major daily,
called it “the greatest thing that has happened to
our people in the last four years”; businessmen
danced in the streets of the capital, and ordinary
citizens believed that Nigeria’s economic distress
would soon be over. That was not to be. Seven
months after the takeover, the national treasury is
as empty as it was under Shagari. Prices are sky-
rocketing, and Nigerians are increasingly dis-
gruntled with the authoritarian drift of the re-
gime. The bungled attempt to kidnap Umaru
Dikko is only the latest of the mounting troubles
now confronting the beleaguered junta.
Nigeria’s economic problems have pre-
sented the ruling generals with their most
formidable challenge. They confront the
same hard reality that plagued their civilian
predecessors: Nigeria’s potential prosperity
from its vast oil resources remains hostage
to the vagaries of world markets. Oil income
provides more than 90 percent of the na-
tion’s foreign exchange, but since the cur-
rent world oil glut began nearly four years
ago, those revenues have dropped from an
annual $26 billion to just over $lO billion
last year. OPEC ministers meeting in Vien-
na last week offered Nigeria some slight
relief by allowing Lagos to raise its current
production ceiling in August and Septem-
ber. But the country is already producing
too much oil, and any benefits from produc-
tion increases are likely to be marginal. As a
result of the loss of revenue in recent years,
the country has run up a total debt of close
to $4O billion. “For all practical purposes,”
said Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari, the
head of the junta, “this country is
bankrupt.”
Buhari has taken some forthright steps in
an effort to halt the economic slide. In May
he introduced an austerity budget that dras-
JOHN CHIASSON—GAMMA-LIAISON
Buhari (above), a Nigerian oil
worker: ‘This country is bankrupt’
tically cut government spending, limited bank
lending, increased interest rates and imposed im-
port duties on 400 items ranging from buses to
bricks. The government has also cracked down on
the rampant smuggling of oil products out of
Nigeria, which was costing the government an
estimated $ 1 billion a year. Meanwhile, negotia-
tions with the International Monetary Fund for
an extended loan of about $3 billion have dragged
on inconclusively for 15 months. Like Shagari
before him, Buhari has refused to bend to IMF
demands that he devalue the country’s currency.
But unless the government reaches an agreement
with the IMF, foreign banks will probably refuse
any new financing to Lagos.
Victims: The government has also alienated
many segments of the population. People in the
south were outraged when the northern-dominat-
ed junta recently singled out three southern-
ers for the first of a series of show trials of
allegedly corrupt politicians. At the same
time, newspapers that originally supported
the coup are now angered by new press laws
giving the government the power to close
down newspapers and to imprison journal-
ists for reporting the junta considers inaccu-
rate. Early this month two journalists from
the respected Guardian newspaper became
the first victims of “Decree 4.” They were
jailed for writing articles about a shake-up
in Nigeria’s diplomatic service.
Discontent among civilians may be the
least of Buhari’s worries, however. Diplo-
matic sources in Lagos suggest that Buhari
and the senior officers in the junta made
their move against Shagari last winter in
order to pre-empt another coup plot by
more radical junior officers. Those sources
say that the younger officers are still waiting
in the wings. If the generals fail to solve the
country’s economic problems, restive cap-
tains and majors might organize their own
Putsch. Whatever happens, power is not
likely to return to civilians for a long time.
Sad as it may be, there is no great clamor in
Nigeria for a return to democracy.

WORLD BUSINESS
Playing Politics With Quotas
The spread of‘voluntary’ limits on imports threatens to strangle international trade.
Dying: The American steel industry, 100-
plus; of outmoded technology, high-priced la-
bor, unfair foreign competition and exposure
to other hazards ofthe postindustrial age.
After studying the patient’s chart for
seven months, the U.S. International
Trade Commission decided last week that
the steel industry should be helped. By a
narrow 3-2 vote, it prescribed a controver-
sial remedy: the imposition of quotas to
provide a sustained period of protection
from foreign steel. Whatever help that may
be to the steel industry, the ITC’s proposed
course of therapy presents President Reagan
with an election-year dilemma. It also prom-
ises to encourage a troubling new phenom-
enon: the “quotafication” of world trade.
The question of how to best deal with the
problems of America’s ailing smokestack
industries is complicated and supercharged
politically, with millions of jobs and billions
of dollars at stake. It poses a special set of
challenges to Reagan, whose free-market
philosophy rejects the kind of “industrial
CREEPING PROTECTIONISM
In recent years, the United States has negotiated import
quotas on several products, mainly textiles, cars, steel
and motorcycles. As a result, nontariff barriers to manu-
factured products have increased dramatically.
Newsweek estimates based on U.S. Trade Representative data.

policy” measures advocated by Democrats
such as Walter Mondale. (The Democratic
nominee-apparent was quick to applaud the
ITC proposals.) In the case of steel, Reagan
is free to accept, modify or reject the ITC’s
complicated package of quotas and tariff
increases. Instituting the ITC plan would
risk a trade war with Europe and put a
severe dent in the already troubled econo-
mies of debtor giants such as Brazil. On the
other hand, declining to help the domestic
steelmakers would alienate a powerful com-
bination of businessmen and union mem-
bers in some key electoral states, including
Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. By
law, Reagan must act within 60 days, put-
ting his deadline in the teeth of the cam-
paign season.
The current prospect is that voluntary
agreements will spare Reagan the tough
choice. Two years ago Europe and Japan
accepted a variety of import curbs on most
forms of steel to forestall harsher measures.
Mexico and South Africa have recently an-
nounced cutbacks in their exports to the
United States. With the quiet
help of the Commerce Depart-
ment, American steelmakers are
now negotiating with the two
remaining unrestrained major
producers, Brazil and South Ko-
rea. If those deals are struck,
President Reagan will be able to
declare the steel-import problem
solved, rendering the more dras-
tic ITC scheme superfluous. “If
the thing were wrapped up in a
private deal,” says a senior U.S.
trade official, “it could remove a
big monkey from the president’s
back, politically.”
‘Appalling’: One way or an-
other, it seems certain that addi-
tional restrictions will be in
place before Election Day, and
that could prove to be a tougher
monkey to shake. When Ronald
Reagan, an ardent free trader,
took office, 20.3 percent of man-
ufactured goods sold here came
under some kind of import re-
straint other than tariffs. That
figure now threatens to jump
above 40 percent. Europe, Can-
ada and Japan are equally re-
strictive. “It is appalling,” says
Robert Lawrence, an analyst
at the Brookings Institution.
“The world [is] being pushed
farther and farther down
the trail towards managed,
manipulated, quota-dominated trade.”
That represents an insidious reversal of a
healthy modern movement. Since the end of
World War II the industrialized nations
have steadily cut all tariffs down to their
current levels of about 6 percent. In the
mid-’7os, stagnation of domestic markets
Japanese Hondas headed for U.S. showrooms:
brought increasing import pressures on
many industries. Rather than openly buck
the trend to lower tariffs, national leaders
began seeking “voluntary” agreements to
restrain trade. They go by a variety of
names —voluntary export restraints, or-
derly marketing agreements and managed
exports —but they all spell protectionism.
Says a ranking American trade official,
“There’s a real question whether quotafica-
tion . . . has completely canceled the effects
of the last couple of rounds of tariff
reductions.”
The best example of creeping quotafica-
tion is the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA).
In 1962 the developed countries negotiated
a “temporary” set of import guidelines on
cotton to fend off the emerging textile mills
of the Third World; shares for synthetic
fibers were alloted in 1973. Meanwhile, the
temporary agreement has been repeatedly
renewed, each time with tighter restric-
tions. In an ideal world the industrial na-
tions would have gradually abandoned
their textile industries to the more efficient

Third World producers. The MFA, says
Lawrence, “has let industrial countries like
Italy, Japan and West Germany remain
large [textile] exporters” and kept clothing
prices in the West artificially high.
Another major case of quotafication is
the agreement that limits Japan’s export of
automobiles to the United States. The Japa-
nese have made the most of the deal by
exporting their more expensive models, on
which the profit margin is greater. Detroit
has roared back to life under the protection,
but American car buyers are paying an
additional $4OO per car—money they
would otherwise spend elsewhere.
Japan’s response to import limits illus-
trates one problem with quotas. By giving a
country a fixed allotment, quotas remove
the incentive for further price cuts. Once in
place, quotas tend to linger longer than
planned. In addition, while both measures
artificially raise prices, quotas allow foreign
producers to collect the bonus profits; tariffs
give the money to the domestic government,
which can return it to its own citizens. Worst
of all, though, quotas hide the true costs of
policy from public view. In sum, Gary Huf-
bauer, senior fellow at the Institute for Inter-
national Economics, concludes that quotas
are “absolutely fiendish.”
War: And there is always the threat that
they could snowball. “Governments in Eu-
rope are under great pressure to protect their
steel industries,” says Paul Tiffany, profes-
sor of management at The Wharton School
of Finance and Commerce. “In this context
the ITC’s ruling [if adopted] is going to hurt
the Europeans and may spark a trade war.”
A sharp increase in trade barriers would be
devastating to the less-developed nations —
and the Western banks that have loaned
them billions of dollars. Brazilian Minister
of Industry and Commerce Joao Camilo
Penna has threatened to cut off payments to
American banks if Washington enacts new
steel curbs. “We really are into a diseased
state of affairs in trade,” says Hufbauer. “It
is pernicious, spreading all over the world,
and there’s no sign of a halt.”
Not everyone is so alarmed. While he
opposes quotas in principle, U.S. Trade
Representative William Brock believes they
may have done some good. Brock, who
helped negotiate the auto deal with Japan,
points out that American automakers
agreed to pump $5O billion into moderniza-
tion in return for restraints on Japan. The
ITC has conditioned its recommendations
on a similar program in the steel industry. “I
believe the message is getting through to
companies and workers alike, that they are
going to have to get competitive or die,”
says Brock. It is also true that the ITC
has rejected a number of petitions for
relief, including those from the footwear
manufacturers and the machine-tool indus-
try. Brock believes that as recovery spreads,
protectionist pressures will ease, especially
in the less-developed countries. “I say we’re
actually turning the corner,” he insists.
“I’m tremendously more optimistic than I
was six months ago.”
It is harder to be optimistic about the
American steel industry. In the past two
years domestic steelmakers have lost a
breathtaking $6 billion, closing more than
170 plants. Since 1979, 200,000 steelwork-
ers have lost their jobs. Demand remains
tepid, and imports, which accounted for 20
percent of the American market last year
and 25 percent in the first five months of
1984, have helped keep prices down.
Even a sustained period of moderniza-
tion would leave American factories sig-
nificantly behind the rest of the world. The
domestic industry currently produces 32
percent of its steel output by continuous
casting, the most advanced process, and
plans to double that figure in five years.
But Japan already produces more than 80
percent of its steel by continuous casting,
Domestic producers must also contend
with high labor costs. Steelworkers now
earn an average of $2O an hour in wages
and benefits, about 60 percent above the
typical American factory wage. But last
year the steelworkers made contract con-
cessions worth $3.5 billion. Says Gary
Hubbard, a spokesman for the United
Steelworkers of America: “There is no way
we would accept additional concessions.”
Brazilian steel comes ashore: Who gets hurt?
As both steel producers and unions see it,
the solution is a bill now in Congress that
would limit all categories of steel imports to
15 percent of the domestic market for five
years. The measure has more than 200 spon-
sors in the House, but is given little chance
of passing the Senate. Even so, the pressure
for protection is not likely to abate. “We’re
seeing in steel a repeat of the dreary path
of textiles,” says Brookings’s Lawrence, “a
world cartel enshrining high costs, ineffi-
cient production and little or no genuine
adjustment by the workers or businesses to
competitive realities.” The catch is that any
measure that raises steel prices will hurt the
industries that use steel: machine tools, for
example. That, in turn, would bolster the
machine-toolmakers’ case for import pro-
tection, and the web of quotas could grow
more tangled. Ensuring the survival of hob-
bled sectors of the American economy is a
risky operation: if done badly, it will leave
everyone ailing.

Asia’s Electronics Wars
Dedication ceremony at Samsung’s new microchip plant: The four dragons’ mount a high-tech challenge to Japan and the West
ssc
year. The corresponding figure for South
Korea was even smaller. But that picture is
changing quickly. Taiwan’s computer in-
dustry is expected to expand by more than
80 percent each year through the 1980 s,
and Seoul predicts that advanced compo-
nents will account for a third of its elec-
tronics exports by 1990.
Close links with foreign investors will be
one key to achieving this growth. Several
East Asian firms have developed commer-
cial ties with Western electronics power-
houses such as IBM, Control Data, Hon-
eywell and AT&T. Government support
will be equally important. To attract foreign
electronics firms and encourage local man-
ufacturers, Singapore has established one of
the most sweeping incentive systems in the
world. It offers foreign firms with “pioneer
status” tax holidays of up to 10 years and
complete repatriation of profits. In Taiwan,
the government offers foreign and local in-
vestors duty-free imports of machinery and
Japanese electronics firms have recently
picked up a Western habit: looking back
over their shoulders. In the past few
years, the four “little dragons” of Asia—
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sin-
gapore—have begun to move out of low-
cost, high-volume consumer electronics
and into the rapidly expanding world of
semiconductors, telecommunications and
computers. Their drive up the high-tech
ladder has clearly worried their more ad-
vanced competitors, particularly Japan and
the United States. And their big rivals may
soon begin fighting back, with a wave of
protectionism and efforts to embargo high-
technology exports.
The evidence of this boom is everywhere.
In South Korea, the giant Hyundai indus-
trial group plans to pour $7OO million into
seven state-of-the-art computer and ad-
vanced-electronics plants. Taiwanese firms
can now manufacture imitation Apple com-
puters for a knock-down price of less than
$2OO. And IBM, the world’s industry lead-
er, buys such computer “peripherals” as
printer mechanisms, keyboards and disc
drives in Singapore and ships them to affili-
ated plants all across the globe. The four
dragons are setting their sights high—per-
haps too high—but the explosion in Asian
electronics has clearly ushered in a new era
that could pit country against country in a
bitter fight for technological ascendancy.
The battle is developing quickly. For dec-
ades, East Asia’s newly industrialized coun-
tries have earned much of their export
income from assembling inexpensive ra-
dios, watches, televisions and other con-
sumer appliances. Now, these countries
want to broaden their industrial base by
developing products of their own. There are
several reasons for the shift. For one thing,
these countries are losing their comparative
advantage in labor costs. Prosperity has
driven up wages, while robots and other
technological advances have lowered pro-
duction costs elsewhere so dramatically
that plants in Japan and the United States
are now as competitive as those in Asia. At
the same time, lower-cost producers in Ma-
laysia, Indonesia and Thailand are moving
strongly into consumer electronics. China
looms as potentially the most threatening
competitor of all.
Model: The preferred solution to these
threats has been the same in all four coun-
tries: to turn out more advanced products
and, eventually, compete with the econom-
ic model they seek to emulate—Japan. So
far, the results have been unremarkable.
Exports of computers and related equip-
ment accounted for less than a tenth of

raw materials, and special state-backed
loans below market rates.
Not all of the four dragons are going to
fare equally well in the new competition,
however. Unlike South Korea and Taiwan,
Hong Kong has made little progress in
moving away from the simple assembly of
electronics components. Spending on re-
search and development is low, in part be-
cause of political jitters over the expiration
of Britain’s lease in 1997, and the govern-
ment has declined to offer the kind of invest-
ment incentives found elsewhere. “It is not
our job to give direct support to any indus-
try,” says Sir John Bremridge, the colony’s
financial secretary. That hands-off attitude,
many analysts say, could ensure that Hong
Kong will finish last in the unfolding elec-
tronics sweepstakes.
Cheap: There is less agreement about who
will win the competition. Taiwan has tradi-
tionally been at the forefront of East Asia’s
electronics thrust. The country’s biggest as-
set is its large pool of engineers and techni-
cians. Taiwan’s universities and technical
colleges provide 25,500 newly trained spe-
cialists every year. The country’s skilled
workers also come cheap. The average annu-
al wage for a Taiwanese engineer is $9,800 —
compared to $17,000 in Singapore, $12,900
in South Korea and $ 10,000 in Hong Kong.
Still, Taiwan’s position may be eclipsed
by South Korea. Seoul is devoting billions of
dollars to its electronics drive, and most of
the money is coming from four of the coun-
try’s largest companies: the Hyundai,
Daewoo, Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar
groups. While refrigerators, tape decks and
televisions will continue to be major rev-
enue earners, South Korea plans to concen-
trate on telecommunications, computers
and peripheral components. New licensing
agreements and joint ventures are being
arranged with foreign firms. And the coun-
try is beginning to step up state-funded
research efforts —particularly in fields that
are still too advanced for industry.
If the world electronics market were
unlimited, or if the four dragons could
count on large domestic markets to absorb
their production, the growing competition
would not be so serious. But it is doubtful
that the global economy will be able to
absorb the coming flood of electronics
equipment from East Asia. In fact, there
may not be enough room for both Taiwan
and South Korea, let alone all four of the
new high-tech entrants.
The key question is whether the four
dragons can grab a big enough share of
Japan’s market to make their efforts pay
off. They have already had some successes.
By concentrating on a limited number of
products—much as the Japanese did in
penetrating fields formerly dominated by
the United States —the four have largely
taken over the manufacture of transistor
radios, tape recorders and black-and-white
televisions. Similar inroads have been
made in other industries, most notably
shipbuilding, steel and textiles. Japan has
usually coped with such competition by
shifting to more advanced products, aban-
doning black-and-white televisions for col-
or sets, and now turning from color TV’s
to videotape recorders.
With the four dragons now pushing into
the most modern technologies, however,
that strategy is no longer enough—and Ja-
pan has reacted by slowing the flow of tech-
nology to its competitors. Earlier this
month, for example, Sumitomo Electric an-
nounced that it had licensed sophisticated
optical-fiber technology to South Korea —
on the condition that the resulting products
would be sold exclusively in Korea. And in
another recent deal, Victor of Japan author-
ized two Korean firms to manufacture Jap-
anese-designed videotape recorders, with
the stipulation that the Korean-made goods
would not be immediately exported.
Japan’s goal is not so much to withhold
technologies as to delay their use and, in
doing so, preserve its own competitive ad-
vantage. And the Japanese are not alone in
their worries. The United States is also
showing a new wariness in transferring
technology, and the West in general is be-
coming increasingly protectionist. The
challenge for the four dragons under these
circumstances is not only to industrialize,
but to do so in a way that will keep Japanese
and Western know-how flowing.

Japan: A Furor Over
A Cracked Rice Bowl
For centuries, farmers in northern Japan
have counted on the warm wet winds of the
tsuyu, or summer rainy season, to transform
their fields into the country’s rice bowl. But
abnormally cold weather has now cut into
four consecutive harvests, the most recent
of which is expected to be roughly 5 percent
below target. The shortfall has pointed up
fundamental flaws in the government’s
bloated farm-subsidy program and raised
the possibility that cheap, foreign-grown
rice will be imported.
The current problems may stem as much
from dubious official policies as from the
fickle weather. Over the past two decades,
per capita rice consumption in Japan has
dropped by more than a third, as consumers
have turned to Western-style bread, cakes
and cookies made with other grains. To
protect farmers, the Ministry of Agricul-
ture has bought and resold rice, paying
farmers up to $ 1,270 a ton, nearly five times
the world market price. It has also paid
thousands of farmers to replant 3.5 million
hectares with wheat and other crops. At a
cost of $3.4 billion last year alone, the two
programs managed roughly to balance sup-
ply and consumption—until mother nature
confounded the equation with this year’s
dismal harvests.
Worse still, agriculture officials an-
nounced in May that 200,000 tons of stock-
piled rice had been contaminated with in-
secticide. Last month Tokyo formally
requested the “return” of some 150,000
tons of rice that had been shipped to South
Korea during food shortages in the late
19605. But Japanese farmers saw the move
as a step toward opening the rice market to
foreign competition. “We are flatly opposed
to rice imports,” says Teruka Ishikawa,
head of the rice department at Zenchu, the
powerful Central Union of Agricultural
Cooperatives. “[The government] has al-
ways assured us of its support for complete
self-sufficiency in rice.”
Subsidies: Officials insist that the Kore-
an rice is technically not being imported
but simply “repaid,” and emphasize that
plentiful stocks—some 600,000 tons —of
table-grade rice remain. But they are
NIHON-NOGYO —SHIMBUN
Farmers rally in Tokyo for a price hike
also clearly hoping to reform the creaky—
and costly—system of subsidies.
Farmers nevertheless are lobbying for
larger reserves as a means of forestalling
future shortages. “We have repeatedly de-
manded that the whole rice reduction pro-
gram be scaled back,” says Ishikawa. “We
are at the mercy oftheweather.”Zenchuand
other farm-lobby groups have long been
among the most loyal supporters of the rul-
ing Liberal Democratic Party; late last
month Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
himself seconded their call for larger official
purchases of homegrown rice. Such a move
might well be opportune, given Nakasone’s
uncertain political fortune. But it would
only heighten complaints abroad that his
government cannot or will not move effec-
tively against Japan’s militantly protection-
ist farmers.

WORLD BUSINESS
OPEC’s Crumbling Facade
Yamani arriving in Vienna: Trying to cope with warring members and the global oil glut
PHOTOS BY RUDI BLAHA— AP
There is a wistful quality these days
about OPEC meetings, not unlike the
mood at reunions of old soldiers whose best
days are behind them. And so it was last
week in Vienna at the 70th gathering of oil
ministers from the 13 member nations. Two
days of closed-door talks in the gold-
trimmed, chandeliered ballroom of the Ho-
tel Inter-Continental produced none of the
bold announcements that used to shake the
foundations of entire nations, rich and poor
alike. This time the ministers sought only to
hold their shaky coalition together amid the
pressures of a world oil glut and a war
between two of their brethren.
Some observers doubted whether OPEC
would ever again control the world’s oil.
“OPEC has become just window dressing,”
says New York oil dealer Harry Newstein,
who was in Vienna monitoring the meeting.
“They can’t set prices or production quotas.
It’s just a togetherness club.”
But there was little togetherness in evi-
dence last week. The ministers spent most of
their time arguing over their year-old pric-
ing and production agreement. Some of the
poorer OPEC nations, especially Nigeria,
wanted higher production ceilings so they
could raise more foreign currency to pay
their debts and import bills. Others, such as
Saudi Arabia, preferred keeping—or even
cutting back —the cartel’s current 17.5 mil-
lion-barrels-a-day limit to keep the oil glut
from growing even larger. And the war
between Iran and Iraq continued to block
the election of a new secretary-general to
oversee the organization; the post has been
vacant for a year because the two countries
cannot agree on a nominee. When the meet-
ing ended on Wednesday, few issues had
been settled, and there was talk of holding
another special session before the next
scheduled meeting in December.
OPEC’s most troubling predicament is
the global oil glut. Estimates of the available
surplus in company and government hands
go as high as 180 days of consumption,
There are several reasons for the oversupply:
the long recession in Western industrialized
countries, worldwide conservation meas-
ures, increased production by Britain, Nor-
way and Egypt and even some quota busting
by a few OPEC members. All told, OPEC’s
daily production in the last few months is
said to exceed the official 17.5 million-bar-
rels-a-day level by more than 1 million bar-
rels. In part the flow was increased to offet
worries about the potential for a crisis in the
Gulf, where last week an-
other tanker, theßritsh-reg-
istered British Renown, was
hit by Iranian missiles, and
the Iraqis claimed sever-
al strikes. Ironically, the
stepped-up production has
caused spot prices around
the world to fall in re-
cent months, despite the
fighting.
Panic: Still, fears of a
protracted—or escalating
—war last week led the 21-
nation International Ener-
gy Agency (lEA) to take
some precautionary meas-
ures. At a meeting in Paris,
the group agreed to revise
its emergency plan to make
government reserves more
readily available to member
nations in the event of a dis-
ruption of oil supplies. Such
On guard: Looking for help
a plan might help avert the kind of panic
that caused prices to shoot up 160 percent
during the 1979-80 oil crisis. “The intention
of governments to coordinate their response
and to use their stocks quickly if need be,
should help to prevent panic buying,” said
Helga Steeg, the lEA’s newly appointed
executive director.
Such a crisis seems remote, however, as
long as OPEC members must continue to
increase their oil earnings to make up a
projected $ 10 billion current account deficit
for 1984. And since the cartel no longer has
the muscle to raise its prices at will, nations
such as Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela
badly need to increase production. Nigeria,
which hasn’t been exceeding its quota, went
into last week’s summit asking for an offi-
cial increase of 300,000 barrels a day in its
output allotment. The request ran into sur-
prisingly stiff opposition, despite the coun-
try’s desperate situation. It finally took the
support of Saudi Arabia to persuade the
members to grant Nigeria an increase of
100,000 barrels a day for August and
150,000 barrels a day for September. In
turn, the Saudis are likely to reduce their
output by the same amount.
Increasingly, the focus of OPEC’s efforts
has been on controlling its own members.
Iran, in need of funds to finance its war
against Iraq, is offering deep discounts to
help regain some of the customers it lost due
to attacks on tankers in the Gulf. Just this
month Japan resumed purchases of Iranian
crude, after Teheran cut prices to more than
offset the higher insurance premiums
charged to ships passing through the Strait
of Hormuz. And as long as prices are falling,
some members will probably continue to
flout the production quotas.
Message: OPEC is hoping that coopera-
tion from outside the cartel will help
strengthen its hand. Mexico, for one, backs
OPEC’s efforts to regain control over world
prices. “We are here to appeal to OPEC for
a return to discipline,” said Mexico’s under
secretary of energy, Eliseo
Mendoza Berrueto, who ob-
served the talks. Saudi Oil
Minister Sheik Ahmad Zaki
Yamani plans to carry the
cartel’s message to other
major non-OPEC produc-
ers, including the Soviet
Union, “if I can get a
visa.” Yamani is not likely
to find much sympathy on
his tour. Norway’s minister
of petroleum and energy,
Kare Kristiansen, has al-
ready said that his country
would maintain its produc-
tion levels. Wherever Ya-
mani goes, it is hard to imag-
ine that anyone could give
him a harder time than his
friends in OPEC.

THEATER
Satire, South African Style
The theater is full, the audience expec-
tant. As the lights go down, a fashion-
ably dressed woman, in a large hat and a
feathered boa, wanders uncertainly down
the center aisle. She stumbles across the
footlights and gropes her way along the
curtain. Suddenly the audience breaks into
applause. It is Evita Bezuidenhoudt, am-
bassador to an imaginary “homeland,” and
the most famous character played by South
African satirist Pieter-Dirk Uys. Evita is a
cunning sendup of a privileged band of
South African women, the wives of the rul-
ing National Party. It was she who arranged
Prime Minister Pieter Botha’s recent trip to
Europe, she tells the audience: “I wanted to
prove to him the world is round.”
This is, believe it or not, an age of political
satire in South Africa. Uys is but one of the
country’s many satirists and comedians
who have flourished in recent years as the
government has relaxed its censorship poli-
cies. Three comics—Uys, Robert Kirby and
Jeremy Taylor—have been particularly
successful, performing in theaters and
nightclubs throughout the country, making
records and videotapes and appearing on
radio or television. They have drawn some
fire from the government. Taylor was once
deported for his critical songs, and all three
must still contend with demands from the
National Censorship Board to soften their
material. But, all in all, they’re getting away
with a lot by South African standards.
Kirby is particularly inventive. He uses
any medium he can think of to get laughs. In
his latest show, “Brave New Pretoria,” he
uses giant animated heads to mimic Botha,
Black Affairs Minister Piet Koornhof and
other political figures. He once designed a
“censorship machine” made of sirens, hoot-
ers, bells, steam whistles and flashing lights
that went off whenever he used four-letter
words. The censorship board unwittingly
joined Kirby’s act by sending him a telegram
demanding removal of the epithets. The
telegram quoted the words in question, and
Kirby promptly demanded an apology not
only to himself but to “all the young ladies in
the Central Telegraph Office who had to
handle —and no doubt read —this offensive
message.” He then placed huge blowups of
the telegram in the theater lobby to show
how “our authorities conduct themselves.”
Songs: T aylor’s chief weapon is music. His
songs dig at every aspect of South African
life, but his humor has a more gentle, teasing
quality than that of Uys or Kirby. In much of
his satire Taylor imitates a wide range of
South African accents; in fact many of his
compositions are sung in a mixture of both
English and Afrikaans, making them —and
their humor —difficult to translate. At the
same time, his songs can be angry. In his
latest record, for example, Taylor attacks
the violence and cheapness of life in South
Africa and the indifference South Africans
often show in the face of tragedy. “Perusing
the Sunday paper, at home the other day/I
read about a traffic cop who died when he got
in the way/He stepped out into the highway,
to wave down a speeding car/But the driver
didn’t see him and flattened him on the tar,”
he sings in one verse, followed by a sarcastic
refrain: “Ag, shame.”
Clearly the most successful of the humor-
ists is Uys (pronounced Ace), who is cur-
rently packing in audiences in Johannes-
burg with impersonations of everyone from
cabinet ministers’ wives to Botha himself.
Uys as the prime minister: Last laugh
MARK PETERS
As the prime minister, he launches into a
lengthy speech attacking political enemies
before turning to his vision of the future of
the country. Suddenly he repeats himself.
Then he repeats himself again. And again.
The record is broken, and the audience is
howling. Uys disappears for a few minutes
and returns as an elegantly gowned young
woman from an upper-class Johannesburg
suburb. She files her nails, gives orders to an
offstage houseboy and then confides to the
audience that she and her husband are leav-
ing the country. “We don’t approve of
apartheid,” she explains, “and we can’t
stand blacks.” The audience almost always
roars its approval, which delights Uys no
end. When dealing with the South African
government, it’s always good to have the
last laugh.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Imagine, a World Without Cockroaches
The creature has survived for perhaps 350 million years,
through all of nature’s changes and all of man’s attempts to
eradicate it. But now, the seemingly invincible cockroach may
have met its match. Zoecon Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif., a
subsidiary of Switzerland’s Sandoz Ltd., is attacking the pest in
a new way. Rather than trying to poison the roaches, which has
proved ineffective because of the insects’ amazing ability to
develop resistance to insecticides, Zoecon is aiming to kill the
bugs before they are even born.
The chemical agent that Zoecon uses is hydroprene, which
works by disrupting the cockroaches’
reproductive systems. It is, in fact, birth
control for roaches, which makes some
sense considering that the company’s
founder, Stanford University chemist
Carl Djerassi, was one of the inventors
of the human birth-control pill. Hydro-
prene closely mimics the juvenile hor-
mone found in roaches. Exposure to
minute amounts of the chemical stunts
the maturation process of the insects,
crumpling their wings and leaving both
male and female roaches unable to re-
produce. Tests by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture have shown the product
to be quite effective. A single spraying
of one apartment complex in Florida cut the roach population
by 95 percent in eight months. Since hydroprene is not a poison
and disrupts only the roaches’ own hormonal system, it should
have no ill effects on humans or other mammals, birds or fish.
Because hydroprene doesn’t actually kill roaches, users of
the product will not see an immediate decline in the numbers
of roaches. But because many homeowners take comfort in
seeing quick results from bug sprays, Zoecon says hydro-
prene will likely be mixed
with a traditional insecti-
cide to kill some roach-
es immediately. The U.S.
Environmental Protection
Agency recently gave its
approval to Zoecon to start
marketing hydroprene, and
the company says it will be-
gin shipments to profes-
sional exterminators this
autumn and to the public
sometime next year.
Better Than a Bed?
After surgery or illness,
some patients must spend
weeks, or even months, in
bed while recovering. It can be a frustrating time, not just for
the immobilized patients but also for their nurses and attend-
ants, who have to adjust the position of the bed to stimulate the
patients’ muscles and prevent bedsores. Recently, however, a
Dutch company has developed an adjustable chair that may
free patients from much of the discomfort and restrictions of
confinement to bed —and lessen tfr e need fo? - continual atten-
tion from nursing aides.
The Axioma chair from Kembo B. V., a leading manufactur-
Axioma chair: Taking the pressure off
First Responder: On-the-spot instruction for medical treatment
er of hospital furniture in the Netherlands, adjusts to almost
any position, from nearly horizontal to fully upright. By using
a control knob on the armrest, the patient can tilt the chair on
its curved base to shift his or her weight, thereby stimulating
blood circulation. The footrest also lifts up to support a pa-
tient’s extended legs. But unlike a flat bed, the Axioma chair
allows patients to exercise their arms and legs, and to sit up to
eat or converse.
The chair is built on an aluminum frame, which keeps its
weight down to about 65 pounds, including a small battery
underneath the seat. A foot pedal on the side of the chair locks its
wheels to keep it from rolling downhill. Removable foam-
rubber cushions come in various thick-
nesses to fit individual needs. Kembo is
currently producing two models of the
chair, and is considering adding a mo-
torized version to the line. The basic
chair costs about $BOO, plus options
such as a detachable eating tray.
First Aid by Video
A worker on an offshore oil rig is
seriously injured and goes into shock.
Will his co-workers know what to do to
save the man’s life? Is the right equip-
ment available to give emergency treat-
ment until a helicopter can arrive to
take the worker to an onshore hospital? For this and similar
emergencies, a new company in Washington, D.C., is working
on a product that makes use of new technology to help un-
trained people administer emergency treatment.
The First Responder Program is essentially a large first-aid
kit with a video player and monitor that can provide audio-
visual instructions from a prerecorded disc. The disc contains
step-by-step instructions for the treatment of various injuries
and illnesses. By referring
to a list of instructions, the
user can ask the disc player
to show the procedure for
treating burns. The expla-
nation will direct the user
to the “burn drawer,” one
of several numbered draw-
ers in the cabinet. The
drawer will contain the
necessary bandages, salves
and ointments needed to
treat burns.
The standard First Re-
sponder kit provides in-
struction on 11 types of
treatment, and other sub-
jects can be added. The
audio portion of the instruc-
tion has two sound tracks. This makes possible instruction in
two languages or separate programs for preventive instruction
and actual emergency treatment. The unit is housed in a
stainless-steel cabinet that weighs about 100 pounds when fully
outfitted. It will run off electric or battery power. The First
Responder Program is being produced by International Train-
ing & Education Systems Technology, Inc. The price of the
standard kit is about $8,900.

“Like any business, we like to know the arithmetic before we
invest in office equipment. In this case, one of our sister
companies had done a full evaluation of four different makes
of facsimile transceivers. They’d actually had the machines
in situ for evaluation. Their conclusion was that the Panafax
Facsimile was the one that could achieve the highest speed
and maintain it for the longest period of time and always
gives clear copies. We know how thorough their testing
was, so we were quite confident in following their
recommendation.
Already, we see clear evidence that it will pay for itself
in well under two years - perhaps as quickly as within.
14 months. One of our major requirements is for
reliable, high-speed clear transmission of
information, often hand-written
between Australia and Japan.
Previously, our Japanese Hino
truck representatives had to write
their message in English, have it typed, then
typed onto the Telex machine.
Now, hand-written messages, in Japanese,
are fed straight into the Panafax so all that
extra time and work is saved, plus whatever
else could previously be lost in translation.
Transmissions to our Tokyo parents have
benefited by the increased speed of the
Panafax.
Our communication cost with Japan, on an
annual basis, runs in the tens of thousands of
dollars and the savings we are making via
Panafax are already significant.
On a cost basis, and on standards of speed,

has to be the best all round.”

“Our frequent failures to take into account their ways of thinking and

“YOU AUSTRALIANS don’t care a
hoot what we feel about things,” Indo-
nesia’s Foreign Minister, Dr Mochtar
Kusumaatmadja, said in the course of
an unusually hard-hitting interview with
The Sydney Morning Herald’s Peter
Hastings in Jakarta last month. “You
have done many serious things to injure
Indonesian feelings.”
“Why should we care?” an Austra-
lian might reply. “Hurting someone’s
feelings cannot be compared with beat-
ing people over the head or with the
‘mysterious killings’ of alleged criminals
or with depriving others of land or lib-
erty, as you have done in East Timor
and Irian Jaya.”
“That’s our business, not yours. A
matter solely within our jurisdiction as a
sovereign state,” the Indonesians would
retort.
“You Australians are interfering in
Indonesia’s domestic affairs with your
irrational obsession over the East Timor
and Irian Jaya situations,” charged
Merdeka, one of Jakarta’s more xeno-
phobic newpapers, recently. Even the
most temperate of them frequently have
said much the same thing, though in
more measured terms.
One could pursue the argument fur-
ther, debating questions about human
rights and the limits of the domestic jur-
isdiction plea. Much more could be said
on both sides of the argument about the
rights and wrongs of Indonesia’s take-
over of East Timor (but not of her lregal
rights in Irian Jaya) and the turbulent
politics of post-colonial state formation.
But to go into all that would lead me too
far away from the central questions
about why the hurt feelings matter.
Hurt feelings, irritation and frictions
of this kind are not thought usually to
be the stuff of which major international
conflicts are made. (Not, at least, since
Henry V, in order to provoke war with
France, sent the dauphin a gift of tennis
balls). And there is an element of hyper-
bole in the “hurt feelings” explanation
of why Australia’s relations with Indo-
nesia have deteriorated recently; it
serves the Indonesians as a convenient
excuse or smoke-screen so that more
embarrassing issues can be evaded. But
in this case the whole argument matters
to Australia for a quite different reason;
not because it will lead to open conflict
but because it will result only in dead-
lock between us and that would have
serious disadvantages for Australia.
This whole tangle of issues epitom-
ises a basic difference about the ways in
which Indonesians see the world and
think about political issues compared to
the ways Australians do. But that in it-
self is not a sufficient cause for conflict.

OPM guerillas with their flag: their activities along the Irian Jaya border are causing tension between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea
Fortunately, apart from East Timor
and Irian Jaya, there are not other sub-
stantive issues in dispute between us at
the moment which would provide
dangerously combustible tinder for any
sparks of animosity that might result
from divergent perceptions and values.
The maritime boundary demarcation
problem in the Timor area is unresolved
but not unresolvable. On broader stra-
tegic issues, there is a high degree of
agreement between our two govern-
ments at present.
The principal reason why all this
matters to Australia has to do with the
broader question of how, in the decade
ahead, this country is going to work out
the full implications of its geographical
and political relationships with Asia.
That is bound to mean some degree of
mental and cultural adjustment on our
part (and theirs) to take account of
Asian ways of thinking about, perceiv-
ing and evaluating what goes on in the
world around us.
We Australians have our deeply-held
principles and beliefs which we will in-
sist on retaining (as over human rights
and democratic liberties). Asians have
theirs, which are in many respects quite
different. Unless there is some degree of
give and take on both sides, Kipling’s
dreadful phrase about East and West,
that “never the twain shall meet,” will
prove disastrously correct. Australia
will remain isolated from the region to
which it belongs.
This means, in the case of Australia’s
relations with Indonesia, that if we Aus-
tralians believe it is vitally important to
cling at all costs to our principles and
beliefs without any concessions to their
point of view, we will have to be pre-
pared to accept the consequence: mis-
understandings and strained relations
with the Indonesian Government and
its people. We would be committing
ourselves to the politics of confronta-
tion and conflict rather than the politics
of convergence and co-operation.
One cannot play it both ways simul-
taneously. If we want to avoid the con-
frontation option, we will have to take
more account of their views, their
sensitivities, susceptibilities and dis-
tinctly different values. It takes two to
tango. And if we don’t even try to tango,
we will be left standing at the side as
Asia’s wall-flowers.
INDONESIAN attitudes towards Aus-
tralia have varied considerably from
time to time and place to place. What
the Balinese in Kuta think about the
droves of Australian cut-price tourists
they encounter is bound to be very
different from what a Jakarta kampung-
dweller thinks. He might never see an
Australian but he does hear what Radio
Indonesia has to say about us, reflecting
the government’s attitudes of the day.
Some Indonesian officials may ex-
press quite hostile opinions about Aus-
tralia or Australians because we create
problems with which they have to cope.
Others who have had constructive deal-
ings with Australians over matters of
technical co-operation or foreign aid
frequently reveal friendly attitudes. We
tend to be less overpowering than Am-
ericans, less formal than the Dutch or
Germans.
But we are still seen as white and
alien to Asia. Not part of the family, as
even the Japanese are seen to be, though
Indonesian attitudes to them are highly
ambivalent, too.
Australians were regarded as In-
donesia’s staunchest friends during the
years 1945-49, when the Chifley Gov-
ernment supported them in their
struggle for independence. But memor-
ies of that honeymoon phase of our re-
lationship have faded as the older In-
donesian leaders have been replaced by
the younger generation who know little
about the events of that time and feel no
great sense of obligation to us.
It may have been partly because of
memories of that earlier support for
their independence struggle that In-
donesian attitudes towards Australia re-
mained reasonably cordial even during
the years of Sukarno’s confrontation of
Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, when Aus-
tralian troops were shooting at In-
donesians on the Sarawak border.
Sukarno was excoriating the British and
Americans as nekolim (neocolonialists
and imperialists) whose political and
military power he was trying to elimin-
ate from South-East Asia. But he
reiterated that Australia was not inclu-
ded in that category, partly because we
belonged to the region and could not be
expected to go away; partly because we
were not powerful enough to pose any
real threat to Indonesia, as the other
nekolim did. Diplomatic relations be-
tween us were endangered seriously at
no point.
It is in some ways paradoxical that
relations between the two countries re-
cently have become as strained as they
were in the mid-60s, when we differed
quite fundamentally on political and
strategic issues of major importance to
us both. That is by no means the case
today.
The explanation, of course, is that
the East Timor episode embittered
many people in both countries in 1974-
75. And just when the raw feelings
aroused in Indonesia by our criticisms
of her actions in Timor were beginning


to subside, the whole question
was reactivated by the ALP’s
adoption of its 1982 confer-
ence resolution on Timor,
which the Hawke Govern-
ment then had to deal with
when it came to office.
To summarise what the In-
donesians think about us
today, I would stress four
main features in the overall
pattern of their perceptions.
FIRST, irritation at what
they see as our excessive
and patronising moralism,
coupled with anger over our
frequent manifestations of
rudeness or insensitivity to
their feelings in expressing
our views. This is where the
cultural differences between
us cut deepest. Australians
deem it a virtue to call a spade
a spade. Indonesians speak el-
liptically or allusively, skirt-
ing around contentious issues
rather than tackling them di-
rectly.
Our inability to communi-
cate on this plane in fact,
our frequent failures to take
into account their ways of
thinking and feeling at all
are seen as at best discourtesy
or lack of consideration; at
worst sheer arrogance. They may be
willing to overlook such shortcomings
when there are no particular causes of
contention between us but not when we
are lecturing or hectoring them.
SECOND, Indonesian officials re-
gard Australia these days as unpredict-
able, erratic and unreliable, our policies
too easily influenced by what they con-
sider to be radical minorities. President
Suharto is said to have complained
some years ago: “I have seen five Aus-
tralian prime ministers come and go
since I became President. Yet still Aus-
tralians keep talking about Indonesia’s
‘instability’.”
His notion of stability no doubt is
very different from an Australian view
but he has a point. I do not mean to
imply here that this rather jaundiced In-
donesian view of the erratic or unstable
character or Australia’s more demo-
cratic political system is an accurate or
well-informed one. It reflects the
Suharto regime’s distaste for political
pluralism and its preference for strong-
ly-entrenched authoritarian govern-
ment. But that is a common viewpoint
these days and we cannot disregard it.
THIRD, in Indonesian eyes, the fact
that Australians are white, rich and not
essentially different from their former
colonial masters is something they can
never ignore entirely. So we are seen
very much as outsiders to the region, an
outpost of white civilisation.
Foreign Minister Mochtar: well-disposed towards us
Twenty years ago, many Indonesians
were inclined to overlook this because
they believe Australia was seeking to be-
come part of Asia or identify closely
with the South-East Asian region. I
doubt if this view is held so commonly
today, so we are still regarded very
much as outsiders in relation to the
ASEAN group.
FOURTH, to set these rather nega-
tive views in perspective, it must be
emphasised that Australia and Austra-
lians are regarded rarely with positive
hostility in Indonesia, even in the cir-
cumstances of distinct strain prevailing
over the past couple of years. We pose
no threat and do not have a high profile
in Indonesian daily life for the most
part, as do Americans or Japanese. On
the contrary, the fact that Australia is
not very powerful but is technologically
quite advanced works in our favor in
various respects.
It must be stressed, moreover, that
what government officials say about
Australia and what the ordinary people
think may diverge considerably. But
official views do percolate into the pub-
lic consciousness and many In-
donesians believe now that Australians
are meddling improperly in their
country’s business over the Timor and
Irian Jaya questions.
Even at the official level, attitudes
vary. It is probably true to say that Dr
Mochtar, the Foreign Minister, has a
fairly well-informed under-
standing of Australia and is
reasonably well-disposed
towards us, despite occasional
outbursts of irritation at some
of our public utterances and
policy stances which make his
job harder.
Before he was appointed
Foreign Minister in 1978,
Mochtar had been a law pro-
fessor specialising in inter-
national law, particularly on
the question of Indonesia’s
maritime boundaries. A
graduate of Yale Law School,
he has visited Australia sever-
al times for negotiations on
the latter issues and is recog-
nised widely as an able law-
yer, with a quick mind and
wide mental horizons.
Mochtar may not be a par-
ticularly influential figure in
the Jakarta political world
and he has to share the deter-
mination of Indonesian for-
eign policy to a considerable
extent with the military lead-
ership, which lays down its
line quite heavy-handedly at
times. Yet we are lucky that
there is someone as intelligent
and generally conversant with
Western societies as Mochtar
heading the Foreign Ministry. We could
do far worse.
The same could hardly be said of
General Benny Moerdani, the Defence
Minister and Armed Forces head, prob-
ably the most powerful figure in Indo-
nesia after Suharto himself, to whom he
is a close and loyal confidant. Moerdani
probably represents, albeit in rather ex-
treme form the general Indonesian mili-
tary attitude towards Australia these
days. He is said to be fed-up with Aus-
tralian pin-pricking over the Timor and
Irian Jaya issues and no longer in a
mood to be accommodating to us on
those matters or anything else.
This was not always the case. A few
years ago he was not especially ill-
disposed towards Australia: in fact, sev-
eral Australian journalists got on quite
well with him, as did former diplomat
Bill Morrison, who had become ac-
quainted with him years before in Kuala
Lumpur when Moerdani was In-
donesian ambassador there. On several
occasions Moerdani used his influence
to assist Australian journalists and TV
teams. But he is said to have felt be-
trayed after he had gone out of his
way to help Richard Carleton and an
ABC team over a program on East
Timor in 1977, but its unsympathetic
presentation of the Indonesian side of
the story.
Moerdani feels that Australians
simply have not understood the nature


of the problems that confront Indonesia
over the Timor situation and have not
tried sufficiently to do so. He is also in-
clined to regard both the present gov-
ernment and its predecessor as weak
and indecisive over the issue, lacking in
the firmness that the military mind
admires.
He would not have much under-
standing of the difficulties with which
Australian governments have to cope in
dealing with parliamentary questions,
intra-party pressures and press criticism
over issues such as Timor and Irian
Jaya. The Indonesian leadership does
not have to bother too much about such
inconveniences (though it has other
constraints upon it of quite different
kinds, as all developing nations do).
Moerdani has been vested by
Suharto with wider and more effective
authority over the Indonesian armed
forces than any previous commander-
in-chief, but this does not mean neces-
sarily that he or his subordinate com-
manders have close control over every
captain or sergeant in the far-flung
reaches of the archipelago or can keep
account of all their dealings with the lo-
cal people. Like the ramshackle civil bu-
reaucracy, the Indonesian armed forces
are still a loosely articulated set of units
with far from adequate communications
facilities at many levels. In Irian Jaya,
Brigadier-General Sembiring, the intel-
ligent and capable military commander
General Benny Moerdani with his daughter: he is fed-up with our pin-pricking
goes on in that great wilderness, though
they bear ultimate responsibility for it.
It is hardly surprising that Moerdani
gets irritated by constant Australian
carping about Indonesian shortcomings
there, no matter how well-justified some
of it may be.
As for Suharto himself, few people
know him well enough to have much
idea what he really thinks on any sub-
ject, particularly about Australia.
His relations with Gough Whitlam
were good in 1973-74 and Bob Hawke is
said to have established good rapport
with him, something that is important in
dealing with such an intensely personal
system of government. But Suharto’s ex-
perience of Western-style political
systems has been limited and he would
not find it easy to comprehend the
labyrinthine intricacies of ALP fac-
tional politics over an issue such as East
Timor, let alone have much sympathy
with that sort of thing. He has much
weightier problems on his plate.
The point I would stress above all
concerning the way Indonesians think
about Australia is that it is not only
what we do or say that affects their per-
ceptions of us. Equally important if
not more so is the way they see us
through a lens or prism that is colored
by their experiences of the world in gen-
eral, their concepts, thought-processes
and value-judgments. These have
changed from time to time since 1945 in
accordance with changes in the political
circumstances and ideology prevailing
in Indonesia.
We could form a misleading im-
pression of their conception of us if we
fail to take into account factors such as
this. It is noteworthy, for instance, that
many Indonesian leaders in recent years
have refused to believe protestations by
the Australian Government that it can-
not curb the Australian press or censor
is an old associate of Moerdani’s and a
man with quite enlightened forward-
looking views about the socio-economic
development of that sparsely-populated
province.
(Being a Christian Batak he has been
better able than his predecessors to es-
tablish contact with the Christian
missions and their Irianese followers
there). But he does not always get his
way on policy issues and neither he nor
Moerdani can control everything that

the ABC or Radio Australia. This would
be almost inconceivable in Indonesian
circumstances so they suspect us of
evasiveness or hypocrisy in maintaining
that it cannot be done here.
Time and again I find myself coming
back to this realisation that the way they
see or talk about us can be understood
only in terms of the way they think
about or mentally construct their own
world, for that provides the points of
reference against which they see ours.
They see Australia as an erratic and
unreliable country by Comparison with
their own high-centralised and authori-
tarian bureaucratic polity. They see us
as Unsure about our national identity
because we lack many of the attributes
of national identity that are familiar
(and precious) to them.
That is why we need to get inside
their world if we are to achieve anything
like a full understanding of their per-
ceptions of themselves or the outside
world including ourselves. It is not
easy to do that. But unless we make a
serious effort to do so, we will misunder-
stand grossly what the Indonesians are
saying or thinking about us or any-
thing else. □
PNG suspicious of its big neighbor
SINCE 1961, when Indonesia’s Presi-
dent Sukarno announced his resolve to
defeat the formation by the Dutch of a
free Papuan state in Irian Jaya, Indo-
nesia has been the bogy man for most
Papua New Guineans.
While university students in other
capitals were demonstrating against
multinationals and the H-bomb, Port
Moresby’s were trampling on the In-
donesian flag and demanding freedom
for their brothers across the border.
The government turned a blind eye
to the propoganda activities of the Free
West Papua Movement (the OPM) in-
side its own borders and politicians
have given voice to the unflattering
opinions of most of the electorate.
Papua New Guineans are suspicious
of Indonesian intentions and the sus-
picion was not assuaged by Indonesia’s
takeover of East Timor. Despite this
public disquiet, the three PNG govern-
ments since independence in 1975 have
been pragmatic in their relations with
their big neighbor. They have offered
goodwill and co-operation and insist
that there are no difficulties that cannot
be resolved.
To take any other view, PNG Prime
Minister Michael Somare believes,
would be irresponsible. His first duty is
to safeguard the welfare of three million
Papua New Guineans who, like it or
not, live next-door to 160 million In-
donesians.
All the difficulties so far have been
confined to the land border about
750 km long, virtually unmarked on the
ground and probably unmarkable.
PNG Foreign Minister Rabbie
Namaliu was in Jakarta again last week
discussing the latest problem: what to
do about 9000 to 10,000 Irian Jaya lo-
cals who have crossed into PNG, appar-
ently seeking refuge.
Both Indonesia and PNG recognise
that there always have been traditional
border-crossers because of family con-
nections and there also have been bona
fide refugees, some of whom have been
given permanent residence by the PNG
government. But the latest 9000 to
10,000 “refugees” are a new problem.
Most have crossed the border this
year.
Their mass arrivals followed a crack-
down by the Indonesian military on the
OPM guerillas. Port Moresby sources
say only a small proportion could be
regarded as political refugees.
This is a view shared by Colonel
Colin East, a former chief of staff and
deputy commander of the PNG De-
fence Force who also has the distinction
of having been attached to the In-
donesian army for 13 months.
East said in Sydney: “Simple subsist-
ence farmers and their families, without
any political motivation, are inclined to
flee when they are scared. They go back
when things quieten down.
“Indonesia’s armed forces chief,
General Benny Moerdani, who is a
hawk, is ruffled by what he sees as Aus-
tralian attitudes to Indonesian affairs in
Timor and Irian Jaya and he probably
Colonel Colin East: “Moerdani is a hawk”
ordered a tough offensive against the
OPM to clean them out.”
There are also pressures on Irian
Jaya villagers from Indonesia’s trans-
migration program which is settling
people from other parts of Indonesia on
Irian Jaya land, especially in the south.
PNG has expressed its fears to Indo-
nesia that resentful, dispossessed village
people can only cause PNG more prob-
lems if they continue to move into PNG.
And it has protested at the number of
border incursions by Indonesian forces
apparently trying to round up dissidents
or stop them from secretly getting aid.
The strength of PNG’s recent pro-
tests has surprised even the Australian
Government but there should be no
doubt that, despite its policy of peaceful
co-existence with Indonesia, PNG
would react militarily if it felt its border
was being violated deliberately by In-
donesian troops.
In the meantime, the PNG govern-
ment is faced with its immediate prob-
lems: how to identify the genuine refu-
gees, how to expatriate the others and
how to keep the OPM guerillas and
their supporters from operating from in-
side PNG’s borders.
All the border crossers are a strain on
local resources.
PNG officials are putting the border
crossers into categories following
guidelines laid down by the United
Nations. In Jakarta, Namaliu and his
officials have been working out repatri-
ation plans with the Indonesians for the
people PNG is confident are not bona
fide refugees but displaced villagers.
Meanwhile, PNG has started to at-
tack its other major problem stopping
the OPM rebels from gaining sanctuary
in PNG. About 120 troops last week
moved into part of the northern border
area where the OPM has been active,
taking over from the police riot squad.
And in Vanimo, on the border, six men
have been charged with being members
of an illegal paramilitary organisation
the OPM. □

NEW ZEALAND
New PM faces
problems with
ANZUS, dollar
Prime Minister Lange celebrates his win: New Zealanders are looking for a golden touch
AAP-AP
By IAN TEMPLETON
DAVID LANGE, with help from some
unusual friends, has become New Zea-
land’s youngest prime minister this cen-
tury. The snap election called by Sir
Robert Muldoon ended with victory go-
ing to the Labor leader.
But it was a tougher race than the
opinion polls had indicated and had it
not been for the intervention of the New
Zealand Party which gained more
than 12 percent of the aggregate vote,
most of it from the National Party
Labor could have been pipped at the
post again.
As it is, Labor will have a comfort-
able majority in the new parliament
with 56 seats to 37 National and two
Social Credit. Once more New Zealand
will have a minority government, with
Labor commanding only 43 percent of
the vote.
If those raw statistics suggest a less
than wholehearted response to the
Labor appeal, there is little doubt that
Lange fought a finely-judged campaign
that avoided the excesses to which
Labor has been prone. He concentrated
on the theme of bringing New Zealand
together, of healing and reconciling the
divisions created by nearly nine years of
Muldoonism.
Offered the long experience and
pragmatic skills of Muldoon, the elec-
torate chose the relatively untested
Lange. Clearly the disenchantment with
Muldoon ran deep and most particular-
ly in National seats, where the New
Zealand Party attracted up to 20 percent
of the vote.
After the harsh years of the Muldoon
era, through the longest recession this
century, New Zealanders are looking to
Lange to bring a golden touch to gov-
ernment. Lange himself rejects that
Midas touch. His critics say he has more
the qualities of the faith-healer.
Lange has yet to cast much light on
how he will resolve some of the difficult-
ies New Zealand faces. One of those has
been compounded by the election of a
Labor government. There has been a
sustained flight out of the New Zealand
dollar because of the belief that a Labor
government would devalue the dollar.
Lange has said he will take the for-
eign affairs portfolio. But even before he
can assume it — the change of govern-
ment is not due to take place until next
week — he is being faced with the di-
lemma of New Zealand’s future role in
ANZUS. Labor’s pledge has been to re-
negotiate the treaty, as well as to ban the
visits of nuclear warships.
The American delegation ac-
companying Secretary of State George
Shultz to Wellington for the annual
ANZUS council meeting has been
pointed in its off-the-record comments
that if New Zealand rejects the visit of
American warships, nuclear or conven-
tional, it cannot expect reciprocal de-
fence commitments. What has surprised
some Labor policymakers has been the
pressure from Australia to retain the
ANZUS commitment.
Shultz told a news conference in
Canberra, before flying to Wellington,
that the ANZUS pact would be weak-
ened if US ships were not allowed to
visit New Zealand ports.
He said: “It has to be possible for the
military forces of the respective coun-
tries to interact with each other, other-
wise it is not much of an alliance.”
Lange’s party, even before it became
the government, looked to the Bob
Hawke model for some of its election
themes. But the new Prime Minister
may not find it so easy to use the Hawke
Government’s line over ANZUS.
Lange is committed to the concept of
a nuclear-free New Zealand, then a nu-
clear-free South Pacific. Many of the ac-
tivists in his party believe it should be
the first action taken by the new govern-
ment “to lead the world towards dis-
armament.”
The last two Labor governments
lasted only one term each. This fear of
again being a one-term government
haunts Lange’s team. But it believes that
by modifying the strategy Hawke used
across the Tasman it can emerge as
popular as the Hawke Government.
But it may need some more discreet
help from across the Tasman. Certainly
Lange is looking for an early solution to
the trans-Tasman investment row to
show that he can succeed where
Muldoon failed. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Bread and butter issues
big guns in the food war
Advertising agencies are doing booming business as staple foods battle changing lifestyles and
perceptions to hold their once-presumed positions in the Australian marketplace. MICHAEL
MEAGHER reports on the wooing you may expect from media campaigns and why it is so.
PROMOTION of staple foods is big bus-
iness for advertising agencies in 1984-
85. Rural product marketing boards
most statutory authorities will spend
more than $4O million on sugar, red
meat, milk, other dairy products and
eggs alone. All these are foods which
Australians are assumed to eat as a mat-
ter of couse. The money is going to push
the generic product, rather than brands.
Farmers are pinning their hopes on
advertising campaigns increasingly. De-
pressed world markets and prices for
staples have forced the marketing bod-
ies to look harder at the local market.
European Economic Community
subsidies have squeezed export op-
portunities but the home market for
prominent staples has been either stag-
nant or declining.
As Table 1 shows, per capita con-
sumption of beef and veal has dived
from 67.5 to an estimated 41.8 kg since
1977-78. Corresponding figures for
sugar are 49.3 and 46kg, respectively.
Milk figures show a marginal gain to
102.9 litres a head but dairy authorities
say that the financial year just ended
brought a national decline of about 0.5
percent.
Consumption of table butter, after
falling dramatically in the 1970 s and
losing ground to margarine, is on the
improve according to the Australian
Dairy Corporation. Its general manager,
Brian Norwood, says that the decline of
table butter sales was arrested in 1981-
82 and consumption was up 4 percent
the next year, then 6 percent in 1983-84.
The corporation has been advertising
the virtues of butter consistently and
heavily for the past three years. It has
also had cheese, lifting
consumption a head to 7.5 kg in 1982-83
from 5.6 five years before.
The aim of the cheese campaign is to
lift the average to 9kg by the end of next
financial year. The promotion of local
product in the corporation’s “Invite our
cheese to dinner ...” and similar tele-
vision commercial themes makes good
sense to the producer.
The bulk domestic cheddar cheese
CSR’s Tony Thirlwell: a puzzling decline in per capita sugar consumption
price is around $2200 a tonne. Because
of costs and subsidies, the same cheese
brings $lOOO less when exported.
Norwood says: “If we lift cheese
consumption from 7.5 to 9kg within the
three years to 1985-86, it would mean an
extra 23,000 tonnes of cheese for the
local manufacturer (Australia’s popula-
tion figure multiplied by the increase).
The end result would be a $23 million
increase in dairy product revenue.”
Marketing authorities are lifting ad-
vertising budgets across the board.
Farmers are being asked for extra levies
to pay for the promotions.
The Queensland Sugar Board is likely


to increase national campaign spending
from $3 million in 1983-84 to $5-6 mil-
lion this year. The restructured Austra-
lian Meat and Livestock Corporation
(AMLC) this year will lift red meat pro-
motion substantially.
The dairy corporation has $11.5 mil-
lion allocated to promotion of man-
ufactured products, mainly cheese and
butter, against $lO million last year. The
Conference of Australian Milk Author-
ities, through continuation of the “Live
on milk” campaign and the various
state campaigns for low-fat and fla-
vored milk, will allocate some $lO mil-
lion to promotion this year. Egg boards
throughout Australia will spend a fur-
ther $6-7 million for their product
whose consumption either has been
static or has gradually declined over the
past three years.
The chief beneficiaries of the staples
splurge are the advertising agencies.
Apart from billings, statutory mar-
keting bodies bring the agencies status.
It is prestigious to have government on
the client list.
The D’Arcy MacManus & Masius
agency (DMM) has become a specialist
in farm products. DMM handles the
dairy coporation’s cheese, butter and
cream accounts and also the national
white milk promotion. Other clients are
egg boards in three states NSW, Vic-
toria and South Australia. DMM until
recently also held the Australian Wool
Corporation account, now with
Monahan Dayman Adams. DMM says
that it differed with that corporation on
strategy. The agency did not re-submit
for the business.
Monhan Dayman Adams,
traditionally a holder of gov-
ernment accounts, also man-
ages the Australian Meat and
Livestock Corporation.
Staples promotion has
been very kind to cartoonist
cook Peter Russell-Clarke
who is employed as a creative
director at DMM’s Mel-
bourne offices and is front
man in commercials for
cheese, butter, cream and
eggs.
Russell-Clarke joined the
Victorian egg marketing au-
thorities in the mid-70s and
was developed as a presenter
of egg recipes. After a three-
year break, he is back with the
egg body. He also works for
the Bread Manufacturers As-
sociation in Melbourne and
does egg promotion in NSW
and SA. Personalities of his
calibre can command up to
$lOO,OOO for their part in na-
tional campaigns.
But agencies face a tough
brief in lifting staples sales.
Australian Dairy Corporation’s Brian Norwood: a big growth in cheese consumption
Nutrition and dietary education has
turned many consumers away from
farm products sugar, eggs and red
meat are prime examples.
Marketing manager of the NSW Egg
Corporation Sue Park laments: “There
is an enormous amount of misconcep-
tion and ignorance about what they
(consumers) should eat to be healthy.”
The corporation, which last week
The Australian Nutrition Foundation’s Healthy Diet Pyramid shows
how nutritional advice is making life tough for the sugar and butter
marketers
moved to abandon its loss-making ex-
port market by production cuts and
dropped the wholesale price of eggs by
14 cents a dozen in other deregulatory
moves, has seen consumption sliding
over the past four years despite promo-
tion. NSW per capita consumption of
eggs was 11.44 dozen in 1980-81 but the
corresponding figure for last year will
pan out closer to 10.95.
The slide is largely at-
tributed to fear of cholesterol.
Park says: “NSW consumers
have different attitudes to eggs
than in the other states. At-
titudes are more intense than
in other states.”
Following his deregulation
announcements last week,
corporation managing direc-
tor Ken Baxter and his board
held a meeting with DMM to
decide on promotional direc-
tions for 1984-85. The corpor-
ation seems unlikely to have
funds left for television ads
after the price cuts.
Public awareness of the de-
sirability of a low-fat diet is
part of the rural marketers’
problem. Jo Rogers, chairing
the Australian Nutrition
Foundation, says that nutri-
tional awareness differs within
a metropolitan area. She says:
“In butchers’ shops in Syd-
ney, you will get leaner meat
in the suburbs such as Double
Bay (east) and St Ives (north)
than in the western suburbs.”
The consumer in more “up-


ANDRE MARTIN
Meat corporation’s Peter Gray: more money to promote meat products
market” areas is more concerned about
a low-fat diet and apparently better
educated in nutrition, according to
Rogers. One .of the foundation’s educa-
tive tools is the Healthy Diet Pyramid
and its instructions show just what the
manufacturers of the generics are up
against. Butter and meat are close to the
apex and at it is sugar, the commodity
which more than any other shows the
attitudinal problems the promoters face.
Responsible for sugar’s promotion is
CSR Ltd which provides marketing,
financial and other services to the
Queensland Sugar Board on a sub-con-
tracting basis. Tony Thirlwell, national
marketing manager of CSR’s refined
sugar and consumer products group, is
scratching his head after the first year of
a $3 million campaign has shown
improved attitudes to sugar but a con-
tinued decline in consumption a head.
Thirlwell found, through market re-
searcher Liz Dangar, in mid-1982 that
(among other things) 34 percent of the
population believed sugar to be “bad
for you.” In April this year, after about
six months of CSR television commer-
cials portraying sugar as a natural prod-
TABLE 2
LIKELY PROMOTION BUDGETS IN 1984-85
Sugar $5 million to $6 million
Red meat $5.5 million
Milk $lO million
Other dairy products $ 11.5 million
Eggs $6 million
Pork $2 million plus
(Milk figure does not include promotion by private
processors of flavored and other milk In some states
for example, QUF Industries In Brisbane.)
uct and integral part of the energy cycle,
Dangar again did her research and
came up with a new figure for those dis-
enchanted of 20 percent. The figure and
attitude improvement was so good that
she checked in a telephone survey
and came up with the same results. But
per capita consumption kept falling. In
1983-84, Thirlwell says, the figure was
about 44.5 kg against 46 the year before.
Dangar belongs to the school of
thought that there is a lag between a
change in attitude and the buying ac-
tion. But CSR and the sugar board also
have employed the services of market-
ing consultant Dr Peter Kenny who says
that consumers must be motivated to
buy before effecting a long-term change
in attitude. Preparing its next television
campaign, for 1985, CSR has briefed
three agencies Hammond Advertising,
Weston Co and Schofield Sherbon Baker
all members of the Fortune Communi-
cations Holdings group. Each agency
has been asked to come up with three
concepts.
Red meat has similar attitudinal
problems to those of sugar. The meat
corporation, headed by recently-ap-
pointed Dick Austen who also is chair-
man and managing director of NSW
coal miner Austen Butta as well as being
a property owner, is likely to take a
much more aggressive stance following
restructuring. The changes have divided
the corporation into a marketing oper-
ation (retaining the name of the
AMLC), a selection committee headed
by TNT Ltd chairman Fred Millar and
an industry council. The council, inclu-
ding representatives of exporters and of
trade unions, will advise the AMLC on
policy.
The reorganisation will “remove
agro-politics from the marketing func-
tion of meat,” according to the AMLC
director of publicity, Russell Gray.
Gray complains of a dearth of funds
available in the past.
The budget this financial year is up
25 percent to $3.7 million, made up of
$2.6 million on beef and $l.l million on
sheepmeats. Two lamb and sheep prod-
uct development and promotion com-
mittees recently convened bring in extra
levies to take the total available for their
promotion and advertising to $3 mil-
lion, the red meat budget to $5.6 mil-
lion. Producers also are considering
lifting the levy on slaughtered cattle by
$1 to $2.20, raising a possible $7 million,
much of which would be available for
promotion on the local market.
Like the sugar board, the corpora-
tion is researching consumer attitudes.
It soon will have the results of a study
by Melbourne market researcher Dr
Peter McKinna who has been asked to
look at consumer attitudes to fast foods,
the non-price attributes and nutritional
aspects of meat, and ethnic influences
and the affect of changing Australian
lifestyle on buying behaviour. The cor-
poration will be looking at a new tele-
vision campaign after it has studied the
results.
Former campaigns have met public
opposition as well as successes. The ad
with the highest recall, on the theme
“Feed the man meat,” was scorned by
the feminist lobby while the latest
“Let’s drink a toast to the great Aussie
roast” carried off one of advertising’s
international Clio awards but did not
arrest the decline in beef and veal sales.
Gray claims that the corporation did
not have a chance with the ad, with such
meagre media budgets. □

WILDCAT
WA Libs go national in land rights battle
WEST AUSTRALIAN Opposition
leader Bill Hassell has bought into the
land rights debate.
Hassell said last week that, under
Aboriginal land rights legislation ex-
pected in Western Australia, nearly half
of that state equivalent to one-sixth of
Australia could be handed over to the
Aborigines who number 2.4 percent of
WA’s population (as against 1.1 percent
of the Australian population).
Much of the 1.2 million sq km im-
mediately at stake includes the most
prospective mineral areas in Australia
where, if Aborigines held the power to
veto exploration, future generations of
Australians would pay an intolerable
price in unemployment and outright
poverty, he said.
In support of that claim denied by
the WA Government he produced a
survey conducted by the Northern Ter-
ritory Department of Mines and En-
ergy, published in May. It showed that,
since the Aboriginal Land Rights Act
came into effect in the Northern Terri-
tory more than a decade ago no ex-
ploration titles had been granted on Ab-
original land since 1972 a complete
breakdown had taken place in mineral
exploration and development over 45
percent of the territory.
The federal ALP platform, endorsed
again at last week’s national conference,
calls for legislation similar to the NT’s
to be enacted in the states using Com-
monwealth powers if necessary. Under
such legislation, which the federal De-
partment of Aboriginal Affairs has
promised for 1985, inalienable freehold
title including control over mining and
exploration will be granted on all re-
serves and pastoral leases currently held
by Aboriginal groups.
A map of Western Australia pub-
lished by the Liberal Party shows the
following breakdown of territory in
WA, which constitutes one-third of the
commonwealth:
■ Aboriginal land 219,000 sq km
or 8.7 percent of the State. This will be
converted to inalienable freehold title
a status confirmed at last week’s ALP
conference when a draft proposal to re-
duce the status to “secure tenure” was
withdrawn in the face of opposition
from Aboriginal groups claiming it was
an attempt to appease reticent state gov-
ernments, pastoralists and miners.
■ Vacant crown land 1,010,000 sq
km or 40 percent of the State. In WA,
the Commissioner of the Aboriginal
Land Inquiry, Paul Seaman, QC, stated
in his discussion paper, published in
January, that this land “should be avail-
able for claim by Aboriginal people.”
This claim must be treated warily be-
cause Seaman’s final report is not due
until September and he has emphasised
that his discussion paper does not con-
stitute recommendations.
■ Pastoral crown land leased to gra-
ziers 951,000 sq km or 37.7 percent of
the state. Under Northern Territory
land rights legislation, pastoral leases
which are purchased by or for Aborigi-
nal groups are being converted to in-
alienable freehold title. The liberals
claim this could happen in WA, al-
though again the claim must be treated
with caution.
■ Freehold land 172,000 sq km or
6.8 percent of the state. Any part of this
would also become available for con-
version to inalienable freehold under
ALP policy, which has a commitment to
fund Aboriginal land purchases.
Hassell alleges the West Australian
Labor government has done a deal with
the federal government whereby it will
deny the substance of the Seaman re-
port to avoid a backlash against the fed-
eral ALP at an early election.
It would then introduce some limited
land rights to a few tribal groups leav-
ing the real legislation to a new federal
Labor government in 1985.
Go on-shore expert
RESOURCES analyst Dr lan Story is
urging investors to switch out of off-
shore oil explorers into on-shore pet-
roleum search companies. In a study
just released, he predicts off-shore ex-
ploration expenditure will drop by one
third as a consequence of the introduc-
tion of Senator Peter Walsh’s resources
rent tax (RRT).
Story quotes an earlier Bureau of
Mineral Resources forecast that new oil


discoveries in Australia could total 1800
million barrels by the year 2000. He as-
sumes 80 percent of those discoveries
would be offshore, with the potential to
find seven new 200 million barrel fields
or one every two years for the remain-
der of the century.
Before the introduction of resources
rent tax, he claims each new 200 million
field would have contributed $1360 mil-
lion in 1984 dollars to government rev-
enues. Under the tax, each field would
be expected to contribute SI6OO million.
But, with offshore exploration spend-
ing predicted to drop by one-third, the
number of new discoveries is likely to
fall from seven to five before the year
2000. (He bases that prediction on the
proposition that the tax will reduce cor-
porate cash flow of successful producers
by one-third, so their exploration ex-
penditure will be likewise cut.)
“The net impact of RRT is therefore
likely to reduce government revenues
from new discoveries by some 20 per-
cent, from around S4OOO million to
$3200 in 1984 dollars by the end of the
century,” he asserts.
“With grave doubts now hanging
over the early commercial development
of the Jabiru find, it could be many,
many years before the RRT generates
any additional government revenues,
and the net impact of the RRT will be
negative on both government and the
oil exploration industry.”
Battler’s challenge
BUSH BATTLER Don Kendell has be-
come the first of Australia’s pocket air-
lines to move into the emerging big
league of commuter competition.
Kendell last week announced he would
buy two $6 million SAAB-Fairchild
3405.
The 30-passenger airliners, to be de-
livered in December and next year, will
put his Wagga-based Kendell Airlines in
the forefront of the small carriers.
Kendell’s network focuses on Mel-
bourne with services to and from his
main base at Wagga Wagga and to Al-
bury, Cooma and Merimbula in New
South Wales, Warrnambool, Portland
and Hamilton, in Victoria, Mount Gam-
bier in South Australia and King Island,
Tasmania.
One-time pilot Kendell extended his
routes as Ansett moved out of Fokker
Friendship subsidiary routes and still
works closely with Ansett. He already
has five Fairchild Metros, which carry
19 passengers.
Kendell said he was attracted to the
340 because of its Swedish-American
parentage and because it applies new
technology to the problem commuters
face: controlling soaring costs in tiny
markets.
The sale was chalked up by
Aerospace International, a member of
the Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd
group, (which through Australian Con-
solidated Press publishes The Bulletin ).
Support for the 340 s will come from Pa-
cific Aviation, a Consolidated Press
Holdings-Ansett venture. □
THE CHARTIST
Two charts for the next textbook
by Russell Lander
TFIE DRAMATIC plunge in the gold
price last week transformed the charts
of most of the Australian gold pro-
ducers, to say nothing of a host of the
specs.
Perhaps the two charts most likely to
make it into future charting textbooks
are Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie and
Poseidon. These companies have more
in common than their rugged share
price charts: they each own 47 percent
of Kalgoorlie Lake View Pty Ltd, the re-
maining 6 percent being held by West-
ern Mining Corp. KLV in turn owns 48
percent of Kalgoorlie Mining Associates
(52 percent Homestake Mining of US),
proprietor of the Mt Charlotte and
Fimiston gold mines and treatment fa-
cilities in the Kalgoorlie district, WA.
These mines produced 65,3730 z of
gold in the first half of 1983-84, being
large-scale underground operations.
Ore grades in this period were 4.57gms
of gold/tonne for Mt Charlotte and
5.39gm5/tonne for Fimiston.
The five-year weekly range charts
have been supplied by courtesy of Com-
puter Investor Services Pty Ltd, which
produces a monthly chart book avail-
able at the stock exchanges. GMK and
Poseidon have broken down from very
large and imposing top patterns which
give downside readings of $5.50 and
$2.50, respectively. The further point in
common is that, at these target levels,
neither stock is within coo-ee of pre-
vious support levels. This opens up the
possibility that, in a very bad gold mar-
ket, these stocks could fall well below
their indicated targets as both are now
in no-man’s land.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Uranium a glow on the horizon
NOW THAT the Australian Labor
Party’s federal conference has approved
a relaxed if hypocritical policy on the
mining and sale of uranium, it’s time to
reassess the potential of Energy Re-
sources of Australia.
The real smart money, of course, has
done that already and the shares have
moved up from a year’s low of $1.30 to
a recent $1.55.
But there remains a safe margin for a
“spec” on this stock particularly since
it may emerge as a takeover situation in
the re-arrangement of ownership now
under way.
As is no doubt well known, Energy
Resources of Australia and its Ranger
mine in the Northern Territory is one of
only two current Australian uranium
producers the other being the smaller
Nabarlek project.
Under the Labor Party’s revised pol-
icy, a third uranium mining project
Roxby Downs in South Australia will
be permitted to go ahead and Ranger
and Nabarlek may continue. Nabarlek,
however, has contracts to supply France
and these will now be disallowed under
the Labor Party’s policy opposing
French Pacific bomb tests.
Energy Resources of Australia has
on issue 410 million shares, of which 25
percent are classed as B and C shares
held by Japanese and European buyers
of the Ranger mine’s product. Of the
remaining 307,500,000 shares, two
sponsoring Australian companies
Peko-Wallsend and EZ Industries
each held 126,945,000 shares and the
balance was issued to the public. Since
April, however, Peko has been edging
up its holding which now tops 130 mil-
lion shares 31.7 percent.
Late last week, North Broken Hill
Holdings Ltd was well on its way to win-
ning its $544 million takeover bid for
EZ Industries.
North Broken Hill sponsored the flo-
tation of EZ Industries in 1916 to
undertake lead smelting. Today EZ has
a major lead-zinc-sliver mine at Elura,
New South Wales, and many years of
reserves in its mines on the west coast of
Tasmania. By contrast, North Broken
Hills’ mine life at Broken Hill has be-
come limited.
North’s managing-director, Mark
Bethwaite, has said it is the company’s
intention to remain in mining, hence the
rationale for the EZ takeover. He has
also said that North Broken Hill likes to
have management control which it
would not have in Energy Resources of
Australia. A sale of EZ’s holding in En-
ergy Resources of Australia at, say, $2
would free up $250 million. Although
it’s a big swallow, it’s conceivable that
Peko-Wallsend could emerge as the
buyer the 180 million A shares it does
not already hold at $2 would cost $360
million.
Although Peko’s current market
capitalisation is only about $340 million
such a move must present some appeal,
for the shares now held by both Peko
and EZ in Energy Resources of Austra-
lia have a restrictive dividend covenant
whereby dividends to the sponsoring
companies are limited until the annual
payout rate exceeds 12.5 percent. (Last
year the publicly held shares received a
full dividend of 10c or 10 percent on
earnings of 14c a share.)
Energy Resources of Australia is
now producing at the rate of 3000
tonnes of uranium oxide a year and has
sold contracts for its production
through until 1995. New contracts
signed with American utility companies
in both Virginia and Wisconsin will al-
low production to increase next year
and until revised Labor Party policy ex-
port approvals for further sales con-
tracts should be granted if markets can
be found.
The tragedy of the past decade of
pussy-footing over uranium policy is
that Australia has been left behind while
major mines have been developed in
Africa and Canada.
The world is now in a glut, with the
spot price of uranium down from
SUS4S/lb in 1977 to SUSI7/lb today,
although all Australian production is on
long-term contract with a government-
imposed floor-price of about $35.
Sources close to Energy Resources of
Australia suggest the company will be
able to lift production to 3600 tonnes a
year by 1988 at minimal additional cost.
Energy Resources of Australia has
traded this year down from a high of
$1.83 to a low of $1.30. In the weeks
ahead of the Labor Party conference, as
confidence developed that the pro-ura-
nium faction would win, the shares
firmed to above $1.50.
I fancy them as a punt on the ex-
change traded options market. I have
paid a premium of 20c for the right to
acquire Energy Resources of Australia
shares at $1.50 next February which
means the share must rise above $1.70
before I’m in front. I’ve taken two con-
tracts, each for 1000 shares.

Home office.
At long last, there is a personal computer that
is both truly portable and truly powerful.
It’s the new Apple® lie.
It weighs just a bit less than eight pounds.
Its power and many applications can only improve
the way you go about your business. And its tremendous
portability means your office isn’t the only place you can
go about your work.
The fact that the Apple lie is twice as powerful as
personal computers twice its size doesn’t mean that it’s
any more complicated. The opposite, in fact.
After plugging your Apple into a normal television
or optional monitor, you’re ready to insert the first of six
self-explanatory start-up programs into the Apple’s built-
in disk drive.
Taking into account the entertaining games and the
enjoyable banter the Apple indulges in as it teaches you
to learn, you’ll leave the world of computer illiteracy
behind you in just a few hours.
And be left wondering what all the' fuss is about.
But what can your Apple do for you?
Although the number grows daily, there are cur-
rently over 10,000 different programs that can be used
with the Apple, many written to make the business of
doing business faster, easier and more productive. The
Apple’s ability to keep records, manage finances and
prepare, file and retrieve documents, will soon make
you wonder how others are managing without one.
And should you ever feel the need to work late
into the night or over the weekend, it won’t be a com-
puter that keeps you at the office. After all, computers
should be the slave of the people, and not vice versa.
For the address of your nearest Apple lie dealer,

THE MODEST BVRMER
Hitting out with a halo
by Bert Kelly
MELBOURNE people breathe a purer
air than the rest of us and they always
know best. I first became aware of this
when, as a member of the Forster com-
mittee trying to work out a blueprint for
the agricultural development of the
Northern Territory, I noticed that the
most urgent admonitions to get crack-
ing came from Melbourne. The further
people are from problems, the easier
they are to solve. Distance does lend en-
chantment to the view.
The Melbourne Age, too, has a
special place in heaven and as a mem-
ber of parliament I was taught to regard
it with veneration as did many other
people, particularly in Canberra. Auth-
ority and rectitude used to ooze out of it
with effortless ease but this veneration
seems lately to have gone to its head and
it now appears to go round seeking out
people with whom it disagrees and hit-
ting them with its halo.
The Age has been an enthusiastic
supporter of the Aborigines’ land rights
cause. You would expect this there
being few Aborigines in Melbourne or,
indeed, in Victoria. It has pursued this
cause with the same singlemindedness
as it did that of tariff protection years
ago. I do not complain about this
singlemindedness but I would have ex-
pected that a paper which so often and
so unctuously parades its moral superi-
ority at least to be fair.
Let me give an example of what I
mean: Hugh Morgan, of Western
Mining, made a speech to the Mining
Council on May 4 in which he asked
that mining be regarded as a responsible
and important industry. In the course of
this speech, he said that the case for Ab-
original land rights depended in the end
on what we would regard as their mysti-
cal almost religious attachment to
their land. Then he said that, if Aborigi-
nal beliefs about land rights were to be
respected, the same respect should be
paid to other mystical Aboriginal beliefs
such as their sacred duty to kill any of
their brethren who even unwittingly
broke some traditional Aboriginal law.
Then Morgan went on to make what
I thought was a very proper plea for the
same respect to be paid to the religious
beliefs of white people, even miners.
I quote from his speech: “Many of
you will be pleased to learn that our
orebodies definitely have a place in or-
thodox Christian doctrine. Just as
Christian ceremonies such as blessing
the fishing fleet or blessing the plough
are well established both in Christian
Western Mining’s Hugh Morgan: a very proper plea on behalf of whites
tradition and orthodox theology, so our
orebodies and the equipment we use
to mine them are part of the divine
order.”
I can see nothing wrong with that. As
an MP, I attended many ceremonies in
which we either asked the Almighty to
make us fruitful or to thank Him (or
Her) for so doing. Indeed, Sir Joh inter-
cedes directly for Queensland in time of
drought. Clearly, it must be the right
way to behave.
However, The Age headlines next
day screamed “GOD’S ON OUR SIDE
SAYS MINING CHIEF” and the re-
port said: “Mr Morgan said that, while
miners were not noted for their piety,
‘many of you will be pleased to know
that mineral deposits had a place in
Christian orthodoxy and mining equip-
ment was part of the divine order’.”
To quote Morgan selectively in this
way, leaving out all references to bless-
ing the plough or the fishing fleets,
seems quite wrong to me. There are
other examples of what I regard as
biased reporting but lack of space pre-
cludes my using them.
I have always been taught to regard
the ideal of the freedom of the press
with respect but it gets harder all the
time. Indeed, I find myself increasingly
in agreement with Peter Dickinson who
wrote the following poem for Punch.
For the benefit of those of you who, like
me, are not culture vultures, I inform
you that in scene 2, act 2 of The Tem-
pest Stephano who had been washed
ashore after shipwreck on a butt of wine
blundered, while very drunk, into Cal-
iban who was part man and part beast
of strange shape indeed and gave off a
fish-like smell.
Stephano quickly saw the financial
advantages in taking the beast home to
sell to the emperor or to exhibit at side-
shows. The poem reads:
A most delicate monster
I had a vision of the British Press.
Ah, broad and furrowed brow, far-
seeing eyes!
Ah, tongue how eloquent! Ah,
thoughts how wise!
Ah, large, warm heart to comfort in
distress!
Ah, ears attuned to every whisp—
Ah yes,
As that reminded me with some
surprise,
Could such a creature stoop to not-
quite-lies,
To rumor, scandal, and the prurient
guess ?
No need to stoop, for (like that curious
beast
Found by drunk Stephano on
Prospero’s isle)
Out of its hinder parts it spoke most
vile,
And, like that monster, on the air
released
A very ancient and a fish-like smell.
Stephano, too, thought that the beast
would sell.
I do not think for a moment that it
was money The Age was after; it was
just peddling its line. □

FROM 0-100 FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY PININFARINA.
Pininfarina was quite a
designer.
His name is on some of
the fastest cars in the world.
Ferrari Boxer. Ferrari Dino.
And the Peugeot STI.
The STI accelerates from
0-100 in just 10.5 seconds.
Thanks to Pininfarina, the
STI looks like it’s flying, even
when it’s standing still.
The tyres are MichelinTßX
radials. The wheels are alloy.
Yet the STI has all the
manners that have made the
Peugeot marque a legend.
Suspension is fully
independent. Brakes are discs.
On all four wheels. The steering
is power-assisted.
And of course there are
those legendary Peugeot seats.
Each has been crafted from
polyurethane foam and tuned
to the car’s suspension.
The rest of your cabin has
every control, to keep you in
control.
The air-conditioning has
adjustments for temperature,
velocity and direction. And a
recycle setting for relief in
seconds from heatwaves or
high humidity.
There’s a Pioneer AM/FM
stereo radio/cassette. And a
central locking system.
Electrically operated front
windows. Fuel econoscope.
Master emergency warning
light system. Digital clock.
Even hydraulically adjustable
headlights.
And they’re all standard.
No wonder the STI has
become something of a legend
in just a few months.

PIERPONT
A fund with a touch of fizz
LAST MONDAY lunchtime the chaps
from Bollinger were opening, for the
first time ever in Australia, the Grand
Annee 1979. Vicomte Arnould
d’Hautefeuille, great-nephew of the late,
great Madame Bollinger, was on hand
to announce the wine and Pierpont was
on hand to drink it.
The vicomte, Pierpont is sad to re-
port, does not have the same felicity of
phrase that marked his great-aunt.
Madame Bollinger’s philosophy of life
may be summed up in the quotation: “I
drink it when I’m happy and when I’m
sad. Sometimes I drink it when I’m
alone. When I have company I consider
it obligatory. I trifle with it if I’m not
hungry and drink it when I am. Other-
wise I never touch it unless I’m
thirsty.”
We shall not see her like again but
the present generation of the Bollinger
family still have a sense of style. They
hired the whole Sydney Hilton ball-
room for lunch, then set one long table
in the centre for 30 assorted wine
scribes, dimmed the lights and had a
lone piano and violin playing in the
background while they served four
varieties of vintage champagne. After
the second course Pierpont was nearly
convinced he had died and gone to
heaven.
But all good things must end and
some time around three o’clock
Pierpont was out in Pitt Street, blinking
owlishly in the strong sunlight and won-
dering whether generous lashings of the
grape of the Marne had given him
enough fortitude to face the stock mar-
ket.
Well, it had but many a lesser wine
would have failed the test. The All Ords
had dropped another eight points to 660
and the bourse looked like the Marne
the morning after the French army had
savaged Moltke’s right flank. Corpses
littered the industrial boards and there
were shell holes in the indices.
This is the sort of situation that
makes a chap ponder. A few weeks ago,
readers may recall, Pierpont offered
three scapegoats for the current state of
the share market: the Mafia, the fascists
and the Vatican. He is now prepared to
add a fourth horseman to these riders of
the Apocalypse in the shape of Vic Mar-
tin.
You all know Vic. He led the Com-
mercial Banking Company of Sydney
through the dark days of the mid 1970 s
to a safe haven with the National Bank.
Then he chaired the Martin Committee,
which recommended the introduction
of foreign banks into Australia. These
days he is executive chairman of the
Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assurance Co
Ltd.
But the MLC has been selling mas-
sive quantities of shares in recent weeks,
making it probably the largest single
factor depressing the Australian stock
market.
To be fair, the MLC has not been the
only factor. The Dow Jones has been
falling like a brick and Jim Dominguez
has been selling so many BHPs that
Pierpont suspects strongly that he has
his own printing press. But the MLC has
been undertaking the largest con-
centrated selling campaign Pierpont can
recall by a major Australian institution.
Consider the fate of the following hold-
ings ...
■ ANI: 6.5 million shares. One mil-
lion of this holding has been sold and
the MLC is still selling. Perhaps it was
sorry to see John Leard leave.
■ Australian Interstate Pipeline: 14.8
percent sold for $2 million in early
June.
■ Martin Bright Steels: 750,000
shares. All sold.
■ Blue Circle Southern Cement: 1.4
million shares. All sold.
■ APM: 7.2 million shares.
Reportedly sold the lot through J. B.
Were.
■ Castlemaine Toohey: 4.4 million
shares. Sold 1.5 million, then stopped.
This sale was interesting because it rep-
resented a weakening of what used to be
a loose Catholic connection between the
brewers and the MLC.
■ Waugh and Josephson: The MLC
used to hold nearly 1.4 million shares in
the Caterpillar tractor servicing group
but sold them all.
■ Wormald: 2.5 million shares. All
sold.
■ Edwards Dunlop: The 1.4 million
holding in the paper merchants was one
of the first to go.
■ Chamberlain: 243,000 shares. All
sold. The MLC obviously doesn’t like
the tractor industry much.
■ George Weston Foods: 760,000
shares, all sold through John Sweeney
Partners.
■ Taubmans: 800,000 shares. Sales
recently.
■ Clifton Brick: 960,000 shares, also
sold recently.
■ Westpac: With 12.7 million shares,
the MLC is the third largest share-
holder. There have been some sales.
■ ANZ: Some of the 1.7 million
shares have gone.
■ National Australia Bank: 12.8 mil-
lion shares. Some selling here, too;
maybe Vic’s revenge for their taking
over the Sydney Bank.
One way or another it has been quite
a fire sale. The whisper around the
Croesus Club is that some of the selling
has lacked a certain finesse. Pierpont
hears, for example, that there might
have been an extra 10c in the price for
Martin Bright if the timing had been
better.
The list does not exhaust the hold-
ings the MLC has for sale. They have
780,000 Tyrees which reportedly have
been on offer for some time and also 1.3
million Vickers hanging around.
The first thought that occurred to
Pierpont was that perhaps the policy-
holders had woken up at last and were
surrendering their policies in droves.
When he rang the MLC and tried out
this theory the MLC said “Certainly
not.”
The MLC had been looking at asset
weightings in various categories and as
a result of the review had determined
that it was prudent to sell some equities.
Did this mean that the MLC had
taken a bear view of the market and de-
cided to get out while the going was


good? Not necessarily. The MLC had
done relatively well in the share market
and it was sensible to wrap up some of
the profits.
What had they done with the cash?
Parked it in the money market? Some of
the cash had been put out longer than
that. The MLC wanted to make sure the
funds were in something negotiable but
which was giving a reasonable return.
Did the MLC’s new advisers, Frank
Russell International Inc, have some
plan for long-term reinvestment? Frank
Russell was not going to run the port-
folio. It would monitor the performance
of the managers who did. MLC Ltd, the
listed company, would become the in-
vestment manager of the MLC’s equity
and negotiable fixed interest portfolio.
Property would be managed by Lend
Lease, which now has 49.7 percent of
MLC Ltd, and the mortgage and life
policy-connected investments would re-
main managed by the life company.
But how is MLC Ltd going to rein-
vest the money long-term? This has yet
to be determined. This is another step in
the restructuring project. The share sales
have given the MLC flexibility.
They certainly have. By Pierpont’s
count up to $5O million worth of flexi-
bility.
It is unusual for an institution to sell
on this scale without having a clear idea
of to where it is switching. The MLC has
decided to get out of a basketful of
stocks and work out afterwards what it
will do with the cash.
If the share market crashes, this will
be seen as fearfully smart. If a bull mar-
ket develops suddenly and the MLC is
left disinvested in equities, the MLC
will look pretty silly.
Pierpont’s view is that it is high time
he put in his application to become the
MLC’s investment manager. With $5O
million to spend, your correspondent
should be able to rely on stockbrokers
giving him free lunches for the rest of
the year. □
CHESS
Openings for name-droppers
by Terrey Shaw
ONE OF the many features which sep-
arates chess from what a less tactful
writer than myself might refer to as the
more pedestrian board games is the fas-
cinating nomenclature of the openings.
About half the recognised openings
take their names from the country or
city in which they were first honed and
grew to prominence. Many of these
names had their origins in particularly
interesting circumstances.
I would like to take this opportunity
to scotch the persistent rumors that the
French Defence (1. P-K4 P-K3) derives
its name from an association with
prophylaxis. It does avoid any possible
trouble on the diagonal leading to the
often sensitive KB2 square, by erecting
a formidable pawn barrier. But the de-
fence is so called because it was adopted
by the French team in a game played by
letter between London and Paris in
1834.
The French letters eventually
brought victory to the Paris team, which
helped to establish the credentials of
their defence. In reality, though, the win
was simply due to Paris being home for
more than its fair share of the top
players of Europe at that time.
Down but not out, the English kept
the home fires burning and struck back
in the 1840 s with the English Opening
(1. P-QB4).
While not a particularly aggressive
first move, this opening had one par-
ticular merit in the eyes of contempor-
ary Englishmen which was calculated to
strike fear into a Gallic heart: you
couldn’t play the French Defence
against it.
Talking about openings, my phone
has been running hot with complaints
from Sicilian addicts that last week’s
column was unfair to their habit. I
would like to make amends this week by
publishing an example of an extremely
rare species: a win by Black in the
Sicilian in fewer than 40 moves.
The game was played in last year’s
Australian Open by our national
women’s champion, Anne Slavotinek.
Anne has just been selected as our top
board in the women’s team for the next
Chess Olympics, in Thessalonika, in
November.

THERE’S been a lot in the
UK press about the naughty
things diplomats get up to
such as parking their CD cars
illegally. All of which gives
some point to the news that, in
France, the initials CD stand
for Cretins Dangereux.
Down but not out
REGULAR visitors to France
may well be shocked and sur-
prised to find some of their
favorite luxury hotels sudden-
ly down-graded to three stars.
This, however, doesn’t reflect
any drop in standards: It’s
due to the luxury-rate valued-
added tax which is levied on
all four-star establishments.
Fertile field
for surgeons
A NSW microsurgeon, dedi-
cated to the free enterprise
system, has a hedge against
the possibility of being denied
access to public hospitals, if
the current doctors’ dispute
continues.
He and his colleagues have
put together an attractive “fly-
sew” package for American
males wishing to reverse their
vasectomies.
For around $5OOO, the re-
gretful male can fly to Sydney,
stay at a top-class city hotel,
have the operation in a pri-
vate hospital and spend a
little R&R in Australia all
for about half the cost of the
California price tag.
Aussie bid for bridge gold medal
THE Australian contract
bridge team to compete in
the World Bridge Teams
Olympiad, in Seattle, in
October is expected to make a
big impact. Eighty-odd coun-
tries will take part in this four-
yearly highlight of the bridge
calendar and some local
bridge experts believe that
Australia will make the final
eight. From there, anything is
possible.
Australia has taken part in
all six Olympiads. Twice in
the 60s they attracted inter-
national attention by finishing
fifth but nothing worthy of
special note has happened
since then. The team to repre-
sent Australia in America is
John Lester - Gaby Lorentz,
Peter Gill - Ron Klinger,
Stephen Burgess - Paul Mar-
ston. They won the right with
a victory in a play-off held re-
cently in Sydney.
Why do some bridge gurus
hold such high hopes for this
team? Mostly because of their
modern bidding systems
which cause danger for their
opponents without sacrificing
accuracy. Australia leads the
world in bidding techniques
these days and, if the team
goes well in Seattle, its
winged-keel bidding can take
a fair chunk of the credit.
It is interesting that, in the
play-off this year, Australia
for the first time followed the
world trend toward ending
possible speculation about
foul play. While bridge at top
level is fought fiercely, it is
generally played with the
highest regard for ethics. The
only way to transmit informa-
tion to your partner is through
the bids and plays you make
anything else is illegal. The
stakes are so high, however,
that some characters have
been tempted to invent devi-
ous strategies to find out more
about their partner’s hand
than the laws of the game al-
low.
Screens have been in-
troduced. These are diagonal
barriers placed across the
tables so that partners cannot
see each other. All bidding is
done on paper.
Australia’s campaign for
international bridge honors
this year is being assisted by a
grant from the federal govern-
ment.
Safety in silence for scribes
“Oh, I dunno . . . bit quiet as political conferences go. ”
PETER Isaacson Publications
Pty Ltd, publishers of Mel-
bourne’s Sunday Observer and
a string of suburban news-
papers, has issued staff with a
delightful statement of editor-
ial policy.
The statement has left staff
concerned about their pos-
sible exposure to libel. Para-
graph 1.9 of the code of con-
duct says staff are expected
“not to publish any comment
or rumor which disparages
any company, its staff, publi-
cations or products, any per-
son, family or organisation.”
This prohibition is drawn
so widely that it could be held
to apply to almost any critical
comment or even reports
which were not intended to be
critical.
The next paragraph says:
“The company may not ac-
cept the legal expenses or
damages awarded against a
staff member who writes
and/or allows to be published
editorial copy of the nature
described in paragraph 1 of
this clause.”
In other words, any Isaac-
son journalist sued for libel
may find himself required to
fund his own defence. Jour-
nalists being a notoriously im-
pecunious lot, this should
mute criticism in the Observer
considerably.

Lobbying the
rural vote
LEFT-WING Labor attacks
on the US alliance have
stirred a lobby group called
the Australian Defence As-
sociation (patron: Air Mar-
shal Sir Valston Hancock) to
step up efforts to support
Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s
stand on defence.
The association has
painted 60 signs, bearing such
slogans as (above): “Austra-
lian people demands (sic)
strengthen US alliance
NOW” and “Australia needs
defence NOW.”
Where have the signs been
placed? On the Brand and
Northwest highways leading
to Exmouth, the town near the
US base at North West Cape.
Hawke can rest assured
that he’s got the kangaroo
vote.
Delusions
of modesty
THE Australian Values Study
Survey, now published by
Ogilvy & Mather, has
emerged with the revealing
statistic that 73 percent of
Australians, when asked, said
they drank less alcohol than
most people.
Which means that 23.1 per-
cent of Australians must be
deluding themselves.
In other countries, the pro-
portions saying they drank
less than their compatriots
were: Britain and France 69
percent, West Germany 51
percent and Japan 48 percent.

The Dally Advertiser, Wagga Wagga, June 26
RELATIONS between Brit-
ain and Nigeria continue to
deteriorate in the wake of the
crated diplomat brouhaha.
The image of Nigerians as
suave sophisticates was not
enhanced by a report last
week in the London Daily
Telegraph about a Nigerian
who was caught at Heathrow
airport, trying to board a
plane for Lagos with tw.o live
rabbits in his pockets.
Asked what he planned to
do with the bunnies, the
gentleman replied brightly: “I
am going to eat them.”
Lurks better
IT MAY well be if that
scurrilous UK journal Private
Eye can be believed that
Rupert Murdoch has
stumbled on the secret of suc-
cessful union relations. The
National Union of Journalists
chapel of Rupe’s London Sun
met recently to discuss an
offer of a 10 percent pay rise
and longer leave.
The offer was turned down,
not because it was ungenerous
but because the extra leave
provision would deny the staff
valuable daily expenses.
Negotiations proceed.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
IT IS easier to make a mess out of
a good roll than it is out of a bad
one.
With a poor roll one is forced
to concentrate, to ponder how to
make the best of it. With a good
roll there is a tendency to move
too fast. Fortune has come your
way and there is impatience to ex-
ploit it immediately.
Look at the illustration. On his
last roll, Black threw a double 4
and failed to re-enter. White has
just rolled a 3-6. What’s the play?
One of the back men to 810,
hitting twice on B 4 and 810,
seems correct. Black would then
have three men on the bar and
White would be poised for victory.
But it’s not the best play. White
needs to press home his advantage
by capturing his 3, 2 and 1 points.
He must ask himself: “How will
three men on the bar help me to
do this?”
To capture the 3, 2 and 1
points White needs ammunition.
As it stands he has none on W 7.
Two Black men on the bar are as
effective as three for White. Black
cannot re-enter and move. He
must use his total roll to re-enter
unless he produces a double.
White should split his back
men, using the 3 to move from B 1
to 84, hitting. He should then use
the 6 to take a man from 812 to
W 7.
At this point, having a man on
W 7 is of prime importance for
White. It can be used as another
builder for W 3, W 2 or W 1 or, fail-
ing that, it starts the capture of
W 7, which could be a game win-
ner, too.

Opening lead six of clubs.
LET’S SAY you’re in three no-
trump and West leads the six of
clubs, East playing the queen. It is
frequently right to duck when you
hold the A-K in order to inter-
fere with enemy communications
but the question is whether or
not it is right in this case (without
seeing the East-West cards).
Note that if you duck you go
down one. East plays another club
and you wind up losing three
clubs and two aces. But if you win
the first club you make the con-
tract against any method of de-
fence.
It is easy to prove that taking
East’s queen is the correct move to
make.
You start by assuming that
West, who presumably led his
fourth best club, did not lead the
six from the J-10-9-6-X, because
with that holding he would have
led the jack, not the six.
It is also safe to assume that
East has specifically the doubleton
Q-10 or Q-9 of clubs because if
he has Q-10-2 or Q-9-2 you are
certain to make the contract
whether you take the queen or
duck.
The only tricks you’d lose
would be two clubs and two aces.
After winning the opening
club lead, you force out the ace of
diamonds. If East has the ace and
returns the nine (or 10) of clubs,
you duck and thus assure the con-
tract.
If West has the ace of dia-
monds (the actual case), you are
equally certain of how things will
turn out.
You duck the club return
whether he plays the jack or the
deuce and in that way dis-
combobulate the defence.
There is a proper time to refuse
a trick and a proper time to win a
trick but when you do one or the
other is largely a matter of exercis-
ing good judgment.
It’s all so simple.
