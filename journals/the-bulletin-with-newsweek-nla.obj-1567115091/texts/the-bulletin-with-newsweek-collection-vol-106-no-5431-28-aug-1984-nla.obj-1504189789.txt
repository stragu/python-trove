Rival 4 cylinder two litre engine at 2500 rpm.
A martini may be improved by being
shaken. But drivers and passengers
seldom are.
BMW insists on using six cylinders in
engines of 2 litres and over. But most
other luxury car makers still persist with
four or five cylinders, despite the laws of
physics which decree that engines of
less than six cylinders can never be
perfectly balanced.
A four cylinder engine will have up to
10 times more vibration than a six
cylinder engine. And a four cylinder car
engine can transmit three times more
vibrations to the passenger compartment.
In a BMW however, you will feel
fewer vibrations than if you were sitting
in an eight cylinder car.
To improve this smoothness even
further, each cylinder has its own
counterweight. Some other cars only
have one counterweight to balance
several cylinders.
When you drive the BMW 323 i for
example, you will be surprised at the
uncanny quiet but effortless acceler-
ation of its electronically fuel injected six.
And when you fill up with petrol you
will be pleasantly surprised at how
economical six cylinders can be, when
combined with energy-saving computer
electronics like a fuel cut-off system.
BMW believes that, if you are to
build the most sophisticated and refined
car in the world, the last place for
compromise is the engine. And if other
manufacturers are prepared to com-
promise on this the most important part
of the car, where will they stop 7

Having an ordinary personal computer in your
business is about as efficient as having to share one pencil.
After all, a computer is just another office tool. And
waiting in line to use it is doing no one any good. Least of
all you.
That’s why we have developed the new ICL Personal
Computer.
It handles four people at once. So you could have your
secretary working on the word processor, your accountant
running a spread sheet, your storeroom handling the
inventory, and the sales department filling an order. All at
the same time, without waiting or confusion.
Really, it’s a very simple concept. But it took ICL to
make it work.
You see, ICL is Europe’s leading, and one of Australia’s
major, computer companies. And over the years, we’ve
gained an enviable reputation as a mainframe expert.
ICL have designed computer systems for organisations
like Woolworths, the Swan Brewery and Parliament House,
and we’ve brought that same expertise to the field of multi-
user microcomputers. Our new Personal Computer is only
one example.
We have a range of computer systems designed for
business, with software programmes to match.

numbers listed below. And find out
how we can help you work better,
together.

Modern meeting spaces,
thousand year old faces.
The best of both. A promise only
Singapore can keep. There simply isn’t another
convention destination with as much to offer.
World-class hotels. A range of
meeting and exhibition venues designed with
the flexibility to provide full convention
facilities. And by 1986 the capacity for 6000
delegates all under one roof.
Sophisticated audio and video
equipment. Satellite communications. Ultra'
modern airport. On-the-spot multilingual
interpreters. And efficient back'Up services
necessary in having a smooth running
convention. Plus the experience in providing
excellent meals from cocktail receptions to
banquets and theme parties to celebrate your
success. And alongside the environment of this
modern metropolis, Singapore’s heritage.
A vibrant blend of Chinese, Indian and
Malay. Sights, sports and sun abound.
Tours, temples and trishaw rides. A thousand
things to see and do.

Passport problems
I read with interest Intelligencer’s com-
ments (B, August 14) on passport appli-
cation delays, which is hardly surprising
since I am convinced that each depart-
ment in the rabbit warren at Chifley
Square in Sydney competes to see who
can create the longest queues.
Recently I obtained an Australian
passport and managed to arrange a very
prompt interview at the post office in
Martin Place. I specifically requested
that the passport, when ready, remain at
Chifley Square for me to collect, since
mail has been stolen from my mailbox
recently. I was even prepared to brave
the inevitable frustrations of finding
someone who would admit to being re-
sponsible for my passport in order to
conform with concern that passports do
not fall into the wrong hands.
I was given a phone number to call
in order to check if the passport was
ready for collection. This number was
engaged throughout the day for the
three or four days I tried to call so,
eventually, I gave up and planned to
call in after giving them a few more
days for safety. The last thing I needed
was to queue for a few hours only to be
told it was not ready.
In the meantime I received a card in
my box to say an attempt had been
made to deliver a registered parcel and
could I pick it up at the post office.
Accordingly, I handed the card over
the counter and was immediately
handed an envelope containing my
passport.
I did not sign anything, nor did I
have to give any proof of my identity.
This, of course, makes total mockery
of the whole revised procedure and
doubtless will make a few people won-
der exactly why they are queuing for
hours on end.

Third World rights
I write with comments on Senator Don
Chipp’s letter (B, August 14).
When considering proliferation of
weapons (as against generation of elec-
tricity), there are technical facts alone
which make irrelevant whether or not
Australia exports uranium.
In the most recent OECD report (to
January 1981), of 31 countries listed,
only four have less than 1000 tonnes of
Reasonably Assured Resources of ura-
nium. These are not exotic sources such
as seawater but ores proved up by ex-
ploration and drilling. In addition, most
of these countries have published evi-
dence of their ability to produce yel-
lowcake from indigenous ores. No
country from the Centrally Planned
“Would you mind if we bowled underarm, just to make a game of it? ”

Economy bloc is listed, nor are others
with known reserves.
Pakistan, for example, as part of its
energy program, started exploration
about 1970. By 1978 a number of occur-
rences had been found, the most im-
portant being in the Siwalik sandstones
to the west of the Indus where drilling
has proved significant reserves. A pilot
plant run was completed and a 120
tonnes a day ore treatment plant de-
signed by 1978. At a meeting in June
1979, a paper was presented describing
Pakistan’s work in refining indigenous
concentrates.
This is not unusual but typical of the
programs of dozens of Third World as
well as developed countries.
Since the 19405, the number of sover-
eign states has increased from about 70
to about 150; hence the Third World.
Many have struggled for freedom
though, in more recent years, they have
received much support from freedom-
loving peoples. Unfortunately, there are
some who preach the rights of sover-
eignty on the one hand but are ready to
abuse states as “tinpot” at any sugges-
tion that they may make unpalatable
political decisions.
When in Bangladesh I was told by a
leading agricultural scientist that a new
rust-resistant and early-maturing rice
developed through an International
Atomic Energy Agency-World Health
Organisation co-operative program in
radiation mutation breeding would re-
sult in tens of millions more bowls of
rice a year.
Should the Third World be denied
this technology? Should it be denied the
diagnostic advantages of nuclear medi-
cine (about 30,000 patients benefit in
Australia a year)? If a country seeks an
experimental reactor to do its own re-
search, should this be denied? Even to
put such questions is an impertinence
and one to which the Third World is
very sensitive.
Of course they can make a bomb.
Most have the ore resources and to sug-
gest that they could not achieve the pro-
fessional competence is to revert to the
insulting implications levelled by our
19th-century European forebears. We
have to do better than offer middle-class
patronage.
It is true that international negotia-
tions are ratified with but fragile pieces
of paper that is in the nature of sov-
ereignty but Senator Chipp under-
estimates grossly the effectiveness of
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
other agreements and at least they
are infinitely better than international
anarchy.

Real democracy
I have followed with interest comments
by Barry Cohen, Professor Geoffrey
Blainey, David McNicoll and others
about immigration, whether it be to sup-
port or vilify or hurl the epithet “racist.”
It might prove salutary for all of
them to consider the words of Voltaire:
“I disapprove of what you say but I will
defend to the death your right to say it.”
Isn’t this, after all, what democracy is
supposed to be about?

David Lange has been called New Zea-
land’s Bob Hawke. Yet he reminds me
of another, quite dissimilar ALP Prime
Minister.
This former PM also was a lawyer
and an effective public speaker. He
acknowledged having a poor grasp on
economic matters but in other ways
came across as being quite arrogant. He


“... And I’d also like to
thank the people of Taiwan
for making this award. ”
also delivered an electoral victory to a
previously hopeless Opposition.
Could it be that Lange is destined
to be New Zealand’s latter-day E. G.

Correction time
In your article “The demons that haunt
the long-run truckies” (B, August 7)
Colin Burdett, embattled truckie, com-
plains that governments are undermin-
ing the transport industry and the com-
munity. By allowing rail systems to offer
rock-bottom freight rates, he says, the
road freight industry and the ordinary
motorist are subject to risk.
I sympathise with the point he
makes. The crazy situation is that all the
rail systems in the country are running
at huge losses and costing the taxpayer a
fortune. The New South Wales railways
lose more than $3OO million a year.
Here in Western Australia the rail defi-
cit is around $7O million.
The situation is in need of urgent
correction.

way out and join the mainstream com-
mercial forces?
While not agreeing with the total
programming of the FM radio network,
there is at least an attempt by this
station to bring adult music to all Aus-
tralians both in the city and the
country.
The major achievement of ABC
radio, since its formation 50 years ago,
has been the musical education of many
Australians and the subsequent growth
of audiences for opera, symphony con-
certs, chamber music and for minority
forms of music such as jazz and musical
theatre.
If there is to be any attempt to lift
ratings by pandering to the under-30s, it
should not be by removing the one
radio network dedicated to improving
our cultural standards.

Try ‘ventricle’
I have been giving quite a lot of thought
to the etymology of the word “ventri-
cal,” as used by your graphics people on
the cover of your issue of August 14.
The origins of the word are, appar-
ently, quite obscure but the best I can do
is to assume that the word comes from
“vent-” and “-cal.”
As the former is a common term for
the opening of the avian cloaca (the
common ending of intestinal, urinary
and reproductive tracts) and the latter is
much in vogue as an abbreviation for
“calorie” (a unit of heat), I can conclude
only that a “ventrical” is some sort of
esoteric device used for warming
chooks’ bottoms.
If this is so, it is no wonder that the
poor chap depicted on your cover was
presented for an MRI scan, as he ap-
pears by implication to have no fewer
than four of these things embedded in
his brain. It must have been a very per-
plexing case for the attending physician.

Advice already taken
Pierpont’s “Goodbye to the White Car-
go cult” (B, August 14) leads me to re-
gret that the tropics were not more hos-
pitable to him and did not allow him to
fulfil his childhood fantasy of becoming
a beachcomber rather than writing the
sort of flotsam contained in the article.
Perhaps his dalliance with a falling
coconut had some lasting effect on his
“unsuspecting cranium”?
Had poor Pierpont spent less time in
the Croesus Club and more on checking
his sources, he would have found that
his advice to Charles Perkins and the
Aboriginal Development Commission
concerning hovercraft in Townsville

By the way, talk of Torres Strait
Islanders “gadding about” in subsidised
transport shows an appalling case of
double standards on Pierpont’s part.
Pierpont, like millions of more ad-
vantaged urban Australians, probably
uses public transport every day. Try to
tell a Torres Strait Islander those forms
of transport are not heavily subsidised.
There is no question that improved
transport services are required in north
Queensland. The ADC will continue to
look at ways of achieving this.

French exploration
The article (B, July 24) on French ex-
ploration and the subsequent corres-
pondence (B, August 7) fails to mention
the major and pioneering contribution
of the New Zealander, Professor John
Dunmore, whose French Explorers in the
Pacific (Oxford, 2 vols, 1965-69) not
only devotes 32 pages to Baudin but
also covers visits to Australia by every
French explorer between 1788 and
1840.
The work has been translated into
French and the author is editing for the
French Imprimerie Nationale a critical
bicentennial edition of the journals of
La Perouse, who reached Botany Bay in
1788 just as the First Fleet was starting
to move to Port Jackson.

‘Re-hash of distortions’
I normally ignore anything Phillip
Adams writes but I have been urged by
friends to say something about his
article (B, August 21). This is difficult as
Mr Adams merely provides a re-hash of
the stale old distortions churned out by
League of Rights smearers over many
years.
Instead of attempting to go over old
ground, I recommend that anyone inter-
ested in testing the accuracy of Mr
Adams should consider his statement
that I am currently “orchestrating the
crescendo of ill-informed hostility to the
land-rights movement.”
So far from being opposed to land
rights for Australians of Aboriginal
background, I have, in accordance with
League of Rights objectives, always ad-
vocated land rights for all Australians.
Anyone genuinely concerned with pre-
senting the truth about the League of
Rights would point this out.
At the annual Western Australian
League of Rights seminar, held in Perth
on August 11, I shared the platform
with guest speaker the Rev. Cedric


“ When you told me you had
a couple of tablets to help us
get through life ... well, nat-
urally I thought ...”
Jacobs, a former member of the Nat-
ional Aboriginal Council, and endorsed
his most constructive proposals for his
fellow Australians of Aboriginal back-
ground.
The proposal advanced by the Rev.
Jacobs are, of course, very much at vari-
ance with the type of land rights ad-
vocated by the leaders of the howling
mob who attempted to prevent this dis-
tinguished Aboriginal spokesman from
appearing on a League platform. Pre-
sumably Mr Jacobs must now be classed
as a “racist?” How silly can we get?
When Mr Adams compares me with
the late Oswald Mosley, he demon-
strates that he is either a political illiter-
ate or has attempted to smear me.
It is a matter of record that I have
never at any time had any sympathy
with the philosophy of centralised
power, irrespective of whether it has
been labelled Nazism, Fascism, Com-
munism or central planning of any
kind.
I unreservedly accept the traditional
Christian philosophy which stresses the
value of every individual and his su-
premacy over all institutions. I also be-
lieve that the practical application of
the Christian law of love is essential for
harmony in human affairs. The essence
of my philosophy is outlined in my
book The Essential Christian Heritage.
Perhaps Mr Adams might read it some-
time. He would then be in the position
to say something sensible about me.

Rudd remembered
What a pity Peter Ellensen did not re-
search his subject fully before submit-
ting his article “The tarnish on our
Steele Rudd” (B, July 3). He would have
found that Rudd (Arthur Hoey Davis) is
honored with “real high polish” at
Drayton, in Toowoomba, throughout
the Darling Downs and, on occasions of
note, much further.
The Toowoomba Ladies’ Literary
Society began as early as 1935 to plan
for a memorial to Rudd to be erected at
Drayton. The war held up the project.
Finally, enough money was raised, the
site chosen and the inscription decided
upon so that by November 1950 all was
ready for the unveiling.
Among the subscribers to the fund
were Bert Bailey who played Dad in
film and on stage he sent £lO and
Sir Lionel Lindsay who etched especial-
ly for the occasion a work entitled “A
Pannikin of Flour” on which he wrote
“For the Steele Rudd Memorial Fund”
- adding in his letter, “Sell it if you
need a bob.” We didn’t sell the etching,
so it forms part of the Municipal Li-
brary Literary Museum along with
Rudd’s silver fountain pen, first editions
of his works, photostats of his birth cer-
tificate, the deeds of lands and a poster
for one of his plays produced in Too-
woomba. A photo of Rudd is hung on
the wall near the collection.

The cairn was erected at Drayton on
the site of Steele Rudd’s father’s work-
shop. It carries the words written by
Margaret Curran, president of the so-
ciety at the time: “To Australian Life
and Letters he brought the rich gift of
honest laughter with undertones of the
struggles and sorrows of the Pioneers.”
On November 20, 1950, the cairn was
unveiled by Professor S. Stable of the
Queensland University. He delivered
the first memorial address.
Since that year, on the Sunday near-
est the author’s birthday, November 14,
a literary pilgrimage is held at which a
memorial address on Australian litera-
ture is given in honor of Steele Rudd.

Low representation
I would like to reply to David
McNicolPs article (B, August 7) in
which comments were made regarding
the forthcoming election for the Austra-
lian Jockey Club committee.
I feel that McNicoll should have his
facts right before making such state-
ments as “the dominance of breeders
(whose influence is pushing up prize
money).” I have been a member of the
AJC for 40 years and professional
breeders’ representation on the commit-
tee is at present at its lowest ebb in that
time. In fact, I would be interested to
hear who the professional breeders are
who presently hold office on the com-
mittee.
I would also like to mention for
McNicoll’s benefit that the thorough-
bred breeders are the people who invest
fortunes in the industry to supply the
actors for racing and only a very small
proportion of these breeders get a good
return on the money they invest.
JOHN W. KELLY
Boorowa NSW
David McNicoll writes: “It is not
necessary for committeemen to be pro-
fessional breeders in order to have a sub-
stantial involvement in breeding. Mr
Kelly will be aware of those to whom this
applies. I stick to my point a couple of
good businessmen, rather than breeders,
is what the AJC committee needs at pre-
sent. ”

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
No grounds
THE Commonwealth Direc-
tor of Public Prosecutions,
lan Temby, QC, found no
grounds in the Briese Affair to
lay criminal charges against
anyone. Briese, Chief Stipen-
diary Magistrate for NSW, al-
leged that Justice Foord of the
NSW District Court talked to
him about the case of Sydney
solicitor Morgan Ryan facing
charges about an alleged im-
migration racket. He (Foord)
allegedly said “Neville”
wanted something done to
help Ryan.
• See story page 24
Roxby blockade
THE Roxby Downs anti-ura-
nium blockade began with
police outnumbering protest-
ers three to one. A spokeswo-
man for the blockaders said
hundreds more protesters
were expected to join the
demonstrations, planned to
last at least six weeks.
Lending record
FIGURES released by the
Australian Bureau of Statis-
tics show that Australia’s
building societies lent $3370
million for housing in the
1983-84 financial year. It was
a record.
Young reinstated
AFTER AN inquiry into
the circumstances of Mick
Young’s false customs declar-
ation had cleared him of any
impropriety he was reinstated
to the cabinet in his portfolio
of Special Minister of State.
Michael Black, QC, who con-
ducted the inquiry, found that
“there was no intention to
evade duty and no attempt
wilfully to mislead any Cus-
toms officer.”
Education funds plan
THE Minister for Education
and Youth Affairs, Senator
Susan Ryan, announced that
the Federal Government will
continue funding state and
private schools for at least the
next eight years. The scheme
will increase funds by 1.8 per-
cent to private schools and by
5.7 percent to government
schools next year and by, re-
spectively, 17.2 percent and
50 percent by 1992.

Average earnings
AVERAGE adult total weekly
earnings including over-
time, penalty and above-
award payments have risen
$39 since the June quarter of
1983 to $386.30 a week. This
means that workers on av-
erage weekly male earnings
have moved into the 46c-in-
the-dollar tax bracket during
the year.
Top men quit
THE voluntary resignation of
Treasury Secretary John
Stone and the removal of
NSW Finance Department
Secretary David Horton have
created temporary vacancies
in the highest echelons of the
bureaucracy.
Footballer dies
ANTHONY GRANT, 19, of
Murray Upper, near Tully,
died in Brisbane’s Princess
Alexandra Hospital a week
after he had suffered neck in-
juries in a rugby league match
at Innisfail, northern Queens-
land.
Migration survey
A SURVEY released by the
Ethnic Affairs Commission
found that Australians now
accept most easily British im-
migrants followed by Italians,
Greeks, Jews, Yugoslavs,
Dutch, Japanese, Lebanese
and Vietnamese in that order.
The report argues that accept-
ability changes. Italian immi-
grants were at the bottom in
1945.
Exercise dispute
SEVEN members of a main-
tenance crew at a Bass Strait
oil rig objected to an exercise
by an army Special Air Ser-
vice (SAS) squad and were
flown to another rig. Another
40 workers on the rig who did
not object to the commando
training operation continued
to work normally.
THE WORLD
Mines mystery
ALL week British, French,
US, Egyptian and (hunting in-
dependently) Soviet mine-
sweepers and helicopters were
vainly searching for mystery
devices which had damaged
up to 20 ships in the Red Sea
and the Gulf of Suez since
July 9. By the weekend main
suspicion for laying the de-
vices was falling on the
Libyan ferry Ghat which
passed through the Suez Ca-
nal on July 6 then followed an
“erratic course” before calling
on the Ethiopian port of
Assab.
Reagan-Bush lead
THE latest New York Times-
CBS poll of 1616 US adults
showed the Reagan-Bush
team holding a lead of 49
percent to 34 percent over the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket in the
election campaign. According
to the survey, 62 percent of
Americans approved of the
nomination of a woman for
the vice-presidency.
Plastic bullet death
ABOUT 5000 people par-
ticipated at the Belfast funeral

you’re Arthur or Martha."
killed by a plastic bullet which
police had fired during an
attempt to arrest Martin Gal-
vin, leader of the US-based
Irish Republican fund-raising
group Noraid.
Bomb cop confesses
LOS ANGELES policeman
James Pearson, 40, who
claimed he had discovered
and defused a bomb attached
to a bus carrying the luggage
of Turkish Olympic athletes
was arrested and charged with
having planted the explosive
device himself. Pearson con-
fessed.
Minister ‘responsible’
PAPUA New Guinea’s Prov-
incial Affairs minister John
Nilkare took “full responsibil-
ity” for the failure of his de-
partment to care for the flood
of refugees who poured in
from Irian Jaya. Fifty-four of
them died of starvation. But
the PNG government refuted
charges that it was trying to
starve refugees back to West
Irian.
Deaths
AUTHOR, playwright and
broadcaster J. B. Priestley,
after a few days’ illness at his
home in Stratford-upon-
Avon, England. He was 89.
Tigran Petrosyan, 55, world
champion Soviet chess player
from 1963 to 1969, after a long
illness in a Moscow hospital.
BUSINESS
Interest drop
BANK primes led the way to
lower interest rates. After
Westpac and the ANZ had
lowered their business prime
rates for amounts of more
than $lOO,OOO from 14.5 to
14.25 percent, the Common-
wealth dropped its rate to 14
percent.
Profit doubled
LOCAL housing and United
States and other overseas ac-
tivities helped Hooker Cor-
poration Ltd to double profit
to $20.2 million in the year to
June 30. The government’s
first home owners’ scheme
contributed to a 25 percent lift
in Hooker’s home sales to
1376. At the same time, prop-
erty and construction group
Lend Lease Corporation is
lifting dividend and making a
one-for-10 bonus issue after a
35 percent increase in net
profit to $41.5 million in
the year to June 30.
Shares drama
THE shares of Western Aus-
tralian explorer Maitland
Mining NL were suspended
after the price more than
doubled to 40 cents. The rise
was sparked by a Perth tele-
vision report of a major gold
discovery at Halls Creek, WA,
with reports of reserves of “20
million tonnes” bearing an
average of 8 gms to the tonne.
After Maitland management
refuted the specific figures,
saying that drilling results
were preliminary, the stock
was relisted. Even after its re-
turn, Maitland traded as high
as 43 cents.
Huge turnabout
TOYOTA car manufacturer
AMI Industries Ltd answered
persistent attacks on its per-
formance by its 10 percent
shareholder GWA Ltd by re-
cording a $16.6 million profit
turnaround in the June year.

EXCLUSIVEI
Secret
report clears Wran
For the past two weeks, the New South Wales
Government has been under fire over allegations
that a judge had tried to influence the outcome
of a court case and that Premier Wran was im-
plicated. The Bulletin has now obtained the con-
fidential report of the Solicitor-General Mary
Gaudron in which she exonerates the Premier
and finds there is no evidence which would jus-
tify a conspiracy charge. The Bulletin’s Editor-
in-Chief TREVOR KENNEDY, tells what the
Gaudron report said.
THE SECRET report by the NSW Sol-
icitor-General, Mary Gaudron, into cer-
tain allegations by Chief Stipendiary
Magistrate Clarrie Briese unequivocally
clears alleged participants of any
wrongdoing.
The allegations, that a District Court
judge at the instigation of a NSW
Government minister had sought to
influence a magistrate who was hearing
charges against Sydney solicitor
Morgan John Ryan, have again em-
broiled the Wran Labor Government in
controversy.
However, a copy of the secret docu-
ment exclusively obtained by The Bul-
letin clearly shows why the government
has refused to engage in further investi-
gations into the matter despite wide-
spread calls from some sections of the
media and the state Opposition.
The report’s strength derives not
only from its failure to recommend fur-
ther action but also from the nature of
its author. Gaudron, who has been
called “Mary the Merciless,” is renown-
ed for scrupulous integrity and legal
brilliance.
Gaudron’s report apart from
seriously discounting the sub-
stantiveness of the Briese allegations
strenuously warns that the indepen-
dence of the judiciary could be gravely
endangered by further official inquiries,
such as a royal commission, into the
charges.
Gaudron’s report has been kept
under wraps because advices between
the Solicitor-General and the govern-
ment (it’s a lawyer-client relationship)
traditionally are confidential.
The leaking of the document could
be a further embarrassment to the gov-
ernment. On the other hand, it goes
some way to explaining why the govern-
ment and particularly Premier Neville
Wran have taken the stand
they have.
There has been speculation
that Wran was the minister
involved in the Briese allega-
tions. The Gaudron report not
only discounts this but sug-
gests that the latter-day con-
troversy which has surround-
ed publication of The Age
tapes led Briese to various
misinterpretations about min-
isterial involvement.
In relation to ministerial
involvement, Gaudron has
this to say: “Even more tenu-
ous than the theory that the
District Court judge was
involved in a conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice is
the notion that the senior gov-
ernment minister might also
be implicated. The reference
to the minister, if indeed it
was made, does not constitute
evidence admissible against
him. The inquiries made of
Mr Bruce Brown [Deputy
Mary Gaudron: “... Brlese has placed misinter-
pretation on the events which occurred”


Chairman of Magistrates], to which ref-
erence has already been made in con-
nection with the identity of the minister,
are relevant only as to the credibility of
Mr Briese and are of no evidentiary use
(being, as against the minister, double
hearsay) to support any theory involv-
ing the minister.”
Further on, under the heading “The
credibility of the complaint made by Mr
Briese,” Gaudron says: “Although, as
indicated above, the claims made by Mr
Briese do not provide evidence of the
commission of any criminal offence,
there are a number of matters which
would suggest that in any event the
more likely explanation is that with
hindsight Mr Briese has placed a misin-
terpretation on the events which occur-
red.” In this respect Gaudron is refer-
ring to the fact that other allegations,
made quite separately in the media and
other discussions of The Age tapes, led
Mr Briese so long after the alleged
event occurred to raise the matters he
did. (The Age tapes recorded illegally
by NSW police cover telephone con-
versations by Ryan and purport to as-
sociate him with identities in the law,
crime and politics.)
It is the apparently gratuitous con-
nection of Wran to every incident that
occurs which has driven him to the
angry reactions of recent times. The Bul-
letin knows that the transcripts of The
Age tapes do not mention the Premier’s
name. They have appended to them a
summary which does mention Wran.
But perhaps he is entitled to be angry
at the selective publication which in-
directly reflects on him because in that
summary is a direct statement that the
telephone discussions reveal that
Morgan Ryan received no assistance
from Wran at any time in relation to
any matter.
Indeed, one transcript purports to re-
cord that Ryan tells the person at the
other end of the phone that Wran is not
a crook and that there is no way Wran
can be influenced.
The Briese allegations have put the
government in an extraordinarily diffi-
cult position. On the one hand is the
trial by innuendo, then there are public
calls for another inquiry with all its
attendant expense and the debilitation
of public life that would accompany it.
Gaudron strongly opposes further
investigation based on the evidence she
has so far seen.
She says in the report: “The course
advocated in some newspaper reports,
for the establishment of some public in-
quiry, is one which I find wholly with-
out precedent and with very serious im-
plications for judicial independence.”
Gaudron goes on to quote a gaggle
of authoritative and eminent legal pre-
cedents for the view she expounds. The
possibility of future generations of
judges being threatened with public in-
quiries into phoney allegations obvious-
ly has concerned her greatly.
The background and the cast
MARY GAUDRON’S report is
difficult to follow for any reader
unversed in its background, es-
pecially as several important char-
acters are not referred to by name.
Sydney solicitor Morgan Ryan
was charged with having conspired
with others to procure, by unlawful
means, permanent resident status
for 22 Koreans between June 30,
1976, and June 30, 1980, at Sydney.
He was, in 1981, committed by
Kevin Jones SM for trial. In the Su-
preme Court, subsequently, a jury
found Ryan guilty and Mr Justice
Flannery fined Ryan $4OO and re-
leased him on a five-year good be-
haviour bond.
The NSW Court of Criminal Ap-
peal quashed the conviction on July
26 this year and ordered a re-trial
after Ryan had appealed.
On July 5 this year, Chief Stipen-
diary Magistrate Clarrie Briese ap-
proached the Under-Secretary of
Justice in NSW, Trevor Haines, and
alleged that a District Court judge
had approached him (Briese) in re-
spect of the original committal pro-
ceedings in the Ryan case.
Mr Justice John Foord sub-
sequently identified himself as the
judge but denied any suggestion that
he had tried to influence the com-
mittal proceedings.
Briese also had claimed that
Foord told him that “Neville” had
an interest in the case. The Premier,
Neville Wran, has said he could not
be the “Neville” referred to as he
had never spoken to Foord about
the case.
Solicitor-General Mary Gaudron
was appointed to report on Briese’s
allegations. She reported to Attor-
ney-General Paul Landa who an-
nounced in the Legislative As-
sembly on August 14 that the allega-
tions did not constitute evidence of
judicial misconduct, nor an offence.


Gaudron’s 25-foolscap-page report
is obviously too long to publish in full
here. What follows is an abridged ver-
sion, mainly omitting quotation of legal
precedents, which should give an indi-
cation of the tone and flavor of the re-
port.
Report into Certain Matters
raised by Mr C.R. Briese,
Chairman of Magistrates,
concerning Commital Proceedings
against Mr Morgan Ryan.
ON sth JULY 1984 Mr C.R.
Briese attended on the Under
Secretary of Justice and in-
formed him that he (Mr
Briese) had had certain dis-
cussions with the Chief Judge
of the District Court in which
he (Mr Briese) had confirmed
to the Chief Judge that a Dis-
trict Court judge had ap-
proached him in respect of
certain committal proceed-
ings against Mr Morgan
Ryan. Mr Briese declined to
name the judge or give precise
details. The same day, the
Under Secretary sought a
written report from Mr Briese
concerning the matter.
On 10th July Mr Briese re-
plied to the Under Secretary,
again declining to name the
judge. He reported that he
had declined to name the
judge to the Chief Judge and
had informed the Chief Judge
“that it would only be appro-
priate to name him at any in-
quiry” [into the existence of a con-
spiracy] “between Morgan Ryan and a
variety of individuals, many of whom
occupy (either now or in the past) pos-
itions of high standing in the commu-
nity.”
Mr Briese claimed in that letter that,
in February 1982, he received a call
from the District Court judge who was
then in the country. The judge asked to
meet him in the following week to dis-
cuss a delicate matter. According to Mr
Briese, the judge rang the following
week and an arrangement was made to
meet at Tattersall’s [sic] Club. At that
meeting the judge referred to a person
who has been identified in media re-
ports as a Senior Government Minister,
and said that he wanted “something
done for Morgan Ryan.” The account
given by Mr Briese continues: “He later
said, ‘I don’t know the magistrate who is
hearing the case. If it was one of the old
Central Magistrates I knew in the past I
could go and speak with him myself.’
He did however state that he knew Mr
Jones was hearing the case. I told him
that nobody should approach the mag-
istrate. I also told him that the magis-
trate, Mr Kevin Jones, was also the
magistrate who had heard the Hum-
phreys Case. I shortly summarised what
was alleged to have happened in that
case ... I indicated that I had been told
by some of Mr Jones’ colleagues that
since the dismissal of that case against
Humphreys, Jones had suffered a great
deal. The judge then said words to the
effect: ‘lt could be counter-productive
to see Jones. I think my advice should
be to get McHugh to address on evi-
dence.’
Mr Briese states that there was some
Clarrie Briese, SM
NEWS LIMITED
further general discussion and reports,
“In fact, Mr T.E.F. Hughes was briefed
to make the final address on evidence.”
On 12th July 1984 the Under Secre-
tary directed further questions to Mr
Briese, who replied on 17th July 1984.
In that latter letter Mr Briese identified
the judge.
The judge has since replied to the
Chief Judge and to the Attorney Gener-
al denying that “the remarks attributed
to me by Mr Briese were made or that
any request or suggestion was made by
me that he interfere in the proceedings
against Morgan Ryan.”
An inquiry was also made of a per-
son being a Minister of the Govern-
ment, and the only such Minister whose
Christian name is that allegedly used by
the District Court judge. Other inquiries
of Mr Bruce Brown, Deputy Chairman
of Magistrates, to whom Mr Briese had
spoken of the incident earlier this year,
tended to support our view that the in-
quiry was directed to the correct Minis-
ter. For reasons which are hereafter dis-
cussed, Mr Brown’s response to such in-
quiries does not and cannot corroborate
in any way the claim made by Mr
Briese. The Minister has denied having
any conversation or communication
with the judge concerning the Morgan
Ryan committal proceedings.
Other inquiries were also made, and,
at my request, Mr Briese attended my
Chambers and in the presence of the
Crown Advocate and the Under Secre-
tary answered a number of questions
put by me. These matters will be dis-
cussed later. At this stage it is pertinent
to consider the committal proceedings
referred to by Mr Briese.
IN AUGUST 1981, Morgan Ryan was
charged with “Conspiracy to effect a
lawful purpose by means unlawful
under a law of the Commonwealth” and
“Forging a document deliverable to a
Department of the Commonwealth.”
(Commonwealth Crimes Act, 1914, sec-
tions 86(l)(d) and 67(b)). The proceed-
ings commenced before Mr Kevin
Jones SM on sth November 1981. Evi-
dence was presented on that day and on
6th November, 16th and 17th Dec-
ember. On all such occasions Mr
Morgan Ryan was represented by Mr
Bruce Miles, solicitor. On 18th
December, Mr Ryan was represented by
Mr Gormly QC and Mr Kilduff, who
appeared again on 22nd December
when Mr Gormly addressed on the evi-
dence which had been presented. On
29th December 1981 Mr Jones ruled
that a prima facie case existed on both
charges. The matter was adjourned on a
number of subsequent occasions to en-
able further evidence and argument on
whether a jury would convict. On 22nd
March 1982 Mr Miles again appeared
for Mr Ryan: character evidence was
led from three witnesses. On the same
day, Mr Jones committed for trial.
FOR REASONS which will be detailed
hereafter, the only aspect of the claim
made by Mr Briese which is strictly
within the reach of New South Wales
law is the question whether the conduct
of the judge constitutes judicial misbe-
haviour. For reasons which will also be
considered later in this report, the con-
duct will only constitute judicial misbe-
haviour if it amounts to a criminal
offence involving moral turpitude and
of a nature inconsistent with the holding
of judicial office. Although the judge
has denied any misconduct on his part,
and there are reasons internal to the
claim made by Mr Briese which would
require that his denial should be given
greater credibility than the claim, it is
convenient to analyse the claim as made
to determine whether it reveals a crimi-
nal offence. There are three offences
which require consideration: perversion
of the course of justice, attempt to per-
vert the course of justice, and con-
spiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Clearly the offence of perversion of


the course of justice is not here relevant.
Jones was in fact committed for trial. A
trial occurred, and Morgan Ryan [was]
convicted. An appeal against that con-
viction was successful, and the question
of further proceedings is a matter for
Commonwealth authorities.
Mr Briese, in his letter of 10th July
1984 stated: “I have no reason to be-
lieve that any interference or influence
was brought to bear on Mr Jones and I
believe he dealt with the case to finality
(as far as he was concerned) un-
influenced by any irrelevant or im-
proper consideration. This is what I
wanted to happen, and this I believe is
what did happen.”
In his subsequent letter of 17th July,
Mr Briese similarly stated: “... because
of the way I handled the two ap-
proaches to me, it appeared there was
no interference or influence in fact
brought to bear on the Magistrate hear-
ing the case.”
Similarly, although not so explicitly,
Mr Briese does not allege that the judge
himself attempted to pervert the course
of justice. As Mr Briese was not himself
hearing the case, the most sinister inter-
pretation that can be put upon the claim
is that the judge was attempting to enlist
Mr Briese to have him seek to influence
the magistrate who was hearing the
case. On this view, had Mr Briese been a
willing recruit, a criminal offence of
conspiracy would have been committed.
But of course, no such recruitment was
effected, and consequently no criminal
offence occurred.
It is implicit in the letters from Mr
Briese that this is the highest at which
his claim can be put. Indeed in his letter
of 17th July 1984, Mr Briese acknowl-
edges that there is another, and much
less sinister interpretation which could
be put on the conversation. He says:
“Viewed by itself, the approach could
no doubt be sought to be interpreted as
a judge going to the Chairman of the
Bench to ascertain whether I knew how
strong the case against Ryan was and
whether he was being adequately repre-
sented.”
When interviewed, Mr Briese was ex-
plicit in his acknowledgement that no
specific request was made to him to do
anything in relation to the Ryan matter,
and that he cannot even say that there
was an attempt to request him to do
anything. In case the conversation had
that implication, according to Mr
Briese, he made it clear in his discussion
of Mr Jones’ situation that there was
nothing which he, Mr Briese, could or
would do.
In his letters and in his discussion Mr
Briese was insistent that the approach
by the judge to him should not be
viewed in isolation. “Viewed in isola-
tion” he said in discussion, “it was not
an attempt to pervert the course of jus-
tice.” The substance of Mr Briese’s con-
tention is that there was a possible con-
spiracy between Morgan Ryan and
other high ranking people. In his letter
of 10th July 1984 Mr Briese identified
“the possibility of the existence of a
conspiracy between Morgan Ryan and
a variety of individuals.” He did not
identify the nature of the conspiracy. In
his subsequent letter of 17th July he
identified “the basis for ‘the possibility
of a conspiracy’ (as) the nature of the
material contained in the Age tapes
coupled with my experiences during the
Sydney solicitor Morgan Ryan
JOHN FAIRFAX & SONS LTD
last 5!4 years, including what I have
learned from you in our discussions re-
ferred to above.” In discussion he
amplified that basis by reference to a
number of matters which have been
subject to some media scrutiny, inclu-
ding one aspect of the matters con-
sidered last year in the Street Royal
Commission, the terms of reference of
which, he seems to imply, were unduly
narrow. He referred also to the content
of the Age tapes and some discussion
between him and Mr Justice Murphy
about which he, Mr Briese, gave evi-
dence to the Senate Committee estab-
lished in consequence of the Age tapes.
Again, Mr Briese supplied no details as
to the nature of this possible conspiracy,
and I apprehend, so far as his theory
proceeds, it is based upon the notion of
guilt by association. Despite long dis-
cussion, Mr Briese did not provide any
factual material which would advance
the existence of a conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice in relation to the
charges laid against Morgan Ryan be-
yond that provided in his letters of 10th
and 17th July.
All that can be drawn from the letters
of Mr Briese in support of a conspiracy
to pervert the course of justice is that on
separate occasions two persons, each of
whom knew Morgan Ryan, approached
Mr Briese in relation to the committal
proceedings against Morgan Ryan.
That falls far short of evidence which
would sustain the existence of a con-
spiracy involving the District Court
judge to pervert the course of justice.
Even more tenuous than the theory
that the District Court judge was
involved in a conspiracy to pervert the
course of justice is the notion that the
senior Government Minister
might also be implicated. The
reference to the Minister, if
indeed it was made, does not
constitute evidence admis-
sible against him. The inquir-
ies made of Mr Bruce Brown,
to which reference has already
been made in connection with
the identity of the Minister,
are relevant only as to the
credibility of Mr Briese, and
are of no evidentiary use (be-
ing as against the Minister
double hearsay) to support
any theory involving the Min-
ister.
ALTHOUGH as indicated
above, the claims made by Mr
Briese do not provide evi-
dence of the commission of
any criminal offence, there are
a number of matters which
would suggest that in any
event, the more likely expla-
nation is that with hindsight,
Mr Briese has placed a misin-
terpretation on the events which occur-
red.
The first such matter is the date on
which the approach by the District
Court judge was allegedly made. In dis-
cussion, Mr Briese was positive that the
meeting could not have taken place
earlier than February. He fixed the time
by reference to earlier events which oc-
curred in part in January, and in part in
early February. By that time Mr Jones
had already found that a prima facie
case existed, but had not ruled on
whether the evidence was sufficient to
warrant trial (Justices Act, section 41).
Senior counsel (Mr Gormly Q.C.) had
already addressed on the evidence. If
the conversation occurred in the man-
ner recounted by Mr Briese, then clearly
the District Court judge had no detailed
knowledge of the proceedings, the lack
of which would be surprising on the
part of such a person if his motives were
in any way dishonourable.
The second matter which causes con-
cern is the delay involved in Mr Briese’s
bringing this matter to the attention of
the Under Secretary, and any other per-
son with relevant authority in respect of


the matter. It could, for example, have
been raised with the Chief Judge or my-
self.
In his letter of 10th July, Mr Briese
reported that he informed the Chief
Judge in his discussions with him on sth
July that: “... taking into account the
nature of the approach and what sub-
sequently transpired, in particular that
it appeared there was no interference or
influence brought to bear on the magis-
trate, Mr Kevin Jones, or the hearing of
the case ... I did not at that time con-
sider it necessary for me to raise the
matter with the Chief Judge or
anybody else.”
I must say I find that expla-
nation unconvincing. If the
incident occurred in the man-
ner claimed by Mr Briese, it
was, even in isolation, a gross
indiscretion and one of which
I should think the Chief Judge
had an interest in being in-
formed. From the point of
view of the Magistrates’
Bench, the Chairman clearly
had an interest to ensure that
District Court judges, who
hear appeals from Magis-
trates, did not canvass current
cases with members of the
Bench of Magistrates.
It is implicit in his letter of
17th July that Mr Briese re-
gards the failure to report the
matter sooner as justified by
the matter assuming signifi-
cance in the context of ‘the
Age' tapes. In discussion with
me, Mr Briese said that
viewed in isolation the meet-
ing with the District Court judge was “a
minor incident really. The major thing
is the material in ‘the Age' tapes and my
experiences over 514 years.” I have al-
ready adverted to the unsatisfactory na-
ture of the matters advanced by Mr
Briese in amplification of that state-
ment. He said also that he has ‘had to re-
interpret events as things unfolded’. In
our discussion Mr Briese emphasized
that the incident should not be viewed
in isolation, and asserted that “to inves-
tigate it in isolation would be not in ac-
cordance with the interests of justice.”
The explanation offered by Mr
Briese, rather than explaining the delay,
seemed to me to suggest that he might
have “re-interpreted” whatever meeting
occurred between him and the District
Court judge to reinforce what he admit-
ted were “suspicions I have held” which
were “confirmed in my mind” when “I
saw ‘the Age' tapes.”
Another matter which causes con-
cern is that the District Court judge was
not well known to Mr Briese. The judge
as a barrister had appeared before Mr
Briese on some few occasions. They
may have met each other once at an
office party given by Mr Nyman, solici-
tor. That was the full extent of their pre-
vious contact. On the other hand, as a
result of inquiries made by the Under
Secretary, it was learned that there was
a warm relationship between the judge
and Mr Bruce Brown, Deputy Chair-
man of Magistrates. In response to
questions directed to Mr Brown by the
Under Secretary, Mr Brown vigorously
asserted that the judge had “never acted
improperly or inappropriately in any
way towards me. Specifically, he has
never sought to influence in any way,
Kevin Jones, SM
any case before me or, through me, any
case before any of my fellow Magis-
trates.” Had the judge had any im-
proper motive, one might think that the
natural course would have been to raise
the matter, even in some discreet way,
with the Deputy Chairman with whom
he had a warm and friendly relation-
ship, rather than the Chairman with
whom he had only a limited acquaint-
ance.
In his letters of 10th and 17th July,
Mr Briese nominated three persons
(apart from family members) with
whom he had discussed the approach
allegedly made by the District Court
judge. They were Mr Bruce Brown,
Deputy Chairman of Magistrates, Mr
Hans Heilpern, previously an officer of
this Department; and presently the Di-
rector of Youth and Community Ser-
vices, and the Honourable B. J.
Unsworth, M.L.C., Minister for Trans-
port.
Mr Brown confirms that Mr Briese
told him of the approach by the District
Court judge. I have already mentioned
that the relevance of Mr Brown’s re-
sponse is limited to the question of the
credibility of Mr Briese. Mr Brown is
able simply to confirm that Mr Briese
spoke to him about the matter. That
does not itself constitute any evidence
as to what in fact occurred.
Inquiries of Mr Heilpern revealed
that he had lunched with Mr Briese at
the time nominated by Mr Briese, but he
stated: “... My recollection is that Mr
Briese referred to a dinner he attended
with Mr Ryan some years ago. I have no
recollection of having any conversation
with Mr Briese in relation to the com-
mittal proceedings of Morgan Ryan.”
Similarly, Mr Unsworth recollects
that Mr Briese spoke to him suggesting
that “someone involved in the Labor
Party should warn the then newly
elected Federal Government that a suc-
cessful (No Bill) application (by Mr
Morgan Ryan) could attract adverse
political publicity.” Mr Unsworth has
no recollection of any conversation
about an approach to Mr Briese by a
District Court judge.
In the course of discussion I asked
Mr Briese why he communicated the al-
leged approach to Mr Heilpern and Mr
Unsworth. He replied: “I wanted the
Labor Party to do something on a
broader basis. The allegations which
have been made have been very dam-
aging damaging to our institutions.
By giving this information, maybe
people at the top level may do some-
thing about this.”
When asked what he thought they
might do, he replied: “For example,
change the leadership.”
This was but one of the answers
which caused me to conclude that Mr
Briese was not entirely objective in his
consideration of the matters the subject
of his claim. I regret that I find it neces-
sary to be at all critical of the Chairman
of Magistrates, but fairness to the Dis-
trict Court judge requires that some
comment be made.
Although it is my view that the claim
made by Mr Briese will not withstand
critical analysis, I am also asked to ad-
vise what action should be taken in con-
sequence thereof. There are a number of
available courses of action which re-
quire consideration in the light of estab-
lished constitutional principle, inclu-
ding the independence of the judiciary.
I NOTE from newspaper reports and
discussion of the subject matter of this
advice that a view has been propounded
that the allegations should be the sub-
ject of a Royal Commission or Special
Commission of Inquiry. I have no
doubt that the provisions of the Royal
Commissions Act, 1923 and the Special
Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1983 are
wide enough to encompases an inquiry
into the conduct of a judicial officer.
The possibility of the establishment
of a public inquiry into the conduct of a


particular judge raises directly the ques-
tion of whether executive pressure may
be said to be compatible with judicial
independence...
Bearing in mind the practice of the
House of Commons in relation to
motions for removal, the writing of
learned authors and the experience of
Lord Hailsham, a highly distinguished
and learned Lord Chancellor, I con-
ceive that it would only be in the most
extraordinary case that the executive
government would establish a public in-
quiry into the conduct of an individual
judge. I hesitate to formulate such cir-
cumstances for the area is largely un-
charted, but I venture to suggest that
such circumstances would probably
only arise when, after making its own
due and proper inquiries, the Executive
forms a view that there are reasonable
grounds for belief that such an inquiry
will produce evidence not otherwise
available which will justify removal
from office ...
I would not presume in this advice to
touch upon the role of Parliament in
such matters, but it would seem to me
that ... it must always be open to the
Parliament, subject to its own rules, to
embark upon a consideration of matters
touching the administration of justice.
However that is in essence a different
matter from the action which should or
might be taken by the executive govern-
ment.
In similar vein to the practice of Par-
liament above discussed, is the principle
that the “Government ought not to sup-
port a motion (for an inquiry into the
conduct of a judge) without having
themselves instituted some preliminary
investigations, and prepared to say, that
there was a fit occasion for following it
up by an address to the Crown ...”
If my formulation of principle be
accepted, it follows that in the present
case an inquiry should be established
only if it were thought likely to pro-
duce evidence which would result in
the conviction of the judge for a crimi-
nal offence ...
In the present case, I have no reason
to believe that any public inquiry, no
matter how extensive its powers of com-
pulsion, would provide evidence which
would implicate the District Court
judge in a criminal conspiracy, that be-
ing the only relevant offence suggested
by my analysis of the claim under con-
sideration. So far as I know there is no
material (not even hearsay) in ‘the Age ’
tapes which touches the judge in any
manner. The only other matter which is
suggested as supporting such a con-
spiracy is the judge’s association with
Mr Ryan. Assuming there to be or to
have been such an association, associa-
tion alone does not a conspiracy make.
Accordingly on the test I have
formulated, there is no basis for the es-
tablishment of a public inquiry into the
matter. I acknowledge, but confess I do
not understand, the view that a public
inquiry provides an opportunity for a
person to clear his or her good name. If
such were to be the justification for a
public inquiry, then I apprehend, that
consistent with the principle of judicial
independence, an inquiry would be es-
tablished as a result of the direct request
of the judge concerned, and perhaps
then, only if endorsed by the Chief
Judge.
There is one other matter of constitu-
NSW Premier Neville Wran
tional law which militates against the es-
tablishment of a public inquiry, particu-
larly if such inquiry is to be attended by
powers of compulsion ...
As the charges the subject of the rel-
evant committal proceedings concerned
offences under the Commonwealth
Crimes Act, it follows that any alleged
conspiracy (or for that matter any al-
leged attempt) to pervert the course of
justice in relation to those proceedings,
is a matter to be determined in accord-
ance with Commonwealth Law ...
The claim made by Mr Briese in rela-
tion to the Morgan Ryan committal
proceedings is one essentially for evalu-
ation by Commonwealth Authorities.
As Mr Temby, QC, Director of Public
Prosecutions for the Commonwealth,
has recently conducted The Age tapes
investigation, and the content of those
tapes appears to be central to matters
raised by Mr Briese, I would suggest
that the material made available to the
Under Secretary be forwarded to him
for his evaluation, and for such further
action as he considers appropriate.
If the Attorney-General is minded to
accept the advice, a copy should be pro-
vided to the Chief Judge of the District
Court for his information and with the
request that he inform the Judge con-
cerned that after investigation the Attor-
ney-General is satisfied that he should
take no further action in the matter.
What, if any, public announcement
should be made is a matter for the At-
torney-General to decide, although I
should think that that is a matter which
might be discussed with the Chief
Judge. □
M. GAUDRON
Solicitor-General
31st July 1984
Richard Farmer reports from
Canberra: Federal Director of
Public Prosecutions lan
Temby, QC, did not take long
to find that there was “insuffi-
cient basis on which to lay
criminal charges.”
In his statement, Temby
said that except in one re-
spect, what Briese said was
notably vague. The particular
allegation he made was that
he was approached by Judge
Foord of the New South
Wales District Court who told
him that “Neville” wanted
something done for Morgan
Ryan, after which there was a
discussion as to the current
state of the committal pro-
ceedings.
Premier Neville Wran had
denied speaking to Judge
Foord. “On the assumption
that Mr Briese has accurately
recollected what Judge Foord
said to him, that provides no evidence
against the Premier,” Temby said in his
statement. “Judge Foord has emphati-
cally denied that the remarks attributed
to him by Mr Briese were made, or that
any request or suggestion was made by
him that Mr Briese interfere in the pro-
ceedings against Mr Ryan.”
Temby’s statement continued: “Mr
Briese made no complaint about the
conversation he had with Judge Foord
until recently, although it occurred over
two and a half years ago. When he did
make complaint he conceded that the
alleged approach by Judge Foord could
be sought to be interpreted innocuously
as a judge going to the chairman of the
Bench to ascertain how strong a case
was and whether the defendant was be-
ing adequately represented. Whatever
views might be held as to the wisdom of
such an approach, that interpretation is
clearly open. Being open, it negates
criminality. Mr Briese has not suggested
he was asked to do anything, or that
there was any suggestion of benefit to
himself or anyone else.”
The only gap in the material
examined by Temby was evidence given


by Briese to the Senate committee in-
quiring into The Age tapes and sugges-
tions of impropriety by High Court
Judge Lionel Murphy.
Temby had wanted access to this evi-
dence because of suggestions by Briese
that his comments about Judge Foord
should be seen in context. The Senate
committee refused to make this material
available. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Cain slips but
ALP stronger
in Victoria
SUPPORT for the Australian Labor
Party in Victoria was up 3 percent to 52
percent during July. Liberal backing
was down 2 percent to 36 percent, the
National Party had 5 percent (down 1),
the Democrats 4 (down 1), and other
parties 3 percent. The ALP would have
been returned in an election at the end
of July, with about the same majority it
holds, the Morgan Gallup Poll finds.
But John Cain’s approval rating as
Premier was down 3 percent to 48 while
that of Jeff Kennett as Leader of the Op-
position was unchanged at 37. Twenty-
six percent of electors remained unde-
cided about Kennett.
This poll surveyed 1087 electors
throughout Victoria in the month,
asking which party would receive their
first preference “if a state election were
being held today?” Only 7 percent did
not indicate a preference.
The following table compares the
latest result with those of previous
Morgan Gallup Polls and with the April
1982 state election result.

Electors then were asked whether
they approved or disapproved of how

People who approved of Cain’s work
made comments including “He’s a good
leader,” “He’s concerned for people”
and “He’s honest.” Disapprovers cited
“too many” increases in gas charges,
rail fares and taxes and some said, “He

Those who approved of the way in
which Kennett was handling his job
made such remarks as “He’s a good
leader,” “He is honest and trustworthy,”
“He speaks when he has to” and “He
speaks rationally.” Others said: “He is

Steady as she

Hawke and ALP
ON THE weekends of August 4/5 and
11/12, support for the Australian Labor
Party was 51 percent, while 42 percent
(down 2 percent) supported the L-NP, 5
percent Australian Democrats and 2
percent other parties.
If a Federal election had been held at
the beginning of August, the ALP would
have been returned with an increased
majority, the Morgan Gallup Poll finds.
If the Senate election had been held
the ALP would have obtained 46 per-
cent which is 5 percent less than the
ALP support for the House of Repre-
sentatives. The Australian Democrats
and independent candidates would
have held the balance of power.
At the beginning of August, 68 per-
cent (unchanged) approved of the way
Prime Minister Bob Hawke was hand-
ling his job. At the same time, 35 per-
cent (down 2 percent) approved of the
way Andrew Peacock was handling his
job as Leader of the Opposition.
Of all electors surveyed, 70 percent
(unchanged) said they felt Hawke
would make a better Prime Minister,
while 17 percent (unchanged) said Pea-
cock. However, of L-NP voters sur-
veyed, 45 percent (up 1 percent), said
Hawke would make the better Prime
Minister, while 36 percent (down 1 per-
cent) said Peacock and 19 percent were
undecided.

THE MEDIA
Radio’s battle
of the
newsrooms
Macquarie Network’s Tony Townsend: an extended network builds status
By GERALDINE WALSH
RADIO NEWS is a far cry from the
days when ABC announcers decked
themselves out in dinner suits to read
the news in sonorous tones. In those
days the ABC had a mortgage on our
news it was the good oil and commer-
cial radio news was, by contrast, a case
of oils not being oils.
These days radio news is as highly
competitive as the Olympic Games and
just as commercial. Somewhere along
the track the ABC has taken a fall as
dramatic as Mary Decker’s.
The Macquarie Network and Syd-
ney’s radio station 2UE are neck-and-
neck in a race to become the dominant.
Target of their news ambition are the
137 commercial radio stations through-
out the nation.
Fifty-nine stations, of which seven
are owned by Macquarie Network, take
the network’s news. Included are two
public broadcasters 2CBA FM in
Sydney and 2WEB Bourke.
The network covers Australia.
Though behind in the station count in
New South Wales, Macquarie is par-
ticularly strong in Victoria and Queens-
land where the network station 4BH re-
lays to 22 other stations.
2UE has an association with 45 other
stations. In NSW it outguns Mac-
quarie’s 15 stations with its 21 and
through its associate 6PR Perth net-
works widely in Western Australia.
Until now 2UE, whose parent com-
pany is the sizeable Broadcast Invest-
ments, has networked its news through
an association, not a company, called
the Major Broadcasting Network. By
the end of the month 2UE hopes to be
marketing its news through a company
by the name of United Network News
which will be but one aspect of Broad-
cast Investments’ services available to
broadcasting stations.
The activity in news networking can
be attributed to several factors. One is
the advanced computer technology now
available to radio newsrooms and an-
other is the alternative means of com-
munication the Aussat satellite will pro-
vide. For example 2UE has only one
news customer in Queensland 4BC in
Brisbane. 2UE sees, under the present
system, little chance of expansion in
that state as Macquarie has a
stranglehold on the available land lines
leased from Telecom.
There is another forthcoming devel-
opment in broadcasting encouraging
the networking of news and other pro-
grams. Communications Minister
Michael Duffy has called for applica-
tions for supplementary commercial
radio station licences one in each re-
gional radio station service area. Those
applications could be with him by early
September but it is unlikely that any of
the supplementary stations will be
operating before the satellite becomes
operational, possibly in late 1985.
The additional stations will increase
considerably the total hours broadcast
and the licencees will have to find pro-
gram material beyond their own re-
sources.
Macquarie’s news co-ordinator Tony
Townsend says an extended network
gives the news service an identity and
prestige. With each new station added,


Nick Erby: networking will extend beyond news
JOHN ELLIOTT
the number of newsmen within the net-
work increases and a mutually ben-
eficial arrangement results whereby the
new station feeds the network with its
really important local news. Townsend
cites dramatic coverage Murray Nichols
of SDN, Adelaide, supplied during the
South Australian bushfires. Through
Macquarie Nichols’ reports were heard
throughout Australia, Britain and the
United States.
Townsend considers radio
news has increased its im-
mediacy through the use of
new technology. He believes
that the ABC News is still in
pre-technology days men-
tally stuck in a print
journalism approach where
newsmakers words are
transcribed and then spoken
by announcers. He feels this
lacks emotion. “We don’t tell
people what Bob Hawke said,
we let our listeners hear him
saying it.”
According to 2UE director
of programs and news, Mark
Collier, the new communica-
tion technology allows actu-
ality news reporting to be
brought instantaneously to all
listeners within the network.
He rejoices in 2UE’s recently
installed New Star computer
system. “It allows journalists
to be journalists,” he says.
Macquarie has installed a
computer news system at 2GB
and Townsend says manage-
ment is attuned to the idea of
computerising the seven Mac-
quarie newsrooms despite a
possible cost of $1 million.
A late starter but display-
ing some speed in the net-
working race is 2WS. In
December 1982 the station in
Sydney’s western suburbs
merged with the Gosford
station 2GO to form the
Westgo broadcasting group.
Until then 2GO had taken
2UE’s news service. 2WS is
very much an area based
station as is 2GO and 2WS’s
news would not have been
suitable. 2WS decided that if
they had to supply a separate
news service to 2GO they
would network a national
commercial news similar to
the ABC’s national news.
The network service
started on May 1 and 6IX
Perth, SKA Adelaide, 4BK
Brisbane and 3FOX FM Mel-
bourne have taken up the ser-
vice. Several other stations
have expressed interest.
Broadcast Investment
executive Nick Erby sees the potential
for radio networking extending beyond
news. He recalls the days when John
Pearce was widely networked from
2GB.
He says: “If Mike Walsh is accept-
able to an Australia-wide audience why
can’t Ita Buttrose be just as acceptable
in a networked radio program that has a
magazine format?” □

EDUCATION
The government
schools are
fighting back
By ANTHONY HILL
THE LATEST Education Department
figures suggest there has been a slowing
down in the drift of students away from
government secondary schools to the
private education system.
While students at private secondary
schools last year increased by nearly
19,000 this was less than the increase of
nearly 22,500 forecast by the Schools
Commission.
More important, from the point of
view of government policy, the propor-
tion of students at government and pri-
vate secondary schools last year re-
mained almost exactly the same as it
was in 1982. The continuing decline in
the public sector, projected by the com-
mission, did not happen.
The main reason for this appears to
have been an unexpected and quite re-
markable turn-around in the retention
rates at government schools. Nearly
16,000 more students stayed on at gov-
ernment secondary schools than had
been anticipated.
It is too early to say whether the
trends evident in these figures will con-
tinue. Revised forecasts, based on this
year’s school enrolments, are not due to
be published by the Education Depart-
ment until next month.
But there are many unknown factors.
Nobody can tell yet whether the new
education funding guidelines, an-
nounced last week, will encourage more
parents to place children in those pri-
vate schools where academic standards
are perceived as being better than those
of government schools. Critics of the
guidelines say parents will.
And as the job market improves
there is the risk that more young people
will leave school early to try their luck
in the work force. While unemployment
for 15- to 19-year-olds remains high, the
June figures show that participation
rates for all but 17-year-olds increased
over the year.
It is here that the committee set up
under Professor Peter Karmel to review
the quality and effectiveness of educa-
tion assumes some importance.
The committee has been briefed to
look not only at improving standards of
literacy and numeracy in the schools
but also at ways to make the courses
more relevant to students wanting to go
to university or into the work force.
It has been argued that many second-
ary schools don’t equip students satis


factorily for either. Hence the
drift to the private schools, the
dole queues or, increasingly,
the Technical and Further
Education colleges.
If the quality of secondary
education can be improved, it
is hoped that the retention
levels in the government
schools will be maintained, if
not increased and the appar-
ent trend back to the public
school system stabilised.
The Education Minister,
Senator Susan Ryan, believes
that the flight away from the
government schools has been
slowed down, if not yet
reversed. She says that the
growth in the retention rates
at government secondary
schools is the first encoura-
ging sign that the $45 million
put into the Participation and
Equity program and the gen-
eral “talking up” of the ben-
efits of continuing education
are beginning to work.
Indeed, many private
schools outside the Catholic
education system have little room to ex-
pand with the constraints on capital
spending new private schools have to
give two years’ notice to qualify for as-
sistance Ryan believes major growth
will be in the government sector.
It is the main answer she gives to the
Teachers’ Federation and left-wing ALP
critics of the new Schools Commission
guidelines continuing funding for
wealthy private schools.
She argues that to concentrate atten-
tion on continued funding for the top
private schools in spite of last
month’s ALP conference vote to cut
funds is to ignore political realities in
an election year. It is also to waste ener-
gies on keeping the state aid debate
alive; energies which might be spent
better on improving the quality of gov-
ernment education.
Ryan will be putting these points to
the ALP caucus education committee
on Thursday.
The committee convenor, Victorian
MP Peter Staples, said: “I think many
people left, right and centre would
be amazed (at the guidelines) consider-
ing the strength of the conference de-
cisions which supported the public edu-
cation system.
“It should make the private schools
feel warm and secure and I fear will
encourage people to fall for the
McDonald’s syndrome: ‘lf you love
your children you will send them to a
private school’.”
Under the guidelines, Common-
wealth spending on recurrent grants for
government schools will rise by about
50 percent over the next eight years un-
til it reaches 8 percent of a community
standard of resources spent on each
child. This is set at $2195 for primary
and $3240 for secondary students but
will be indexed to the inflation rate.
All non-government schools will be
put into 12 categories, with student
grants tied to the community standard
and indexed for inflation. No school
will receive less money than it got this
year. Based on last year’s enrolments,
spending on private schools will rise
from $6OO million to $703 million over
the next eight years but the figures will
change as enrolments increase.
Legislation will be brought down this
parliamentary session to guarantee the
schools program for the next
four years a considerable
win for Ryan in cabinet over
opposition from the Depart-
ments of Treasury, Finance
and Prime Minister and Cabi-
net.
Treasury, in particular,
objects to the notion of for-
ward commitments, arguing
that it locks a government into
the budget process. As a re-
flection of her victory over the
bureaucracy, Ryan said
lightheartedly: “John Stone
resigned as Secretary of the
Treasury because I got foward
commitments in the budget.”
Even so, the decision
underlines the intensely pol-
itical, pragmatic nature of the
cabinet decision. If the com-
mitment had been given for
only one year as Treasury
and Finance wanted the un-
certainty over future funding
would have been maintained
in the private sector and the
state aid debate would have
continued over the election. □
New guidelines
will end the
funding game
By ROBBIE LLOYD
WHEN THE purring and applause
from supporters of the private school
system settle down, in the background
will be heard the determined chatter of
the Hawke Government’s accounting
machine.
The state aid victory for private
schools, when Senator Susan Ryan an-
nounced last week that there would be
no freeze or cut in any private school’s
funding, came with some important
provisos.
Chief among them was the start of a
new system of holding schools account-
able for the money they earn and the
federal funds they receive on top of
those earnings.
The government has tackled the
problem of stopping getting
more than their rightful share of funds
by juggling their finances to appear
poorer than they are. Ever since the
Karmel Report established the Schools
Commission system of funding private
schools in 1974, there has been a game
to see who could outsmart their oppo-
nents in the funding stakes.
The new guidelines mean private
schools will be divided into 12 clearly
identified categories and all will be ex


pected to disclose their finan-
cial details.
While it has cost millions
to defuse the potentially dam-
aging state aid election time
bomb and alienate the ALP
left even further in the long
run the move should prove to
be more than just another
pragmatic Hawke vote protec-
tor. Four factors hold the key
to settling the issue:
1: Private schools will not
go away and any government
serious about holding office
has to dig deeper to find funds
attractive to both state school
and non-government support-
ers. Ryan has achieved the lat-
ter but she will still be subject
to criticism from public
school supporters, unhappy
with their 8 percent funding
growth by 1992 instead of
Hawke’s more generous pre-
election promises.
2: Accountability for pub-
lic funding is expected and
the community will welcome
more stringent controls on
support for private schools
just as it will delight in watch-
ing the bureaucrats squirm if Ryan is
successful in forcing state school
authorities also to show how they allo-
cate their federal grants. These will be
handed out on a per capita basis in fu-
ture rather than in bulk.
3: Dividing private schools into 12
categories will help the government to
save money by fine-tuning its agreed
payouts over the next four years.
The new system will consider a
school’s income for both recurrent and
capital funding purposes and will be
based on a community standard of
$2195 for a primary student and $3240
for a secondary student. Private schools
which earn fractions of these amounts
from their private incomes will receive
graded funds. A school earning 88 per-
cent or more of the communitystandard
will receive funding of at least 12 per-
cent of the standard figure for each pri-
mary pupil and at least 13 percent for
each high school pupil.
The top two categories in the 12 will
have their funds held at present levels
until 1992, with adjustments to match
inflation. The other 10 categories will
have their funds increased. But the new
scale means many of the schools at the
wealthier end will start slowing their
rate of funding increases, because they
will no longer appear with the majority
in the old categories 2 and 3, where
many richer schools used to obtain
more funds by appearing to be as poor
as their fellow group members.
The common method of fiddling the
books was to use private income to fund
Education Minister Ryan: the next compromise might not work
NEVILLE WALLER
capital programs (mainly buildings),
leaving the account books bare when
the schools applied for federal funds to
finance extra staff and equipment. Thus
more accommodation could be pro-
vided for increasing enrolments, which
created the need for greater payouts
from Canberra. This is the snowball sys-
tem which generated so much hatred
among public school supporters.
When these schools are re-graded
they will have their funds frozen, so in-
flation will erode them until they have
dropped to the new funding level which
matches their private income.
The government stopped short of
“You can’t help but feel sorry for
these private-school kids!”
taking up the Schools Com-
mission’s recommended pub-
lic register of income and ex-
penditure from public and
private sources. But it has fol-
lowed the spirit of the Com-
mission’s Funding Policies re-
port, released last April, rec-
ommending that schools
should notify the government
of these figures as well as staff-
ing levels, enrolments, ad-
mission and exclusion poli-
cies and fee levels. By moni-
toring these factors closely,
the government will have
plenty of ammunition if the
private school lobby tries to
complain about increased
public school funding.
4: The crunch will come
with the details of the govern-
ment’s plans regarding estab-
lishment of new private
schools. With a predicted ex-
pansion of nearly 20 percent
in private schools by 1988,
there is an obvious threat to
numbers and therefore
funding levels in public
schools.
By requiring new schools
to give two years’ notice of intention
to open, as well as proving they are
meeting a definite need in developing
areas and not entering an area al-
ready catered for, the government has
slowed the development of a potential
problem.
As things stand, Bob Hawke and
Ryan will be feeling as comfortable as
the non-government school supporters.
But they must have in the back of their
minds the knowledge that they couldn’t
hope to pull off another compromise
without inciting a riot.
Government schools will receive
only $37 million in extra funds by 1986
and next year they will get a total of
$335.6 million, compared with $610.8
million for the non-government sector.
Those sums don’t sit well with the Aus-
tralian Teachers’ Federation and the
Australian Council for State School Or-
ganisations.
As far as the private school lobby is
concerned, its blustering since March
1983 has worked. Statements last week
by Margaret Slattery, national secretary
of the non-government school Austra-
lian Parents Council, sounded glowing
about the goodwill of the Hawke Gov-
ernment.
Father John Williams, chairman of
the National Catholic Education Com-
mission, was equally charmed.
But when the Schools Commission
does its new sums and Treasurer Paul
Keating tightens the purse-strings, there
will be some schools feeling more pinch
than pampering. □

TRADE UNIONS
Bitter election
struggle looms for
AMFSU leadership
Laurie Carmichael: shift of position may leave a vacuum
By DEBORAH HOPE
BALLOTS for three key positions in
Australia’s largest union, the
Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and
Shipwrights Union, open on Tuesday
with a backdrop of bitter court battles
and allegations of National Civic Coun-
cil backing for the challenging Reform
Group.
The election is lining up to be one of
the toughest facing the union in recent
years. At stake are the position of na-
tional secretary, held by ALP
leftwinger Jack Kidd, and two of five
national organiser jobs.
The importance of the election can
only be gauged beside the likely with-
drawal of Laurie Carmichael from a
leadership position in the union to its
national research office next year and
the possibility of a similar move by
Victorian secretary John Halfpenny,
also in 1985. Control of these positions
in the union by the right-wing Reform
Group, together with those being con-
tested this month, would have major
ramifications for the union movement
including for its accord with the Hawke
government.
Leading the reform ticket and chal-
lenger to Kidd is Rod Kelly, a political
maverick from Victoria who has de-
voted the past five years to toppling the
union’s left-wing leadership. His suc-
cess has been limited. Of some 100
elected AMFSU officers around Austra-
lia, the Reform Group can claim only
two national organiser Charlie Bali
and Tasmanian secretary Geoff Adams.
Out of a national membership of
around 160,000, Kelly claims a Reform
Group membership of 2000 in the
union’s rank and file.
This is not Kelly’s first challenge to
Kidd he lost the same contest four
years ago. He lost again the next year
when he challenged Halfpenny and in
1982 to Dick Scott in the ballot for
national president. It is the audacity of
these challenges (Kelly’s only industrial
experience is as a shop steward) and Re-
form’s court actions over alleged
AMFSU improprieties, rather than its
Rod Kelly: a political maverick challenges again
real impact on the union’s left-wing cre-
dentials, that have brought it to promi-
nence.
According to Kidd, Reform Group
court actions have so far cost the union
more than $lOO,OOO in costs and dis-
rupted the work of a number of
AMFSU officials. He is still waiting for
the results of an AMFSU appeal to a
full bench of the Federal Court over a
court ruling prohibiting publication of
any material supporting left-wing in-
cumbents in the union journal, The
Metal Worker. The action was initiated
by a member of the Reform Group,
Michael Jess, and the ruling so incensed
the ACTU that it intervened in the ap-
peal in support of the union leadership.
The union is also waiting for the out-
come of court action taken by Bob
Adamson who was defeated by Charlie
Bali in February this year after a fierce
anti-communist campaign by the Re-
form Group.
Industrial observers predict a close
result in the contest for the job of na-
tional secretary and Kidd regards the
challenge as a serious one. He believes,
however, that his long experience in the
union will carry him through.
The incumbents fear that the heavy
job losses in the metal industry over the
past few years and the failure of the in-
dustry to pick up with the general econ-
omic recovery could result in a backlash
against the incumbents. It is also clear
that the Reform Group is planning a
tough campaign continuing the dual
themes of union accountability and left-
wing control. This is despite the
AMFSU’s close ties with the
Labor Government, its key
role in the stability of the
ALP’s prices and incomes ac-
cord with the union move-
ment and that Kidd is a Labor
Party member rather than a
communist: “At the ALP
national conference last
month Kidd voted against
every motion put forward by
the Prime Minister,” Kelly
said last week.
“Leopards never change
their spots. I believe Laurie
Carmichael was just as re-
sponsible as John Kerr for the
downfall of the Whitlam gov-
ernment.”
Kelly began his political
life as a leftwinger, applying
unsuccessfully to join the
Communist Party in 1976 and
then moving in and out of the
ALP. He is now associated
with the Labor unity faction
in the Victorian branch and a
member of its industrial pol-
icy committee.

ruption of the AMFSU and

the union’s own belief of NCC involve-
ment in the campaign have resulted in a
rare intervention in the election by the
ACTU which has strongly condemned
the outside interference it believes has
occurred. The union estimates that the
Reform Group has spent an estimated
$500,000 on its campaign in recent years
and believes a substantial part of this
comes from NCC sources.
Kelly denies NCC involvement, say-
ing money is raised through a fortnight-
ly stipend of members of the Reform

seeking outside assistance through a
group called Friends of the Metal

WINE
Sweet, white
and bubbly
the top sellers
By DAVID FARMER
SWEET, white and preferably with
bubbles: the ingredients of a successful
brand on the Australian wine market.
The nation’s best-selling table wines are
dominated by sparkling whites. The
Bulletin's survey to find the 25 wines
that Australians drink most has un-
covered but one red. And there’s not a
chardonnay in sight.
Out in front as the biggest
seller is Summer Wine which
in 1983 brought its maker,
Kaiser Stuhl, sales of 430,000
nine-litre cases. This might
not be a product about which
wine writers rave but it meets
with public approval. The
brand did not even exist six
years ago. Its climb to the top
is surely one of the great mar-
keting success stories.
Summer Wine is both
sweet and sparkling, as are six
other wines on the Top 25 list.
There are five champagne
brands as well and most of
their sales come from sweeter
varieties. Of the 11 still whites
on the list, only Houghton’s
white burgundy has any pre-
tensions to dryness; the others
that are not straight-out
moselle styles all have more
than a trace of residual sugar.
In equal 12th place as the soli-
tary red is another brand with
a relatively short history
Orlando’s Jacob’s Creek claret. Making
up the numbers with the seven spark-
lings, five champagnes, 11 whites and
one red is Kaiser Stuhl Gold Medal
rose.
Between them, these account for
some 3,915,000 cases more than 40
percent of Australian table wine sales
last year. Their production and distribu-
tion are handled by only 13 of the hun-
dreds of companies and individuals in
the business.
The Penfolds-Kaiser Stuhl group on
its own has five of the best sellers. Along
with Summer Wine, Penfolds has
Minchinbury champagne at number
seven, Black Forest moselle at 16, Gold
Medal rose at 20 and Kaiser Stuhl
champagne at 21.
The other giants of the industry are
also well represented. Lindemans may
have seen its Ben Ean moselle displaced
as number one two years ago but it still
has three of the 25 in its stable. So does
Orlando. McWilliams, Seppelts and
Hardy’s have two each.
The position of McWilliams would
look much better if bottled fortified
wines were included. It is not doing
badly in the table wine market with
215,000 cases of Sparkling Bodega and
75,000 cases of Mt Pleasant riesling but
the Riverina-based firm really domi-
nates the fortifieds. McWilliams cream
sherry bottles in 1983 totalled some
160,000 dozen. The company’s Royal
Reserve port was in second place with
sales of 125,000 dozen and Royal Re-
serve sweet sherry (80,000 cases) was the
fourth-biggest-selling fortified wine in
bottle. In third place, splitting the two
Royal Reserves, came Penfold’s Club
port with 95,000 cases.

The wine Industry does not Itself produce official figures for sales of Individual
brands of wines. David Farmer has been preparing his figures for three years
drawing on Information supplied by companies themselves, liquor warehouse
withdrawal figures and market survey data of A.C. Nellsen
In such powerful company, Griffith-
based Miranda Wines deserves a special
mention. This family business has, in
Golden Gate spumante, Australia’s
lOth-biggest seller with 145,000 cases in
1983. That exalted position is reassuring
proof that, while it might help to be big
in the wine industry, scope remains for
the resourceful entrepreneur. Golden
Gate has never to my knowledge been
accorded a review by a wine writer but
it’s what they drink in Sydney’s western
suburbs and in Queensland.
The dominance of the biggest sellers
varies considerably between segments
of the table wine market.
Jacob’s Creek claret, at
120,000 cases, accounted for
about 7.7 percent of estimated
bottled red wine sales in 1983.
(Exact total sales are difficult
to arrive at because the Aus-
tralian Bureau of Statistics
surveys only those wineries
producing 250,000 litres or
more and they probably ac-
count for 97 percent of pro-
duction. The extra 3 percent
probably is close to a million
cases.)
With white wines, the 10
local products on the list
totalled 1,380,000 dozen. This
compares with an estimated
total production of some
4,340,000 dozen, giving the 10
a share of 31.84 percent. The
single ros.e, at 80,000 cases,
was more than half of the rose
category’s total.
The seven sparkling wines
listed had sales for the year of
1,235,000 dozen some 59

percent of the total. With the cham-
pagne category, the five biggest sellers
at 990,000 cases for the year repre-
sented 90.3 percent of total champagne
sales.
Between them, the Top 25 had sales
for the year of 3,915,000 cases. Subtract
the 110,000 cases of Black Tower
Liebfraumilch imported from Germany
by Seppelts and the 24 Australian-made
wines represented 42.4 percent of the
total sales of local red, white, rose,
champagne and sparkling wines in
1983. □

THE MINIMUM weekly cost of keep-
ing a family of four in Australia has
risen by only $3 to $3Ol in the past
six months, compared with an $lB in-
crease in the previous six months, ac-
cording to the Morgan Gallup Poll.
The $2l rise since last mid-year rep-
resents a 7 percent increase in the cost

PUBLIC OPINION
One in two
believe Aborigines
get a fair go
THE VAST majority of Australians say
Aborigines should be treated the same
as other Australians, and should have
the same land rights.
However, opinion is divided as to
whether Aborigines get a fair go, but the
majority agreed with Aboriginal owner-
ship of minerals found on Aboriginal
reserves.
These results come from the Austra-
lian Values Study. In total an Australia-
wide cross-section of more than 1200
people, aged 14 and over, were asked
about their values, attitudes and beliefs
regarding many aspects of their home,
family and working life.
Interviewing for the study was con-
ducted by the Roy Morgan Research
Centre.
The study was made shortly before
the land rights issue flared with renewed
passion.
The attitudes expressed in the survey
are consistent with Australian Value
Studies made on the issue over several
years.
People surveyed were asked: “Think-
ing about the statement ‘Aborigines get
a fair go in this country.’ Do you agree
or disagree with that? If you agree or
disagree: ‘Do you (agree) (disagree)
strongly or only slightly?’ ”
More than one in two Australians
agreed that Aborigines “get a fair go in
this country.” Men (57 percent) were
more likely than women (49 percent) to
hold this view.

People were then told, “At present,

for Aboriginal reserves, the Aborigines
should own minerals found on their re-
serves.” People surveyed were then
asked, “Do you agree or disagree with

with the suggestion that Aborigines
should own the minerals found on Ab-
original reserves. Thirty-eight percent of
people agreed that Aborigines should
own these minerals and 7 percent were
undecided.

COVER STORY
How Keating and his backroom
boys framed the budget
The federal budget was very much the work of Treasurer Paul Keating.
RICHARD FARMER tells how Keating exploited the intellectual resources
of the Treasury backroom boys in framing it.
PREPARING THIS year’s budget,
Treasurer Paul Keating had one rather
tense moment with Treasury officials. A
decision Keating made did not meet
with approval from the departmental
advisers; they told him he should
change his mind. Keating responded
firmly with the advice that he was the
Treasurer and they were the Treasury.
They would do as he said and that was
that. And do it they did.
It was a clear sign that this week’s
budget was Keating’s budget. The
Treasurer, who was really nothing more
than an economics student this time last
year, feels in control of his portfolio.
Not even the budget eve resignation of
his departmental Secretary, John Stone,
dented the Keating confidence.
The Treasurer had not expected his
senior public servant to go. Keating was
loyally and quite properly defending
Stone the day before the resignation. If
Stone was a bete noire to some members
of the cabinet, he certainly wasn’t to
Keating. Keating admired the forthright
Stone style which often resulted in ad-
vice that ministers did not want to hear.
To get rid of Stone, to sack him or force
a resignation, would have been seen by
Keating as an admission of failure.
Keating has a very orthodox view of
the public service and its role in govern-
ment. He alone among cabinet ministers
expressed doubts about the need for the
reforms of the Public Service Act which
have resulted in heads of departments
losing their permanency. He was initial-
ly sympathetic to the opposition voiced
by Stone to the new methods of filling
senior jobs, which weaken the influence
of departmental secretaries. Keating
could even understand the frustration
Stone felt about administrative incon-
venience created by an expanded Free-
dom of Information Act and the review
of personnel decisions by administra-
tive tribunals. These days, the head of a
department of state spends a goodly
measure of time on essentially unpro-
ductive paperwork.
What Keating found harder to un-
derstand about Stone was why he con-
Treasury Secretary John Stone: announced his resignation

tinued to fight so vehemently after the
changes became law. The Treasurer had
as his goal the running of the economy;
at times, he thought, his Secretary de-
voted too much of his undoubted en-
ergy and ability to what Keating con-
sidered to be a secondary matter.
Stone was privately very critical of
the chairman of the Public Service
Board, Dr Peter Wilenski. Communica-
tion between the two senior public ser-
vants was by way of letter and Stone’s
side of that correspondence was at best
cold and meticulously formal. It has
been a long time since a Treasury secre-
tary and a Board chairman have been
on “Dear Sir” terms.
In keeping with a belief that he
should be able to work with the people
the system gave him, Keating did not
press his Secretary to discontinue his
campaigns. But one result was that the
Treasurer, with Stone’s approval,
delved much more deeply into his de-
partment for advice than many of his
predecessors had done.
This year’s budget was the product,
for example, of the first assistant secre-
tary of the general financial and econ-
omic policy division, Ted Evans, and
assistant secretary of fiscal and monet-
ary policy John Fraser.
The basic strategy these two men
fleshed out was very much Keating’s.
Together with Prime Minister
Bob Hawke, Keating decided
months ago that Labor’s econ-
omic policy should be more of
the same. His thesis is that
budget night should not have
any major surprises; the de-
cisions announced on the
third Tuesday in August
should have an inevitability
about them. The aim was to
create in the months before-
hand a climate to give the
actual announcements an
aura of being the only pos-
sible ones hence the suc-
cession of speeches by
Keating and Hawke this year
about the thrust of their econ-
omic policies.
The deficit needs to be con-
tained to enable interest rates
to keep falling. Tax cuts must
compensate workers for the
freeze in award wages caused
by the Medicare effect on in-
dexation. Pensioners and the
unemployed needed some in-
crease in payments for the
same reason and because of
Labor’s commitment to social
justice.
Hawke and Keating took
these basic principles to a
large number of forums to try
to lock in support for their
budget before it was de-
livered. The form of the tax
cuts was deemed a proper
subject for discussion with the
Australian Council of Trade
Unions. The unions, after all,
would decide whether the
prices and incomes accord
hung together in the face of
no indexed wage increases
until next April. The deficit
parameters were explained to
the Economic Planning Ad-
visory Council and the Ad-
visory Committee on Prices
and Incomes. The Business
Council, the Confederation of
Australian Industry and the
National Farmers Federation were
briefed on the strategy months ago. The
hope was that these industry bodies,
even if they did not approve of every-
thing the government did, would at least
find themselves bored by the final ver-
sion.
The Keating style is to downplay
budget night. He realises that good
economic policy is no once-a-year occa-
sion. He wants budgets to be book-
keeping exercises with the discipline
they impose on a government directed
at telling his ministerial colleagues that
the country cannot afford all their pet
projects.
Keating likes to think that he, not his


Prime Minister Bob Hawke: helped seek support from industry bodies
department, originates the basic econ-
omic strategy. But, unlike the latest Lib-
eral treasurer John Howard
Keating still sees a major role for his
department. Whereas Howard recruited
his personal advisers from outside,
Keating got his most important staff
members from within. Tony Cole is a
Treasury man of 15 years’ standing and
went to the Treasurer’s office after a
spell at the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. As principal
private secretary, he is Keating’s chief
sounding-board.
Taxation policy ideas come to
Keating from Greg Smith, another
Treasury official albeit one who
worked in opposition with present
Housing minister and minister assisting
the Treasurer Chris Hurford. Smith’s in-
put for this year’s budget was not great
because of the absence of major tax-
ation proposals. His influence will in-
crease in the months after the election
when taxation receives greater promi-
nence.
The chief advisers without a
Treasury background are Dr Barry
Hughes who commutes between Can-
berra and Flinders University, in Adel-
aide, and Barbara Ward who worked
with Keating in opposition and who is
his acute political antenna within the
parliamentary party. Hughes sits in for
his boss on the forecasting group which
provides the essential base material for
any budget. The group has representa-
tives from the Treasury, Reserve Bank,
the Commonwealth Statistician, the De-
partment of Finance and Prime Minis-
ter’s and Cabinet. Its task is to provide a
best guess of where the economy is
headed what growth is likely to be,
inflation and unemployment.
Such forecasts are by their very na-

ture unreliable but nonetheless essen-
tial. Quite early in the preparation of
this year’s budget, there was apparently
some disagreement on the committee as
to what figures to use for the estimates.
The growth figure finally used in budget
calculations was higher than that orig-
inally recommended by Treasury.
If Keating likes to be in charge of the
direction of economic policy himself, he
is sensible enough to know that he has
to have the Treasury working with him.
And, from all reports, the relations be-
tween him and his department remain
good. The harsh words which might on
occasion be uttered are quickly forgot-
ten and there is no better symbol of that
than the bottle of Champagne that
Keating and Stone shared after Stone
announced his resignation.
The Treasury, as an institution, in-
variably fights hard for what it believes
to be the correct course. But those at
Treasury are proper people and insub-
ordination is not a charge that can be
levelled at them despite the paranoia of
some politicians.
Keating obviously enjoys working
with Evans, a laconic, quietly-spoken
Queenslander who joined Treasury
after 12 years with the old Postmaster-
General’s Department. Perhaps the
Treasurer with no formal training in
economics finds it easier to have as his
current tutor a man who began working
life as a Telecom technician than some
more orthodox first-class honors gradu-
ate.
If that is so, he still speaks highly of
John Fraser who worked under Evans
on the budget. Fraser, who got a taste of
the political judgments involved in
economic policy-making
while working briefly in How-
ard’s office before the change
of government, is a highly
skilled economist from the
bright-young-man mould.
Keating will have a similar
choice between the solid, reli-
able public servant and the
more brilliant young man
when he focuses on choosing
a successor for Stone. The
favorites for the post are both
deputy secretaries. Bernie
Fraser returned to the
Treasury last year after a spell
as the number two man at Re-
sources and Energy. Mild-
mannered but tough, as
should be expected of a for-
mer rugby league front-row
forward, he has impressed
Keating as a solid all-rounder.
He was of great assistance to
Keating in the decision to
float the dollar and in sorting
out the difficulties involved in
de-regulation of financial in-
stitutions. His style fits well
with that of Keating and the experience
gained in a department outside
Treasury’s cloisters would make him
very acceptable to other departmental
heads.
The second serious candidate, Chris
Higgins, would certainly meet with
greater approval than would Bernie
Fraser within the Labor Party. Higgins
is thought to be more sympathetic to the
party and to represent a greater change
in style from Stone than would Fraser.
Higgins has recently returned from a
spell on the staff of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment in Paris. His original departure to
that body coincided with Stone’s origin

al appointment as Secretary of the
Treasury.
The timing of Stone’s resignation has
worked against Higgins’ chances. Ap-
pointed as a deputy secretary this
month, he has not yet actually taken up
the position. Thus, Keating has not
worked with him for long.
The rather conservative Keating
style suggests that he will choose as his
senior adviser a man Keating knows he
can work with rather than one whom
other people tell him he will be able to
work with. □
TRAVEL
Africa in the
wild and in
luxury
By DAVID McNICOLL
THE GIRAFFE had been killed about a
kilometre from our camp. Two lions
had brought it down; one up on the
neck, another attacking the legs. It had
been dead for four days and the five
lions gorging on the meat hardly looked
up at us as our open truck edged to
within 20m. Behind us, moving, watch-
ing and obviously ravenously hungry
were the hyenas, four of them,
waiting for the lions to hand over the
remnants of the giraffe. And high in the
trees were the vultures, their eyes fixed
on the kill, waiting, like the hyenas, for
the lions to quit the remains.
This was the McFarlane Safari
Camp, in the Sabie Sand section of the
Eastern Transvaal, in the string of pri-
vate game reserves which border the
Kruger camp, offering one of the
greatest adventure holidays in the
world. None of that strictly controlled
game viewing from buses running along
sealed roads. These reserves offer dirt
tracks, vehicles with only a few guests,
skilled rangers and the biggest plus
viewing by night as well as by day.
Nelspruit, the start of the trip, is less
than an hour from Johannesburg. Not
the greatest airstrip in the world and the
Metroliner shuddered as the props were
reversed and the engines roared to pull
the plane up. Waiting in the little ter-
minal building were Dave Rattray, of
McFarlane Safaris, and my “minder”
for the trip, Marlene Frylinck, of the
South African Tourist Commission.
We lunched in a typical little out-
back South African town Graskop. A
pub, a community centre, two mini
supermarkets, a saddlery, butchery,
bakery, a garage, and mirabile dictu, a
steak house (the best steak I had in
South Africa which, oddly enough, does
not seem to produce prime steaks).
We stayed that night at the famed
Mount Sheba Hotel, high in the misty
mountains, with views stretching far
across the Drakenbergs. What a hotel!
Thatched rondavel roofs but, if you
thought that meant rugged accommoda-
tion inside, you were in for a shock. In
each suite a roaring log fire; comfort-
able bars; and in the dining room a
menu which would hold its own with
most of the hotels of Europe.
Next day, down to the game parks.
First stop, McFarlane’s where Garth
McFarlane was waiting for us. He’d just
seen off a small party of ecstatic Texans
who in the previous 48 hours had seen
and identified 32 different mammals.
In the late afternoon we went out to
the giraffe kill and watched the lions for
an hour. That night, we went out again
by spotlight. This is real high adventure
in a game park. The night is full of
strange sounds baboons chattering
and yelling, hyenas howling, owls flap-
ping with a swish of wings, warthogs
scuttering into the bush.
Dinner in the bamboo-enclosed
boma. A circular reed room, the huge
fire in the centre driving out the winter
chill. Silent black waiters moving round
with the wines. The line-up for the de-
licious food impala, springbok, fish,
curry, delicious vegetables.
In the morning, another look at the
kill. Only one lion on sentry duty, flick-
ing his tail menacingly at the hyenas,
now moving in closer. Because we
didn’t know where the other four lions
were and because the hyenas were try-
ing to use our truck as cover, we judged
it wise to pull further back. You don’t
take chances, even with gorged lions,
and a Mannlicher rifle was at the ready.
Next day, on to Kirkman’s Camp.
Kirkman’s, named after a game park
pioneer, is next to the fabled Mala Mala
and both are owned by Mike Rattray
who has built the two resorts into the
leaders in the world. Mala Mala holds
about 50 people and is the sought-after
refuge of the rich, the famous and those
seeking privacy and relaxation among
the animals. Kirkman’s holds only 20
and is magnificent.
Our ranger at Kirkman’s was Tony.
He had a genius for finding animals.
Not the prolific impala, nor the ba-
boons, but the rarer animals the mon-
goose skittering across the path as the
black “spotter” at the rear of the vehicle
swings it round; the dangerous buffalo;
and, on the last night, the incredible
good fortune of seeing a superb leopard
cross our path within 10m.
Kruger is a wonderful park and the
variety of animals in its vast area is re-
markable (it is as big as Wales). But the
private parks next-door to Kruger de-
liver a magic element to game watching
by virtue of the skills of the rangers and
the advantage of the night spotting.
Back to the airport at Skukuza. Fare-
wells to rangers and black “spotters”
and aboard the Fokker Friendship. Two
hours later, into the Sandton Sun Hotel
in Johannesburg, back to humans who
don’t seem nearly as interesting as the
animals in the wild. □

THE ARTS
Shirley Hazzard: chance
and the transit of pleasure
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
SHIRLEY HAZZARD, one
of the most distinguished of
contemporary writers of fic-
tion in English, has come
back to Australia to record the
Boyer lectures for the Austra-
lian Broadcasting Corpora-
tion. She lived in Sydney until
she was 15 and then moved
around the world until she
settled in New York with her
husband, the biographer and
French scholar Francis
Steegmuller. They spend half
the year there and half in Italy
which is the scene of several
of her books. She won the
United States National Book
Critics Circle award in 1980
for her most recent novel,
Transit of Venus.
THAT FAMOUS old sexist
remark of Buffon’s, Le style
est Vhomme meme (the style is
the man), has instantly and re-
spectfully to be modified for
Shirley Hazzard. She is a
woman whose personal style
elegant, perceptive, witty
is indistinguishable from that
of her books. She lives by such
personal identification and re-
sponsibility. Talking to her or
reading her books, one is im-
mediately conscious that
one’s actions and, indeed,
those of a nation must be
accounted for.
As several of her beloved poets have
said: one is the sum of all that one has
been and, if one’s behaviour is constant-
ly trivial or inane, it will take its toll.
This obviously is one thing that
worries her about Bob Hawke’s Austra-
lia. Amid all the virtures of consensus
and the possibilities of regained pros-
perity, more signs are needed from The
Leader of solidarity with the arts.
In an interview specially given The
Bulletin, Hazzard was lyrical about the
Sydney winter light. “It occurred to me
that it moved me so much because I
haven’t been here for over 30 years in
this month of August. I discovered
something, which is that light has prop-
Shirley Hazzard: 'I discovered
... that light has properties of
memory like the scents of flowers ’
KEVIN BROWN
erties of memory like the scents of
flowers. I find myself walking along and
looking at Sydney and having memories
pour over me. The whole content of
one’s youth and one’s experience that’s
lingering somewhere in one’s mind is
brought to attention by this quality of
light.”
She has flown back into her past, for
the subject of her Boyer Lectures is to
do with growing up in Australia in the
1930 s and 40s. For a woman of such
intellectual distinction and verbal deft-
ness, she is remarkably vulnerable to
poetic concepts that go straight to the
emotions.
She stayed awake throughout the
flight from Los Angeles to Tahiti watch-
ing “this night sky which was,
from horizon to horizon, a
great field of stars.”
Hazzard does not lose this
capacity for awe when survey-
ing humanity and its achieve-
ments but her shrewd gaze
misses nothing of human
frailty and pretensions. She
was able to observe them,
small and large, in the years
during which she worked for
the United Nations the bit-
ter subject of her book Defeat
Of An Ideal. She sees women
as more truly international
than men and still finds in
many Australian women
those qualities of being open
and receptive that she saw in
Grace and Caro, the young
Australian heroines of Transit
of Venus.
“I don’t want to get sim-
plistic about it there are div-
isions one gets in every
country that women in gen-
eral are more receptive, more
indulgent of the world, have
the sense of common human-
ity, but it is still very pro-
nounced here. It’s like two
nations at times. I don’t say
this just to criticise all the
menfolk but, in those ways,
women are more part of the
planet than their country.”
Hazzard comes back again
and again to “common humanity” ...
“Many people have yet to realise that
we’re all in this together; it all adds up
to something more than the current rash
of nationalism and tribalism.”
It worries her that, in Australia,
“with this enormous change that has
happened which you can hardly take in
if you have been away as much as I
have, there is a tendency to talk about
Australia and then about the world. The
word ‘world’ comes up as if it were
somewhere else ‘We’re going to show
the world’, as if it were some other
planet from Australia.
“Underconfidence is still here, this
shaping up to an imaginary enemy.
There is a very considerable amount of


goodwill towards Australia around the
world. I think people are far more inter-
ested in Australia and that Australia
itself has become more interesting.
What would be the point of ‘Advance
Australia’ if it hadn’t advanced!”
The Australia in which she grew up
had a deep, puritanical, official distrust
of pleasure very much in an Anglo/
American/Australian tradition. (Cen-
sorship, 6 o’clock closing, few restaur-
ants, no Sunday entertainment.) She
finds that Australian attitudes to
pleasure have changed enormously.
“In principle, pleasure is a good
thing but there is an element of pleasure
which is a bit ominous; it’s as if the end
of the world were coming and one must
indulge one’s appetites to the full. That’s
not what I call pleasure; that’s more
connected to ‘having a good time’, in a
way that implies self-forgetfulness. True
pleasure what I think of as true
pleasure is shared pleasure with the
earth and other people. The point is not
just to forget your self but to come to
your senses. Pleasure is not merely iner-
tia or the discarding of responsibility.”
She talks of the ease with which Syd-
ney people can reach the bush or the sea
and of the kind climate, things that are
true of all Australian cities. “There is a
lovely life here in Sydney: one must live
in a city with a long dark winter and a
stony aspect and very little contact with
nature to know what that means.”
Any reader of Hazzard’s short stories
and novels will know how important the
element of chance is in them. She says:
“Everything that I can think of readily
that has happened to me has happened
from chance. And those
are mostly the good things.
I don’t mean that I haven’t
done things which invited
it but there have also been
events entirely accidental.
Shakespeare said ‘Oppor-
tunity, thy guilt is great.’
Also, of course, if opportu-
nity hadn’t been placed in
one’s path, one wouldn’t
have made the same mis-
takes.
“Chance and coinci-
dence are slightly different
things, I think. There is so
much coincidence in life
one wouldn’t dare put in a
novel ... Things coming
round, extraordinary con-
nections I do believe in
the grinding of the mills of
the gods; I couldn’t disbe-
lieve in it unpredictable.
Even when I’ve been on
the receiving end and
haven’t liked it, I’ve had to
admire the way things fit
together. I regard it with
awe, the way things con-
nect. Every mean and
thoughtless thing one does
against one’s own nature
somehow all adds up.
Nemesis is ultimately one’s
own personality. Yeats
said (a day could scarcely
pass without his recalling
shameful acts of his life)
‘My conscience or my van-
ity appalled ... things said
or done.’ ”
Hazzard’s mind is rich
with poetry. She said some
years ago: “The reading of
poetry has been the single
most important literary ‘in-
fluence’ for me, the longest
important influence of any
kind on my thought and
life.” She has not changed
her opinion: “It has
created everything for me.
Too complicated to ex-
press in a short space.
“For instance, one of
the complaints made
against the Australia of my
childhood in the 1930 s and
1940 s was that people were
looking outside Australia for their cul-
ture. However, an imaginative child will
sometimes live in books and it is true
that the best books came from other
places; it wasn’t just cultural snobbery.
It wasn’t a case of ‘looking elsewhere.’
One was really looking into one’s own
heart.
“Auden said in that beautiful poem
about Yeats that poetry altered nothing,
that all the savagery of the world would
‘Pleasure is a
good thing but
there is an
element of
pleasure which
is .. ominous’
be the same if no poet had
ever written. But I know
from my own small experi-
ence that it can change life
radically. Poetry gave me
companionship, it opened
my mind and my heart
as far as they could be
opened. It also changed
the facts of my life.
“When I was living in
New Zealand in 1949-50, I
read poems of Leopardi in
translation by John Heath-
Stubbs and I wanted to
learn the originals: they
were so beautiful.
“I began to read Italian,
12,000 miles away without
expectation of going to
Italy. Later, it was because
I had studied Italian I was
sent there by the United
Nations and everything
changed. It’s not true that
poetry doesn’t change
things; it does change
one’s own nature. You
can’t prove such things;
thank God you can’t prove
'The redeeming
themes in all
civilisation . ..
have come from
a spiritualising
of experience ’
them. Truth is too great to
be ‘proved.’ ”
She is not afraid of
using that unfashionable
word “beauty.” She re-
gards it as “a redemption”
and the fear of it comes
from “terror of appearing
banal, the curse of current
intellectual attitudes. One
has to be free, one has to
look at a much wider spec-
trum. Cleanth Brooks said,
‘The history of Europe
might be the same without
art and thought but would
it be worth reading?’
“It comes in with the in-
dustrial revolution, this
concept of things being at-
testable, of material evi-
dence. I think it’s Montale
who said we’re now in a
state where intellectuals
with exceptions, of course
will accept any element
of reality as something
they must stand in awe at,
no matter how terrible,
rather than believe in the
transcendent power of spiritual quality.
It’s a fear of not being up to date, of not
being current. You have to consider the
redeeming themes in all civilisation,
which have come from a spiritualising
of experience.
“In the past, time allowed a possibil-
ity of spiritualising even the terrible ex-
periences; the past became legendary;
men might in some ways embody heroes
who weren’t entirely brutal, who came
to assume an elevated, idealistic el-
ement. Now there is no time for our ex-
perience to be spiritualised.”
On the other hand, as against that
burning up of time, the mad rush that
characterises so much of modern life
Hazzard sees that the possibility still
exists in Australia to take time to enjoy
our incredible natural advantages. It
was not always so. “People have time to
enjoy Australia. Australians are con-
scious of how much beauty and
pleasure there is in Australia, partly be-
cause they have time to look at it and to
travel in it with advantages. In my
childhood during the Depression
people had no time or money to go, for
example, to the centre of Australia.
And, if they did, there were no facilities
for anything other than a very hard
time.”
That the ABC has given Hazzard
time to talk about the Australia of her
youth is a good thing. She says that she
has never worked harder than on these
four lectures. They are obviously going
to make us think, not only about the
Australia of 40 years ago but of what are
“the redeeming themes” in Australian
civilisation today. □


MUSIC
Graeme Bell
and all
that jazz
International acclaim: Graeme Bell at the Breda Jazz Hall of Fame in the Netherlands, along with Fats, the Duke and the Count
By CLEMENT SEMMLER
FIFTY YEARS ago three Melbourne
teenagers and former Scotch College
schoolboys teamed up as a musical
group to play their first engagement, at
the Deepdene Scout Hall. They were
destined to figure among the foremost
names in Australian jazz Graeme
Bell, his brother Roger and Ade Mons-
bourgh.
They called themselves Gay’s Swing
Gang. Gay was their leader. It was
Graeme’s nickname (easier to say than
Gray, as a diminutive of Graeme).
Looking back, Graeme remarks ironi-
cally that the word has been stolen;
people are taken aback when old
friends still use the nickname, yet “it
was a good word when it meant jolly.”
Graeme Bell nowadays, as appropri-
ately as anyone, could be called the
father of Australian jazz; he is certainly
its most travelled player. His music is as
familiar to fans in Europe as it is in
Australia and South-East Asia - the re-
sult of a dozen or so overseas tours.
In the early 50s his band spent nearly
two years in Europe and, in West Ger-
many, accompanied American blues
singer Big Bill Broonzy on a concert
tour. And as recently as 1980 Bell led
the former members of the famous
Dutch Swing College Band (as Graeme
Bell and his Dutch Friends) at a jazz
festival at Breda, in the Netherlands.
The stint was so successful that, with the
backing of the Foreign Affairs Depart-
ment, he took his own band to the festi-
val in 1981 and 1983 to equal acclaim
and a place in Breda’s Jazz Hall of
Fame, along with greats such as Duke
Ellington and Count Basie.
Bell remains the same good-natured,
unhurried and highly cultivated man he
has always been. Yet at the piano he
becomes the perfect showman, com-
bining a virtuosity in traditional jazz,
ragtime or stride piano with a perfect
understanding of the capabilities of
whatever group of musicians he may be
leading. Whether at the Brisbane City
Hall or jazz joints such as the Rocks
Push or the Hilton Marble Bar in Syd-
ney or the Dallas Brooks Hall in his
hometown, Bell’s name is a guaranteed
audience-winner.
There was show business in his fam-
ily. His mother, as Elva Rogers, a well-
known contralto of her day, toured with
Melba in Australia and New Zealand.
His father played in musical comedy
and Gilbert and Sullivan. Bell originally
had no such ideas. After leaving Scotch
College he worked as an insurance
clerk; as a part-time student he studied
painting at the then National Art Gal-
lery of Melbourne and later under Max
Meldrum. Musically he was a dyed-in-
the-wool classicist (he had studied the
piano since his schooldays) until one
day Roger brought home some Fats
Waller recordings with solos such as
Numb Fumblin ’ and A Handful of Keys.
That did it. They pooled their
savings, including some gold sovereigns
Graeme had inherited from his Scottish
grandmother, to buy a drum kit for
Roger to the horror of their parents.
Monsbourgh, when Gay’s Swing Gang
folded, had gone off to Melbourne Uni-
versity to study metallurgy (he founded
the Rhythm Club there) and didn’t
catch up again with the Bells until some
years later.
Searching for like-minded souls they
were passing a Kew coffee-shop one
night and heard the strains of some
wonderful clarinet blues. It was Pixie
Roberts playing and he became an early
Bell stalwart. Then they picked up a
drummer, also an old Scotch collegian,
named Russ Murphy (Roger had by
now switched to trumpet) and thus
was formed, as Graeme recalls, the first
of his best bands.
As the Portsea Four they played the
fashionable beach places on the
Mornington Peninsula. In the early
1940 s jazz, like contemporary art and
avant-garde literature, was a dirty word
to the establishment. Not surprisingly
these three cultural forms banded
together; among the champions of the
Bell Band were Max Harris and John
Reed, at that time editing the controver-
sial Angry Penguins. Indeed it was this

journal that devoted a special issue to
the first Australian Jazz Convention in
1946, of which the Bell Band was the
spearhead. These conventions have be-
come one of the most notable events in
the Australian jazz calendar.
In 1947 the Bells made jazz history as
the first Australian band to tour inter-
nationally. Invited to a youth festival in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, their success
led to tours of France, the Netherlands
and England. At the Gare St Lazaire in
Paris, noting their passport descriptions
as “clerk,” “electrician,” etc and not
comprehending the status of part-time
jazzmen, customs officials suspected
them of trying to smuggle in musical in-
struments. There was only one way out.
The band gave a concert then and there
on the platform to prove its bona fides.
This made front-page news and earned
an invitation to play at the exclusive
Hot Club of France.
English jazz fans took them to their
hearts. It could be said that the Bells’
brand of traditional jazz made an Aus-
tralian impact on London’s cultural
scene before Sidney Nolan (a lifetime
friend and admirer of Graeme), Boyd,
Tucker and others became expatriates
there. They inspired British band-lead-
ers such as Humphrey Lyttleton and
Acker Bilk (who later admitted he learnt
much from Pixie Roberts’ clarinet
Trad, ragtime or stride: Bell performing at the Albury Jazz Club
style). The Bells introduced “jazz for
dancing”; they opened their own club
in the West End one night a week and
were asked by the police to extend it to
two nights because the patrons were
blocking the footpath and street traffic.
Back in Australia in 1948 their
biggest break came when they were
signed up for a concert tour with the
ABC. (If, immodestly, I claim the credit
for this, it remains one of the most satis-
factory memories of my years with the
ABC and it took the backing of the
then general manager, Charles Moses,
to break down the stuffy resistance of
the classically-oriented Concert and
Music departments.) The Bells were a
riot. In at least one capital city they
broke the attendance record set pre-
viously by the pianist Eileen Joyce. One
shattered state manager rang the Syd-
ney office with the startling news that

Jazz to dance by: Bell and friends playing on a Sydney Harbor ferry
the patrons were cheering and dancing
in the aisles an enormity without pre-
cedent in ABC concert history.
Graeme Bell and his various bands
(it’s like football, he explains players
change but the coach remains) have
never looked back since then; he has
lost count of radio and TV shows and
recordings he has made; the thousands
of concerts and club dates he has played
(at one Sydney hotel in the late 50s he
played seven performances a week for
two years).
Now writing his memoirs, he says he
is glad to have lived in an age when
people were able to play music them-
selves he fears that in the next century
people will participate less and less as
electronics take over. His jazz tastes re-
main traditional and mainstream he
dislikes so-called free-form and the
“new” jazz which, he thinks, should find
another name. He recalls with pride the
many talented Australian jazzmen who
have played with him, some of whom,
such as Bob Barnard, Paul Furniss, Ken
Herron and John Sangster, were later to
lead notable bands of their own.
The miracle is that, rising 70, Bell’s
energy and enthusiasm is undiminished.
He has no intention of, as he says, pack-
ing it in. “Later on perhaps and, if I do,
jazz will become my hobby just as art,
classical music, gardening and cricket
are now.”
So it is appropriate enough that the
jazz and entertainment world and the
media collectively will honor the 70th
birthday of Graeme Bell, MBE, early
next month. Apart from a public con-
cert organised by the Sydney Jazz Club,
the Nine Network will fly the entire
original Prague 1947 band into Sydney
for its Sunday show on September 2
its first Sydney appearance for 32 years
(“and I should think,” remarks Graeme
drily, “the last time we’ll all be
together.”) And on the next night, in the
ABC show The Don Burrows Collection,
a special documentary will retrace the
Bell story with performances, interviews
and archival material the story of a
man who, more than most, put Austra-
lian jazz on the musical map. These will
be events that none of his legion of ad-
mirers will want to miss. □

PUBLISHING
Top publishing
house gets
a new chief
By MICHELE FIELD
COLLINS, Australia’s largest publish-
ing house, has imported a new mana-
ging director and chief executive
John Clement, aged 38. He replaces
Ken Wilder who came to Australia in
1961. Wilder, retiring earlier than ex-
pected, will remain chairman of Collins
Australia for the present.
Like the Collins family itself, Clem-
ent is Scottish by birth. He moved from
a village neighborhood to a Glasgow
education and on to Oxford University
and a scholarship at Queens College.
With a good degree in French and Ger-
man literature and a short stint in the
real world selling chemicals for ICI
where, he says, he quickly learned the
drawbacks of working for a gigantic
multinational Clement wandered into
publishing by accident. He met
Christian Gallimard, son of a French
publisher, and then spent 10 years steer-
ing the house of Gallimard toward in-
ternational sales. “In a very French
kind of way,” he says, “they simply
hired a foreigner when they were look-
ing for someone to understand foreign
markets.”
Six years ago, when he began to
worry that he and his family were be-
coming too attached to a European way
of life, he returned to England and
joined Collins. Each year of those six, as
export director of some of Collins’
hardback divisions and recently as head
of the Fontana paperback imprint,
Clement visited the Sydney office. His
wife, Penny, and their three young chil-
dren have a- “readiness to travel” which
makes this overseas assignment easier:
“We certainly don’t believe that Britain
is the be-all and end-all.”
Collins’ profits last year were up 81.8
percent on those of 1982. To Clement,
Australian publishing is not a back-
water but part of the boom as a piece
of a big international publishing house
“and a big Australian publishing house,
too, if that’s possible.” He brushes aside
talk of Rupert Murdoch’s influence on
Collins and the affiliations with his
other publishing houses, Bay Books and
Angus and Robertson. Though
Murdoch may be Collins’ largest share-
holder, Clement says, “he is certainly
not seen as the guy who is running the
show.”
It will be “very tricky,” Clements ad-
mits, to show the Collins organisation in
Australia that he can give it something
no one local could provide. He is
coming on a two-year secondment.
Among publishers, Clements thinks,
being the biggest kid on the block makes
Collins Australia very vulnerable. After
all, with economies of scale enjoyed by
few Australian publishers, it should not
Collins’ new chief John Clement: he has guidelines so broad that they could fit on one sheet of paper
ROBERT DORAN
only provide the best distribution and
the best customer services but also the
best books. And the more of these that
Collins Australia can generate for the
international market, the better.
Many of their recent non-fiction
titles Bob Ellis’ book on the British
general elections and Margaret Jones’
forthcoming study of Margaret
Thatcher’s reign, for instance have
not even been shown to the British pub-
lic. The reason, Clement says, is a sub-
stantial difference in attitude between
the countries.
But, he says, he does not believe that
Collins Australia should concentrate on
local relevance. He is coming to Sydney
with talk of broad frameworks, diversi-
fication and with British Collins titles
“reaching 10 percent of a book’s poten-
tial readers” in Australia which might
mean a very narrow market but also a
genuine one.
He says we were “failing in our obli-
gation” when the Collins translation of
Proust’s letters was not brought into
Australia last year.
Clement’s posting to Sydney co-
incides with a new appointment back in
Collins’ London office: Alewyn Birch,
former head of Granada, the publishing
house which Collins bought last year,
will be group managing director, inter-
national, and a member of the board of
Collins Australia. Directors of all four
major Collins subsidiaries will report to
him.
Birch is particularly canny about
Australian publishing, having come
here annually since 1957.
“But Collins Australia is 12,000 miles
(19,000 km) away,” Clement
says, “and there’s no way it
can be managed in London.”
He has guidelines so broad, he
says, that they could be con-
tained on one sheet of paper.
His recreation plans are
much more extensive. Clem-
ent is a good windsurfer,
having learned the art in
Greece in 1977. He is also a
keen tennis player, with a
little social cricket and golf on
the side.
He says that he is “basic-
ally a rural person” his
father, a chartered account-
ant, specialised in the finances
of Scottish farms and estates
and Clement grew up with a
love of country rambles and
ornithology.
Though the family did not
arrive with furniture or the
dog, Clement is bringing his
library. He is an enthusiastic
reader of experimental fiction
now largely French and
American but soon, he says,
Australian novels too. □

FILMS
The Bounty
develops
a lisp
By SANDRA HALL
THE CONVENIENT thing about his-
tory is that it is so adaptable. Tarted up
• every few years in a new set of interpre-
tations, an event can go on indefinitely
doing faithful service to thesis writers,
novelists and screenwriters who will all
talk up its “relevance to today.”
And so it is with the story of Bligh,
Christian and the Bounty now in its
third major screen incarnation in 50
years. Called simply The Bounty (to sug-
gest serious stuff), this version comes
with a screenplay by Robert Bolt, years
of grand planning (finally abandoned)
by director David Lean and money by
Dino De Laurentiis.
The director now is New Zealand’s
Roger Donaldson, best known for his
painfully perceptive portrait of a mar-
riage gone wrong in Smash Palace , and
the emphasis distinctly Freudian.
Sadism is out, sexual repression in and
Fletcher Christian no longer a hero
overthrowing a tyrant (the 1935 Holly-
wood view) or even an arrogant snob
(the 1963 Brando model). This time
round, with Mel Gibson in the role, he’s
a tease; a bundle of quivering
sensibilities and petulant impulses who
nearly drives poor Bligh mad but not
quite.
The screenplay is based on Richard
Hough’s Captain Bligh and Mr
Christian, written in 1972, but Bolt wise-
ly fails to endorse the vaguely-based
suggestion (repeated by Hough) that the
two might have begun the Bounty’s voy-
age as lovers. Reasonably alert viewers
are encouraged to reach their own con-
clusions about Bligh’s latent feelings as
he tosses sleepless on his narrow bunk,
tormented by visions of Christian at
play with his Tahitian princess.
Bligh is stern with himself, if not with
the crew, for in this version he is a de-
cent man undone by his chilly personal-
ity and the malcontents and incompe-
tents with whom he has to put up. And
when he is not worrying about Mr
Christian, Anthony Hopkins makes a
convincing case for him.
The story unfolds in flashback as
Bligh is justifying himself to Sir
Laurence Olivier and Edward Fox as,
respectively, Admiral Hood and Cap-
tain Greetham at a court martial. Things
began to go wrong for him, Bligh tells
them, during the Bounty's futile, month-
long attempt to round the Horn in win-
ter a sequence handled by Donaldson
in epic style with smashing waves,
howling gales and heroic rescues.
Fryer, played by Daniel Day Lewis,
an actor with chiselled features and
Brandoish egotism, is replaced by
Christian as master for showing insuffi-
cient spirit under pressure and at this
news Gibson launches one of the looks
of glazed-eyed wonderment which turn
out as pivotal to his performance. This
can be described only as economical in
the extreme. Apart from quivering and
looking bemused, he also flares his nos-
trils and juts his jaw. During the famous
moment in which he shouts “I am in
Hell,” while forcing Bligh into the long-
Mel Gibson in The Bounty : a bundle of quivering sensibilities
boat, he can be seen doing all four.
Tahiti is more or less the Garden of
Eden and who would want to quarrel
with that? Besides, Donaldson livens up
the languorousness of island life by
staging a stirring mating dance which is
enough in itself to give this version an
edge on the previous one while supply-
ing a much-needed boost to the sexual
repression theme as the watching Bligh
sits considering glumly just what he’s up
against.
Freudian bits apart, there is a lot to
be said for the Bolt view of history. He
never neglects the plot — or plots, for
he’s a good hand with sub-plots — so
here the politics of shipboard life get
plenty of coverage, helped along by his
habit of putting in plenty of full-
blooded minor characters to help take
up the slack during those moments
when life wasn’t quite up to art as far as
pace was concerned.
In Tahiti, for instance, while
Christian is lying around lotus-eating
and Bligh is harrumphing in frustration,
Bolt helps pass the time with the adven-
tures of alcoholic surgeon Huggan
(Malcolm Terris) and three deserters
whose punishment provides the obliga-
tory flogging scene.
Hopkins is exactly right as Bligh a
stocky, straitlaced figure, quick-tem-
pered, rather sorrowful afterwards and
desperately anxious to be true to both
his ambition and his sense of fairness.
His moments of sexual suffering over
Christian seem all the more strange as
they seem to have been added without
reference to anything else about him.
The film ends with the mutineers’ ar-
rival on Pitcairn and with Bligh’s tri-
umph in being exonerated from blame
(a neatly symbolic but rather false con-
clusion since the affair haunted him ever
afterwards). Here the even-handedness
of Bolt’s approach has its disadvantages
for it leaves a very bland aftertaste and
a sense of so-what.
Bligh should be seen as a tragic fig-
ure. After all, he seems to have had all
the makings in being a good, right-
thinking man handicapped by the awk-
ward and insurmountable fact that no-
body seems to have liked him much. A
more believable Fletcher Chrisian might
have helped to bring that out and the
tragedy with it.
The Bounty may go some of the way
towards putting things right with Bligh
but, despite Freud’s help, it doesn’t
make you care one way or the other. □

THEATRE
Born-again
Yesterday
is dated
By BRIAN HOAD
ONE OF the more interesting aspects of
the Sydney Theatre Company’s revival
of Garson Kanin’s tired little Broadway
comedy of 1946, Born Yesterday, is that
it was revived commercially in Mel-
bourne only last October. Despite the
presence of Australia’s favorite, not-so-
dumb blonde, Jacki Weaver, cocooned
in a gilded cage at the Washington Ritz
(as designed by Roger Kirk in a style
aptly reminiscent of the worst excesses
of the Roman Empire), the show
bombed. The proposed tour to Sydney
was cancelled. And that, you might have
thought, was that.
But the STC, as the most heavily-
subsidised commercial theatre company
in the country, is free to follow its pri-
vate fancies. It has rescued Weaver, her
frocks and her gilded cage from obliv-
ion in Melbourne and is presenting
them again at the Sydney Opera House
in a new production by the company’s
artistic director, Richard Wherrett.
Weaver is cutely comic as Billie
Dawn, ex-chorus girl pet of brutish
Harry Brock (Gary Files), millionaire,
swindler and scrap metal dealer.
Priggish idealist and crusading jour-
nalist Paul Verrall (John Allen)
unwisely is brought in to make Billie fit
for Washington society. And so she
comes to learn of Tom Paine and the
rights of man (and woman), rebels
against Harry, his cronies and the graft
and corruption of big business and big
government and heads off into a new
dawn of idealism on the arm of Paul
which must have seemed rather hearten-
ing in 1946 but in the light of post-war
American history is rather pathetic.
This little piece requires a large cast
of 15 who are put through their paces by
Wherrett in a slightly ritzy fashion
which is vaguely amusing. And he has
given some thought to justifying this
presentation. As a result, a new artistic
policy has been devised for the com-
pany and published in the program. It
appears that the STC is in search of
plays that are either “show business edi-
fication” or “inspirational entertain-
ment.” Unfortunately, the faded Ameri-
can dream of Born Yesterday is neither
edifying nor inspiring.
“Show business edification” may be
sampled at Sydney’s Kinselas. For
maximum effect it is best to take in the
all-female Gentlemen Only and the all-
male A Drag Show on one evening. In
between, a stroll around the neighbor-
ing Oxford Street milieu adds further
enlightenment.
Gentlemen Only is a neat conceit for
the age of sexual politics. Set in a
gentlemen’s club at the turn of the cen-
tury, the members simply gather to
crack sexist jokes, sing music-hall songs,
perform some snazzy routines and, for
Jackl Weaver and James Condon in Born Yesterday: neither edifying nor inspiring
good measure, stage a drag show (with-
in a drag show).
Directed by Nancye Hayes, the
seven actors led with relish by Judi
Connelli, Melissa Jaffer and Joan
Brockenshire play the piece straight
(so to speak). As a result, the satire re-
mains implicit and the “edification”
subtly subversive.
A Drag Show, presented by Simone
and Monique’s Playgirls Revue, carries
the evening through further sexual con-
fusions towards an edifying conclusion.
As show business, it’s a particularly pol-
ished and imaginative example of its
genre. As a featheryJligJit of transexual
fantasy into a world about which male
chauvinists dream, it is given perspec-
tive by Simone’s down-to-earth com-
mentaries.
Yet 90 minutes of mimed song and
prance numbers of such high calibre are
still guaranteed to tease the straightest
libido into a terrible tangle. At which
point, for a grand finale, the seven
prancing “playgirls” reveal themselves
as the progeny of Hermes and
Aphrodite.
“Inspirational entertainment” may
be found at the New Theatre in a new
work by Mona Brand, Here Comes
Kisch! The subject is Egon Kisch, a
Czech journalist invited to address the
Victorian Council Against War and
Fascism in 1934; and how the then At-
torney-General, Robert Menzies, made
a monumental fool of himself in trying
to stop Kisch landing.
The same subject was tackled by
Nimrod a couple of years back in Ken
Horler’s far less successful Party Wall.
But on this occasion, Brand and the
New strike a good balance between the
seriousness of the facts and a lightness
of touch in their presentation. The nar-
rative is moved along at a cracking
pace. The anti-fascist themes are clear
but unlabored. And the cast of 16 under
strong direction from Gregg Levy are
infectiously lively and good-humored.
The result is mainstream Australian
theatre at its best. In bringing alive so
vividly the events of 50 years ago, when
the protests of ordinary Australians
shook a government and changed the
law, it revives a sense of idealism in the
present; not the airy-fairy idealism of a
Billie Dawn but an idealism linked di-
rectly to the realities of the street out-
side. It’s rare, heart-stirring (inspiration-
al) entertainment.
Meanwhile, back at the STC,
Wherrett is insisting that Born Yesterday
will lead Australian civilisation towards
a new dawn in which force will give way
to reason, ignorance to experience,
cynicism to positivism, innocence to
maturity and imprisoning conservatism
to liberating radicalism.
Could he be trying to formulate an-
other artistic policy? □

After pushing new Toyota Camry through a course
of witches hats, one thing will be obvious.
It handles like you're driving something sophis-
ticated and expensive from Europe.
All you need do is take a look underneath Camry
and you'll discover why.
You see, the new Camry has gas pressure shock
absorbers at the front and fully independent suspension.
With the control of rack and pinion steering and
front wheel drive.
ALL VERY ADVANCED. ALL VERY SPORTY.
And better than a lot of other cars with similar
features. That's because Camry's advanced features are
specially tuned to work together in complete harmony.
The result is new Camry now handles even better
than the previous model that won Car of 'B3.
So even though Camry is a family car, you could be
excused for actually enjoying a winding mountain road.
You could even be excused for
enjoying Camry on the open road.
After all - you do have a Super
Responsive 2 litre engine with elec-
tronic fuel injection under your right foot.
SOMETHING THIS MUCH FUN

Camry's space and luggage capacity is totally unlike
most European family sports.
With a big hatchback and split folding rear seats,
Camry's capacity for a family and their luggage is enor-
mous. And anything that enormous is just the right size
for a family.
NEW CAMRY IS A CAR THAT CAN WEAR
MANY HATS.
Camry now has more luxury appointments.
There's a new tilt steering column for a more
comfortable driving position.
Further improvements have been made in-
side with a redesigned dash and seats with new cloth
upholstery.
The result is a more plush interior with more comfort
for driver and passenger alike.
Camry will hold the road as well as most European
family sports. Then hold your family with a lot more ease.
So Camry further builds on its unique reputation.
The perfect combination of European luxury, inno-
vation and finesse with the practicality of a Japanese car.

BOOKS
Why you
wait for
a waiter
By CEDRIC FLOWER
The World of Waiters, by Gerald
Mars and Michael Nicod. George
Allen and Unwin, hardback,
$27.95; paperback, $9.95.
DON’T be misled by the title into an-
ticipating a romp in the manner of
Ludwig Bemelmans’ delightful remem-
brances of life in the Hotel Splendide.
Nor is it a diner’s guide to out-facing
head waiters and obtaining a desirable
table. The beady eyes of waiterdom will
spy out, all too often, those unfavorable
clues that class us as “mean peasants.”
So forget all that. This is a serious
study by two British anthropologists
who penetrated the green baize doors of
hotels and restaurants to investigate the
complex world of “hierarchy and inse-
curity, of crisis and fiddling.”
Using the same methods on waiters
as those applied to other tribal groups
(such as New Guinea Highlanders) the
authors explain how we innocent diners
are embroiled willy-nilly in a web of
covert struggles that extends beyond the
waiter-client conflicts to embrace man-
agement, chefs and kitchen staff.
Diner-waiter relationships, say the
authors in a key chapter that will touch
a universal nerve, are based on the
proposition of who will get the jump on
the other. Initially, the advantage lies
with the customer and his tipping po-
tential. But, to retain the upper hand, he
or she must pass rigorous tests in mat-
ters of dress and deportment. The ad-
vantage passes to the waiter at the first
sign of social unease, never to be re-
gained.
If this sounds like taking part in
some devious power struggle when all
you wanted was a decent meal with
reasonable service, that’s the way it is.
Let the craven-hearted eat at home;
Here is photography imitating realist art
and not art imitating photography. The
picture at the top was taken in Townsville,
Queensland, and the other, at Boulder in
Western Australia. They are from John
Peel’s A Different Light, published by
James Fraser at $24.95. The work of
English-born Peel easily justifies yet an-
other photographic book on Australia; the
text, also by Peel, is less exciting.

Toshiba introduces
9 printers in 3.
You use your computer for more than one purpose.
Why shouldn’t you use your printer the same way?
With Toshiba’s P 1351, P 1350 and P 1340 you can. A
text mode uses a 24-pin dot matrix printhead to give
you clean, letter-quality copy. A draft mode accelerates
the pace for long jobs or jobs that are required in a
hurry. And graphs are no problem either. The exclusive
printhead delivers a high 180 x 180 dots-per-inch
graphics density pattern. Each printer is really three
printers in one.
The P 1350 and P 1351 double the speed of a
standard daisy wheel printer, producing high quality
copy in the text mode, at 100 cps. The draft mode races
along at 192 cps.
They also offer subscripts, super-|
scripts, variable pitch and a variety
of fonts selectable by software
command. And both printers
have extra wide platens. Perfect |
for spreadsheet and Lotus
1-2-3 data processing. If
space and budget are a bit
tight, choose the P 1340. It gives you |
most of the features of the other two, for less. I
With all these advantages, and proven reliability,
it’s little wonder that IBM PC users the world over are
choosing Toshiba printers. No matter which one
you choose, it’s all the printers you need.

Once you have absorbed the authors’
thesis, eating out should become a posi-
tive challenge well worth the overcharg-
ing and the tipping.
Those who fail to get the jump (most
of us, I suspect) and are abandoned in
some dim corner to fiddle with a bread
roll can take heart from George
Orwell’s advice never to be sorry for
waiters; they are all snobs who yearn to
change places with you. It may help to
know, as you watch the swift and jovial
service lavished on fellow diners, that
the waiters don’t really despise you.
“Excuse me ... waiter? ... I say,
waiter ...” □

The Bellarmine Jug, by Nicholas
Hasluck. Penguin, $5.95.
Last Ferry to Manly, by Jill Neville.
Penguin, $4.95.
The Chinaman, by Don’o Kim. Hale
& Iremonger, hardback, $19.95;
paperback, $9.95.
NICHOLAS HASLUCK is the latest of
many writers and artists to have been
fascinated by explorer Francisco Pel-
saert, the wreck of the Batavia on the
Houtman Abrolhos Islands in 1629 and
the subsequent mutiny in which 125
people were murdered. Hasluck’s novel
does not deal directly with Pelsaert,
apart from brief extracts from an ap-
pendix (which turns out to be a fabrica-
tion) to his journal. In fact, it is a kind
of espionage thriller set in Holland in
1948 and London 30 years later.
Hasluck expects his readers to be
diligent. Apart from hanging on to the
thread through a plot of extreme com-
plexity and ambiguity you have to know
something about Pelsaert, Grotius (a
17th-century father of international
law), Rosicrucianism and the struggle
for independence in Indonesia.
Bellarmine jugs were produced in
large quantities in the 17th century and
were decorated with a portrait of Car-
dinal Bellarmino. If you believe some of
the stories and some of the people in
this novel, the mutineers (joined by the
great Grotius’ son) were Rosicrucians
and had smuggled aboard the Batavia
jugs decorated with the Rosicrucian
symbol.
The Bellarmine Jug is really about
truth and falsehood and that often
unrecorded and even undefinable pro-
cess by which lies become accepted doc-
trine and forgeries are taken as origin-

als. The old librarian Niesman, the only
one who knows the true story about the
Pelsaert appendix and the Bellarmine
jug, says: “The greatest threat to order is
deception.”
Hasluck is no jesting Pilate; he stays
for an answer to the question of truth.
But the reader needs some staying
power to remain with him.
No effort at all is needed to read and
enjoy Last Ferry to Manly, which is a
tribute to Jill Neville’s spare artistry.
Lillian, back in Sydney from Europe, is
looking for a job and somewhere to live.
She finds a job with a newspaper (sat-
irised deftly) and a grotty flat looking
straight out on to Manly beach, with
“buckled walls, mouldy carpets, a rusty
pressed-iron ceiling ... wet footprints
gleaming on the lino.” It is just what she
wants and there is an unforgettable
neighbor, Bruiser, thrown in.
Lillian’s love life, whether in Manly,
up the coast, London or Paris, is by no
means always what she wants. Neville
writes about it with just the right mix-
ture of sweet-sour sensuality and
humor. Whether it is Lillian’s husband,
someone else’s, a surfie young enough to
be her son or another woman, her lovers
are not trapped in the bedroom by guilt
or revenge.
There are some vignettes of London
publishing which will rejoice anyone
with a long memory but Last Ferry to
Manly is in spirit another notable Syd-
ney book; of the harbor, the ferries,
Manly, the beach and the people who
come and go there. Lillian, sitting alone
on the top deck of the last ferry where
she is discovered by the anxious Bruiser,
is able to tell him that she is not the type
to commit suicide. But she still asks the
question of the Heads and the open sea:
“Why was it so hard to be rooted in the
world?”
The Chinaman would be a notable
addition to the growing literature of the
Barrier Reef if Don’o Kim had con-
centrated more tightly on some aspect
of his bountiful material. A novel by a
Korean-Australian about a Japanese
graduate student deckhand on a rich
man’s motor-cruiser in the waters of the
reef sounds promising enough but it
falls between adventure story, psycho-
logical drama, an expose' of racism and
a melange of literary and philosophical
discussion.
Kim obviously would like the voyage
of the Quovadis to the island of Moses
Perch to be some sort of allegory about
the human condition. However, there is
nothing of the strong pattern of narra-
tive that allegory needs and some evoca-
tive passages -about the reef, its corals
and waters, are lost in awkward dia-
logue and gauche characterisation.
Kim has tried to cram too much into
this, his third novel but the first with an
Australian setting. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Thatcher seen from down under
by Patricia Rolfe
THATCHER’S Kingdom: A View of
Britain in the 1980 s by Margaret Jones
will come from Collins next month.
Jones is a senior journalist with The
Sydney Morning Herald and, with
postings to the United States and China
and three spells in Britain, probably as
close as you will get to a foreign corre-
spondent in print journalism today.
Jones sees her title as ironic. She says
she is interested in Thatcher, admires
her in some ways but is not sympathetic
to her. “She is enormously dominating
and seems to see the country as her per-
sonal fiefdom,” she said. “She has de-
stroyed consensus and seems to want to
turn the country back or forward into
some other kind of Britain.”
Thatcher’s Kingdom is not all poli-
tics. There are chapters on Orwell 50
years on not 1984 but The Road to
Wigan Pier on the monarchy, on re-
curring scandals, on how the class sys-
tem is reclassifying itself. If the book
has a central idea it is that Britain is
going through the trauma of becoming a
secondary power not, in Jones’ view,
a bad thing.
Thatcher’s Kingdom will also be pub-
lished in Britain.
Billy Blue award winner Robert English
BILLY BLUE, named after the man
who began the first boat service across
Sydney Harbor, is a magazine sassy is
perhaps the word for it more admired
by the Eastern suburbanites who cross
the harbor each day to work in North
Sydney advertising agencies than by
North Shore people who cross the har-
bor each day to work in banks and in-
surance companies in the city.
It is also a notable supporter of Aus-
tralian fiction and has just announced
the winners of its fourth literary awards,
worth $5OOO. These are jointly funded
with the Clemenger advertising agency,
probably the most generous agency to
the arts. The winner, Robert English,
got $3OOO. Previous winners include
Peter Carey and Gerard Lee but Billy
Blue is proud to have first published a
couple of writers who have since found
book publishers.
The awards exist, Billy Blue editor
Lee Buchanan said, because of the inter-
est publisher Aaron Kaplan and mana-
ging editor Ross Renwick have in fic-
tion. Billy Blue publishes about 50
stories a year, receives around 1000
manuscripts in that time, and the
awards and magazines are subsidised by
the group’s design and related activities.
Its first application for subsidy to the
Literature Board of the Australia Coun-
cil is being prepared.
PUBLISHERS sincerely believe that
crime pays for them. The problem is
that in NSW there always seems to be a
fresh Briese in the air, so when does the
author decide the book is finished and
the publisher publish? Macmillan has
jumped in and will publish Bob Bot-
tom’s Without Fear or Favor on August
30 with a 45,000 print run, price of $7.95
and launching at the National Press
Club. Nelson had planned Richard
Hall’s Crime Does Pay for this month
but publication is delayed.
THE EUROPEAN Parliament plans to
set up a library without books and they
are going to call it an “awareness sys-
tem.” It would be a databank in Flor-
ence linked with 500 major European
libraries. The idea of a Euro-library to
serve all the areas of the European
Economic Community was discussed a
couple of years ago but critics foresaw a
mountain of books growing like the
mountains of unsold primary products
in which the EEC specialises. Now they
have to find if Italy wants an awareness
system and how to pay for it. □

These books get up my nose
PHILLIP ADAMS
SEEKING spiritual nourishment for
my youngest daughter, I pushed open
the door of Mary Martin’s book shop in
South Yarra. What about Wind In The
Willows? Or A. A. Milne’s latest, Now
We Are 45? Something simple and
pristine, with elegant typography and
understated black-and-white illustra-
tions. The sort of books that give the
literary purist a sense of smugness and
self satisfaction.
And what did my eyes behold?
Books laden, encrusted with gim-
micks. Take the Sesame Street
people. They proffer a variety of
“non-toxic and washable”
books; books you can toss into
the washer when you’re doing
your Y-fronts. And alongside
them Ernie’s and Bert’s Delivery
Service, a book in the shape of a
lorry with “real moving wheels.”
Frankly, I have no desire to
wash books. That sort of thing
might appeal to a Fred
Whitehouse or Mary Nile. You
could see them with a load of
Norman Mailers or Henry
Millers, plonking them into the
Hoover with a few cups of Omo.
And, after the spin dry, retrieving
some spotless Gideon Bibles or a
wholesome Malcolm Muggeridge.
Nor do I have any urgent desire for
books with wheels on them, although
being able to summon some heavy vol-
umes of the Britannica, linked together
like freight cars, might have its attrac-
tions. There was an Indian maharajah
who had a miniature railway running
from his kitchen around his vast dining
table so that his guests could be served
from a miniature version of the Flying
Scotsman. Perhaps there could be some
efficiencies in rail-roading your refer-
ence works, summoning up a Roget’s
coupled to Synonyms and Antonyms.
But what if one were to weaken?
God knows where you would finish up;
perhaps replacing the printed word with
those wretched video cassettes.
The next examples of children’s lit-
erature to catch the eye were pop-up
books and 3D books to be viewed
through colored glasses. Instead of the
young mind conjuring images from the
purity of the printed word, here are
books that aspire to be TV sets. Person-
ally, I disapprove deeply of colored il-
lustrations, regarding them as decadent,
let alone pictures that pop up at you or
pop out at you.
Ricocheting from the display stand, I
found myself confronted by Ernie’s
Bath Book and a placard saying “Rub-
a-dub-dub take this book in the tub!”
Not to be confused with books you can
toss in the washer, these are books to
read in the bath. Personally I believe the
proper place to read is on the 100 or in
bed. Thus I reserve the bath for games
with my rubber duck and submarine.
Though from time to time, I must admit,
I do have my valet come in and read me
a few chapters from Proust.
Moving through the book shop with
increasing caution and hostility, I
waited to be confronted by edible cook
books. Perhaps a sophisticated new
work from Don Dunstan or Leo
Schofield that you could munch, going
through the leaves like a koala up its
eucalypt.
Instead I was confronted with some-
thing far, far worse: No less than eight
books you could smell.
As any bibliophile knows, books
have a proper, natural smell which is
musty and dusty. This is the way books,
book shops, libraries and librarians
have smelt since the time of Caxton. But
here were books containing those ap-
palling “scratch ’n’ sniff” fragrances.
There was The Sweet Smell of Straw-
berry Land, Poppa’s Pizza, Charmkins
Sniffy Adventure, Sniff and Tell Riddle
Book, Detective McGruff Sniffs Out a
Thief, Garfield Goes To A Picnic, Super-
market Magic and Sniffy The Mouse. I
was assured that the smells therein were
“amazingly like the real thing” and was
offered the entire collection of olfactory
fiction for $32.
Needless to say, I turned up my nose.
As I’ve said already, books have a tra-
ditional odor. They are not meant to
smell like strawberries or pizza, with or
without anchovies. The implications of
scratch ’n’ sniff publishing are, quite
clearly, too awful to contemplate. It is
only a matter of time until someone
offers us a scratch ’n’ sniff Patrick
White, complete with the rotting cada-
ver of Voss. Or a scratch ’n’ sniff T. E.
Lawrence, complete with the authentic
stench of camel. And imagine, if you
dare, the scratch ’n’ sniff edition of
Frank Hardy’s Outcasts of Foolgarah
which was, as I remember, the
story of a nightcart driver.
And if it ever comes to scratch
’n’ sniff porn, I’ll be apologising
to Fred and Mary and joining the
Festival of Light.
Once upon a time the library
was a quiet and hushed place. In
the future one imagines the deaf-
ening sound of hundreds of
readers (sniffers?) scratching
furiously at the text as they seek
to inhale the scent of kippers in
Shoes Of The Fisherman or the
ambrosial Viennese sewers in
Graham Greene’s Third Man.
Not to mention the choking fug
of lavender water that would
arise from the heavily scented
prose of Barbara Cartland.
I have, slowly and reluctantly, ad-
justed to the idea of talking books and
of books in braille. I’ve learned to live
with detumescent books with those
awful, soft, floppy covers and even
with books that aspire to be coffee
tables.
But I’ll have no part of books with
edible illustrations, books that bob
around in the bath, books that emerge
floppy and fresh from the clothes dryer
or books that you read with your nose.
And yet, what of a scratch ’n’ sniff
Bulletin ?
One can imagine the scent of a good
cigar arising from McNicoll’s prose
while Pierpont’s pages would produce
the fragrant pot pourri of the Croesus
Club in stereo for both nostrils.
Many a bad smell would arise from
the pages devoted to politics while
Sandra Hall’s film reviews could be aug-
mented with a whiff of popcorn or a hint
of Jaffas.
The letters pages would be a nasal
smorgasbord; the Modest Farmer could
choose from an entire menagerie. As for
me, I’ve got a cold this week and can’t
smell a thing. Consequently you might
just catch a whiff of Vicks Vaporub from
my page. □

Quintet by Rova
Quintet by Rovei
The most exciting
When you find the car that you always wanted,
life can get pretty exciting.
Particularly when it has all the verve and grace of a
Rover. And Japanese economy, reliability and high re-
sale value.
Best of all is a modest price tag of $13,400.*
(Which is about what you’d normally pay for a
Toyota Celica Hatchback,
Mazda 626 Super Deluxe
5-Door, or a
TXS Ghia.)*
Telstar
The luxury in exciting detail.
When you discuss the Quintet, it’s best to start
with a long list of comforts and features.
Power steering. Electric windows. Electric aerial.
Twin remote control exterior mirrors. Pioneer stereo
radio/cassette. Seats, doors and headrests beautifully
finished in crushed velour.
Carpet you’d be happy to have in your
home. (Even the load space is carpeted.)
Alloy wheels. Radial ply tyres.
Tachometer. Interior releases for the
9.

Behind that sombre facade, Boris is laughing
DAVID McNICOLL
I HAVE never thought of the Russians
as having much sense of humor. It cer-
tainly doesn’t show up in their literature
or music.
But there is humor in Russia. David
Evans, for three years our ambassador
in Moscow, and now our high commis-
sioner in Kuala Lumpur, told me last
week how the foreign diplomatic corps
discovered the Muscovite humor.
The inevitable “bug” listening to
everything every foreigner in Russia
says is known affectionately as “Boris.”
At a recent Christmas party at one of
the embassies, someone said, amid all
the noise and celebration, “Isn’t it sad to
think of Boris, wherever he is, ear-
phones on, listening to all our fun, and
having absolutely none himself.”
A few minutes later, the phone in the
embassy rang, and the ambassador
picked it up. There was silence for a mo-
ment, then the unmistakable sound of a
champagne cork coming out of a bottle.
Then the caller hung up.
I SEE that Immigration Minister West
has been sculling round El Salvador
and other areas of Central America
finding out if there are any spare poten-
tial migrants for Australia.
Why, for Heaven’s sake? Surely we
have done our bit with the Boat People,
and with refugees from Lebanon. Are
we to have Central Americans coming
in no doubt with the special advan-
tages not available to United Kingdom
and European migrants and no doubt
bringing their hometown hates and pol-
itical feuds with them?
In the last couple of weeks I have
seen some very interesting documents.
Not pilfered, merely now available
under Freedom of Information legisla-
tion. If anyone doubted that special
consideration was being given to mi-
grants from Asia and Lebanon, they
should put the optic on Immigration
and Ethnic Affairs Instructions, PC 39,
PC 207, and PC 1102. They clearly illus-
trate that most precautionary investiga-
tions of intending Asian and Lebanese
migrants have been abandoned or
broken down.
The Settler Arrival Data (Country of
Last Residence) makes interesting read-
ing. In 1981-82 the figures were UK
and Ireland 38,863; Europe 24,981;
Asia 26,528. In 1983-84 the figures were
UK and Ireland 16,954; Europe 1 1,928;
Asia 23,546. Note the steady flow from
Asia, the dramatic drop from UK and
Europe.
Diplomat Evans: the fun was shared
LUIS MARTIN
Taking the specific period July 1983
to January 1984, one finds the figures
even more enlightening. Approvals for
this period were UK and Ireland
6433; north Europe 2934; southern Eur-
ope 2973. Total 12,340.
In the same period, other approvals
were - Middle East 2442; Asia 15,386.
Total 17,828. In other words, 5488 more
from the Middle East and Asia than
from the UK and Europe.
How can this man West continue to
say migration is not favoring Asians?
Apart from these figures, I have been
given information about the “not
wanted” treatment being meted out to
prospective migrants from Britain. One
document I have carries details about
an intending migrant with much-needed
trade skills, married with children, and
relatives in Australia, plus about
£lOO,OOO ready to be transferred with
him. His consistent applications to
come here have been brushed off in
London.
I also have an extraordinary letter
containing in part:
“I came to Australia this year to
marry an Australian. Before I was
issued with a visa I had to fill in a dec-
laration signing away the rights of my
two daughters to enter Australia, as they
are over 18 years of age. I was a bit
concerned, but I had no option because
I wouldn’t have been allowed entry
otherwise..
Who in his right mind can point
any sort of accusing finger at Professor
Geoffrey Blainey?
AT ONE time the Chinese seemed to
have a tight grip on the restaurant busi-
ness in Sydney, outnumbering other
ethnic houses by about two to one. Then
the Greeks made a steady run and
Greek restaurants sprang up in city and
suburbs. In recent times, the Lebanese
have come on strongly, and the Malays,
Thais and Vietnamese are opening up in
many suburbs.
Making a very strong run are the
Italian restaurants. For years the old-
established ones Beppi’s, Darcy’s,
Mario’s and A 1 Corso have kept up
extremely high standards. Now two new
ones have joined the scene.
Ettore Prossimo, who for years ran
the Buona Sera at Kings Cross, has
opened Donini’s at Double Bay and
turned it into the place in which to be
seen at that gilded shopping centre. In
the city proper Johnny Walker, of
Bistro fame, has opened the Medici in
Angel Place, where his chef, Carmelo
Brancato, brings Roman delights to the
jaded businessmen and women of the
city centre.
WELL, IT looks as though the Federal
Government’s juggling is going to save
so-called “top” schools from unfair
treatment at least for a year or so.
In my view, the whole attitude of
Labor’s left to these schools is cockeyed
and class conscious. It would be mani-
festly unfair if people of moderate
means who happen to have a family
connection with a certain school were
unable, because funding had ended, to
send their children to that school and so
continue the family association. But this
is what would happen if certain schools
were penalised. Money will be the only
“open sesame” and many families will
“launder” their children into what they
see as more respectable circles, just as
the Mafia launders money through re-
spectable outlets.
Before the government had second
thoughts, one angry mother said to me:
“It’s unfair. There are thousands of
families who are really well-to-do two
or three cars, boat, pool, holiday home
who send their children to govern-
ment schools at no cost to themselves.
Despite their wealth, they’re getting an
extra bonus through free education.
Why not have assets tests for parents
sending their children to government
schools?” □

ANDREW MARTIN
Cdited by (fiend/ ‘Thompson
The Melbourne homosexual newspaper
Outrage speculated that with his new
gown and chain, Australia’s first openly
homosexual mayor, Ralph McLean,
might don fishnet stockings and stil-
ettos. McLean (27) responded that the
mayoral allowance didn’t cover cloth-
ing. “I don’t wear drag but I like bright
clothes,” chattered the university re-
searcher, “and last week as I was going
down the Town Hall steps an engineer-
ing staff man whistled at me.” McLean
says only a couple of residents of the
nation’s smallest municipality objected
to their mayor’s proclivity they called
him a pervert.
Evan Green, motoring writer, rally dri-
ver and support team member on
Donald Campbell’s 1964 world speed re-
cords is set to become the new Colleen
McCullough. His Australian publisher
James Fraser says MacDonald Futura,
the UK publishers of The Thornbirds,
have bought Green’s second novel,
Adam’s Empire, for one of the biggest
contracts ever paid to someone unpub-
lished outside Australia. Literary agent
Selwa Anthony says the advance is big-
ger than $50,000, that the US publishing
houses were falling over themselves for
a piece of the action and that there is
talk of a film. The book is due for
hardback issue in 1986. “Adam” in the
saga is based on a well-known South
Australian.
Sydney Gould (43) is cross at Australia’s
“shabby treatment” of John Clunies
Ross in the Cocos islands and is writing
a book about it. She is just back from a
research trip to Cocos where these days
even John’s wife Daphne needs a visa to
get in. “When I was there 10 years ago
with a team collecting marine speci-
mens, it was an idyllic situation for the
islanders,” said the American blonde,
“Now they seem inactive.” A High
Court action will tell whether Clunies
Ross loses his toehold (his house) and is
kicked off completely. Gould says his
shipping contracts have been cancelled,
leaving him with very few pennies to
rub together.
Pele, the legendary soccer hero, is en-
joying a flourishing second career as a
leading film actor in Brazil. He recently
completed his 10th movie in which he
starred as Pedro Mico, a Latin Robin
Hood. In one steamy sequence a naked
Pele had to make love to his beautiful
leading lady. “I had a lot of difficulty
with the scene,” said Pele later, “es-
pecially as the actress was the director’s
wife.”
Stephanie Brush, the New Yorker who
wrote Men: An Owner’s Manual for a
“world desperately needing a guide to
cohabitation,” was quoted recently by
People's Weekly magazine as “semi-
seriously hanging out with a Nice
Young Man.” Brush (29) says heart sur-
geons all want to be God, except that it
would involve a cut in pay. She gunned
along the lines of wry funny person
Fran Lebowitz: “If you ever read the
Bachelor of the Month in Cosmopolitan
you know what men really want is ‘a
woman with a sense of humor’ and
not just because it’s crude to say, ‘I go
for giganto tits.’ But what you have to
face is that a woman with a sense of
humor isn’t a woman who makes jokes,
it’s a woman who laughs at jokes.”
The poet John Masefield was a recluse
in his later years, living near Oxford in a
dark, ivy-covered house like the one
in Rebecca , according to his cousin
Richard Masefield, 41, a farmer-cum-
author now in Sydney researching a
convict novel. “I remember his cour-
tesy,” says Richard. “He was in his 80s
and he pulled my chair out for me I
was 19 at the time. He told me always to
write my thoughts down because you
never remember them when you get
back to the office.” Taking his advice, in
the dawn shift while milking 50 cows,
Richard outlined and started his first
novel, Chalkhill Blue, on paper udder
cloths.
Women are definitely narrowing the
gap. Recently Swedish player Pia
Cramling defeated Viktor Korchnoi, suc-
cessively runner-up and semi-finalist in
the world chess championship, in a
grand master tournament in Switzer-
land. Pia, 21, is currently number one
female player in the world.
A recent picture spread in a US maga-
zine showed a top American couple at
home. They were Senator Robert Dole
and his wife, Elizabeth, who is Reagan’s
Transportation Secretary. One shot
showed them making a bed, which
prompted a reader to write to complain
that Dole was “destroying the American
male image.” Dole responded: “Buster,
you don’t know the half of it. If they
hadn’t been taking the pictures, she
wouldn’t have been helping at all.”
Barry Humphries’ alter ego Dame Edna
Everage is not as well known as he

ebrations as Edna Earl.


The latest project of nationalistic Kevin
Weldon (he published A Day In the Life

the big glossy book shows the creations

signers such as Anthea Crawford,
Ewaldo, Brian Rochford, Carla Zampatti
and Jenny Kee. If the title seems a little
truncated, it was to have “Annual” on
the end but with a winter edition
planned that somehow didn’t seem ap-
propriate.

Singaporeans call him the father of the
Australian tribe. Len Denison now
heads 240 people working in Australia
for Singapore Airlines. But it wasn’t so
when he left Qantas to take on the in-
fant carrier in Australia 19 years ago; he
shared a desk with a secretary and that
was the Australian strength. For MSA,
the airline that was to turn into SIA, it
was the first big step overseas. Denison
masterminded its expansion in Austra-
lia, fought the political and commercial
wars to establish it and now feels it’s
time to step down from the general
manager’s job and let his former mar-
keting manager Giles Killick take his
place. From the overseas step Denison
and his Australian tribe provided, Sin-
gapore Airlines has grown into one of
the world’s biggest. It’s been a notable
aviation success story. Back at head
office they are far from reluctant to ac-
knowledge the debt they owe to their
Australian chieftain.

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
John Bull’s vineyard born anew
BACK IN THE 1890 s unquestionably
Victoria was the wine colony with the
most muscle, bigger than South Austra-
lia or New South Wales. We were call-
ing ourselves “John Bull’s Vineyard.”
There was the big dream that Victoria
was the new Bordeaux and it was just a
matter of time before we put a bottle of
Victorian wine on every English table.
In 1894-95 we had an unbelievable
12,265 ha under vine. The combination
of phylloxera, economic depression and
rampant aggressive wowserism practi-
cally wiped it all out. I grew up in an era
when wine was almost forgotten. Even
at bastions such as the Melbourne Club
they didn’t drink much wine. Back in
pre-war days whisky was the tipple and
at lunch they used to put little flasks of
whisky on the table.
During the 50s you’d be lucky if we
had 1500 ha genuinely producing wine.
There was Rutherglen, Milawa, Great
Western, Chateau Tahbilk, not much
else and wine was desperately difficult
to sell. I would get my wine down from
Milawa by the barrel and I used to have
an old beer keg which I sent up to Eric
Purbrick at Chateau Tahbilk.
This wasn’t cask wine that they were
selling, but premium quality and I used
to bottle it for under 10 cents a bottle.
Some of those bottles with more than 25
years of age, full of wisdom, benevol-
ence and maturity are still in the cellar.
The new boom started in the 70s but
it occurred to few people that Victoria
could make wine. The talk was all Hunt-
er, largely due to the verve and incred-
ible skills of my old mate Len Evans.
Victoria even had an inferiority com-
plex. Many people thought if it was
Victorian it couldn’t be any good and
Vic wines didn’t make the wine lists
even in their own wine areas.
All right, last week we had our sixth
Exhibition of Victorian Winemakers.
Dear Reader, the sense of inferiority
isn’t there any more. Everything has
gone the other way. Indeed we are so
good we think we might even have to
calm down a little.
Roy Moorfield, still only 35, started
the first exhibition with 28 wine makers
at Gordon House in 1979. “Isn’t it won-
derful,” said Roy, “how we always pick
the old houses of temperance?” The
present exhibition is in the Victoria,
which used to be the Victoria Coffee
Palace, and it took on the wine show
with the very hope of trying to shatter its
wowser past.
Roy started work as a bank clerk
Inspection time for the grapes at Warrenmang
NORMAN WODETZKI
with the old ES&A, and he discovered
very early that it is difficult to make
your fortune looking after other
people’s money, so he borrowed $5OO
and went into the wine business. He
now runs Moorfield Vintners.
He remembers very vividly that
period in 1979. “All the other states
were beating the drum for their wines.
The Hunter mob came over with a
special Hunter dinner. Their guest of
honor was Malcolm Fraser. I couldn’t
get over the fact that they had a
Victorian prime minister pushing Hunt-
er wine. Then there was another big
show from South Australia. Everyone
was running round with lapel badges:
BE A BAROSSA BUFF. But nobody
was doing anything for Victoria.”
After the first wine exhibition, mar-
keting people Peter Wilms and Ken
Ezard moved in and every year there
has been an astonishing range of new
wineries. This year they had 48 and
there will be many more next year.
When you get Roy Moorfield talking
about Victorian wines you almost have
to hold him back. He is convinced that
Victoria unquestionably has the best
conditions in the nation for producing
wine. “You know,” he said, “for years
we have had people coming to us from
interstate, telling us what a terrible cli-
mate we have. Isn’t it lovely that this
terrible climate is so perfect for produ-
cing good wine?”
He said: “There is no doubt in the
minds of the wine trade that Victoria
has prime areas for quality wine on a
large scale. There was a sur-
vey done by Roseworthy
Viticultural College in the late
70s on prime homoclimes,
and they found here prime
viticultural areas which 60 to
80 percent matched the great
viticultural areas of Europe.”
And so Roy continued to
enthuse. He spoke of the re-
birth of the Yarra Valley, an
area still remembered for
some of the greatest wines of
the 19th century; he spoke of
the extraordinary reds coming
from the “Golden Triangle”
Ballarat, Ararat and Avoca
of the return of Geelong, of
areas absolutely destined to
be famous Gisborne and
Mount Macedon, cooler areas
superb for great rieslings,
pinot noirs.
“You see here we can
produce wines more of an international
style, not the huge blockbusting wines
of old. That’s been our trouble in Aus-
tralia, always we have produced the
wrong grapes in the wrong areas.”
What’s more, he claimed, Victoria
had started a new era producing quality
wines produced by the champagnoise
method. He cites Bests, Taltarni, Remy
Martin and Yellowglen. “And at last
they are using the right grapes.”
The ultimate compliment to Victoria,
he says, has come from the big compan-
ies. Would you believe Lindeman, that
bastion of the Hunter, has resurrected
the old label “Matthew Lang,” so that it
can push Victorian wines.
Then Seppelts, which for years has
had its great holding at Great Western,
suddenly has become Victoria minded.
It has released the Victorian Selection, a
white label with a sash across it:
“Victorian Wine.”
So last week one had a very formid-
able task. In that dear old temperance
hall one took a glass and worked one’s
way through 200 wines, interesting
names like Balgownie, Bonnonnee,
Delatite, Warrenmang, Water Wheel,
Yarra Burn, Prince Albert, Diamond
Valley and Jasper Hill.
Eventually Victorian wine could be
as formidable as the football. Soon
Victorian wine will have its second exhi-
bition in Sydney. They are going to
Brisbane in May and tomorrow they are
looking to the world. Glory be, they are
planning a Victorian Wine Exhibition
for San Francisco in 1986. □

How Scowl shared his food
RON SAW
A GERMAN in London is suggesting
(according to Malcolm Andrews in the
Sydney Daily Telegraph) that one of the
world’s shortest books would be Austra-
lian Table Manners.
I can’t think why it would be short. I
could do 80,000 words on the subject, at
least half of them devoted to the
boarders at Hale School, Perth, WA,
during World War 11.
It was there that I, aged about 10,
used a fork to stab the hand of a boy
who was trying to steal a potato from
my plate. His screams were probably
frightful but in a large room, with about
100 boys at the trencher, it was impos-
sible to hear him. On a good day say
on one of the days when they were serv-
ing sinker and Golden Syrup a rhi-
noceros could have sat at the head of
the Third Form table and howled, un-
heard, to its mate.
But the rest of my book would be
devoted to one man: a politics reporter
named, for the sake of convenience,
Nugent Scowl, with a publishing group,
the name of which I must also suppress
to protect the innocent.
Maybe Scowl wasn’t really bad-man-
nered: perhaps he was just untidy.
Judge for yourself.
He was a big, cheerful man but his
appetite was nothing to write home
about. And that was just as well, be-
cause had he tried to eat any more he
might have done himself an injury.
At the staff canteen he was always a
star attraction. His method of eating
was to pile as much food as possible on
to the fork. Meat, potatoes, cabbage, a
touch of mashed pumpkin here, a few
drips of gravy there; he seldom cut up
anything smaller than his hand, so that
the fork would be well-nigh groaning
under the weight of about half a leg of
lamb and maybe a bucket of vegetables.
Scowl would throw back his head,
close his eyes and try, I always thought,
to imitate a hippopotamus. It was sel-
dom that he could manage to get more
than about 15cm between his upper
teeth and his lower; had he really
wanted to get the whole forkful through,
he’d have needed seven or eight more
centimetres to play with.
There were times when he came close
to that. 1 don’t exactly know how; it had
something to do with pressing just in
front of his ears so that his jaw would
fall down to somewhere around his so-
lar plexus but getting it back needed two
hands and tended to slow him.
Anyway, on a normal day Scowl
would shove away with his fork and
most of the food would be brushed off
by his teeth. It would fall heavily, but
not much of it would reach the table or
Scowl’s trousers.
Across his chin there was a ledge
the result, he said, of the poor treatment
of a kick from a cow.
On to this ledge would fall gobbets of
meat, potato mashed with gravy and,
once, an entire french bean; and on a
day when the canteen had served steak
and kidney pie about a week after
Scowl had begun growing a beard
coarse tufts of whiskers on his chin-
ledge held for some time two or three
pieces of chopped kidney; a grisly sight.
Scowl was aware of the state of his
chin but, oddly enough, he was com-
pletely oblivious to its effect on others.
One afternoon he arrived to interview
Sir Robert Askin wearing not only a
raincoat and a scarf but also, on his
ledge, a long white sliver of fish, half a
pea and specks of fried potato.
“Strike me roan!” shouted the for-
mer NSW premier. “What’s that you’ve
got all over your face?”
Scowl scrubbed a bit and looked,
with interest, at his lunch as it fell to the
floor.
“Just a bit of fish,” he said. “Flat-
head. Had it in our canteen today.
Bloody good, too. They do it with ...”
“Never mind how they do it. You
shouldn’t walk around Sydney wearing
it all over your face.”
Scowl told us the story in the pub
that night. He didn’t seem to think it
droll or even bizarre. It just seemed a
pity, he said, that the political boss of
the state could get so worked up about a
bit of plain food.
Still, the unhappiest victim of
Scowl’s feeding hours was an elderly
leader-writer named Harry Groat. As
fate would have it, Harry, too, was an
unconventional feeder.
In his 75th year Groat had lost all his
teeth, so that while others worked their
way through thick steaks, apples, etc, he
had to be content with soups, ice-cream
or boiled custard. But for his favorite
light luncheon he had a cup of coffee
and sawed the end off and sucked a
chocolate eclair.
He was a sensitive old chap and the
sight of Scowl at the board made him
wince. And, when Scowl enjoyed his
favorite dessert, Harry sometimes cried.
For it was Scowl’s pleasure to get two
scoops of ice-cream with strawberry
syrup, mash them with his spoon and
then, stirring, reduce the confection to
the consistency of pink glue.
Worse: a man who carried as much
food on his face as Scowl did was not
untidy but also dangerous.
One lunchtime when Scowl having
disposed of sweet curry and rice was
stirring away at his ice-cream, he
sneezed hugely. The result was that
Harry, sitting opposite him, sucking his
eclair, collected curried lamb, gravy,
rice, chopped banana, cucumber and
half-a-dozen hot, fat sultanas; and I, at
Scowl’s left, got a glot of pink glue on
my right shoulder.
As I said, Scowl wasn’t classically
bad-mannered. He was more untidy. □

How Good
A President?
In Dallas this week, Ronald Wilson Rea-
gan will be officially nominated for a second
term with all the pomp and glitter that the
Republican Party can muster. He is the
nation’s 40th president—already one of its
most extraordinary—and that Reagan has,
on balance, succeeded in his first term seems
wholly beyond dispute: the real questions
are how and why. As a man, he is neither
especially acute nor especially driven; as
WALLY McNAMEE —Newsweek
Dallas welcome, the candidates: Effortless
ROBERT R. McELROY— Newsweek
president, he is neither especially knowl-
edgeable nor especially well prepared for
the most powerful job in the world. But he
succeeds effortlessly, in a way that leaves
both friends and adversaries groping for
explanation. Although it may be too much
to say that Ronald Reagan has reinvented
the presidency during his first 45 months in
office, he has unquestionably revitalized it.
That aura of leadership may be the most
significant accomplishment of Reagan’s
first term; it is also a crucial asset in his
campaign for re-election. From the day he
took office until the present moment, Rea-
gan has demonstrated a mastery of the bully
pulpit that is equaled only by Franklin Roo-
sevelt in modern times. Presidential schol-
ars, who are as impressed by his political
agility as Democrats are cowed by it, de-
scribe that mastery as a genius for the “sha-
manistic” functions of the office —its cere-
monial role in the national psyche, the
president as father figure, cheerleader, com-
mander in chief. Reagan’s own amiable
personality and even his practiced com-
mand of television are only part of that
leadership style. Over the past 3Vi years,
through words and deeds and careful stage
management by the White House staff,
Reagan has undeniably brought about a
revival of patriotism, confidence and na-
tional purpose. “America is basically a
nation that believes in a kind of Manifest
Destiny,” says one adviser, “and in the same
way that the French idolized de Gaulle,
Reagan personifies an idealized image of
what America would like to be.”
Work in Progress: The nation is not ready,
of course, to carve Reagan’s idealized image
on Mount Rushmore. He is cordially detest-
ed by liberal politicians at every level of
government and by a fervent minority of the
voters. Many intellectuals dismiss him as a
know-nothing; working women consider
him a troglodyte who has been left behind
by the sweeping social changes of the past
two decades, and civil-rights leaders charge
that his administration is hostile to the poor,
the black and the disadvantaged.
That opposition is, in many ways, a reac-
tion to his assault on the tradition of the
New Deal. Yet the main initiatives of his
conservative revolution are hardly com-
plete. From the daunting task of controlling
the federal deficit to the chilly prospects
for stabilized relations with the Soviet
Union, Reagan’s presidency is very much a
work in progress. Its future success, if he
wins in November, will depend heavily on
the outcome of this year’s congressional
elections—and perhaps just as much on
luck. And he is already under pressure from
within his own party to press the Reagan
revolution further, harder and faster. In
Dallas last week, Republican right-wingers
forced the White House to accept a no-new-
taxes plank in the GOP platform—a show
of force that clearly signaled their ascen-
dance in the party and which will surely
complicate Reagan’s running debate with
Walter Mondale.
Reagan has recently been losing that de-
bate, and his advisers know it. Mondale’s
charge that Reagan has a “secret plan” to
raise taxes succeeded in putting Reagan on
the defensive for weeks—and when Vice
President George Bush publicly counseled
his boss on the need for flexibility, it led to a
rare display of friction and confusion within
the presidential entourage. Last week Rea-
gan conceded the issue by admitting that he
might someday raise taxes “as a last re-
sort” —but by that point his handlers were
trying to contain the fallout from two other
awkward gaffes. The first was Reagan’s
clumsy joke about bombing Russia; the
second was aide Michael Deaver’s too-can-
did admission that Reagan occasionally
nods off at Cabinet meetings (box). A plausi-
ble construction of these disclosures might
be that Reagan is (1) a schemer who dissem-
bles on major issues, (2) a fanatic who
dreams of pushing the nuclear button and (3)
a bumbler who cannot stay awake long
enough to run his own administration. All
that, of course, is precisely what Mondale
would like the voters to think.
Crises: In truth, Reagan is none of those
things. More than any presidential candi-
date since Barry Goldwater, he has been
consistently explicit about his ideology: he is
a conservative, perhaps the most conserva-
tive president to hold office in modern times,
and the voters know it. He has dabbled in the
red-meat rhetoric of doctrinaire anticom-
munism, flung billions into the largest
peacetime military buildup in history and
conspicuously stiffened U.S. policy toward
the Soviet Union. But his handling of poten-
tial crises, such as the destruction of Korean
Air Lines Flight 007 last year, has been
notably restrained, and he has lately been
careful to outdove the men in the Kremlin.
As chief executive, Reagan’s operating
style has been so laid back as to inspire a spate

of judgments about the “disengaged presi-
dency,” and there is no question that he
relies heavily on his advisers. But there is
also no question that Reagan himself has
shaped the major decisions of his adminis-
tration. Despite the deluge of dark news
about the 1981-82 recession, for example, it
was Reagan who quelled the uproar among
economics aides. “He never gave up the
notion that the recovery would come if we
would just wait,” says one top hand.
For all that, the tangible achievements of
his first term have been relatively modest.
His economic program, in the judgment of
many experts, has succeeded almost in spite
of itself —and the current recovery is built on
record deficits that will burden the nation for
a generation. His foreign policy has lacked
coherence and produced one real debacle, in
Lebanon; his approach to nuclear-arms con-
trol has been marked by false starts and
missed opportunities. His tax cuts have been
of marginal value to the vast majority of
American families, and his budget cuts have
widened the gap between rich and poor.
Even his crusade against the growth of big
government has fallen short of his rhetoric: if
Reagan has been revolutionary in purpose,
the Urban Institute study concludes, he has
been evolutionary in practice. “Where he
has turned things around has been in form
rather than substance,” says presidential
scholar James David Barber.
Hormone: But his mastery of the form has
a power of its own —and there is simply no
question that Reagan has radically altered
the nation’s political dialogue. That he is
fundamentally opposed to the idea of posi-
tive government —the notion that if there is
a perceived national problem, the federal
government should have some response—is
obvious. But Reagan and his men saw that
federal tax revenues, rising constantly
through the inflationary 19705, were the
growth hormone of big government. They
were also shrewd enough to find an anti-
Addressing a ‘Solid South’ assembly in Atlanta: ‘He personifies what America would like to be’
dote: his 1981 tax cuts, rammed through
Congress in the honeymoon glow of his
victory over Jimmy Carter, created a chron-
ic structural shortfall in government rev-
enues that has put liberals on the defensive
ever since. The Reagan deficits, in short,
have transformed the long-running liberal
debate over the ends of government —help-
ing the poor, protecting the environment,
and so on—into a conser-
vative argument over the means. And it is a
powerful irony indeed that those same defi-
cits have converted traditional Democrats
like Walter Mondale into born-again apos-
tles of fiscal responsibility.
The paradox, of course, is that Reagan has
generally operated as a deep-dyed pragma-
tist since taking office. He and his aides —
with a few conspicuous exceptions, Rea-
gan’s White House staff has been among the
best in decades —have repeatedly demon-
strated an uncanny sense of the political
moment and a ruthless willingness to cut
their losses in a crunch. The list of adminis-
tration officials who have been induced to
quit for the good of the president is,in a way,
impressive: Richard Allen, James Watt and
Anne Burford, to name a notable few, have
fallen loyally on their swords, and presiden-
tial counselor Edwin Meese 111 has utterly
vanished since his nomination as attorney
general ran into trouble. More important,
Reagan and his men have been quick to
reverse themselves on major policy blun-
ders. When the scandals at EPA revealed
their fundamental misjudgment of the pub-
lie mood on environmental protection, they
cured it by sending in a well-credentialed
Mr. Clean, William Ruckelshaus. And
when their ill-conceived gamble in Lebanon
fell tragically and brutally apart, Reagan
stunned everyone by abruptly pulling out of
the multinational peacekeeping force that
he had pressed upon the allies.
‘We Begin Bombing in Five '
Relaxing at the ranch: ‘Won’t he ever learn?’
PETE SOUZA— THE WHITE HOUSE
“My fellow Americans, I am pleased to
tell you that I’ve signed legislation that will
outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing
in five minutes.”
Ronald Reagan spoke the words two
Saturdays ago to test the microphones be-
fore taping his weekly radio speech. Just an
innocent joke, loyalists explained—but it
unequivocally bombed. By early last week
Reagan’s venture into geopolitical humor
had handed the Democrats another issue
and alarmed most of Europe. Teletekst, a
Dutch news service, commented, “Hope-
fully, the man tests his missiles more
carefully.” The Soviet news agency,
Tass, claimed that Reagan’s comments
were “unprecedentedly hostile” (although
France’s Le Matin recalled that back in
1970 Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev invit-
ed French President Georges Pompidou to
push a button at a Soviet space center —
then joked, “You’ve just destroyed Paris”).
Walter Mondale’s response was sub-
dued —on the theory that Reagan himself
had buttressed charges that he was trigger
happy. Privately, Reaganites were dis-
mayed. “Won’t he ever learn?” groaned
one aide. Late last week Reagan took a
more considered poke at the Evil Empire,
assuring Polish-Americans that the United
States does not accept the “permanent sub-
jugation of the people of Eastern Europe.”


Supporters at a July rally in Austin, Texas: Once again, an image of the president as father figure, cheerleader and commander in chief
Now he takes his record before the voters
in what will be, beyond any doubt, one of
the more significant presidential elections
of this century. The ideological contrast
between Reagan and Mondale gives the
electorate a clearer choice than any since
1 964 —and to the joy of his supporters on the
right, Reagan is no Barry Goldwater. His
immense political gifts would make him a
formidable contender against any Demo-
crat; he has the overwhelming advantages of
incumbency and a cornucopia of GOP mon-
ey; the flood tide of an economic recovery is
running powerfully in his favor. His popu-
larity in the fast-growing West and South
gives him a rock-solid regional base: by the
calculations of Prof. Walter Dean Burnham
of MIT, Reagan could wind up burying
Mondale and Ferraro in the Electoral Col-
lege by more than 300 votes. Recent polls
show that Reagan has easily recovered the
10- to 12-point lead he held before the Demo-
cratic convention—and one survey, by NBC
News, puts his current margin at a stupefy-
ing 23 points. Reagan’s muddled position on
taxes and his bomb-Russia gaffe seem to
have had no effect at all.
That immunity from all the usual laws of
politics—the Teflon factor —is the ultimate
mystery of Ronald Reagan’s success. It is
true that he has played his hand about as well
as it could be played, and it is true that the
voters are inclined to respect him for his
strengths and forgive him for his faults. But
there is something more at work here —and
as the White House inner circle fully recog-
nizes, it has much to do with the nation’s
deep-seated need to believe in itself again.
Reagan was fortunate to take office after
four failed presidencies and 16 years of na-
tional humiliation—Vietnam, Watergate,
the Arab oil embargo, Iran. America had a
colossal case of the jitters, a historic case of
self-doubt; Jimmy Carter was right about
the “national malaise, ” but woefully mistak-
en about its remedy. Reagan has found the
tonic for America. He has wrapped himself
in the symbols of patriotism, reasserted tra-
ditional values and re-evoked the slumber-
ing sense of national destiny. It smacks of
jingoistic nostalgia to some in his audience
and strikes others as wholly synthetic—but
the polls suggest that it plays wonderfully
well with the majority.
Peril: It is by no means clear, however,
that the voters are equally ready for the full-
fledged counterrevolution that some of Rea-
gan’s supporters seem to have in mind. The
major legacies of the New Deal and the
Great Society—social security, Medicare,
some minimal definition of federal responsi-
bility for the poor—are deeply woven in the
fabric of American life; conservatives will
tamper with them at their peril. The expecta-
tion that government will act when things go
wrong is still alive, and Reagan is perhaps
vulnerable to the criticism that, in a period
when many Americans believe the nation’s
economic future is on the line, he has done
little to assuage their forebodings.
Yet he has already earned a respectable
niche in the pantheon of presidents who
have succeeded in their time. According to
political scientist Thomas E. Cronin, Rea-
gan even now ranks among the top 20 presi-
dents, primarily because of his great skill as
“a morale builder and a renewer of the
faith.” Whether he will rise higher, of

Deaver and Baker: Relying heavily on aides
course, is a question history will decide:
great presidents make their mark by manag-
ing true national crises, and Cronin does not
believe that history will record Reagan’s
campaign to reduce the role of government
as the overriding moral imperative of the
1980 s. But that is Ronald Reagan’s self-
appointed mission—and that is the issue the
voters will ultimately decide.

It was a tough reading of the 1945 Yalta
Agreement and the 1975 Helsinki accords,
which set the rules for East-West accom-
modation in Europe. But it offered no more
than the moral support America has of-
fered to past Hungarian and Czech free-
dom movements.
Dozing: Before Reagan left the ranch,
senior adviser Michael Deaver handed the
Democrats another freebie, admitting that
the president sometimes dozes off during
boring cabinet meetings. And just a few
weeks ago Nancy Reagan had to help her
husband frame an answer to a question on
arms control during a vacation photo ses-
sion. As the Mondale camp sees it, such
incidents may reinforce what it hopes will
be this year’s sleeper issue: whether Rea-
gan, at 73, is too old for a second term.


IK TRUE BUIITY OF A MA/nA K THAI
Up, down or turned

the multipurpose
comfort in Mazda’s
new E-Series
Wagon* is first

Today’s life-styles have
redefined comfort in recreational
vehicles. Not necessarily more, but
with the versatility to keep
you awake and alert after long
hours behind the wheel. Or
completely refreshed after a night
under the stars.
Multi-use capability that Mazda
realized could only be satisfied by
careful attention to
engineering detail.
Precisely the approach we
took in designing first class
comfort into the new E-Series
Wagon.
Comfort begins down under.
Since ride comfort and good
handling start with the suspension,
Mazda went straight to the bottom
of the matter. The key up front was
wishbone-type suspension with
torsion bar spring. A configuration
similar to that found in sports cars.


ITS AIMS BOTH! THAN IT HAS 10 BE.
N
Its excellent grip and feel for the
road are right for the kind of
demanding driving required of a
recreational vehicle. And when
compared to the strut-type
suspension, the wishbone’s
compactness assures plenty of
roominess inside.
Mazda also chose a rear
suspension with a keen eye on
interior room. A long taper leaf
spring with inserted interleaf was
employed for its space-saving
advantage and smooth ride.
More to it than meets the seat.
Mazda recognized that true
comfort is as dependent on plush
seating as it is on a sure ride.
Whatever the road surface,
driving should be a pleasure and
not a chore. In keeping with this
philosophy, Mazda employed
torsion bars instead of coil
springs for an almost 2kg
reduction in unsprung weight at
each wheel. Along with directional
compliant rubber bushings, this
lighter load assures the smooth,
comforting ride today’s'recreational
vehicle driver is looking for.
Comfortably engineered.
For the new E-Series Wagon
to really stand out in multi-use
comfort, Mazda knew there was
no substitute for careful attention
to engineering detail. Mazda’s
approach took the form of a
unique blend of “active” and
“passive” comfort.
Active comfort can be defined
as those “hardware” oriented
elements that particularly relate to
driving. The powerfully spirited, yet
quiet 1.8-liter engine, highly
responsive rack and pinion steering
and a finely tuned suspension that
guarantees top handling are all
factors that actively contribute to a
positive experience at the wheel.
On the “softer” side, passive
comfort addresses traits more

commonly associated with
recreational vehicle accommodation.
Whether it’s a quick nap or a good
night’s sleep, all eight seats quickly
fold down flat for a spacious rest
area. Or, for an unusual element
of versatility, the seating position
can be reversed-to face each other.
Annoying wind noise has been
hushed by the aerodynamically
flush surface. And when joined with
the functional cluster switches,
storage compartments under the
side step and dual air conditioner/
heater with additional rear control
panel, the new E Series offers a
superior level of comfort.
Mazda’s better way.
Quality is integral to the new
E-Series Wagon just as it is to every
Mazda. Finely tuned for today’s
active life-styles, Mazda’s unerring
eye for engineering detail has
discovered a better way to
recreational vehicle accommodation.
Further proof that at Mazda, we
always strive to build cars better
than they have to be.

The View From Abroad
Political experts overseas assess Reagan’s record.
Searching for debris after the Soviets shot down a Korean jetliner: Is Reagan too provocative?
TOSHIO SAKAI
How is Ronald Reagan viewed outside his
own country? As he sailed triumphantly to-
ward renomination at the Republican Party
convention in Dallas this week, there were no
global opinion polls to measure his popular-
ity. Instead, Newsweek asked an unscien-
tific but representative sampling of political
specialists around the world to evaluate his
first term as president. Excerpts from their
replies:
Michael Howard, Regius professor of mod-
ern history, Oxford:
‘ ‘There are many aspects of his presidency
for which he deserves credit, especially if you
look at what he has done—and not done. His
handling of foreign policy has been very
much wiser than he’s been given credit for.
He has a great capacity, if necessary, to do
nothing—to walk away from an insoluble
problem. That is an asset his predecessor did
not possess.”
Lorenzo Meyer, international-relations spe-
cialist, El Colegiode Mexico, Mexico City:
“What worries us is the insistence [of
Reagan and his aides] that they are in the
right, politically and morally, and that they
have an obligation to impose their views on
us. They have neither the sensibility nor the
inclination to understand another point of
view. That is a major step backward.”
Gianni Bonvicini, deputy director, Institute
of International Affairs, Rome:
“Apart from the question of leadership, I
don’t see any great change [from the Carter
years]. What has been lacking for many
years is a fundamental, credible strategy to
try to solve the main international problems.
The Reagan administration has a reactive
policy, not bringing in any new ideas. He is a
very provincial president.”
Seizaburo Sato, professor of political science,
University of Tokyo:
“It’s very nice to see the United States
recovering its military strength. That’s an
absolute precondition for the security of
the world. But, at least at the early stages,
some of the leading officials, including
Reagan himself, were unnecessarily pro-
vocative toward the Soviet Union. We
need a strong United States —but we
should also make it very clear that we
don’t want to wipe the Soviets off the face
of the earth.”
Adm. Sir James Eberle, director of the Royal
Institute of In ternational Affairs, London:
[Reagan has raised] two fundamental
problems in the security field. One is that the
strategy of the [Western] alliance appears,
because of the accent on nuclear weapons, to
be out of sympathy with the aspirations of
Europe. Europeans want to be defended, but
they don’t want to be defended to death. The
other problem is the idea that reduction in
arms can only [be achieved by] negotiating
from a position of strength. The paradox
that in order to reduce arms you have to
increase them is fundamentally wrong.”
Alfred Grosser, professor of international re-
lations at the Institut des Sciences Politiques
in Paris and columnist forLe Monde:
“President Reagan has con-
tinued the totally selfish fiscal
and monetary policies that
Richard Nixon began in 1969.
Until then, American presi-
dents thought that political
solidarity required them to con-
sider Europe’s economic inter-
ests. Reagan has been just as
selfish, even though United
States interest rates are also a
European domestic affair.”
Norbert Walter, professor of
economics, the Institute for
World Economics, Kiel, West
Germany:
“[Reagan’s] tax policies are
fully in line with supply-side
philosophy: they have left citi-
zens and businesses with more
money to spend. But there’s
another side to the coin. Rea-
gan has not reduced public ex-
penditures as a percentage of
GNP. He has not significantly
reduced social-welfare pay-
ments and has boosted military spending
far beyond what is appropriate in peace-
time. That money could be used more
productively.”
Shlomo Slonim, professor of American stud-
ies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem:
“He has managed to put the U.S. econo-
my on an even keel. That’s a great feat.
Could we look on with equanimity if the
United States was going down in economic
terms? At the same time, Reagan has been a
powerful president in helping to protect the
Middle East from Soviet encroachment. He
made a mistake in Lebanon and was hit with
a terrible calamity. But from an Israeli view-
point, he has been a good president.”
Saburo Okita, economist and former Japa-
nese foreign minister:
“The U.S. economy seems to be in nice
shape. Unemployment is lower, prices are
relatively stable and the economy is expand-
ing at a very high rate. The strong dollar has
enabled other countries to export more to
the United States, including some debtor
countries like Mexico and Brazil. There is
some apprehension about the fact that the
current U.S. prosperity is supported by very
substantial deficits in both budget and
trade. People are concerned because no one
can go on borrowing indefinitely.”
Serge July, political columnist and editor in
chief of the Paris daily Liberation:
“Reagan’s rearmament program is drug-
ging the American economy and only seems
to be an escape from the harder question of
deciding what he really wants with the Sovi-
ets. He has made a lot of noise on the
international scene, but finally he’s done
nothing except overarm America. He has
been lucky—Carter wasn’t —and that
makes an enormous difference.”


Furor Over Ferraro Finances
Mondale’s embattled running mate hopes full disclosure will limit the damage.
First came the ecstasy—the wave of eu-
phoria and emotion that engulfed the
first woman ever nominated by a major
party for vice president. The agony arrived
last week, as Geraldine Ferraro desperately
struggled to prepare answers to dozens of
questions about her tangled finances and
those of her husband, New York real-estate
entrepreneur John Zaccaro. By Friday, Fer-
raro was virtually the prisoner of Park Ave-
nue, as she and Zaccaro spent nine
hours going over her financial-dis-
closure statement and tax returns
with Mondale campaign treasurer
Michael Berman andffier new ac-
countants at the offices of Arthur
Young, Inc. At home in Forest
Hills early Saturday morning, the
strain showed. Confronted with a
magazine article contending that
Zaccaro once had briefly been the
landlord for an underworld figure,
an angry Ferraro snapped, “It’s
lovely having an Italian name, isn’t
it? I’m absolutely outraged.”
Geraldine Ferraro was under-
going one of the worst ordeals
of a media age—trial by disclosure.
And the flow of events was run-
ning against her. Both she and
Walter Mondale were hoping that
an exhaustive disclosure this
week of the family’s full tax re-
turns back to 1978 would stem the
tide. But Newsweek has learned
that the disclosures will reveal
serious new problems: Ferraro
and Zaccaro inadvertently under-
paid their joint 1978 income taxes
and, according to one Mondale
campaign aide, could end up owing
the IRS as much as $250,000 —
including interest and penalties.
Other campaign aides put the fig-
ure at $60,000 to $lOO,OOO. In
addition, the disclosures will also
detail Zaccaro’s participation in a
complicated real-estate deal that
raises new questions about the al-
ready controversial financing of
Ferraro’s first congressional campaign.
‘Proud’: Ferraro had handed the Republi-
cans a campaign issue that may quiet talk
about the “sleaze factor” in the Reagan
administration. Some of Ferraro’s strongest
champions among women now worry that
her precedent-shattering career could set
other precedents that would not make them
as proud. As he waited for the financial
disclosures, Mondale was reduced to declar-
ing, “I’m proud of Geraldine Ferraro.” For
the voters, the controversy may also call into
question—fairly or not —Mondale’s judg-
ment in selecting Ferraro. Although Mon-
dale aides had known about most —but not
all—of Ferraro’s problems, no one had ex-
pected a media circus that could oversha-
dow the GOP convention.
The Democrats’ Second Family brought
on much of the furor themselves with an
all-too-public marital confrontation over
whether Zaccaro would release his tax re-

turns. Along with the detailed financial-
disclosure statement mandated by law, Fer-
raro had promised to provide the family’s
tax returns (they had filed separately since
1979) by Aug. 20. Then, little more than a
week ago, Zaccaro reneged on the deal.
According to Ferraro, her husband said,
“Gerry, I’m not going to tell you how to run
the country, you’re not going to tell me how
to run my business.” Reflecting a flippant
campaign style she herself has called “disas-
trous,” Ferraro then used an ethnic stereo-
type to explain Zaccaro’s turnabout: “If
you’ve ever been married to Italian men, you
know what it’s like.” In the end, Zaccaro
chose full disclosure over privacy, announc-
ing that he would release his own tax returns
since 1979 this week. But by the time he
changed his mind, the Ferraro family fi-
nances had become the campaign issue that
refused to die.
Many of Ferraro’s current problems date
back to the funding of her first
House campaign—a bitter and ex-
pensive 1978 primary fight con-
ducted during a New York news-
paper strike. The day before she
won the primary, the FEC ques-
tioned the legality of funds bor-
rowed from her family—a sum
that eventually totaled $llO,OOO
from Zaccaro. Just four months
earlier, at the start of her cam-
paign, Ferraro had purchased with
a down payment of $25,000 a half
interest in a commercial building
on the fringes of Little Italy. Her
copurchaser was Manny Lerman,
a multimillionaire real-estate in-
vestor who had an ongoing busi-
ness relationship with Zaccaro.
Forced by the FEC’s inquiry to
raise cash quickly, Ferraro sold her
half of the building to Lerman,
who claimed that it had almost
doubled in value. It was the kind of
real-estate deal of which dreams
are made—Ferraro apparently
made a $ 137,500 profit in just four
months, Mondale sources say.
Gains: It is this transaction that
is now causing Ferraro and Zac-
caro tax problems. According to
Mondale aides, Ferraro’s former
accountant erroneously computed
the capital-gains tax —and based
the return on a profit of $75,000,
not $137,500. The 1978 underpay-
ment to the IRS was only recently
discovered as the Arthur Young
firm helped her prepare her finan-
cial-disclosure form. With penal-
ties and interest, Mondale aides variously
estimate that the error could cost Ferraro
from $60,000 to s2so,ooo—depending on
the outcome of the inevitable arguments
between her accountants and the IRS.
There is one more twist to the tale of the
Little Italy property. “John and Geraldine
never wanted to sell that piece of land,” said
Murry Kalik, the attorney who had handled
the sale from Ferraro to Lerman. “Geral-
dine was forced to let it go in order to get
money.” Newsweek has learned that in


early 1979 John Zaccaro him-
self bought back the half inter-
est in the same building from
Lerman. And this time there
was no profit or appreciation on
the deal: Zaccaro paid Lerman
the same amount Ferraro had
received four months earlier.
These elaborate transactions
could be interpreted as a device
to allow Zaccaro to channel
money to his wife’s campaign in
spite of federal spending limits.
The Mondale campaign was
particularly exasperated to
learn the full details of the daisy
chain of transactions among
Ferraro, Lerman and Zaccaro.
“It was a stupid, unnecessary
round robin,” said one Mon-
dale aide. It would not have
been illegal for Zaccaro to pur-
chase the half interest in the
property directly from Fer-
raro —though questions might
have been raised about her large
profit. Curiously enough, Mon-
dale lawyers say Ferraro herself
only recently learned that her
husband had bought her half
interest from Lerman. As a re-
sult, the second purchase was
never mentioned during the
Mondale campaign’s lengthy
inspection of Ferraro’s finances before her
selection as his running mate.
Ferraro has built her political persona
around the conceit that she’s just a typical
Queens housewife—“l guess most people do
what I do, buy things on sale,” she said
during a recent well-photographed shop-
ping expedition. But most housewives in
Queens do not have husbands able to make
legal or illegal $ 110,000 loans before crucial
primaries. True, the financial disclosures
this week will show that Zaccaro’s income is
not nearly as high as many theorized —and,
contrary to speculation, he has paid substan-
tial taxes in the last three years. But there are
still questions surrounding Zaccaro’s illegal
1978 campaign loans and the mild $750 fine
the FEC levied in 1979.
Spouses: In truth, the story of
the loans is partly an indictment
of the FEC and the confusing
campaign laws. Ferraro and
Zaccaro claim to have inno-
cently believed that loans from
family members were not cov-
ered by the $l,OOO ceiling on
contributions. Until 1976,
there was no limit on contribu-
tions from spouses —and in
1978 the issue was still a bit
murky. In their defense to the
FEC, the Ferraro campaign ar-
gued that David Stein, a former
commission attorney, had told
them the loans would be legal.
Stein now claims he said other-
wise—but former campaign
Mondale’s unexpected problem: ‘This isn’t the preferred way of establishing your credibility’
treasurer David Blanksteen disputes this.
When the FEC first discussed the Ferraro
case in May 1979, several commissioners
questioned whether bad legal advice was an
acceptable defense. But the mood was mark-
edly different five months later, when the
commission met to resolve the Ferraro mat-
ter. Cynics might note that in the interim
Ferraro had emerged as a particular favorite
of House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill.
In any case, the commission approved a
$750 settlement with the only objections
coming from a Republican.
Before they selected Ferraro, the Mon-
dale high command knew that her question-
able use of a loophole on her congressional
disclosure forms might cause problems. But
they believed she made an honest judgment,
With John and daughter Laura: The Democrats’ Second Family
SONIA MOSKOWITZ
or misjudgment, in claiming that she had no
knowledge and derived no benefit from Zac-
caro’s real-estate business —and therefore
thought it permissible to shield her hus-
band’s holdings from public scrutiny. At
best, Ferraro’s case was weak, since she
admits owning a share of stock in and was
listed as secretary-treasurer of one of her
husband’s companies, P. Zaccaro Co.
Shares: But it now turns out that in a 1983
filing with the State of New York, Ferraro
stated that she was the firm’s vice president.
More damaging was the revelation that
there were only two shares in the company:
she owns one of them. Since 1979 Ferraro
has claimed on her congressional disclosure
forms that her stock was worth between
$5,000 and $15,000. That would mean that
P. Zaccaro Co. —a property-
management firm—was valued
at a maximum of $30,000.
While that might seem implau-
sible, it is quite conceivable that
as a service firm, P. Zaccaro
may have little tangible assets.
Given all the controversy, it
was perhaps inevitable that
there would be some revelation
tenuously linking Zaccaro with
the underworld. New York
magazine revealed that another
family firm —Frajo Associates,
run by Zaccaro’s father —had
from 1963 to 1971 been the
landlord for Aniello Della-
croce, reputed to be an under-
boss of the Gambinocrimefam

ily. Around the time of his father’s death in
1971, Zaccaro sold the tenement that was
Dellacroce’s address in Little Italy. Real-
estate records show that Ferraro was the
attorney for the buyers in the transaction.
Responding to the article, Ferraro said she
was livid “that anyone should stoop so low as
to imply that my husband has any sort of
connection with organized crime. ”
Politically, it is still difficult to assess
whether the summer squall buffeting Fer-
raro will turn into a full-fledged hurricane.
Despite the hoopla surrounding her candi-
dacy, voters are still forming an impression
of her character and capability. Backing
away from the pledge to release her hus-
band’s tax returns could be seen as a sign of
weakness —with the equation reading, “If
she can’t negotiate with her husband, how
can she handle the Russians?” Most voters
still don’t understand the questions swirling
around the Ferraro family finances. But as a
leading Democratic polltaker put it, “This
isn’t the preferred way of establishing your
credibility.” Although a four-day campaign
swing was marred by the Zaccaro tax flap,
Ferraro remains a potent political drawing
card: 17,000 people turned out to greet her at
Seattle’s Pike Street Market.
Frosty Relations: Some Mondale aides
hope that last week’s ordeal may have giv-
en Ferraro a much needed infusion of hu-
mility. Two weeks ago Mondale was seeth-
ing when Ferraro balked at taking on a
rigorous August campaign schedule. Even
worse, Ferraro never told Mondale that
her husband was objecting to releasing his
tax returns. Instead, after the Ferraro press
conference, Mondale learned about the
problem from campaign manager Jim
Johnson. Relations between the two cam-
paigns have grown frosty, with Ferraro
and her aides resisting ideas generated by
the Mondale camp as if her independence
as a woman were at stake. A top Mondale
adviser was so puzzled by the way Ferraro
bristled at suggestions that he turned to
several successful woman politicians for
insight. What Ferraro fails to recognize,
said a senior Mondale aide, “is, if she were
a man, we’d be a lot meaner.”
Geraldine Ferraro’s current problems
are rooted in the novelty of her situation —
she is the first member of a genuine two-
income family to run for national office in
the era of full disclosure. But more than 30
years ago, another vice presidential candi-
date survived a far worse grilling over his
personal finances. He saved himself with a
memorable television address about his av-
erage family—and his cocker spaniel
named Checkers. Ferraro and Richard Nix-
on are, of course, polar opposites. But she,
too, may have to make a public appeal to
dispel the whiff of scandal.

De Lorean: Not Guilty
The ex-auto magnate beats the government’s sting.
De Lorean with his attorneys: ‘Praise the Lord’ —and pass the shrimp and crabmeat
John Z. De Lorean stared intently at the
expressionless jurors as the court clerk
read the verdict. “We the guilty,” she
stumbled —-then corrected herself. “We the
jury in the above entitled action find the
defendant, John Z. De Lorean, not guilty as
charged in count one. . .’’One after another,
she rolled off the cocaine-conspiracy counts
that could have put De Lorean in prison for
67 years: not guilty on all eight. When she
had finished, De Lorean stood bolt upright.
“Praise the Lord,” he said. Then he walked
to his wife, actress-model Cristina Ferrare,
who was weeping in the arms of her mother,
and knelt to embrace the two women. As De
Lorean moved off to hug each of his three
lawyers, Cristina raced from the courtroom
to phone their children. “I’m so happy!” she
told them. “We won!”
After a 22-week trial that produced
18,000 transcript pages of testimony, De
Lorean had indeed won —per-
haps even thrashed the govern-
ment. Though the jury was out
for seven days, it actually deliber-
ated for only about 29 hours and
needed just one ballot to acquit
the 59-year-old businessman. In
doing so, the jury did more than
clear De Lorean of charges that
he conspired to sell $24 million in
Colombian cocaine as a desper-
ate measure to bail out his bank-
rupt automobile company. It
also effectively challenged the
U.S. Justice Department’s Ab-
scam-style “sting” operations.
De Lorean’s lead lawyer, How-
ard Weitzman, called it an “at-
tempt to send a message. . . that the type of
conduct involved in the investigation, ar-
rest, indictment and prosecution. ..ofJohn
De Lorean will not be tolerated again.”
Unlike Weitzman, the government law-
yers had little left to say. Chief prosecutor
James Walsh Jr., who had described De
Lorean as “the face of greed, the face of evil”
during his summation, pronounced himself
“shocked and surprised” by the verdict and
quickly left the courtroom. U.S. Attorney
Robert Bonner praised the government ef-
fort, noting that it had resulted in con-
victions of two people—William Morgan
Hetrick and Stephen Lee Arrington.
Sloppy: But when thejurors emerged from
a lengthy, post-verdict get-together with De
Lorean and his defense team, they made it
even clearer that the government had failed
miserably. They explained that about half
the jury voted not guilty because the pros-
Videotaped arrest: ‘Would you buy a used car from me?'


ecution failed to prove its case. Those jurors
found the government’s conduct at times
offensive, its case often sloppy and confus-
ing. They also had trouble believing the star
prosecution witness, James Hoffman, a con-
victed felon who admitted previous perju-
ry—and who, the defense revealed, had de-
manded 10 percent of any De Lorean assets
seized as a result of the sting operation.
Other jurors thought De Lorean had com-
mitted the crimes, but believed he was legal-
ly blameless because the government had
entrapped him. Adhering to the judge’s de-
tailed instruction on entrapment, they con-
cluded that the government had conceived
the drug-smuggling deal and that its agents
had lured De Lorean into criminal acts. The
differing views amounted to the same ver-
dict —not guilty—and the jurors celebrated
their surprisingly easy unanimity by sending
out for a tray of shrimp and crabmeat.
Bom Again: Eight jurors agreed to talk to
the press about the trial and their delibera-
tions. (Four refused because TV camera
crews had chased them in the parking garage
after each day’s deliberations.) One juror
explained that the verdict was not based on
“personal feelings about the correctness of
the operation.” But others echoed Weitz-
man’s opinion that the judgment was an
indictment of government conduct. One ju-
ror called government sting operations “a
threat to my wife and children,” adding,
“The way the government agents operated
in this case was not appropriate, and I look
forward to the future favorable impact of
this [verdict] on the country.”
What impact it will have on the future of
John De Lorean is not yet clear. The latest
model De Lorean, once noted for his hard-
nosed business practices and jet-set life-
style, is a born-again Christian and devoted
family man, and his first public utterances
were entirely in keeping. “Obviously I have
to thank God ... as a Christian I have no
animosity, no grudges against any of these
people.” Still, even De Lorean appears to
recognize that he may be irrevocably tar-
nished —especially by the widely publicized
government tapes that seemed to show him
eager to consider a cocaine deal. Despite
dreams of someday returning to the auto-
mobile business, De Lorean asked grimly,
“Would you buy a used car from me?”
Selling used cars—or himself —may be
the least of De Lorean’s problems. Most of
his assets are tied up in a creditors’ suit
alleging that De Lorean siphoned off mil-
lions from his automobile company into
foreign bank accounts. In addition, a federal
grand jury in Detroit is investigating his
finances for possible violations of wire-,
mail- and tax-fraud laws. De Lorean has
denied any wrongdoing. But in the end, last
week’s vindication may prove to be only a
brief respite for the beleaguered De Lorean.

Agent Orange: No
Link to Birth Defects?
Vietnam veterans have long feared that
exposure to Agent Orange, used to destroy
jungle growth in Southeast Asia, had also
reduced their chances of fathering normal
children. That claim was part of a $lBO
million settlement reached last May be-
tween Vietnam vets and seven chemical
manufacturers. But last week, after a four-
year, $2.8 million study, the Centers for
Disease Control reported that they had
found no significant link between Agent
Orange and birth defects in children. Men
who thought they were exposed had a slight-
ly higher chance of siring children with spina
bifida, cleft palates or certain tumors. But
CDC researchers said they could not con-
clude that the two were related.
Veterans’ groups criticized the study—
based on nearly 8,000 Atlanta-area chil-
dren —as incomplete. “The CDC study did
not go far enough in allaying the fears
of an extremely apprehensive group of peo-
ple,” said Frank McCarthy, president of
Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims,
Inc. Sen. Alan Cranston, ranking Democrat
on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee,
hailed the findings as “good news” but asked
for a review of the CDC study. CDC re-
searchers will continue to investigate.
But they noted that theirs is the third
study to reach the same conclusion.
‘An Error in Judgment'
Mark O. Hatfield at first tried to deny that he had done
anything wrong. But with both the Justice Department and the
Senate Ethics Committee investigating payments made to his
wife, Antoinette, by a Greek businessman, the Republican sena-
tor last week confessed to ‘‘an error in judgment. ” In an emotional
press conference in Oregon with his wife at his side, Hatfield
conceded, “My insensitivity to the appearance of impropriety
was a mistake.” But he denied that the $55,000 in payments (he
had earlier admitted to $40,000) had anything to do with
his active support of a multibillion-dollar trans-African
pipeline proposed by the same businesssman, Basil Tsakos.
“I swear before God almighty neither one of us [has] done
anything unethical or illegal, ” said Hatfield.
His statement, coupled with his wife’s donation of the
$55,000 to the local Shriners Hospital for Crippled Chil-
dren, may help the senator in what could be a tough re-
election fight. But it did not quiet the political storm in
Washington. Columnist Jack Anderson, who originally
reported the payments, obtained a transcript of congres-
sional testimony in which two former Tsakos employees—
secretary Margaret Stocker and attorney Marilyn Man-
gan—insisted that Antoinette Hatfield, a Washington
real-estate agent, did no work for the money. Stocker
testified that she thought the money was meant as a quid
pro quo for Hatfield’s backing of the pipeline, and Mangan
dismissed Hatfield’s explanation as “a total fabrication.”
At the Portland press conference, Antoinette Hatfield
finally chose to speak for herself. She detailed a long list of
real-estate services tendered to the Tsakos family and said,
“I earned all the fees I was paid.” During the coming weeks,
Justice Department investigators will try to determine whether
Tsakos was really paying Antoinette Hatfield—or, as Stocker
and Mangan charged, the senator. If the money was meant for
Hatfield, he and Tsakos could be charged under the federal
bribery, illegal-gratuities or conflict-of-interest statutes. Mean-
while, Hatfield will have to campaign under a cloud—and hope
that his powerful political organization, his well-established
record of integrity and his entrenched position in Oregon’s
moderate mainstream will be enough to defeat his Democratic
opponent, state Sen. Margie Hendriksen.

America Meets Its Heroes
ROBERT MAASS—PHOTOREPORTERS
Gold medalist Gaines, members of the water-polo team in New York’s ‘Canyon of Heroes’: The biggest ticker-tape parade ever
KAREN LEFT— AP
Even after 180 hours of television cover-
age, millions of Americans wanted to
see their Olympic heroes, as the TV people
say it, “up close and personal.” And millions
did —from Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who
were made honorary members of the team at
a Los Angeles breakfast, to the throngs of
ordinary folk who turned out to cheer the
Olympians on a cross-country triumphal
With Reagan: An honorary team member
JAMES D. WILSON —Newsweek
tour through Washington, New York, Or-
lando and Dallas. The athletes seemed to
share the enthusiasm, often turning their
own Instamatics on the camera-clicking
fans. A parade up Broadway capped the
victory tour as 2 million Big Apple specta-
tors showered the team with ticker tape and
huzzahs. “The people of New York are in-
credible,” bubbled supergymnast Mary Lou
Retton. “I mean, incredible. ”
The feeling was mutual. In Los Angeles
the 4-foot-10 Retton got a bear hug from the
president after she slipped the team jacket on
his shoulders (“Can she reach you?” joked
Nancy). Then Reagan told the athletes:
“You gave us something to be unified
around and cheer for together.” In Wash-
ington a crowd 0f30,000 lined Pennsylvania
Avenue near the Capitol, ignoring rain to
hail the heroes and snatch their autographs.
But the main event was the biggest ever
ticker-tape parade through lower Manhat-
tan’s “Canyon of Heroes.” But the celebra-
tion was marred by a jarring mishap. One
enthusiastic cluster perched on a construc-
tion scaffold for a better view—and tumbled
it down on the crowd below, injuring 100
spectators, two of them seriously. It was the
second jarring incident in an otherwise eu-
phoric week. Earlier a bomb hidden on a bus
belonging to Turkey’s Olympic team turned
out to have been planted by the very Los
Angeles policeman who had fearlessly re-
moved it. Caught up in the Olympic after-
glow, officer James Pearson apparently had
staged the bomb scare so that he, too, could
be thought a hero.

I miss you already.
You’re going to miss something

WORLD AFFAIRS
The Minesweepers Move In
An allied flotilla searches the Red Sea for the mines that are damaging ships.
The Oceanic Energy on the Red Sea: A delicate mission to deal with ‘mindless , indiscriminate terrorism ’
After the slaughter at the U.S. and
French embassies in Beirut, no one
expected to see a Western “multinational
peacekeeping force” in the Middle East for
a long time to come. But last week the allies
were back in action: a flotilla entered the
Suez Canal with the British supply ship Oil
Endeavor at the lead, followed close on by
the British mine hunters Kirkliston, Gavin-
ton, Bossington and Brinton. Next came the
French minesweeper Cantho. One day
later, the USS Shreveport steamed in carry-
ing four RH-53D Sea Stallion minesweep-
ing helicopters and about 200 American
servicemen. The armada’s mission: to
sweep up the mysterious mines that have
been damaging merchant ships in the Gulf
of Suez and the Red Sea.
The governments that launched the ships
had to navigate gingerly around another
mine field, the diplomatic and political
troubles in the region. Western govern-
ments stressed that the Egyptians and Saudi
Arabians were in charge of the maneuvers
and that they were only there to provide
technical help. But Teheran and Moscow
still denounced the operation as a return of
the imperialists, an accusation that could
well fuel more radicalism in the region. At
the same time, the allies faced the awkward
problem of trying to decide whether it was
even worthwhile to attempt to assign blame
for the explosions. Even if it could be proved
that the most likely suspects, Iran or Libya,
had laid the mines, no one was eager for a
nasty showdown with either government.
Said a U.S. official: “It’s the usual dilemma
you face when you try to deal with this kind
of mindless, indiscriminate terrorism.”
Who’s in Charge? The most immediate
challenge was the obvious one: to find the
mines before they did any more damage.
Just before and after the fleet pulled in, two
explosions —the 17th and 18th in recent
weeks —reportedly damaged Soviet and
Cypriot ships in the area. But before the
minesweepers could get to work, they had
to settle on a politically acceptable com-
mand structure. A committee was formed
under the leadership of a senior Egyptian
officer, and the duties were divided among
the patrolling ships. The five British vessels
went to the Adabiya Naval Base near Suez,
while the Shreveport headed south to the
vulnerable Ras Shukheir area that includes
many oil rigs and the Egyptian ports of
Hurghada and Safaga. Three French ships
headed farther south to the Saudi coast.
As the fleet was moving in, the United
States was making a special, separate effort
to help Saudi Arabia sweep mines in its
waters. The Saudis asked for help after a
Polish freighter hit a mine in the Red Sea
two weeks ago. The Harkness, an American
oceanographic-research ship, was already
serving as a base for 120 U.S. crewmen in
the area. But after the Saudi request, Wash-
ington dispatched the La Salle, the com-
mand ship of the Middle East Force, as well
as three extra helicopters. The choppers,
operating in concert with the La Salle, will
concentrate on sweeping out the two key
ports of Jidda and Yanbu. They may then
move on to mine-clearing operations in the
southern reaches of the Red Sea, where
most of the explosions have taken place.
There were persistent reports that a Sovi-
et minesweeper was operating on its own
out of the Russian base in Aden at the Bab el
Mandeb, the southern gate to the Red Sea.
At least four Eastern-bloc ships have been
damaged by the explosions, and the Soviets
may well be as anxious as the Western pow-
ers were to ensure that the vital Middle

Eastern sea lanes were cleared for passage.
Even so, the Kremlin continued to de-
nounce the minesweeping operation as a
power play designed to turn the Red Sea
into an “American lake.”
Some Egyptian officials thought that
Libya was responsible for the sabotage.
They citeH the travels of a Libyan freight-
er, the Ghada, which made a mysterious
trip through the Suez Canal, down the Red
Sea and back only days before the first
mine explosion. The government of
Muammar Kaddafi has denied the connec-
tion to the explosions. But Egyptian suspi-
cions persist; some officials in Cairo say
that Kaddafi has a tendency to send out
peace messages precisely when he is trying
to cover up warlike moves.
Tit for Tat: The suspicions of Iranian
involvement were also based on bits of
circumstantial evidence. The only group
that has claimed responsibility for the min-
ing was one known as Islamic Jihad, a
shadowy organization that says it is devot-
ed to the Ayatollah Khomeini. Last week
the group boasted that it would plant more
mines. Some Iranian leaders have praised
the sabotage operation, but Khomeini
himself has denounced it and has denied
involvement. Egyptian officials are as dis-
trustful of Iran’s disclaimer as they are of
Libya’s. Cairo is closely monitoring all
ships passing through the canal—and they
have so far stopped and searched at least
10 ships, including six Iranian vessels. In
retaliation, Iran last week threat-
ened to search Egyptian ships in
the Strait of Hormuz.
None of the allies had much taste
for the idea of sanctions against
whichever country may be planting
the explosives. The United States
found itself in a particular quandary
since it had recently indulged in a bit
of its own mining in Nicaraguan
harbors. But the main question was
what kind of action would be effec-
tive. “There are a variety of things
you could do to Libya,” said Wil-
liam Quandt, a former Middle East
policymaker for Jimmy Carter’s
White House. “You could stop
buying their oil, launch an econom-
ic boycott, foment subversion and
try to knock off Kaddafi.” The
problem is that no such moves have
worked very well against foreign
adversaries in the past. “The ques-
tion,” said Quandt, “is what would
be effective in putting a stop to Kad-
dafi’s behavior—and the answer is,
‘Not much’. ”
The Reagan administration is es-
pecially wary of making any kind of
military move in an election year.
The minesweeping operation alone
is a considerable political risk for
the president. If terrorists somehow
manage to kill some of the Ameri-
can troops, that could badly unset-
tle the Reagan campaign. A more
serious problem is what might happen after
the minesweepers finish their current task.
The terrorists, whoever they are, are likely
to drop more mines into international wa-
terways in the future. Despite the best ef-
forts of the major Western powers, world
shipping may well face more uncertain-
ties —and explosions—in the years ahead.

And Now, the Other Games
Opening ceremonies in Lenin Stadium: Nothing—and everything— to do with the Olympics
Multicolored flags ringed Lenin Stadi-
um once again, and vendors outside
hawked souvenirs. Inside, stirring music
from the movie “Chariots of Fire” wafted
over the crowd. Finally, a lone Soviet run-
ner, carrying a flame, ran onto the track and
lit the torch that had burned so brightly four
years ago. But no measure of orchestrated
festivity could mask the fact that this was a
flame of defiance, and that what was hap-
pening in the stadium had nothing—and
everything—to do with the Olympics. The
Friendship ’B4 Games opened in Moscow
and other comradely cities last week, and
for the next two weeks, athletes from Po-
land, Hungary, Bulgaria and elsewhere will
try to capture the glory they never had a
chance to find in Los Angeles.
For Moscow, the Friendship Games pre-
sent more than just an opportunity to ease
the pain of the athletes who were forced to
miss the Olympics. They are a prime chance
to score some propaganda points at home
and with fellow Eastern-bloc members.
Planning for the games began soon after the
Olympic boycott was announced last spring.
And in recent weeks, the Soviets have been
busy sprucing up the facilities built for their
own 1980 Olympic Games, a proud moment
tarnished by the American-led boycott.

East Germany’s Koch: Beating the Olympians
Now the score has been evened, and resent-
ment still runs high on both sides. Said one
State Department official in Washington:
“It is evidence of the Soviets’ continuing
interest in undermining the Olympic ideal
that they would hold their own games right
in the shadow of the Olympics.”
Moscow has been careful not to bill these
games as an alternative Olympics; to do so
would violate the charter of the Internation-
al Olympic Committee, which the Soviets
don’t care to offend. Accordingly, the
Friendship Games are scheduled in far-
flung capitals and, as in an open meet, ath-
letes from any nation are free to compete.
And so, athletes from more than 40 nations
are competing, including a few Americans.
But the message remains clear. During the
Olympics, the Soviets ridiculed the quality
of competition and the staging in Los An-
geles. Now, said Pravda, the Friendship
Games will “yet again demonstrate . . . not
only sporting achievements, but also that
socialist society provides more favorable fa-
cilities for the human being’s all-around
physical and spiritual development.”
So far, however, the games have aroused
little interest outside the competing coun-
tries and drawn a disappointing turnout of
athletes. Moscow originally said that as
many as 8,000 competitors would partici-
pate. But last week officials acknowledged
that only 2,000 would attend, almost all of
them from fellow socialist countries. And
even there, enthusiasm was muted. Roma-
nia, which defied the Soviet boycott of the
Olympics, delivered another slap in the face

to Moscow by sending only its shooting
team to the Friendship Games.
The games offer a whirlwind tour of the
Soviet bloc. Only 9 of the 28 sports being
contested are being held in the Soviet Union.
The venues are scattered across eight coun-
tries. There is boxing in Cuba, gymnastics in
Bulgaria and sambo wrestling in Mongolia.
But Moscow is in firm control. Marat
Gramov, chairman of the Soviet Olympic
Committee, is presiding over the competi-
tion, and of the 267 officials monitoring the
games, only nine are from outside Russia.
Quality: Despite the relative scarcity of
participants (7,800 athletes were in Los An-
geles), the level of competition is definitely
world class. Many of the athletes would
have been favored to win Olympic medals,
and now they are getting the chance to show
why. Last Thursday in Prague, on the first
day of the games, several women track stars
bested gold-medal marks set in Los An-
geles. East Germany’s Marita Koch ran the
400 meters in 48.16 seconds, well under the
time of American gold medalist Valerie
Brisco-Hooks. Another East German,
Marlies Gohr, won the 100-meter dash with
a time of 10.95, just under the Olympic-
record time of 10.97 set just 11 days earlier
by Evelyn Ashford of the United States. In
the Prague race, Alice Brown of the United
States, who won a silver medal in L.A.,
finished sixth. East Germany’s wunderkin-
der women swimmers, paced by Ute
Geweniger, are also expected to beat many
of the best Los Angeles times.
The men should fare just as well. On
East Germany’s Geweniger: Wunderkind
SVEN SIMON
Friday in Moscow, three Soviet hammer
throwers, led by Yuri Sedykh, outdistanced
the winning L. A. mark. East German Uwe
Hohn, who holds the world record in the
javelin, topped the Olympic gold-medal
performance. Soviet pole vaulter Sergei
Bubka, weight lifter Anatoly Pisarenko,
Cuban heavyweight boxer Teofilo Steven-
son and a host of wrestlers and swimmers
ensure that the Friendship Games will
be Olympic in quality, if not in fact.
But that may not be enough for the ath-
letes who missed out on the competitive
spirit and global good will that was kindled
in Los Angeles. “No competition can re-
place being an Olympic champion,” says
Bela Karolyi, who coached the Romanian
women’s gymnastics team before defecting
to the United States in 1981 and now
coaches American medal winners Mary
Lou Retton and Julianne McNamara. The
Eastern-bloc athletes, says Karolyi, must
feel the pain of missing the Olympics, much
as the Americans did in 1980: “They have a
feeling of frustration, of losing something
very prestigious from their lives and their
athletic careers.”
Given the lingering spirit of Los Angeles,
the Soviets probably couldn’t have picked a
worse time to put on the Friendship Games.
The Olympics were a stunning success,
staged without any of the problems that the
boycotters glumly predicted. Athletes who
had worried about “tainted” medals no
longer dwell on the boycott. American
heavyweight boxing gold medalist Tyrell
Biggs, who in less contentious times would
have had to beat Teofilo Stevenson, says,
“The gold medal means a lot because that
was my goal—not to beat Cubans or Sovi-
ets. This [boycott] stuff doesn’t take away
from it one bit.” In the end, the Friendship
Games may manage similarly to soothe the
Eastern-bloc athletes, but Los Angeles is a
tough act to follow.
WILLIAM BURGER with DEBBIE SEWARD

Moscow Meets the Press
For Western reporters, getting at the news in the Soviet Union
has often meant plowing carefully through mounds of
official Tass wire copy and scrutinizing page after propagandis-
tic page of tiny, dense print in Pravda, Izvestia and other
government publications. Reading between the lines is one of the
chief methods used by Moscow-based correspondents to find
out what’s happening on their beat, but they now have a new
tool. It is used commonly in the West, but until recently it was
rarely seen in the Soviet Union. It is called a press conference.
Until the Russians shot down a Korean jetliner nearly a year
ago, Moscow had held only a few carefully controlled press
briefings. But amid the worldwide furor over the incident, Tass
announced that Nikolai Ogarkov, chief of staff of the Soviet
armed forces, would hold a press briefing. Hundreds of journal-
ists packed a modern press center that had originally been built
for the 19S0 Olympics. Suddenly, the face and voice of a man who
had rarely been seen or heard in public was being broadcast live
around the world. Ogarkov admitted that a Soviet SU-15 fighter
had shot down the 747, killing all 269 persons aboard, but he
insisted it was on a U.S. spy mission. Although his facts did not
always coincide with the American version, he offered no apolo-
gies and got his sometimes-strong case across.
The Kremlin got what it wanted: when Moscow met the press,
the world listened. Since then, the Foreign Ministry has held
dozens of brifingi —the Russians use the English term —at the
press center. They are not conducted on any regular schedule
but rather whenever the Foreign Ministry wants to make a point.
Press officers notify foreign correspondents by telephone, and
an announcement is sent out over the Tass wire. Everything is on
the record; the briefing officer may be named and anything he
says, quoted. Usually there is a short speech or a declaration of
Soviet policy followed by answers to questions submitted by
journalists on small pieces of paper. Sometimes questions are
taken directly from the floor.
The questions are not always easy. Briefing officers can select
the questions in advance from the slips of paper, but they still get
“hardballs” from the Western press. Subjects, and the media’s
interest in them, vary. A recent press conference by Aleksandr
Bessmertnykh, a senior Foreign Ministry official, on the pros-
pect for space-weaponry talks between the United States and the
Soviet Union drew a packed house. The turnout for a briefing on
Soviet efforts to provide a university education for Third World
students was markedly poorer.
Welcome: Reporters are not the only ones in attendance. Also
eager to tap new veins of information —and, like the press, take a
welcome break from the tedious task of deciphering Pravda and
Izvestia —Western diplomats like to stop by to assess their
Soviet counterparts in action. “The briefings are a more modern
and efficient way of getting Soviet ideas across,” says the press
attache at one Western embassy, “even though the substance
remains essentially the same.” They also provide most Western
reporters with their only opportunity to see top Soviet officials in
person. One-on-one interviews are rare, and they have become
even rarer since the Korean-jetliner incident a year ago. Journal-
ists say the briefings have limited value. But when the phone
rings, few of them fail to show up.

ASIA
A Stormy March
In the Philippines
As Marcos hangs onto power, Aquino haunts him —
and the chance of a showdown can only increase.
Singing choruses of “Marcos is a ter-
rorist,” thousands of demonstrators
marched through Manila while office work-
ers heaved confetti in the Philippine version
of a ticker-tape parade. The march, in pro-
test of the country’s massive foreign debt,
was one of five anti-Marcos demonstrations
last week. And it was only a prelude to the
turnout expected this week, when up to a
million Filipinos may mark the first anni-
versary of the assassination of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino. Attacks on the gov-
ernment have reached an intensity that once
would have seemed impossible. “The big-
gest difference between now and a year ago
is that the public is sympathetic and wants
to show it,” said student protest leader
Leandro Alejandro. “It’s not just the stu-
dents doing something, and not just the
middle class. Now it’s everyone.”
But if President Ferdinand Marcos was
worried about public opinion, he exhibited
very few outward signs of it. He has repeat-

edly charged that the demonstrations, what
people call the “parliament of the street,”
are infiltrated by communists. According to
his supporters, Marcos was sticking to a
strategy that amounted to “no change, no
concessions.” He would not give up his
power to rule by decree or to arrest without
charge, nor would he remove cabinet minis-
ters who had proven loyal but unpopular.
The danger was that the president’s intran-
sigence would force frustrated Filipinos to
take to the streets or join the growing ranks
of the underground communist insurgency.
Many Filipinos openly wondered whether
one man’s political survival was worth the
growing unrest that it was bound to entail.
But Marcos was determined to maintain the
calculated inflexibility that has been the
hallmark of most of his 19 years of rule. He
is an “expert at crisis management,” insist-
ed one admiring aide.
Even so, Marcos’s continuing difficulties
have set off a scramble among aides and
cronies determined to protect
their own interests. As the na-
tion sinks into its steepest
economic decline since the Jap-
anese invasion of 1941, techno-
crats have squared off against
the businessmen who are said to
have benefited hugely from the
government’s largesse. Grum-
bling has also developed in the
Army, where young colonels
seeking promotion are clamor-
ing for the retirement of gener-
als close to Marcos. There are
new signs of skittishness within
the ruling New Society Move-
ment party, with some mem-
bers joining the opposition to
attack the president’s decree
powers. At one recent party
meeting, Marcos warned that
anyone who disagreed with his
policies should “get out.”
Those tensions have intensi-
fied speculation over who will
eventually succeed Marcos.
Last year the president was
widely believed to be suffering
from systemic lupus erythema-
tosus, a chronic disease that
sometimes affects the kidneys,
Manila anti-riot police attack demonstrators:
and although he appears much stronger to-
day, his health is still a vital concern. His
most likely successor remains his strong-
willed wife, Imelda, who despite earlier
promises to relinquish all her public posts
was recently reconfirmed as governor of
Greater Manila and head of the powerful
Human Settlements Ministry. Another can-
didate is Defense Minister Juan Ponce En-
rile, who announced last May that he might
seek the presidency in 1987 should Mar-
cos—or the First Lady—decide not to run.
Although Enrile’s authority was eclipsed
last year by Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed
forces chief of staff, the general’s name has
figured prominently in the investigation of
the Aquino assassination while Enrile has
emerged untouched. Yet another dark horse
is the immensely wealthy Eduardo Co-
juangco, perhaps Marcos’s most influential
crony. Whether or not he is planning a bid
for the presidency, notes one Marcos strate-
gist, “these days Cojuangco is the ‘unseen
hand’ that everyone tends to see behind
important events.”
It is still possible, of course, that the next
president of the Philippines may come from
the ranks of the political opposition. Despite
widespread charges of ballot-box tampering
by supporters of the ruling party, opposition
candidates captured nearly a third of the
contested seats in the National Assembly


One year after Aquino’s assassination, a growing frustration drives more and more Filipinos to join the ‘parliament of the streets’
elections last May. So alarming was their
victory that Marcos reportedly considered
packing the Assembly with 80 additional
progovernment members. Last week oppo-
sition assemblymen were preparing to begin
impeachment proceedings against Marcos,
and while the move seemed certain to be
bottled up in committee, just the presenta-
tion of specific charges would be yet another
embarrassment for the president.
‘Against the Wall’: Many Filipinos fear
that if the opposition becomes too obstrep-
erous, Marcos will simply respond by reim-
posing martial law. At the moment the gov-
ernment is negotiating to obtain a $650
million standby loan from the International
Monetary Fund, and officials fear that any
move toward repression might cause the
IMF to back away. But “once Marcos has
the money, the road to a clampdown to
restore security will be clear,” declared one
source in the presidential palace. “And the
president has his back against the wall.”
The next major test for the Marcos gov-
ernment may come by the end of this month
when the commission investigating the
murder of Aquino hopes to issue its final
report. Despite the government’s conten-
tion that Aquino was killed by a lone gun-
man, many Filipinos are convinced that the
slaying was part of a military conspiracy,
possibly involving the inner circle of the
‘There Is Fear No Longer’
Aquilino Pimentel, 50, is the national
chairman of the opposition PDP-Laban
Party and a probable candidate for presi-
dent of the Philippines. In Manila last
week he talked with Newsweek’s Me-
linda Liu and Richard Vokey about
changes over the past year and the opposi-
tion ’s strategy for the future. Excerpts:
On street demonstrations: We’re be-
ginning to generate. . . support from the
“parliament of the streets.”
If we rely only on opposi-
tion numbers in the Parlia-
ment, we’ll never achieve
anything.
On the economy: Much of
the capital that has left the
country will never come
back as long as Marcos is
here. So Marcos must go—
that is the best way to solve
the economic problem.
On opposition hopes: We
will be happy if the rule of Marcos ends
by the presidential elections in 1987.
Happier if it happens sooner.
On threats of a crackdown: There are
two factors that inhibit Marcos from a
massive, nationwide crackdown. First,
President Ronald Reagan would not
want this tinhorn dictator that he sup-
ports cracking down just before the U.S.
election. Second, the IMF standby credit

is still being negotiated.
These give us something of a
breathing spell.
On the legacy of Aquino:
The fear which had para-
lyzed millions of our coun-
trymen is no longer there.
More and more people are
beginning to stand up to say
what they want and to dem-
onstrate. That’s the biggest
contribution that the death
of Ninoy Aquino gave to
our people.

acy, the armed forces might re-

heavy hand.
Mindful of the lessons of
Iran, the United States was do-
ing everything it could to prod
Marcos into adopting a more
democratic course. “We have
close relations with the Marcos
government,” insisted John C.
Monjo, deputy assistant secre-
tary of state for East Asia and
Pacific affairs, “and we also
have close relations with the
people who oppose the re-
gime.” The motives of the State
Department were clear: the
United States operates Clark
Air Base and the naval station at Subic Bay,
two huge and almost irreplaceable military
bases. And to some observers, a smell of
decay seemed to hang over the Marcos gov-
ernment. “Manila now has a tenuous politi-
cal situation, a dire economic situation and
an insurgency situation that is the worst of
all because it is insoluble,” said one foreign
diplomat in the capital. “We are 5 to 10
years off from the possible downfall of a
regime.” Marcos is a proven survivor. But
as he hangs on to power in the face of
growing public anger, the possibility of a
moderate political solution grows more re-
mote, and the chances of a brutal showdown
can only increase.
HARRY ANDERSON with MELINDA LIU and
RICHARD VOKEY in Manila
A ‘Manchurian Candidate’
The late Benigno Aquino once called him “the Manchurian
candidate,” a double reference to his part-Chinese ancestry and
his reputation as a shadowy power broker of Malacanang Palace.
To friends and family he is simply “Danding,” a trusted friend of
President Ferdinand Marcos. He virtually controls the Philip-
pine coconut industry as well as the country’s largest multina-
tional company, San Miguel Corp. But there’s more. Eduardo M.
Cojuangco Jr. may also be the leading dark-horse candidate for
the Philippine presidency should Marcos slip from the scene.
In a year of unrelenting crises for all those in Marcos’s inner
circle, Cojuangco (pronounced Co-whang-co ), the 48-year-old
scion of a wealthy Luzon sugar-planting family, is one of the few
people close to the president who has substantially consolidated
his power. Part of the reason may be his talent for keeping a low
profile—and tenaciously accomplishing whatever task is at
hand. Almost alone among the so-called crony businessmen close
to Marcos, he has seen his commercial empire continue to grow.
Some political opponents have talked of a possible link to the
shooting of Aquino, but they have produced no evidence. During
May’s National Assembly elections he
played a key role in delivering his home
province of Tarlac for the president’s
party. “Businessmen tell me that Marcos
and Imelda aren’t the ones to watch,”
says opposition leader Salvador Laurel,
himself a likely candidate in presidential
elections scheduled for 1987. “They say
Danding Cojuangco is preparing to run.”
Vast PlantationsrAny such move,
however, will have to be based more on
muscle and money than popular sup-
port. A series of presidential decrees in
the early 1970 s gave Cojuangco effec-
tive control over the vital coconut in-
dustry that directly or indirectly affects
the livelihood of nearly 20 million Fili-
pinos. While expanding rapidly into
other industries, he also benefited from
a presidential decree placing a levy on
small coconut planters. Before it was
lifted two years ago the levy poured an
estimated $1.4 billion into a bank Co-
juangco partially owns. He has security
forces attached to his own vast planta-
tions that function as a virtual private
army, and he cultivates key military
officers. Still, some believe that Cojuangco would rather be
kingmaker than king. “If Danding became president,” one
Malacanang source quotes Marcos as saying, “there would
immediately be demonstrations outside the San Miguel build-
ing, and people would be stoning his bank. Why should he
want that? Why shouldn’t he go on enjoying life?”
Willingly or not, Cojuangco has recently been closer than
usual to the limelight. Occasionally during the past year his
name has popped up in the local opposition media in connection
with theories about the assassination of Aquino—whose widow,
Corazon, is Cojuangco’s first cousin from a rival branch of the
family. In an uncharacteristically public response, Cojuangco
last month launched an angry, $6 million libel suit against the
Sunday magazine of the Bulletin Today, Manila’s largest daily,
for publishing such allegations. Cojuangco denied any link to the
murder and said the insinuations were “highly offensive to my
honor, dignity, integrity and reputation and expose me to public
hatred, contempt and ridicule.” Cojuangco is also reportedly
trying to buy the Bulletin —a sound investment in financial
terms —but one that could yield an aspiring presidential candi-
date even greater political dividends.

SRI LANKA
The Ethnic Fires Bum Again
After the rampage in Mannar: Five people died in a two-hour orgy of looting and arson
AP
The story told in Mannar these days is
chilling. A fortnight ago, people say, a
bus screeched to a halt in their quiet Sri
Lankan port town. Fifty government sol-
diers emptied into a dusty street, helped
themselves to drinks at a local bar —then
embarked on a two-hour orgy of looting and
arson. “The whole square was full of smoke
and I could see soldiers running around
yelling and singing,” says Xavier Croos, a
local pastor. “The police could not do any-
thing and the people were helpless.” Flames
engulfed more than 120 shops and countless
homes. Five people were shot to death.
The rampage was one of a series of clashes
that have rocked northern Sri Lanka this
month. It was the worst flare-up since last
summer in the longstanding dispute be-
tween the country’s Sinhalese majority and
the ethnic Tamils who total nearly a fifth of
the country’s 15 million population. The
violence began with a bomb in the airport at
Madras, capital of the Indian state of Tamil
Nadu, whose coast lies just 18 miles across
the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka. Two days
later, Tamil guerrillas staged an ambush,
killing two seamen aboard a Sri Lankan
Navy vessel patrolling the strait. No firm
evidence has uncovered who planted the
airport bomb. But Sri Lankan officials
linked the two attacks and concluded that
Tamil guerrillas had renewed their cam-
paign for a separate Tamil state. In retali-
ation, they ordered their predominantly
Sinhalese troops to sweep the country’s
Tamil-dominated northern region. “Ulti-
mately,” National Security Minister Lalith
Athulathmudali warned two weeks ago,
“we will have the entire population that is
opposed to terrorism armed to the teeth.”
For the moment, the crackdown has
brought an abrupt end to the guerrilla at-
tacks, whose main targets had been banks,
police stations and military patrols. But as
reports from areas hit by Army troops
spread through the island, even many Sinha-
lese began to doubt government claims that
all but a few of the almost 100 T amils killed in
the fighting were “terrorists.” “If anything
has come out of the events of the past week,”
says one Sinhalese political analyst, “it is
that our Army is undisciplined and poorly
trained.” Public outcry over the Mannar
incident in particular compelled the govern-
ment of President Junius Jayewardene to
launch a full-scale investigation. At the
Madras airport: Pressure from New Delhi
AP
weekend, the government issued a
statement concluding that soldiers
had, indeed, been responsible. But it
also said that “extremists and Marx-
ists” had organized the rampage—a
charge that has been leveled after
similar incidents in the past. Under
pressure from Mannar’s Muslim
community, the government has
agreed to pay the owners of damaged
shops $2,000 each.
Slump: The deepening political and
ethnic strains could not have come at a
worse time. Since the bloody riots of a
year ago that claimed 400 lives and
ruined $ 150 million worth of property
in the capital city of Colombo alone,
officials have waged a mostly down-
hill struggle to right the country’s
shaken economy. The government
has tried to revive Sri Lanka’s image as
a haven of political stability. But for-
eign investment continues to stag-
nate. Tourism, which before the 1983
riots was Sri Lanka’s top revenue earner,
continues to slump. And unemployment
and inflation continue at double-digit rates.
More ominously, there are signs that
many Sri Lankans —Tamils and Sinhalese
alike —have lost hope of a quick end to the
strife. Western embassy officials in Colom-
bo are bracing for an expected wave of re-
quests for asylum from fearful Tamils, most
of whom are Hindus in a predominantly
Buddhist country. Especially dangerous is
the threat of a brain drain, as increasing
numbers of educated professionals apply for
residence abroad. “If a political solution is
not reached soon,” warns one diplomat,
“one of the biggest problems for develop-
ment here is going to be the human flight.”
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government
faces mounting demands from its giant
neighbor to find a negotiated settle-
ment to the strife. Twice last week,
India’s Prime Minister Indira Gan-
dhi publicly criticized the military
crackdown. Her concern is hardly
disinterested: there are more than 50
million Tamils in India and, with na-
tional elections approaching, Gandhi
is eager to court their votes.
Sri Lanka may soon face pressures
of a different sort from other foreign
allies. Officials in Colombo are devel-
oping a new intelligence network
with the help of up to six Israeli gov-
ernment experts. Their presence has
already prompted an outcry from the
country’s small Muslim communi-
ty —and there are signs that such ma-
jor trade partners as Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Libya are similarly out-
raged. The calm in the streets this
week may hold for the moment. But
past experience would indicate only
a short breathing spell before the
tiny island nation erupts in crisis
once again.

WORLD BUSINESS
Braking in the Fast Lane
The sprawling Eurobond market has been jarred by scandal and U.S. challenges.
Kelly: Trading across national borders and offering investors total anonymity in a sprawling, unregulated securities bazaar
PHOTOS BY SALLY FEAR—IMPACT
Every time John Kelly picks up the
phone, his word is good for about
$50,000. An electrician’s son who left
school at 16, Kelly is a trader in the frenetic
Eurobond market. Unlike many of the oth-
er young traders, British-born Kelly, 28,
doesn’t spend after-work hours zooming
around in a BMW or Ferrari; in fact, he
drives a station wagon. Still, he admits to a
certain sybaritic life-style: “In this business
you drink too much, you eat too much and
you enjoy yourself too much.”
Too much has jarred the Eurobond mar-
ket this summer. The events began in late
June, when a prominent Swiss bond trader
was found dead in his car—a suicide who
had been suspected of fraudulent trading.
Then last month the U.S. Congress re-
pealed the 30 percent withholding tax on
interest paid to foreign investors holding
American bonds; that tax had been a cru-
cial catalyst to the growth of the London-
based Eurobond market. And last week
U.S. Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
challenged the market anew. Although he
tempered the disquiet among market play-
ers abroad by announcing that the Treas-
ury Department would not issue bearer
bonds —the lifeblood of the Eurobond busi-
ness—he revealed that the government
would look into “innovations” to entice
more foreign investors to United States
shores. The summer is almost over, but
confidence in the future of the Eurobond
market seems severely shaken.
It is a sprawling, unregulated securities
bazaar that trades across national borders,
matching the borrowing needs of blue-chip
corporations and sovereign nations with
the investment desires of over-
taxed Belgian dentists, nerv-
ous Hong Kong real-estate
tycoons and dollar-soaked Ku-
waiti sheiks. With $250 billion
in bonds in circulation, the
Eurobond market is the third
largest debt exchange in the
world (after U.S. Treasury is-
sues and Japanese government
securities). Its traders are the
precocious children of the se-
curities-trading family—and
characteristically, some wax
optimistic about their market
despite fears that the summer’s
events could send more busi-
ness back to New York. “The
idea that the European banks
might be nice and just content
themselves with playing a re-
duced role behind the likes of Morgan Stan-
ley and Goldman, Sachs is remarkably na-
ive,” says Hans-Joerg Rudloff of Credit
Suisse First Boston Ltd., a leading Euro-
bond underwriter.
The Eurobond business clearly doesn’t
want for appeal. Eurobonds are floated
simultaneously in several nations outside
the borrower’s home country. One of the
Quadrex chairman Klesch: A European ‘Wild West ’


reasons investors find them alluring is that
they are issued as bearer bonds: whoever
holds the paper owns it. Critics claim that
bearer bonds can lead to tax evasion and
encourage theft, but their main feature—
anonymity—is an obvious attraction to
legitimate bondholders. “We in Europe
have been through civil wars, revolutions,
world wars and the confiscatory policies
of socialist and communist governments,”
says Rudloff". “Whoever saves and has
capital wants to protect themselves from
these events.”
Burnout: Eurobond trading is a game for
the young, and the burnout rate is high.
“This is a market for young people,” says
Oswal Gruebel of White Weld Securities.
“It’s mentally and physically tough.”
Traders can earn princely salaries, especial-
ly by British standards —as much as
$50,000 with two years’ experience, more
than $lOO,OOO with five. But the price is
very long workdays. Eurobond traders of-
ten arrive at their offices around 7 a.m.,
emerge 11 hours later and receive calls at
home in the middle of the night as other
traders in Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore
begin their days. “If I buy $lOO million of
bonds at night, I’ve got to do something to
sell them,” says David Watkins of Gold-
man, Sachs & Co. “I may well want to begin
putting together a syndicate, so I’ve got
everyone’s home number.” Five billion dol-
lars’ worth of bonds is traded daily, nearly
all via telephone or telex. The telephone is
so essential to the business, in fact, that
traders frequently develop “trader’s arm,”
a form of tendinitis akin to tennis elbow.
A relatively tiny galaxy of stars domi-
nates the action. The underwriting side of
the business “has become a very small and
exclusive club,” says David Vollans, chief
dealer at the Kuwait Investment Co. “If
you’re not a member of the club, you can’t
make money.” Traders also have an inner
circle. Among other things, they strive
to become “big and real” —
market jargon for having
authority to execute multimil-
lion-dollar trades.
A market as big and unbri-
dled as the Eurobond market
would seem the perfect place
for fraud. Earlier this summer,
a Bear, Stearns trader was
charged with involvement in
an $8 million bond-trading
scandal. As head of the firm’s
convertible trading depart-
ment, Peter Buer, 36, was “big
and real” and had a penchant
for fast cars and posh London
nightspots. But in June, Bear,
Stearns stunned the Eurobond
market when it announced
that it would not honor trades
done by Buer. The next day,
Buer was fired. Bear, Stearns
notified the Union Bank of
Switzerland that it was also
suspicious of the bank’s chief
Watkins: Putting together $100 million syndicates in the middle of the night
bond trader in New York, Jurg Remund.
Remund, 35, was a close friend of Buer’s.
After being confronted with fraud allega-
tions, Remund shot himself. Buer, who has
proclaimed his innocence, was later arrest-
ed at a Swiss airport and is currently await-
ing trial in a Swiss jail. Though details of the
alleged fraud scheme remain sketchy, mar-
ket sources suspect that bonds may have
been channeled through fictitious compa-
nies—where prices could be manipulated
to the profit of the traders.
‘Wild West 9 : Still, considering its size and
scope, the market is relatively untarnished
by scandals. “In some quarters, the Euro-
bond market has this image of being filled
with cowboys—an unregulated Wild
West,” says Gary Klesch, chairman of
Quadrex Securities, Ltd., a small, inde-
pendent investment house based in Lon-
don. “But all I can say to those who point
their fingers is don’t throw stones if you live
in a glass house.” Even the best-designed
Eurobond trader Gruebel: A tiny galaxy of stars dominates the action
TERRY FINCHER—PHOTOGRAPHERS INTERNATIONAL-OUTLINE
regulatory net, legal and financial experts
say, can be circumvented by sufficiently
enterprising crooks.
A bigger threat to the Eurobond market
is the U.S. Treasury’s move to deregulate
the domestic bond market. Though shying
away from bearer bonds per se, Regan an-
nounced plans to sell special issues of bonds
that will not require foreign bondholders to
reveal their names to the U.S. government.
Congressional critics have warned that the
bonds could wind up in the hands of Ameri-
cans looking for a way to evade taxes. But
the bond market in New York reveled at
Regan’s announcement. Prices surged on
the hope that the measure would permit the
government to tap a new source of funds
and help finance the federal deficit.
Shakeout: It remains to be seen whether
the new Treasury issues, coupled with
repeal of the 30 percent withholding tax,
will draw the capital market out of Lon-
don and back to New York. Salomon
Brothers Inc., the New York
investment house, is trying
some transatlantic coaxing of
its own: the firm recently
bought Treasury bonds and
repackaged them for sale
abroad in bearer form. Insid-
ers say that no matter where
the market is finally based, it
is due for a shakeout. And
when it’s complete, no single
money center may dominate.
Besides the American moves
to deregulate securities, the
Japanese are easing foreign
access to their markets, West
Germany is contemplating
elimination of their withhold-
ing tax and the British are
poised to abolish decades-old
trading regulations. The fu-
ture, says Rudloff, looks like
“one, big worldwide market.”

Hong Kong: Cooking the Books
Hong Kong’s unbridled markets and
laissez-faire attitude toward business
have made the colony an entrepreneur’s
paradise. But those traditions have their
pitfalls. Two years ago a real-estate bust
sent Hong Kong’s economy spinning into
recession. Bankruptcies came in rapid suc-
cession, laying bare evidence of widespread
careless management practices. Now the
colony’s financial crisis seems ready to
claim another set of victims: the auditors
who verified the too-often faulty—and oc-
casionally fraudulent —books of Hong
Kong’s freewheeling companies. Once
again, there will be calls for reform and
regulation.
Two recent cases illustrate how quickly
the backlash has occurred. In late May, two
accountants from the prestigious American
Tan under arrest: Were his accountants purposely conniving or merely careless?
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST
firm Price Waterhouse & Co. were arrested
and charged with fraud as auditors of the
sprawling Carrian real-estate group. The
conglomerate collapsed late last year, leav-
ing debts of $1.2 billion and leading to the
arrest for fraud of its chief executive,
George Tan. The second case highlighted
the growing strains between accountants
and their clients. After poring over the re-
cords of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd.
(BMF), Carrian’s principal creditor,
Touche Ross & Co. concluded that the bank
had failed to keep “proper books of ac-
count” and was in weak financial condition.
BMF’s parent, Malaysia’s giant Bumiputra
Bank, was enraged; it abruptly fired Touche
Ross and hired other accountants.
The incidents have unnerved Hong
Kong’s auditing industry. In the aftermath
of the property market’s collapse, many
accounting firms say they are tightening up
their procedures and increasing the number
of qualifying notes they write into the mar-
gins of corporate accounts. But that step has
disturbed their clients, who are accustomed
to minimal scrutiny and few questions from
outsiders. Even more troubling to the colo-
ny’s auditors is the prospect that they might
be sued for past inaccuracies in their clients’
accounts. “The Price Waterhouse case is
only the first instance of this,” says one
British auditor. “Accountants will see more
litigation simply because of the crashes of
the past two years.”
Reputation: The accounting firms’ poten-
tial liability could be substantial. Hong
Kong’s accountants have long had a reputa-
tion for carelessness. For many of the colo-
ny’s family-run concerns, “accounting”
means little more than a father watching his
sons’ salaries. Directors and chief execu-
tives are noted for borrowing money and
making loans off the books. In hard eco-
nomic times, companies will often bury the
evidence of their problems by using ques-
tionable, or perhaps fraudulent, accounting
methods.
In addition, it is not always clear where
one company ends and another begins.
Hong Kong law requires only that a quarter
of a public company’s capital be disclosed
and accounted for. The rest can be con-
trolled by a private holding company that
may control any number of subsidiaries.
Cash and other assets can be shifted back
and forth among companies in the group,
and accountants have no access to the pri-
vate holding company’s records. As a re-
sult, even an apparently healthy public
company can be brought down by undis-
closed dealings of its private affiliates. One
example is the recent bankruptcy of Conic
Investment Co., once Hong Kong’s largest
electronics firm. The firm reported losses of
nearly $5O million in June, more than half of
which resulted from unpublicized borrow-
ings by Conic’s chairman, Alex Au.
Hong Kong will have a hard time curbing
such abuses, mainly because it lacks any real
enforcement mechanisms. The colony’s
four stock exchanges require almost no de-
tailed financial information from listed
companies. Its decade-old Securities Com-
mission has been virtually inactive. And the
Hong Kong Society of Accountants is only
just beginning to define its policies govern-
ing associated companies, borrowing costs
and foreign-exchange translations —the
areas where many abuses occur.
Still, there are signs of progress. Earlier
this year, the government introduced new
regulations limiting the loans and payments
that can be made to directors and tightening
controls on intercompany asset transfers.
The Securities Commission is also planning
to revamp its operations. Starting this au-
tumn, the commission will begin to enforce
more strictly the accounting and disclosure
requirements for publicly traded compa-
nies. By 1986 it is expected to have passed a
sweeping set of rules and sanctions that will
bring Hong Kong’s regulations somewhat
closer to those of the tough American Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission.
How effective these steps will be is an
open question, and the stakes involved are
high. Many executives believe that the
changes could fundamentally alter the way
business is done in the colony. Hong
Kong’s goal at this time is to attract for-
eign investors and protect its reputation as
an international financial center. The
problem lies in reconciling these ambitions
with the colony’s wheeler-dealer tradi-
tions. “We’re squeezed between interna-
tional investors and local investors,” says
one Hong Kong accountant. “You can’t
have a laissez-faire system and a system of
full disclosure at the same time.” If so,
Hong Kong sooner or later will have to
decide between the two.

A Sex-Discrimination Case
The National Organization for Women
has moved the battle over sex discrimina-
tion in insurance pricing into the courts.
Last week the group filed a class-action suit
designed to eliminate the practice of charg-
ing higher health and disability rates for
women than for men. The suit contends that
Mutual of Omaha has violated the District
of Columbia’s 1977 Human Rights Act.
NOW fingered Mutual of Omaha, in
part, because it contributed $50,000 to a
group lobbying against legislation to ban
sex-based insurance pricing. “The insur-
ance industry is motivated by profit, which
is perfectly reasonable,” says NOW presi-
dent Judy Goldsmith. “But its profit on
women is inflated.” ’ Mutual of Omaha said
that women have a greater incidence of
medical claims, which justifies higher rates.


Big Blue Adds to Its Arsenal
‘Do you have one that can help me decide which is the one for me?’
With banjo music, magicians, moun-
tains of barbecue and an uncharacter-
istic display of corporate high spirits, IBM
threw a lavish country-and-Western party
at the Loews Anatole Hotel in Dallas last
week for 2,000 computer dealers, consult-
ants and software developers. The occasion:
the unveiling of IBM’s new personal com-
puter, the IBM PC AT. Big Blue already
dominates the office market for personal
computers —and the new machine adds a
formidable weapon to its arsenal.
Technologically, the PC AT is a signifi-
cant advance over the PC and the IBM
clones now on the market. The heart of the
machine is a new Intel microprocessor, the
80286, a more powerful cousin of the Intel
8088 chip in the PC. As a result, PC AT is
compatible with the PC, but it operates
faster and has much greater internal memo-
ry—up to 3 million bytes (characters) of
random access memory (RAM), compared
with a maximum of 640,000 bytes for the
PC. That means the PC AT can run more
sophisticated software. It is also powerful
enough to run several tasks at once —and up
to three terminals or small
computers can be plugged
into the machine, making it
a “multiuser” system. IBM
also announced a coaxial-
cable local-area network
that will link up to 72 per-
sonal computers, printers
and storage devices.
The impact of the PC AT
goes beyond technology:
IBM priced the machines
lower than many analysts
had expected. Base prices
run from $3,995 to $5,795, a
range that will increase the pressure on
IBM’s competitors. The PC AT is clearly
aimed at the office market, where AT&T
offers a higher-priced multiuser system and
a new entry, the Model 6300 personal com-
puter. But that machine was designed to
compete mainly against the older PC, now
overshadowed by the PC AT. “IBM has, in
effect, pulled the rug out from under
AT&T,” says one analyst.
IBM is also pulling the rug out from
under many smaller firms making so-called
IBM-compatible machines designed to
compete only against the PC, not the new
machine. And the PC AT may increase the
pressure on Apple: though its new Macin-
tosh computer is designed for a different
market than the PC AT, Apple and IBM
compete head-on for independent software
developers. Given IBM’s clout and market
power, that makes it tough for Apple.
Despite its strengths, the PC AT has
shortcomings that competitors will try to
exploit. Its graphics capability, for exam-
ple, is not equal to machines like the Com-
paq desk-top models or the AT&T person-
IBM’s PC A T: Market power
al computer. Even so, the
PC AT is another step for-
ward: only a decade ago it
would have taken a main-
frame computer to supply
the computing power pack-
aged in the PC AT. Says
Fred Gibbons of Software
Publishing: “We are now
putting on a desk what was
once behind glass doors up
on raised floors.”

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Trying to Take the Work Out of Bicycling
The bicycle, one of society’s most universal means of trans-
portation, has survived decades of technological achievement
almost unchanged, and until recently few people gave any
thought to the idea that there might be a better way. But now,
inventors and designers are beginning to challenge the basic
architecture of the modern bicycle and are turning out models
and accessories that are anything but ordinary.
The newfangled bikes may look different, but they were
created with an eye toward performance, not esthetics. All of
them aim to increase speed, efficiency and comfort. The com-
panies producing such bikes say that their biggest challenge
isn’t complicated technology but overcoming the skepticism of
the public, which has grown so accustomed to traditional
models that it resists change.
Relaxing on ‘Recumbents '
Probably the most striking of the new
bikes are the so-called recumbents, on
which riders sit back and pedal with
their feet extended in front of them. The
basic design is perhaps a century old, but
it has been brought back to life in recent
years by several small companies in Eu-
rope and the United States. The makers
of recumbents say their products have
several advantages over standard bikes.
Because the rider is lower to the ground
and leans back, wind resistance is said to
be lessened by as much as 20 percent.
And the high-back seat gives riders more
leverage to work the pedals. The combi-
nation should make the recumbents easi-
er to ride, especially over long distances
and up hills.
The Dutch-made Roulandt is perhaps
the first recumbent bike to be mass-pro-
duced and sold at a price close to that of
some 10-speeds. The rider sits on a mold-
ed fiber-glass seat near the top of the 28-
inch rear wheel. From there, the frame
slopes down to a front wheel that meas-
ures just 16 inches. The handlebars that
steer the bike and contain the hand
brakes and gear-shifting control are un-
der the seat, about where the arms hang
naturally. Over all, the 32-pound Rou-
landt is about the same length as a regu-
lar bike, although it appears to be much
longer. Except for the steel frame, han-
dlebars and seat, the Roulandt is
made of off-the-shelf bicycle parts,
which helps to keep down the cost. The
Roulandt six-speed model sells for be-
tween $5OO and $600; the 12-speed ver-
sion costs about $5O more.
Despite some of the advantages that
recumbents have over other bicycles, so
far no major bike manufacturer is pro-
ducing them. America’s Schwinn Bicy-
cle Co. doubts the public will accept the
design. However, the Murray Ohio
Manufacturing Co. of Brentwood,
Tenn., has developed a prototype that it
plans to show to retailers and that it
believes could sell for about $3OO.
The ‘Flying Saucer’: Easier pedaling
Dutch Roulandt: Less wind resistance
Reducing Wasted Energy
A major goal of bicycle designers has
been to reduce the amount of wasted
effort involved in pedaling. The circular
motion on traditional bikes inefficiently
produces the torque needed to propel a
bike, since much of the movement is
along the horizontal plane, where mini-
mal force can be exerted on the pedals.
Recently, companies in Australia and
the United States have come up with
very different solutions to the problem.
Bicycle designer Peter Bartolin of
Sydney has invented a curious-looking
bike he calls the Flying Saucer. The bike
makes use of lever-type pedals that move
up and down in an elliptical motion, and
which connect to a sprocket mounted
above the rear wheel. Bartolin says the
setup generates 50 percent more torque
with the same amount of effort. Fie is
looking for a manufacturer for his bike,
which he says could sell for between
$2OO and $3OO.
Houdaille Industries of Fort Worth,
Texas, produces an attachment called the
Powercam that gets more sustained pow-
er from the circular pedaling motion. The
device makes it easier to pedal on the
downstroke but more difficult at the top
and bottom. The result is a slower, more
efficient pedaling speed. The mechanism
is expensive, however: about $2OO.
Automatic Gear Shifters
Bike manufacturers have found that
many people won’t buy 10-speeds be-
cause it is too difficult to shift the gears.
Now, two small American firms are pro-
ducing devices that attach to most bikes
to make shifting gears much easier.
The Air Shifter, made by Leisure Cy-
cle Technology of Fairfield, N.J., uses
pneumatic pressure to manipulate the
derailleur that controls the gears. The
device attaches to the rear of the bike and
is connected to a control unit that can be
mounted on the handlebars. With the
control unit, the rider can direct the de-
vice to shift to a higher or lower gear. The
unit also can be set to shift the bicycle’s
gears automatically, much like the auto-
matic transmission on an automobile.
The Air Shifter sells for about $6O.
A more elaborate answer to the gear-
shifting problem comes from the Excel
Group of Franklin Park, 111., which man-
ufactures the Cambiogear. This mecha-
nism replaces the cluster gears, derail-
leurs and crank arms that connect to the
pedals. The Cambiogear works some-
thing like an automobile clutch, disen-
gaging the gears at the push of a lever.
The rider then can shift gears by moving
the pedals forward or backward. The
device also allows the rider to downshift
to first while standing still. The basic
Cambiogear kit sells for about $ 100.

Ever since that time, the shattering
noise of the jackhammers remained the
scourge of our cities, and the industry
produced literally generations of operat-

and vibration-related distress.
It was Atlas Copco who developed the
noise suppressing compressor system.
Over twenty years of research and
experimentation with noise insulation
materials, muffler systems, anti-vibration
techniques and modern dust extraction
application has now produced Atlas
Copco compressors quieter than an
ordinary motor car and pneumatic break-

traffic.
And the use of silenced equipment is
not restricted to our highways. Atlas

South Pacific Cinderella
hopes for a godfather
When he attends next week's South Pacific Forum on Tuvalu probably the
world’s smallest, least-favored independent nation Prime Minister Bob Hawke
will learn first-hand of the desperate hopes its citizens pin on Australian assistance.
IN VIE W OF structural prob-
lems which are beyond their
control and beyond the reach
of aid, Australia should make
available limited opportunities
for immigration from Tuvalu
and Kiribati.
That brief recommenda-
tion in the Jackson committee
review of Australia’s overseas
aid program packs a bigger
punch than might be apparent
from the couple of dozen
words allocated to it by the
Jackson report.
But it is about to get the
attention it deserves.
The report, tabled in feder-
al parliament in June, is to be
debated in the budget session
which began this week. And,
coincidentally, Prime Minis-
ter Bob Hawke will be in
Tuvalu next week for the
South Pacific Forum where he
should be left in no doubt of
the hopes for a better life
which the Tuvaluans have
riding on that recommenda-
tion.
Tuvalu estimated popu-
lation 8700, packed onto a land area of
only 24 sq km contained in its nine low
atolls and reefs scattered for 600 km
midway between Fiji and the equator
is probably the smallest, least-favored,
least-known, independent country in
the world.
“All we have is sunshine, wind and a
portion of the Pacific Ocean,” said its
prime minister at his independence
speech in 1978.
Tuvalu has no surface water, so
coconuts and pandanus are its principal
crops giving a miserable export re-
turn. Tuvalu earns almost as much
money selling its postage stamps to phil-
atelists abroad. Because of its remote-
ness and lack of development, it has no
tourist potential.
Many of the visiting politicians and
Colin McDonald: a special category needed for “refugees”
STUART INDER
public servants attending next week’s
forum meeting there will need to stay
aboard Australian and New Zealand
naval ships anchored in the lagoon.
More than half of Tuvalu households
live on remittances from relatives
forced to work abroad. The serious
problem they face is that these econ-
omic opportunities are fading.
For decades they manned the phos-
phate workings at Ocean Island to their
north, operated by the Melbourne-
based British Phosphate Commission-
ers, but the island was worked out in
1979. The phosphate deposits on Nauru,
where they now work, also are coming
to an end.
“Emigration is the only real solution
for a group of superficially idyllic
islands that otherwise face a bleak fu-
ture,” says Dr John Connell,
of Sydney University’s Ge-
ography department, who re-
cently made an exhaustive
study of Tuvalu and Kiribati’s
situation as part of a wider in-
quiry.
The Tuvalu and Kiribati
people spent much of this cen-
tury as Britain’s Gilbert and
Ellice Islands Colony, until
the colony amicably split into
two parts in 1975. The Ellice,
whose people are Polynesians,
became Tuvalu and the Gil-
berts to the north Micro-
nesians became Kiribati.
Although Kiribati has by
far the larger population
(60,000) and better economic
potential, both have the same
lack of opportunities in the
long term which makes mi-
gration so vital.
The Tuvalu and Kiribati
governments have been press-
ing for years for work op-
portunities for their people in
Australia but they have not fit-
ted into Australia’s guidelines
for immigrants.
They have not been trained in the
sorts of skills that Australia seeks and
don’t have relatives to sponsor them.
“So you have to have a special
category; you might call them economic
refugees,” Colin McDonald, Australia’s
High Commissioner in Fiji, told the
Suva-based Islands Business magazine
on his departure for a new posting.
What the Jackson proposal recog-
nises is that, in such special cases, the
“traditional ideas of aid must give way.”
Immigration policy could be used as an
arm of overseas aid so that potential mi-
grants from Tuvalu and Kiribati were
trained by Australia in the skills that
would find them employment in Austra-
lia.
It is a concept which would win Aus-
tralia friends in the South Pacific. □


NEW ZEALAND
Labor starts
to dismantle the
welfare state
New Zealand sheep on the move: subsidies have become targets
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALAND, which pioneered the
welfare state and extended it far beyond
the limits imagined by the founding
fathers, is stripping it back.
Surprisingly, the task is being tackled
by a Labor government the predeces-
sors of which were assiduous in build-
ing the welfare state. But, in the past two
decades, welfare had reached what
some saw as absurd heights with
wealthy farmers and major companies
receiving handsome state subsidies.
Prime Minister David Lange said
last week that government assistance to
farmers, manufacturers and exporters
had been costing taxpayers about $2 bil-
lion a year.
New Zealand’s system of subsidies
for farmers and exporters already had
been a target of the country’s main
trading partners. The United States’
Reagan administration criticised the ex-
port incentives more than three years
ago and threatened countervailing du-
ties if New Zealand did not agree to
phase them out. Only some rugged dip-
lomacy by former prime minister Sir
Robert Muldoon prevented those sanc-
tions being applied.
Then, within the context of the
Closer Economic Relationship with
Australia, the Fraser government in-
dicated that it could not accept the ex-
port incentives and New Zealand con-
ceded in that trade agreement an obliga-
tion to phase them out by 1987.
The main export incentive provides a
tax credit of up to 14 cents in the dollar
on manufactured goods, the actual
amount varying according to the level
of New Zealand content. It has been
remarkably successful in stimulating ex-
ports.
A decade ago, New Zealand sold
only $2OO million of manufactures
abroad. In the latest 12 months, to June,
the value of those exports reached $1.5
billion. And some of the country’s most
successful companies did so well out of
the export incentives that they were pay-
ing little or no corporate tax.
A different system operated for farm-
ers who, according to the government
rationalisation, needed to be compen-
sated for the high internal cost structure
which arose from the first and second
oil price shocks.
But, in spite of all the bandages for
the export sector, New Zealand has con-
tinued to run a heavy deficit in its bal-
ance of payments.
The last time it had a surplus on cur-
rent account was in 1973.
The cost of maintaining that deficit
through overseas loans and debt servic-
ing had become ruinous. So the Labor
government, in abolishing subsidies for
farmers and exporters, has been able to
make a virtue of necessity.
Some critics say it has not gone fast
enough. They say the subsidies should
have been wiped out immediately the
government decided to devalue the dol-
lar by 20 percent. Instead, the export
incentives are to be phased down over
the next two years.
Significantly, however, the govern-
ment also has decided to accelerate the
planned switch from import licensing to
the tariff as the main form of protection
for domestic industry. Again, that is a
remarkable departure from traditional
Labor philosophy.
It was a Labor government which in-
troduced import licensing 46 years ago.
It was a device to protect the country’s
depleted overseas funds but acquired
respectability as a means of encoura-
ging manufacturing industry to expand
and provide the jobs which a growing
population demanded.
Under a blanket import protection
wall, however, New Zealand risked be-
coming a nation of assemblers produ-
cing a limited range of high-cost prod-
ucts. Even now, some manufacturers
demand to be able to import their raw
materials from the cheapest world
source but also demand total protection
from competition in their markets.
Those manufacturers once could
look to the Labor Party to defend them.
Now the Lange Government says it will
not only go along with the agreement
reached by the previous government
with the Manufacturers Federation to
switch from import licensing to tariff-
based protection; it also has decided to
speed up the change, particularly for
those sectors subject to little import ex-
posure.
Announcing the change, minister of
Trade and Industry David Caygill rev-
elled in the Treasury philosophy: “If we
are to achieve an improved economic
performance, a better standard of living
and increased employment op-
portunities, it is essential that our re-
sources are directed into activities
which yield the highest return. Large


differences in the level of industry as-
sistance will not achieve this objective.”
This Labor government sees more
clearly than its predecessors that the
first priority is to create wealth, rather
than to redistribute it. Economic
growth, it believes, will come only with
conditions to suit internationally com-
petitive industry.
How palatable that will be politically
for a nation conditioned to state aid for
all remains to be seen. Perhaps the new
ministers should have been even more
brutal in their use of the scalpel.
New Zealand has been living beyond
its income for a long time. It may be
able to recover with this as-yet-minimal
amount of pain. But, if the new ministry
is to succeed in tuning up the economy
so it can lead the world again in living
standards, it may have to apply itself
even more ruthlessly to rooting out the
inefficiencies that are the legacy of dec-
ades of the welfare state. □
THE PACIFIC
How they Cooked
the books
on the captain
By STUART INDER
TWO CENTURIES after publication
of the official account of the death of
Captain Cook in Hawaii, it has become
clear that the record is wrong. Cook al-
most certainly was the chief architect of
his own death but the official account
covered up his fatal flaws and those of
some of his officers.
The man who wrote the account,
Captain James King, was anxious not
only to enhance Cook’s reputation but
also to protect his own, says Emeritus
Professor O.H.K. Spate of the Austra-
lian National University in the latest
issue of The Journal of Pacific History.
King achieved what he set out to do
even though he died in 1784, the year
his book appeared. In the two centuries
since, says Spate, King’s account (the
third volume of A Voyage to the Pacific
Ocean ... In the years 1776, 1777, 1778,
1779 and 1780), with a few exceptions,
“has been followed almost universally
and quite uncritically.”
King was second lieutenant under
Cook in Resolution when Cook was
stabbed and clubbed to death at
Kealakekua Bay in February 1779.
One of King’s fellow officers was the
young William Bligh who even then was
contemptuous of King and some of the
others. Bligh left no doubt of his feel-
ings when King’s work first appeared
and, in a copy of the book found later in
Cook’s death in 1779: original illustration from A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Volume III,
by Captain James King, published in London in 1784.
the Admiralty library, he pencilled mar-
ginal corrections and indignant com-
ment. But it was the King version of
events that was to endure.
A Secretary to the Admiralty wrote
later on the flyleaf of Bligh’s annotated
book: “Bligh’s marginal notes must be
read with grains of allowance for his
temper and prejudices.”
But Spate, a distinguished historian,
believes that Bligh’s notes on King need
not be debited “merely to his own crab-
bed temperament; he had very probably
substantial reason to feel aggrieved.”
Spate says a careful comparison of
King’s journal on the voyage with his
published account of 1784 suggests
“that King was in fact a literary artist of
a high order.”
Subtle changes in wording and dis-
creet concealment of the truth, together
with deliberate misrepresentation,
“produced not only the portrait of Cook
as the hero without flaw but the flatter-
ing self-image of King as the man about
whom everything revolved, the man
who ‘kept his head when all about him
were losing theirs’.”
Various scholars in recent years have
shown that there were more facets to the
fateful events that February day; it was
not a case of the humane Cook being
struck down unexpectedly by the un-
trustworthy Hawaiians when he went
ashore in friendship.
The facts don’t detract from Cook’s
superb achievements or stature in his-
tory. His notorious short temper simply
got the better of him that day.
Enraged at the theft of a boat, Cook
went ashore without a proper plan and
without confiding in his officers to take
a local friendly chief hostage. Cook
stepped out of character when con-
fronted by an angry crowd, concerned
about the safety of their chief, by shoot-
ing one dead.
Finally, he frittered away so much
time that when he was forced to order
his marines in nearby boats to fire in his
support, it was too late.
King, who was not present, sup-
pressed the evidence of the only officer
ashore with Cook that Cook ordered the
marines to open fire.
King manages, instead, to suggest
that Cook wanted the marines to hold
their fire so the Hawaiians would not be
hurt.
King also muddies the evidence on
Cook’s killing of the man in the crowd
which Cook apparently did to make an
example of him.
But King’s worst suppression was of
the discreditable conduct of Lieutenant
John Williamson who withdrew his
marine party from the attack on Cook
and his companions when he may
have been able to save them and who
made no effort even to recover bodies.
King’s protection of his friend Wil-
liamson resulted in Williamson’s pro-
motion.
(Some years later, in another battle,
Williamson was court-martialled and
dismissed for cowardice.)
In Canberra Spate said: “King’s ac-
count has been quoted and requoted for
two centuries, so the lesson here is that
one should never take even the most
respectable author on trust when he
is quoting from another respectable
author.
“Go back to sources.
“Did you know that, while there is a
high probability that Magellan named
the Pacific Ocean, there is no hard evi-
dence on it?” □

South Australia chips
into the high-tech game
Australia has taken an important step into the world of the silicon chip.
JOHN STACKHOUSE looks at the latest development and its likely impact as we
sit in on the fastest money-technology game in the world.
FLYING between Melbourne
and Sydney, you often pass
over Canberra at around
10,000 m. The miniaturised
city divides into blocks of
power and interest parlia-
ment, the bureaucratic offices,
commercial centres, the resi-
dential suburbs, the lake and
its follies. Between them are
the lines of roads and bridges,
the links.
In Adelaide’s industrial
park last week, an Olympus
microscope focused on the
latest CSIRO silicon chip. The
plan view was remarkably like
a well-organised city viewed
from hundreds of kilometres
out in space. In the image you
could track the Canberra
equivalents the logic
centres, the decision-making
and evaluation elements and
the memories all linked by
connecting lines.
The system, containing
102,000 transistors, is only
about one centimetre square.
This is known as a very
large scale integrated circuit
(VSLI) on a single chip, a city
of electronic functions linked by a street
network of connections. In terms of
buildings and streets, blown up to geo-
graphical scale, it would be remarkably
like the city of Adelaide.
It was fun to track through the sys-
tem using the microscope. You move
along the pathways of artificial reason-
ing, down the connecting lines to the
blocks of logic and the evaluation
farms. In the middle of all this, like one
of Adelaide’s squares, is a touch of pure
cheek: an electronically blank spot
decorated with a picture of Australia II
with an Advance Australia symbol on
its spinnaker. The touch of nationalism
is only 1 millimetre high.
The traverse down the electronic
tramways leaves you no doubt that this
is an Australian chip. It was conceived
and designed in Adelaide with CSIRO
Science minister Barry Jones (left) with Austek’s Craig Mudge
S. HANNAGAN/THE ADVERTISER
funding. It forms what Science and
Technology minister Barry Jones hopes
will be the basis of one of his sunrise,
high-tech industries.
This chip is designed for one pur-
pose: to show that Australian technol-
ogy works. It will demonstrate to the
world the hope that we can clone Cali-
fornia’s Silicon Valley in an industrial
park north of Adelaide.
When Jones unveiled the 102,000-
transistor (100 K chips in the jargon)
voice-recognition device, the team
which designed it formally left the
CSIRO and moved into private enter-
prise as Austek Pty Ltd a privately
funded company set up to market the
expertise.
They moved into a wing of Innova-
tion House, a blue and white structure
which looks as though some architect
went wild with Lego blocks,
on the industrial park set up
next to the South Australian
Institute of Technology. The
South Australian government
financed it to attract Jones’s
sunrise industries to a state
which can see the sun setting
on its traditional, tariff-pro-
tected industries.
Behind Austek is $7 mil-
lion in Australian and over-
seas capital under the stew-
ardship of Sir Gordon Jack-
son as chairman, which wants
to buy part of the action in the
fastest money-technology
game in the world.
Heading up the company
itself is Dr Craig Mudge, Port
Pirie-born boy who came
back to his home state as one
of the world’s experts in VSLI
technology. The CSIRO lured
him from Digital Equipment
Corporation in the United
States to bring expertise and
contacts back to the country
and the state of his birth.
Mudge has drawn to him
one of the world’s top teams
in this sharp-edge technology.
There are bright young Australian en-
gineers, some Asians and, coming soon,
Americans. VSLI chip design is partly a
game and partly a challenge. But the
players go only where the action is like-
ly to be.
I asked one of Mudge’s senior engin-
eers: “What brings you to this com-
pany? Is it the challenge, the honor and
the glory, or do you hope to be a mil-
lionaire?”
“Off the record,” he said looking
around, “I want to get the good things
the world can offer.
“I told myself that just once before I
was 40, I wanted to have a grab at the
big game. This is the only one in town.”
“And Mudge?” I asked.
“Craig’s more complex. It’s a mix-
ture of all those things. But the reason
we’re here in Adelaide is because his


mum and dad live here and so do
mine.”
Mudge indeed is complex. And
there’s no doubt that, like, Jones he has
a dream. He is using some of the com-
plex motives that brought him back to
help set up Austek. There is the chal-
lenge of working with 100 K VSLIs
which, at the present stage of technol-
ogy, are what the four-minute mile was
when Roger Bannister came along.
There is also the chance as an executive
to participate in a 37 percent share of a
company which he hopes will be gross-
ing $5O million within five years. There
is the laid-back lifestyle of Adelaide.
There is also the element of being boss
of a top team by world standards.
Austek, therefore, aims to emulate
Silicon Valley. The typical company
there starts in a garage as a spare-time
activity of gifted engineers or academ-
ics, attracts venture capital and ex-
plodes into new products. Along the
way, many of the participants have be-
come multi-millionaires.
Even the ones who have made it only
comfortably on the financial scale enjoy
a work environment of creativity and
freedom that few in an industrialised so-
ciety can share. And, make no mistake,
the 100 K smart chip is one of the
sportiest games in the world.
The US department of Defence is
funding a major drive into this type of
technology aimed at miniaturising even
more the chips that drive computers or
aircraft or missile systems. The CSIRO
demonstration chip is well up among
technologies that the department is
spending hundreds of millions to foster.
The demonstration chip itself is not
designed to be part of a commercial
working system. Its function is to trans-
late the human voice into commands.
To use it, it is linked with a computer
and memory to present a menu of suit-
able commands that are written into the
computer software.
The computer throws these com-
mands up on the screen and the user
names them so the chip can recognise
his or her voice.
One of the systems demonstrated
was a design feature to help create
newer and more complex chips that
Austek plans to market worldwide.
The screen throws up words such as
“connect,” “zoom,” “set” 12 or so.
The operator reads these off the screen
twice while the tiny chip memorises the

PUBLIC OPINION
Interest, pride
put before
pay and perks
A LARGE majority of Australians take
great pride in their work and consider
that an interesting job or one in which
they feel they can achieve something is
more important than good pay, the
working hours or generous holidays. In
view of the significance of the current
prices and incomes policy, it is interest-
ing that good pay is ranked of less im-
portance in Australia than in any of the
countries except France surveyed in an
International Values Study.
These findings come from the Aus-
tralian Values Study. A nationwide
cross-section of more than 1200 people,
aged 14 and over, was asked about
values, attitudes and beliefs regarding
aspects of their home, family and work-
ing lives. Interviewing was conducted
by The Roy Morgan Research Centre.
Questions asked about pride in work
and important characteristics of it also
were asked in the other countries taking
part in the world’s largest social science
survey. This analysis is based on the first
results supplied by the worldwide
Gallup Organisation to the Australian
Values Study Steering Committee and
Foundation members.
The results in the first table show
large national differences for “pride in
work.”
Americans were the most likely to
claim a great deal of pride in their work
(84 percent). Australians (83 percent)
were next, followed by the British (79
percent). In contrast, the European av-
erage was 36 percent, with only 15 per-
cent in West Germany and 13 percent in
France claiming to take great pride in
their work.

People were shown a list of job
characteristics and asked which ones
were important to them personally.
The most important aspects in Aus-
tralia, in rank order, were “a job that is
interesting” (76 percent), “a job where
you feel you can achieve something” (73
percent), “pleasant people to work
with” (72).
Very low on the list of priorities for
Australians were “generous holidays”
(22 percent) and “not too much press-
ure” (29).
Men in Australia placed somewhat
more emphasis on good pay, job securi-
ty and interest than did women who
were concerned more with relationships
at work such as “pleasant people to
work with,” “meeting people” and the
place of work in relation to home life.
Other findings of the Values Study
indicate that home and family are very
important to Australians.
Home ownership in Australia was
the highest found in the international
studies.
Older Australians placed more im-
portance on a job which the family con-
sidered worthwhile and younger Aus-
tralians looked for good pay, overtime
with cash, security, good hours,
generous holidays and an interesting
job with training opportunities.
The table below shows how Austra-
lians’ priorities compare with those of
Europeans and the Japanese.

When the match is made, the second
computer is instructed to carry out the
software command written into the ma-
chine.
To give an idea of the versatility of
this system: when the VIPs and TV
crews left, the young design engineers
surreptitiously punched up a Pacman
game. I joined in and put on the com-
mand microphone. I told the machine
to recognise “up,” “down,” “left” and
“right” and the other game commands
and the voracious Pacman started
chasing me through the maze.
It was fun.
This chip is not planned as yet to be
commercial. They would cost $lOOO
each. But I have seen older-generation
machines engaged in such tasks as
sorting baggage going on to aircraft and
moving air freight down rollers. Those
machines used entire decks of electronic
equipment to match voice and com-
mand. This does it all with one chip,
only Icm square.
Mudge sees Austek as essentially in-
ternational. The company will have
electronic links with Santa Clara, Cali-
fornia, with Boston (the other major US
electronics centre), with Singapore and
with Europe.
Austek’s marketing people will be in
touch with manufacturers who have a
concept needing a specialised chip.
Mudge is aiming at the top end of the
market chips in the $3OO to $5OO
bracket. The world market for VSLI
chips is about $4O billion a year. The
niche at the high-value end is worth $8
billion.
This is the sort of action the Adelaide
engineers are after. The $5O million
doesn’t seem so much an impossibility
when you hear all the figures.
For Australia, it’s important to have
this technology at our fingertips. The
edge Mudge has is a software program
called SPRINT which can link func-
tional micro-systems in minutes in a job
that would have taken months.
The assemblies to some extent come
off the shelf. The basic building blocks
have been developed computers,
switches, voice-analysis modules and
they can be moved around for design
and efficiency to suit the needs of prod-
uct manufacturers.
We won’t be building the chips here.
They go on to layers of silicon,
produced in factories which represent
an investment of $lOO million or so.
Most factories are in the US but soon
they will be available in Asia as well.
Mudge sees Australia’s edge as
brainpower, not the capital-intensive
chip manufacturing technology.
And the chips are so small that the
discs of silicon, each crammed with
about 100 chips, can be packed 40 to a
canister about half the size of a shoebox.
Freight, consequently, is no problem.

Back in Adelaide, however, the indi-
vidual chips will be sawn out of the
discs, mounted, tested and bonded for
the market, with an Austek label.
For Jones, launching Austek and the
100 K chip was a golden occasion in a
silicon week. He ushered in a report rec-
ommending an information-technology
industry for Australia and switched on
the CSIRO’s new super-computer. In
Adelaide he spoke like an evangelist
trying to awake the dreamers of Austra-
lian industry in words that Phillip
Adams could have chosen for him.
But, from this week on, the euphoria
is over. The testing times of Jones tech-

MANUFACTURING
Australian
group in
China deal
A CONTRACT VALUED at ap-
proximately $6 million has been signed
between Philips and the Nanjing Radio
Factory of China, under which Philips
technology will be transferred to the
radio factory’s engineers and manufac-
turing staff. This is the second-most-suc-
cessful agreement between Philips In-
dustries Holdings Ltd and China.
The technology involved is for the
engineering and manufacture of mobile
automatic telephone systems (MATS).
Included in the contract is the supply by
Philips of an initial 17 MATS-B 2 sys-
tems and nearly 2000 associated mobile
radio telephone units type FM956. The
majority of the systems and mobile
units will be supplied in kit form and
assembled by the Nanjing factory.
Under extensive training, the factory
will become increasingly self-sufficient
over a five-year contract period.
Equipment to be supplied includes
MATS-B 2 central control and base
stations to be provided by Tekade, a
Philips Company in Germany. The mo-
bile radio telephone units will be sup-
plied by Philips-TMC Ltd, of Australia,
using the FM956-B2 transceiver which
has been adopted by British Telecom
for the United Kingdom MATS-system.
The FM956-B2 is part of the Australian
designed and manufactured micro-
processor controlled synthesised mobile
radio series recently released in Austra-
lia by Philips-TMC. This series is being
exported to Europe, North America and
South-east Asia.
Deliveries of complete equipment
are due to begin at the end of 1984, fol-
lowed by kits of part which will be de-
livered during 1985-86. □
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Old man Emu re-invigorated
WHEN Emu Hills Gold Mines NL first
issued its prospectus in April, there was
no great rush by investors to put their
money into the float.
The gold price dipped and Perth
brokers R. M. Blake and Associates
withdrew from their one-third of the
underwriting. The main underwriter
Sydney brokers Jackson Graham Moore
and Partners reduced support to a
“best endeavor” basis. The float lan-
guished under-subscribed until early
August.
Then along came the directors of a
small West Australian gold producer,
Kulim Ltd, and baled out the issue with
a $2 million cash injection that gave
Kulim a 28 percent stake in Emu Hills.
In undertaking the rescue, the Kulim
directors insisted that a package of top
prospects held privately by three Emu
directors was injected at no cost into the
Emu float.
That move has greatly enhanced
Emu’s potential. When the stock listed
last week, the 20c paid shares held their
par value and the lc options traded to
5c giving those who stagged a 19 per-
cent profit on the share-option package.
With the stags out of the way, there
will be potential for gains in this stock
over the next month or two.
Emu has on issue 24,999,995 20c
fully-paid shares, and an equal number
of options expiring on January 31,
1986. In addition, there are 12.5 million
unlisted vendor shares issued to acquire
the prospects on which the company
was to float.
Vendors included Balmoral Re-
sources NL, which now has an 8.3 per-
cent interest in Emu and Balmoral
shareholders were given an entitlement
to subscribe for 22 percent of the public
issue.
Prime among the initial prospects
was a consolidation of 13 old gold
mines covering 1998 ha over a 13km
strike length embracing the metagabbro
belt immediately north of Coolgardie.
Based on channel sampling, field
surveys and old production records,
consulting geologists Mackay and
Schnellman Pty Ltd estimated that with-
in the 40 percent of the block they in-
vestigated when taken to vertical depths
of between 10 and 60m, there was aggre-
gate potential mineralisation of 920,000
tonnes averaging 3.48gm/tonne.
The “sweetener” has since been in-
jected, with three of the original Emu
Hills directors handing over their 40
percent stake in what is known as the
Mt Burgess Mining Syndicate. This
equity is expected to be lifted substan-
tially as Emu Hills takes up the work
commitments of the remaining 15 syn-
dicate members.
The syndicate has 10 properties with-
in the Mt Margaret and Coolgardie
goldfields. Mackay and Schnellmann
has valued the properties at $l.B mil-
lion, based on only 3 percent of their
estimate of potential in-ground gold
mineralisation. Prime among the new
properties is the AWA block where po-
tential is indicated for one million
tonnes grading lOgm/tonne to a depth
of only 60m.
Drilling will begin in four weeks on
what is known as the Jolly Britain pros-
pect, just north of Coolgardie, where
open-cut potential is envisaged.
Kulim announced in its recent quar-
terly that it had proved minimum mine-
able reserves at the Sons of Gwalia
North block of 150,000 tonnes of
3.Bgm/tonne grade on which a mining
operation is to begin in October.
In the meantime, I reluctantly
reduced my holding in Cord for the
reason only that this highly successful
investment was becoming too large a
part of the portfolio.

Casino moves spark Territory row
THE BULLETIN’S report (August 14)
on plans by Northern Territory Chief
Minister Paul Everingham to buy out
Federal Hotels’ casino interests sparked
a major political row in Darwin. Critics
have charged that Everingham led the
public to believe the original agreement
provided that the government could ac-
quire Federal’s interests.
Not so, it turned out, which is why
Everingham was due to introduce legis-
lation in this week’s session to acquire
the Darwin and Alice Springs casinos
compulsorily.
Although the legislation will steam-
roll through with the usual 19 to six
majority, the Opposition will charge
that Everingham misled the public and
was premature in offering an interest in
the casinos to overseas interests before
he had completed negotiations with
Federal.
Federal has said it doesn’t want to
sell out. But, if forced to do so, it wants
$55 million compensation while all the
Territory is prepared to pay up is $47
million.
An interesting side issue is that part
of the development package the NT
offered in its tourism plan was waterside
land in a picked spot near the Mindil
Bay casino. It turns out that two of the
choice blocks in the area are owned by
the commonwealth, which doesn’t want
to hand them over. This means the ten-
der offer, advertised widely abroad, has
been altered.
As it was put to The Bulletin when it
broke the story, the question is still be-
ing raised as to why Everingham is bull-
dozing Australian private enterprise if
he has long-term plans to play on the
bigger national political stage as con-
servative leader.
Fare go
MANY airline travellers would be scep-
tical of claims that our domestic airfares
are among the cheapest in the world.
But that’s the conclusion reached in a
survey published in the August edition
of Choice, organ of the Australian Con-
sumers’ Association.
“Snip! There goes Wicks in Accounts. Snip! Snip! There go two more
salesmen. Snip! Snip! Snip! There go Barber, Woodruff and Wilson and
their BMWs. Snip...!”
Another survey produced last month
shows that international air travel has
become much cheaper than domestic
travel in the past 20 years or so. For that
reason, a rising proportion of Austra-
lian holidaymakers go overseas to the
detriment of domestic tourism.
The first surprise for many is the
Choice survey, which compared sched-
uled economy fares at December 1983
over various routes in Australia with
those for similar routes in Europe and
the United States. In all cases selected,
the Australian fares were cheaper.
The survey showed as an example on
short-haul routes ...
Distance Economy Cents/
(km) fare (SA) (km)
Melbourne/Sydney 707 133.30 18.85
Little Rock/Loulsvllle 724 173.93 24.02
London/Lyon 732 185.12 25.28
And on long-haul routes ...
Distance Economy Cents/
(km) fare (SA) (km)
Melboume/Perth 2707 309.00 11.41
Los Angeles/
New Orleans 2692 388.08 14.41
London/Kano (Nigeria) 2758 575.03 20.84
But the survey pointed out that many
more discount travel options were avail-
able overseas and suggested that Aus-
tralians tended to compare their own
domestic economy fares with the
cheapest discounts available elsewhere.
Another survey, produced by the
Queensland Tourist and Travel Corpor-
ation, shows the number of hours an
Australian male on average weekly
earnings must work to afford airfares.
Using fares applicable in April, its
international calculations are based on
advance purchase and domestic statis-
tics on full economy fares.
It shows travel more affordable than
in the 1960 s and 70s but that it has be-
come much easier to save for an inter-
national ticket than for a domestic one.
As an example, the average wage
earner worked 82.6 hours to buy a Mel-
bourne-Gold Coast ticket in 1961.
Today he works 42.5 hours. But the
same person in 1961 would have
worked 737.9 hours to buy a Brisbane-
Honolulu ticket whereas that ticket
could be earned in 108.6 hours today.
Wrong name
WILDCAT has his tail between his legs
after wrongly tipping the new chief
executive of Santos Ltd last week.

The following
corporate stones
are true, only
the names have
been changed.
##Coopers & Lybrand were asked
to look at a proposed acquisition,
Jamison Fabrications* buying Amal
Sheet Metal*.
Jamison’s merchant bank had
recommended the deal and was
standing ready to provide the funds.
We discovered that Amal’s stock
and work in progress was vastly
overvalued, a matter of $2 million
in $6 million.
Secondly, Coopers & Lybrand
noticed that the plant and
equipment (which is tax deductible)
was priced below market value.
So we told them to pay more
for the plant and less for goodwill,
which isn’t tax deductible.
By restructuring, we saved
Jamison $4 million out of $l5
million.##
## Parsons & Co. Ltd!, an old well
established company, had an
enviable profit record.
But lately, the management had
become uneasy that perhaps
future prospects weren’t so bright.
However, they couldn’t tell if
their worries were justified.
Certainly their auditing,
taxation and legal advisers hadn’t
reported any warning signs.
And Parsons had no strategic
planning adviser.
So they had no orderly method
of assessing what would happen
DDB 3277.033
in the long term if they continued
their business as it was.
Fortunately Parsons decided to
call in management consultants
from Coopers & Lybrand.
We observed that Parsons were
overly dependent on one market.
And our investigations proved
that the products and methods
that had served them so well in the
past were now inappropriate for
that market.
The company was, in fact,
marching towards a precipice.
Parsons’ auditing, taxation and
advice had been the very best.
But without a strategic planner
to complete the picture, it could
have been fatally incomplete.
Coopers & Lybrand proposed
a forward plan that has now set
Parsons on a path to secure the
company’s future.^#
Several major companies
were well advanced in their merger
plans when they decided to get
Coopers & Lybrand involved, just
as a precaution.
We found that their method of
merging would have caused
significant tax liability to certain
shareholders.
The very people whose consent
was needed if the merger was to
happen at all.
Coopers & Lybrand not only
devised an arrangement that
avoided the tax liability.
We had it approved in advance
by the tax commissioner.
The shareholders were never
aroused to become obstructive,
and the deal went ahead.^^
From these stories, one thing is clear.
Getting piecemeal advice from
bankers, management consultants, tax
advisers and lawyers can be hazardous.
Because each sees your business
from his own limited viewpoint.
Advice which may be sound in one
area, can seriously disadvantage you in
another. A unified strategy is needed.
That is why Coopers & Lybrand retain
highly qualified professionals in finance,
tax and management consulting, under
one roof. So they can consult with each
other, and with your legal advisers if
necessary, before advising you.
Although you may know us only as
chartered accountants, fully 60% of our
business is nowin giving business advice.
Finally, if you need money, it's our job
to find it in the market as cheaply as
possible. Rather than to push you into
borrowing from us.

Back on board
THE irrepressible Ken McMahon offi-
cially made it back on to the boards last
week with the listing of two companies
he chairs and in which he holds stakes
Orca Petroleum NL and MC Mining
NL.
The former chairman and founder of
Mineral Securities Australia Ltd a
spectacular casualty of the mining
boom in 1971 was out with Orca man-
aging director Peter Jamieson last
Thursday afternoon celebrating the suc-
cessful listing of the oil explorer. Orca’s
25 cent fully-paid shares came on at 21
cents with a last sale of 20 cents while
options, issued free on a one-for-one
basis, opened at 9 cents and closed at 8
cents. Stags made 16 percent on the
package before brokerage. What
pleased underwriter Jackson Graham
Moore & Partners was a low turnover of
278,000 ordinary shares compared with
the public issue of 40 million. Some
150,000 options were traded.
Orca was formed in the ARI stable in
1983 but plans for its float were inter-
rupted late last year when a dispute
and subsequent reshuffle removed
McMahon and Jamieson from the ARI
board. The partners have negotiated
good acreage in the Euromanga and
Canning basins, upgraded steadily
through other oil discoveries. □
THE CHARTIST
Aberfoyle soars on Hellyer find
by Russell Lander
THE Hellyer base metals discovery on
the west coast of Tasmania appears to
be the largest mineral find in Australia
since WMC’s initial Olympic Dam an-
nouncements. Aberfoyle (90 percent)
and Paringa (10 percent) have turned up
a rich silver, lead and zinc deposit 3km
from their Que River mine estimated to
contain about 5 million tonnes of min-
eralisation “with reasonable chances of
further increase.”
The partners are also examining
other targets in this area. Grades at
Hellyer are apparently similar to the
Que River mine which has ore reserves
of about 1.9 million tonnes grading 12.7
percent zinc, 7.4 percent lead, 205
gms/tonne of silver, 3.5 gms/tonne of
gold and 0.4 percent copper.
The two Bridge Data charts show
monthly and weekly price/volume data
on Aberfoyle and bear out the trans-
formation in the share price in recent
weeks as a result of the Hellyer bomb-
shell.
At a stroke, Aberfoyle has embarked
upon a new primary uptrend and in this
respect is unique among Australia’s
leading mining stocks. In that there
were no consolidation patterns pre-
ceding blast-off, these charts provide
little clue as to the upside potential of
this stock. However, a daily chart shows
the stock to be forming a hesitation pat-
tern in the range $8.50 to $9.20. A break
above $9.20 would be very bullish as it
would signal a new run. A charting ob-
servation is that, in excited markets,
“flags occur at half mast.” Given that
Aberfoyle is forming a flag, the next leg
up could be equal to the first which
would give an upside reading to around
$12.50.

Sugar is not so sweet
by Bert Kelly
LAST WEEK I told how Fred had
induced me to go with him to Queens-
land to see if he should sell his South
Australian wheat-sheep property to buy
a sugar farm. One reason for this was
his conviction that, in Queensland, he
would not have to suffer the creeping
socialism that dogs us down here.
However, it has been a nasty shock
for Fred to find that sugar growing is
under the iron hand of the Queensland
Government with the willing agreement
of the sugar industry leaders who like
being looked after even if it is bad for
them.
I have had many sceptical enquiries
about last week’s statement that Fred
would not be allowed into the industry
unless he could prove he was a person
of good character. People seemed to
think I must have made that up. But
under section 37 of the Regulation of
Sugar Cane Prices Act, applicants to
buy land with an entitlement to grow
sugar “must demonstrate that the prices
or terms of a proposed sale, lease or
sub-lease, letting or transfer, are not un-
reasonable or unfair and that the buyer
or lessee is a fit and proper person to
hold an assignment.”
There is nothing in writing in the Act
about the desirability of being a mem-
ber of a political party or secret society
but no doubt this could be mentioned at
the personal interview.
The same Act contains the stern in-
junction that the Central Sugar Board,
when allotting entitlements to grow
sugar, must have regard to “the pro-
vision of the utmost employment of
labor economically possible under reas-
onable wages and conditions.” It is sur-
prising they do not command their
farmers to use horses instead of tractors
to create employment.
Last week the land agent scared the
daylights out of Fred by telling him how
closely the Queensland Government
controlled the way cane farmers
managed their farms. This week we will
take a quick look at how the milling side
of the industry is controlled by the gov-
ernment, this last bastion against social-
ism.
I have before me a copy of the
Queensland Government Gazette dated
April 20, 1983, which spells out the
regulations to control the relations be-
tween the Rocky Point Sugar Mill and
the growers who supply it. I understand
that these are typical of what is required
for all mills. There are four closely-
printed pages of the most minute direc-
tions about what has to be done and
when. Crushing had to commence on
August 2 that year (3!4 months ahead)
and from then on all procedures were
either spelt out in regulations or were
under the control of the cane inspector
who controlled everything else.
The land agent told Fred that the
regulations direct each farmer to send
his cane to a particular mill. The costs of
transport are averaged over all suppliers
to the mill, thus destroying any incen-
tive to cut corners in transport.
Further, the allocation of cane to the
mills is done on historical and equity
grounds rather than on the basis of what
is the best way to manage matters today.
Yet conditions now are so different to
those in 1915 when the industry ar-
rangements seem to have been set in
concrete. It is not surprising, then, to
find that mill numbers and locations
have remained unaltered for 60 years in
spite of enormous changes in technol-
ogy and the size of the industry.
The regulations that control the
sugar industry are centred on protecting
it from the discomfort of change. The
industry was conceived and grew up in
the sheltering arms of governments and
it hates the thought of being weaned,
even late in life. This dependence on
government support explains the regu-
lation which I quoted before that de-
mands the maximum use of labor.
I know that change is almost always
uncomfortable. But a bucket of worms
that stops turning soon dies and people
who are not disturbed on their feather
beds soon get drowsy.
Cane farmers seem to have faced the
traumas of change on their farms but
they seem scared of change to their en-
titlement system and particularly to the
way their cane is handled after it leaves
their farm gates. Yet such changes are
inevitable in the long run.
This is not only the opinion of wheat
farmers such as Fred and I or even that
know-all Eccles. I quote now a retiring
official of the Central Sugar Cane Prices
Board who said last year: “The regula-
tions of the Sugar Cane Producers Act
creak and growl like an old un-oiled
windmill!” Those bushies who have
such a windmill and most of us have
will have a very clear idea of the be-
haviour of the sugar industry.
Fred came back home with his tail
between his legs. He says that he never
wants to hear another word about Uncle
Sir Joh being the last bastion against so-
cialism. □

PIERPONT
And now a word from Pierpont...
AS THE Avarice Party now has four
members, which is at least as many as
the Liberals, Pierpont has been allowed
equal time on television as soon as
Andrew Peacock has finished speaking.
Fond as he is of young Andrew,
Pierpont must confess that he is by no
means sure that he will have time to
watch the telecast. If it turns out to be a
matter of watching either Andrew on
economics for 20 minutes or the test
pattern, your correspondent will be
faced with an agonising choice.
In fact, the Avarice Party has done
better than the Liberals because we
managed to attract a few suitable gov-
ernment sponsors.
The draft script runs as follows, start-
ing with a word from the Australian
Taxation Office:
Jingle
Pay your tax today, today
Send that cheque in right away
Dollars, gold or pounds OK
We'll take money any way.
And now, here is the Avarice Party
economic strategy.
Other parties have from time to time
proposed to curb public spending.
None of them ever have, of course, the
reason being that they are too wishy-
washy, not to mention downright insin-
cere, in the approach to the problem.
Nothing could illustrate this better
than the current state of government
financing. The Federal Government is
currently receiving $5O billion a year
but still cannot balance its budget.
Even Pierpont, whose luxurious
tastes are notorious, could run out with
a surplus if his income were $5O billion.
The way Pierpont sees it, the income is
the problem because expenditure keeps
rising beyond it. The Avarice Party pro-
poses to resolve this problem by
eliminating government income alto-
gether. Expenditure will then automati-
cally drop to zero.
Politicians will still be free to prom-
ise the voters such necessities as com-
passionate leave for homosexuals but in
the absence of taxes or any other gov-
ernment revenue they will have to meet
the cost out of their own pockets.
To ease the pain of transition we will
begin by lopping off the bits of govern-
ment that have no apparent rational
basis, such as the Legal Aid Service and
the Australia Council.
But how, you ask, will we fund items
such as the navy? Pierpont will be back
to tell you immediately after this break.
Music: Give me land, lots of land
under starry skies above . . .
Voice over: Tired of farming? Weary
of pulling that plough and hauling those
bales? Well, the good news is the army’s
got a deal for you. Just go to your local
recruiting office, sign over your dusty old
acres to the sergeant and he'll give you a
rifle and a Queen's shilling. Then you can
go back and live on your property at our
expense and spend the rest of your life
sowing land mines. Don't be a farmy, join
the army.
The Avarice Party believes in giving
the Australian public exactly the
amount of government it is prepared to
pay for. Let us say, as various people in
the navy have been saying, that the
people want an aircraft carrier. Fine!
Everyone who wants an aircraft carrier
can write in, giving his, her or its name
and address. Say 100 people write in
and the cost of a carrier is $2 billion; we
will then send each of those 100 a bill
for $2O million. Problem solved. Work-
ing at it this way, we should be able to
fund everything from universities to the
Oats Marketing Board. We will also
find out precisely which parts of the
government the Australian public feel
like funding. But how will we fund so-
cial welfare? We will be back to tell you
just after another of these blasted com-
mercials ...
This is the Overseas Telecommunica-
tions Corporation speaking, Why don't
you send a Herogram today to your local
MP? Abroad and alone throughout the
Antipodean winter, they need to know
you are cheering them on. Overseas our
little Aussie battlers are achieving great
feats of skill and daring . . . smuggling
their mistresses into international confer-
ences as delegates . . . filling out Customs
forms in unknown languages such as
English ... let them know you're right
behind them. Send a Herogram now or,
better still, just send us money.
The Avarice Party intends to devolve
the social welfare system on to commu-
nity self-help groups. The plan is
sketchy so far but we thought individ-
uals who were related by blood might


have some natural affinity for each other
and we are toying with the notion of
combining them into an economic unit
which we will call a “family.”
The idea is that if we remove income
taxes entirely the high-earning members
of this group will be able to support the
low and non-earning ones, such as
small children, the elderly and the in-
firm. It would appear logically desirable
to make this a permanently interdepen-
dent arrangement throughout life.
Babies, for example, could be supported
by their parents and when the parents
grew old they in turn could be sup-
ported by their mature children.
To reinforce this permanency would
logically require a legal contract of
some kind. The one we have in mind
has been tentatively named “marriage”
and would normally take place between
one adult male and one adult female.
This is a radical and novel idea in
these times, of course, and Pierpont
frankly doesn’t give it much hope. In-
deed, we are quite willing to consider a
better alternative, if anybody can sug-
gest one.
Perhaps we could help make the con-
tract stick by adding some supernatural
mysticism to it, or even making the two
people subject to the contract swear an
oath in a ceremony conducted by some
religious sect such as the Hare Krishnas
or the Movement Against Uranium
Mining.
By this time the audience will have
switched across in droves to Sale of the
Century, so we will sign off with our last
message.
Hi, this is Bruce. Why don’t all you
swinging hutches out there ring in now
and ask about the ABC’s Closet Club?
We’re getting out of the closet and
around the world now and if you join this
month you’ll be eligible for the draw in
our Love Lotto. First prize is a trip for two
to Acapulco and second is an R.M. Wil-
liams handbag. See you, darls.
CHESS
Mind over matter
by Terrey Shaw
AS MAE WEST was fond of saying, it’s
not the men in your life that is import-
ant but the life in your men.
Certainly on the chess board it’s not
the number of men you have on hand
that counts but what they are contrib-
uting to the battle.
The most sinned-against pieces in
this regard are the Rooks. Just because
Rooks are born in the corners of the
board it doesn’t mean they have to die
there. The way to breathe life into them
is to put them on open files, down which
they can cut a swathe through to enemy
territory.
Forgetting to give all the pieces a
slice of the action in this way probably
is the single most common fault of the
improving player. Mechanically doing a
head count to see who is winning on
material is pointless when some of your
men may as well not be on the board for
all their influence on the game.
In such circumstances, what usually
decides who has the gun in his pocket is
the ability to muster a greater concen-
tration of forces in the specific areas
under contention usually around the
Kings.
A good example is the following
game from this year’s Sydney inter-club
competition.
After mounting an early K-side at-
tack which just fails to break through,
Black falls victim to a sharp counter ac-
tion in the centre. Although he is the
equivalent of a piece ahead in the final
position, Black finds his Rooks reduced
to the role of helpless spectators.

INTELLIGENCER
THE LAYMAN'S GOIDE TO SEAT DISTRIBUTION
It’s al! in the name
THE Victorian Government
has changed the name of its
maximum security division at
Pentridge from Jika Jika to K
Division.
Jika Jika happens to be the
name of the new state seat to
be contested by local ALP
president George Crawford.
Many people are musing
dver the possibility that the
change at Pentridge was
forced by the prospect of
tmmper stickers such as:
“George Crawford for Jika
Jika.”
Science and land rights in conflict
LAND RIGHTS and arche-
ology have moved apart in
Australia. Dr Betty Meehan,
President of the Australian
Archeological Association,
says that she tried for months
to influence the recently-pro-
claimed Interim Heritage Bill
but was fobbed off until the
last minute.
This is significant because
archeologists, anthropologists
and Aboriginal groups are re-
garded as natural allies. An
archeologist told The Bull-
etin: “The blacks are going to
lose their best friends.”
The problem is that arche-
ology is a science which does
not rest easily with established
ideas and which does not fit
neatly into popular Aborigi-
nal notions of racial origins.
There are no Aboriginal
archeologists with the auth-
ority to combat the urban op-
portunists.
According to Professor
John Mulvaney, the pioneer-
ing pre-historian at the Aus-
tralian National University,
this situation differs radically
from that in the US where In-
dians are working on ancient
relics as archeologists and cu-
rators.
Australian archeology is
an exciting field. Once
thought to have been some
kind of evolutionary back-
water, Australia now appears
to have received immigrants
from southern Asia and
maybe even China perhaps
40,000 years ago.
As well, there are theories
that giant kangaroos, pos-
sums, echidnas and wombats
were not nearly so ancient as
was thought only recently.
Professor Richard Wright of
Sydney University has been
hinting that human contact
destroyed them perhaps only
6000 years ago.
It’s a new idea and it re-
quires new ideas about Abor-
igines and their ancient world.
Wright is concerned that
sacred sites legislation will be-
come confused with arche-
ological sites and that land-
owners will refuse permission
for any digging just in case
something that comes under
sacred site legislation is dis-
covered and their land is
alienated.
For the time being,
Meehan is more concerned
about the immediate threat of
the kind raised by Jim Berg in
Victoria (B, August 21). She
thinks that commonsense will
prevail, although she doubts
whether archeologists can
hope for the conditions they
have assumed hitherto.
Her primary concern
and that of the Australian
Archeological Association
is that archeological material
with no direct relationship to
known historical persons
should be conserved with the
best attention possible.
Aboriginal site museums
controlled by local Aboriginal
communities are a possible
solution.
Socking it
to Rupert
THE London Daily Mail re-
ports from Chicago that
Rupert Murdoch’s Sun-Times’
local rival, the Chicago Trib-
une, has hit back at Rup’s
bingo onslaught.
The Trib’s star columnist
Mike Royko has promised to
give away a pair of his socks
for every reader who sends in
10 of his columns. For a new
13-week subscription, he’ll
sign the socks personally.
So far: 2500 new subs and
5000 signed socks.
Family fun
LONDON’S wacky Labor
Party branch has put out a
new socialist version of that
traditional children’s card
game, Happy Families.
Instead of Mr Bun the
Baker and his ilk the Poms
now get such non-sexist and
committed characters as Lucy
the Lesbian, the Politiko fam-
ily, Engels the Cat, Muriel the
Artist, Guy the Gay Bookshop
Worker, Patience the Peace
Campaigner’s Mother and
last but not least Simon the
Social Worker.
“Yes, lovely view, Denis, but there’s something
unpleasant about it that 1 can’t quite put my finger on.”


Norm wins another one
IS THERE no limit to the
craftiness of Builders Lab-
orers’ Federation supremo
Norm Gallagher? Just four
weeks ago building em-
ployers, under the umbrella of
the National Industrial Con-
struction Council, withdrew
from de-registration proceed-
ings in the Federal. Court after
the union had given undertak-
ings to the ACTU and the
Federal Government about
improvements in its industrial
conduct and abiding by
ACTU rules, particularly re-
garding demarcation disputes.
The BLF also signed the
NICC’s “peace package” for
the building industry the
two key elements being eligi-
bility for a portable superan-
nuation scheme funded by
employers and agreement to a
disputes settling procedure.
Why then, you might won-
der, has the BLF been able to
get away with the recent viol-
ent scenes involving its picket
lines outside the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, the ignoring
of Arbitration Commission
rulings and the intimidation
of other workers which has
cost the Victorian Govern-
ment close to $1 million in
police protection of the site?
The answer is that the BLF
managed to secure agreement
from the ACTU and the Fed-
eral Government to exclude
the MCG lights matter from
its undertakings on industrial
conduct because the dispute
was underway already.
As a bonus for Norm,
Newsteel Pty Ltd, the Mel-
bourne construction irm car-
rying out the MCG contract,
is a member of the Metal
Trades Industry Association
rather than any of the build-
ing employer bodies under the
NICC.
As such Newsteel does not
have any protection from
BLF bullying under the build-
ing industry peace package so
Norm is playing within
bounds.
Gloomy outlook
NOT everyone in Los Angeles

In the property review, two

ing to show a St Kilda Road
complex, had the well-known
facade of the Collins Street
Rialto buildings in the fore-
ground. The second, sup-
posed to show the Rialto de-
velopment, was surrounded
by trees more typical of St
Kilda Road. Page 24 then had
the bridge and chess columns
transposed.
Unholy row
at the ABC
THE ABC is threatened with
another furore likely to equal
those caused by the proposal
to abolish FM quality music
broadcasting and the granting
of equal rights to homosexual
spouses. It is considering the
removal of the daily early-
morning Bible readings.
Religious broadcasting
people are cagey about dis-
cussing the matter beyond
saying that they “just don’t
know what’s going to hap-
pen.” What they do know is
that “the whole morning radio
format” is under review and
the Bible readings may go.
If so, the churches are like-
ly to raise what even they
might call Merry Hell. One
fact is certain: the ABC is not
recording any more Bible
readings until people at the
top including the board and
the new boy from BBC
Bristol, Robin Hicks have
reviewed all ABC breakfast-
time broadcasting.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
IF YOU ARE running as fast as
you can to avoid being gam-
moned, always take extra time to
decide on your move if you have a
“hole” in your board.
Look at the illustration. White
had been penned up in Black’s
home board and Black removed
his men without being forced to
leave a shot.
White is desperate to bear off a
man in order to avoid the gam-
mon. He rolls a 6-1. What’s the
play?
It may seem obvious to bring
in two men Wl2 to W 6 and W 7
to W 6 but closer inspection will
reveal that White will get only one
more roll (providing Black doesn’t
throw a double).
If White does bring in two men
he will have two left in his outer
board on W 9. This means he must
roll a double on his next roll to
take off a man. The question is:
which doubles? Double Is or 2s
won’t fit the bill so double 3s or
better will have to be the order of
the day.
But the point to watch is that
White has a “hole” in his board;
the 5 point is empty. This means
that double 5s will be a loser for
White; the roll will not allow him
to bear off a man. Only double 3s,
4s and 6s will save the gammon,
making White an 11 to 1 shot
against saving it.
Back now to the 6-1 roll. Sup-
pose White moved the same 6
(Wl2 to W 6) but then, purposely
leaving three men outside instead
of two, used the 1 to drop a man
from W 6 to W 5. Now double 5s
become a gammon-saving roll,
making White an 8 to 1 shot.
Although 8 to 1 is not particu-
larly hot it is a lot better than 11
to 1.

Opening lead king of clubs.
THERE ARE contracts appar-
ently impossible to make that
nevertheless can be made with
precisely the right mixture of luck
and skill.
Lets say you’re in six hearts
and West leads a club. Certainly
your prospects are poor but
strangely enough they’re not
hopeless. You win the club with
the ace and cash the A-K of
spades, both opponents following
suit.
For deceptive purposes you
now play the jack of spades,
hoping West will discard a dia-
mond or a club on the assumption
his partner holds the queen of
spades. Unfortunately this hope
does not materialise when West
plays the 10 of spades.
You can’t afford to discard
dummy’s club on this trick, which
seems certain to lead to down one,
so you ruff the jack of spades with
the jack of hearts.
When East discards on this
trick, a very favorable develop-
ment, you lead the king of dia-
monds from dummy, covered by
East with the ace.
There is now the sweet smell of
success in the air. You ruff and
continue with the queen of spades,
at which point West can do
nothing to stop the slam. When he
discards a club, you ruff the spade
with the king of hearts, discard
your club loser on the king of dia-
monds and lead a trump.
West wins with the ace but that
is the only trick you lose. That
brew you cooked up early in the
play proved to be the one and
only winning concoction.

The Australian environment is
among the harshest in the world.
You've got to be tough when
you drive off road, and you've got
to have a tough vehicle like Toyota
Land Cruiser or HiLux 4WD.
The engineering that goes into
these famous vehicles has proven
itself in this country for twenty-five
years, ever since Sir Leslie Thiess
brought the first Land Cruisers in to
help build the Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric project.
The feeling of reliability they
give you is unequalled. Their sales are
unequalled, too.
You'll see them used in Australia's
Antarctic Territory, by police, by the
Landcruiser Station Wagon, Hi Lux 4x4 Xtra Cab.

foresters, farmers, and every hard-
working, hard-living group you care
to name.
