IK SPORT Of IMNKMG
At BMW we have a definite
attitude to motor racing. We would
rather return from the track with an
innovation than with a trophy.
For to us, every race is an
opportunity to test a theory or improve
a component.
Every car we build for the track
is an experiment in automotive
technology.
And every lesson we learn on the
track we apply directly to our
production cars.
We believe it is this philosophy
that distinguishes a car that carries the
BMW symbol from all others.
For while others regard factors
such as peak performance and
superlative manoeuvrability as
desirable, to us they are absolutely
compulsory.


RECARO
Hertz
But perhaps even more impor-
tant than our commitment to research
and technological innovation is our
intrinsic certainty that without
individual brilliance and disciplined
creativity, cars such as the 318 i, the
323 i, 520 i, 528 i, and the 735 i would
never have seen the light of day.
Let alone produce the sheer
pleasure experienced by those who
drive them.
These demands on the creative
capacities of our designers are the
most important reasons for our
involvement in motor sport.
When we are asked what
think about sport we reply:
Thinking is our sport.

A world without
polypropylene is impossible to
imagine today.
Most thin-walled food
containers such as ice cream and
margarine tubs are made from
this highly economical and
accommodating polymer.
So too are ball point pens,
plastic bottles, eye droppers, kitchen
utensils and a thousand and one
other products in daily use.
Hoechst are the world's
No. 3 supplier ot polypropylene,
marketed as Hostalen PP # and, in

It’s important to the future of this country that
enough people believe in and invest in its vast natural
resources. In so many ways, BP Australia has been
doingjust that.
Once again, BP is backing Australian energy.
But this time the energy takes the form of work,
sweat, determination and all the other qualities that
make up a tennis champion.
As well as sponsoring the Davis Cup team,
SSBM/8P195
BP is also supporting the new Tennis Achievers
programme, which is pledged to finding good junior
players and turning them into great senior players.
By helping to develop these
precious ‘resources’, BP hopes that
Australia may soon re-emerge as a
tennis power.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Foreign affairs in disarray
It is strange that the Liberal Party does
not follow successful election tactics
used by the great Menzies; especially
with Andrew Peacock, a former minis-
ter of External Affairs, for a leader.
Menzies made foreign affairs and de-
fence the centre of his election plat-
forms.
Look, at what opportunity adoption
of foreign affairs would present to the
Liberals:
When Malcolm Fraser retired from
politics after defeat at the polls the
country’s external affairs were in excel-
lent shape.
Our relations with Indonesia,
troubled by the East Timor Affair, were
on the mend. All other ASEAN mem-
bers maintained friendly relations with
us. The ANZUS alliance was un-
troubled by exposure to back-biting idi-
ocy from socialist governments. China
and Japan were seen as friendly trading
partners. Even the USSR was a satisfied
customer for our wheat.
Our efforts to gain access to the EEC-
markets, though forcibly stated, and un-
successful, did not result in a trade-war.
On the whole, nobody doubted that
Australia belonged into the camp of
Western civilised nations. We were sig-
nificant members of the (British) Com-
monwealth of Nations.
Relations with Third World
countries, though uneven, varied be-
tween warm respect from Zimbabwe, to
indifference by Vietnam. The average
tended to be friendly, tempered by lack
of interest a concomitant with grow-
ing distance from Australia. Nobody
took our bickering with South Africa
seriously except Malcolm Fraser.
Now, look at the changed scene of
international politics today:
Far (left) travelling Leslie (sic)
Hayden conducted in the 18 months of
Labor in power, a foreign policy of
Janus-like duplicity, with a wavering
prime minister making different noises
in the background.
Whom are other state leaders to
trust? Can any Labor minister be taken
seriously?
Gone are the days of the strong
bonds of alliance between the members
of ANZUS. No superpower guarantees
Australian sovereignty.
Indonesia mistrusts'us, as the Labor
Government blows both hot and cold,
over the East Timor affair. The ASEAN
officially told Hayden not to meddle
where he has no business to do so.
After a propaganda trip to the East
by the Prime Minister, when he earned
the great honor of being called “Bob”
by the Prime Minister of Japan, all
Japanese promises proved to be illu-
sory. We have no working arrange-
ment with the EEC. Dumped, surplus
agricultural products destroy our export
markets. The crowning glory of Mr
Hayden’s career was when he told off
Andrei Gromyko, the minister for for-
eign affairs and Politbureau-member of
the USSR.
Australia, after 18 months of Labor
stewardship is Very, very much alone at
the end of a long line from anywhere.
Not even a takeover target. It cannot
defend itself, says a spokesman from the
Department of Defence.
“They’re buying a new six mainframe satellite-linked security system to try
to stop the leaks. ”

ABC News chiefs keen
Glennys Bell’s article on the news and
current affairs format being developed
by the ABC (B, September 18) suggests
the proposal effectively eliminates the
primacy of ABC News.
However, it should be noted that
senior news executives with long ABC
experience have been closely associated
with development of the concept.
They, along with other ABC staff, are
excited by the possibilities of the
proposed program.
The agreed editorial guidelines say
that hard news coverage will provide
the core material for the program and
the format will be developed around
this.
Your readers can be assured that
ABC Television will continue to pro-
vide a comprehensive and authoritative
news service in 1985.

Lange’s curious cure-all
The priorities of New Zealand Prime
Minister David Lange are curious to say
the least. When one compares the en-
ergy he has devoted to his crusade
against nuclear weapons with his gov-
ernment’s copycat domestic policies, it
is easy to see which has been placed on
the back-burner.
Regardless of which party is in
power, it would appear that economic
policy in New Zealand is gimmicky
rather than innovative.
Muldoon’s panacea was resource-
based technology. To be fair to the man,
there were Australian state premiers
who got taken in by the same cargo-cult
of salvation through cheap energy. The
difference being that Muldoon
bequeathed a herd of economic white
elephants whose cost has added sub-
stantially to his country’s overseas debt.
Lange appears to be looking to that
Hawke-Keating brainchild, the econ-
omic summit, as his cure-all. Using it
requires no reflective thinking by the
New Zealand government. Just follow
the instructions printed on the packet.
It is as if “consensus” has become a
magic incantation. Say but the word
and my economy shall be healed.
Apparently, Lange’s private ob


session with nuclear disarmament is his
reason for being in politics. By contrast,
his interest in the health of the national
economy appears limited to be extent
by which this affects his government’s
re-election prospects.
Dear David, what does it profit a
politician if he gains the attention of the
whole world yet suffers the loss of his
credibility?
If you cannot answer that, just ask
Sir Robert Muldoon.

Defining moral codes
Deputy Prime Minister Bowen’s call to
Catholics to join the Labor Party and
get their political act together is an in-
junction that should be heeded by all
religious denominations.
Politics is about power. It breeds
upon diversities of rival groups whether
political or otherwise. Religion purports
to be apart from mundane politics and
claims to be primarily concerned with
moral codes of behaviour. Both politics
and religion are directed to the persua-
sion of minds of mankind and the
power of both becomes polarised when
such persuasion is directed to the same
ends; in particular those morally ac-
ceptable to the community.
President Reagan’s view that re-
ligious morality is part of politics and
“And how are our new infants behaving this morning?"
the Hawke Government’s about-face
funding of private schools gives local
recognition to Reagan’s realism.
The power base of politics is philos-
ophy. To retain power, political expedi-
ency and political morality demands
compromise or “consensus”. The very
art of politics is compromise.
The power base of religious denomi-
nations is philosophy. Unlike politics, a
tenet of religious belief is that “in
articles of faith or morals to be held by
all the faithful” there can be no compro-
mise, yet the world-wide ecumenical
movement supports a compromise of
faith and morals.
Political parties are divided upon
their moral stand. What is food for one
is poison for another. For the zealot,
politics itself is a religion. These politi-
cal animals seek power for power’s
sake. To them all’s fair, not only in love

and war, but also for the party to retain
power at any price. For them political
expediency and morality are one. This
was the Askin era code and the same
code probably obtains today at state
and federal levels. This class of political
morality is the hallmark of despots. It
has existed since time began and is as
dangerous as religious fanaticism.
If our national goal is Advance Aus-
tralia certain moral issues should be
recognised by the majority as tran-
scending political bias and petty poli-
tics. Do most of us accept:—
(1) That the end justifies the means?
Is it morally acceptable for “party soli-
darity sake” to cover up commissions of
breaches of state or commonwealth
laws by politicians, judges or other citi-
zens is bribery of officials acceptable
community behaviour?
(2) That all are equal before the law?
If during a gang war innocent by-
standers are murdered, should not
known members of such gangs present
at the shoot-out be charged as ac-
cessories to murder?
(3) That community standards of
morality do not include the Ten Com-
mandments? Killing, rape, theft, adul-
tery are acceptable if you are not found
out?
(4) That because organised crime im-
plicates VIPs, in the interest of good
government, it should not be classified a
specific indictable offence or a crime
against the nation nor should the demo-
cratic considerations of individual
rights be suspended in the community
war against it?
If your answer to (1), (3) and (4) is
“Yes” and to (2) “No”, Lionel Bowen’s
call is indeed justified for no society can
survive without a defined moral code
which all adhere to.

Office or the boozer) and we’ll try to
track down all those farmers loaded
with their $25,000 subsidy monies, or
sitting in the shade scratching them-
selves while the Treasurer banks their
$2OOO hectare subsidy for not growing
their tobacco quota.
Bert, old son, you and I both know
that when the smoker buys a packet of
cigarettes, less than 10 cents is for the
tobacco and the rest goes to Mr
Keating, the manufacturer and the re-
tailer, and in all states except Queens-
land, 10 cents to the state government.
Now let’s suppose (as they supposed
at the lAC enquiry) that we replaced all
this (subsidised?) Australian tobacco
with Indian tobacco. Bert, you and I
both know this would mean a saving (in
theory) to the smoker of a couple of
cents per packet at the most.
Now Bert, all of my neighbors,
whom I’d like you to meet (like Egidio
and Mehmet, Francesco and Nunzio,
and Ted and Elio) say that as far as they
are concerned a Government that wants
to import cheaper tobacco from India

No ‘rant’ on refugees
Mr Ya’Acov Ben Uri would serve his
cause much better if he refrained from
the insulting and false allegations he
makes against me (B, September 4).
I have never at any time “ranted”
against Jewish refugees.
I find it revolting that I should be
compared with those who ran National
Socialist Germany. How often must I
stress that 1 am opposed to all policies
of centralised power.

Better battles to fight
As a devout Christian, believing God is
the source of all life, I am disturbed to
hear stupid protestant sects support
“creationalism” and deny God could
have created life by a process of evol-
ution.
I am further disturbed to hear them
state God also chose to create life in
what we know as days God is infinite
he is not limited by time or anything
finite.
Evolution has yet to be fully proved
even if daily more and more evidence
is found to support it in various parts of
the world. But even if evolution ceases
to be a theory and can be accepted as a
fact it will never rule out God as the
catalyst of all life.
Protestants would do better to fight


'State of the art' fax
is here in two brilliant
new Ricoh machines
that are unsurpassed
for advanced facsimile
communication features.
At last, every corporate or individual fox
requirement is catered for by one of these two
extraordinary machines.
There's the new Ricoh FX 5000 desk top - the
Ultimate fox machine. And the Ricoh FX 120 Ultra
Compact - the 'state of the art' mini that takes
the space of two telephone books, yet
outperforms others that take up half the office
and cost thousands more.
Incorporating the latest technology in their on-
board computers, these new Ricoh models
satisfy every corporate or individual fax
requirement superbly, giving you fox features
and quality that are quite simply the 'state of the
art' in facsimile operation.
Read on.
And discover the features that moke Ricoh the
the Redial function will automatically redial the
number twice at 5 minute intervals if the
receivers line is busy.
Naturally, no line charges are incurred until the
connection is made.
A 3 ability and Enlargement function
The FX 5000 can transmit originals up to A 3 size,
and can automatically reduce the transmitted
copy to a size requested by the receiving end.
"Send later" function
'State of the Art' Ricohfax can be programmed
for the unattended transmission of documents
when telephone charges are cheapest, creating
considerable savings on intra/inter state and
international transmissions.
And because staff don't hove to wait bock for
cheaper transmission times, the savings increase!
Sequential polling
Ricoh's advanced Sequential Polling Function
permits documents of up to 30 B 4 pages to be
received from up to 20 fax machine locations in
one programmed operation.
This programmed polling can be 'poll immedi-
ate', or on a 'poll later' basis to take advantage of
lower off peak telephone charges.
The master machine simply dials each location
number in sequence, triggering document
transmission.
Voice Request Key
The Voice Request Key activates the
conversation mode indicating that one party
wishes to speak to the other after sending the
document. Ideal for discussion of the transmitted
material without incurring the cost of a further
phone call.
Unattended Reception
Through a command from the transmitter, the
receiving side can be activated to accept
documents at any time, enabling the receipt of
important documents after hours.
TransmitterTerminol Identification (TTI)
The name, transmission time and date can be
automatically printed on the received copy,
enabling instant identification of the sender.
Half Tone Mode
This permits accurate reproduction of photo-
graphs and illustrations, in addition to enhancing
the reproduction of graphics and line work.
Copier facility
The Copier facility lets the operator check the
receiving copy quality, in addition to simply using
the machine as an office copier.
Automatic Document Width Detection
Ricohfax automatically senses the width of
incoming documents, and adjusts its receiving
mode to the required paper size.

15 second 'super speed' transmission
Ricohfax gives you an amazing 15 second per
page across town or around the world
transmission speed with the FX 5000,
saving at least 25% on telephone
charges over most other machines.
And the ultra-compact FX 120 cuts
transmission time to an incredible
20 seconds per page!
Auto Redial
If any receiving fax machine in a
programmed calling sequence
does not answer or is engaged on the
first call, it is automatically redialled at the end
of the programme, eliminating expensive staff
stand-by.
In normal use (not
multiple programme),

Confidentiality through RTI
y Confidential documents cannot be transmit-

Ricoh's built-in Remote Terminal Identification
function (RTI).
G 2 ond G 3 compatibility
Ricohfax automatically
checks the other
location's mode
whether sending
or receiving,
facilitating easy
communication
with any G 2 or
G 3 machine.
Automotic Document Feeder
The Ricohfox automatic document feeder
permits the automatic transmission of a
document of up to 30 pages, eliminating the
need for on operator and creating further savings
when using the'send later’function.
Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)
Documentation which contains small
characters, fine lines or graphics ore 'read' by
the MTF, and effective transmission assured.
Full reporting facilities
You'd expect fox machines with a 'state of the
art' brain to not only know what they're doing,
but to tell you about it, too. So Ricohfox gives you
a complete list of operating reports like the
Transmit Confirmation Report (TCR), which
confirms which document went where and the
length of individual transmission times so that
faxing can be correctly charged out.
Charge code facility
The ability automatically to identify every
transmission by department or client, for
chorging-on purposes.

Murphy’s mateship
Murphy’s Law states: If anything can
go wrong, it will. Corollaries abound
(the basic one being: If Murphy’s Law
can go wrong, it will).
I believe we owe our masters a debt
of gratitude that they have made a
special Oz corollary feasible:
The magnitude of the personal and
political embarrassment and of the
drain on public funds caused by a
simple solicitous inquiry about a little
mate are inversely proportional to the
ostensible simplicity of the inquiry and
the insignificance of the mate.

Parliamentary rubbish
I had the misfortune to be tuned in to
the ABC’s radio coverage of the par-
limentary debate on September 13 and I
was thoroughly disgusted at the quality
of debate.
I have listened to more rational and
educated debate in the bars of local ho-
tels, and suggest both parties get back to
the grassroots, as we the voters are sick
of the rubbish we are getting for our
hard-earned taxes.

Debts of the war
I must protest about the letter (B, Sep-
tember 11) headed “Sham pacifists,” by


Syd Richardson, from Burnie,Tasmania.
He is incorrect when he states that
pacifists do not protest about the arms
build-up in the Soviet bloc. They do but,
of necessity, their main interest is di-
rected at the region where such protest
can have some possible effect.
My main objection to his letter, how-
ever, is his perpetuation of the myth that
the United States “saved” Australia in
World War 11. I suggest he gets his his-
torical facts right.
The Coral Sea battle, fought by both
American and Australian ships, was an
inconclusive affair in which honors
were about even.
The other two attacks at Port Mores-
by were both decisively defeated by
Australian forces with, at Milne Bay,
some support from American engineers.
The main attack, over the Kokoda Trail,
was an entirely Australian affair and re-
sulted in the total destruction of the in-
vading Japanese army. American troops
made their first appearance at Buna,
months later, when the Japanese had al-
ready been repulsed.
I would point out that the ANZUS
Pact does no more than commit the
USA to “consult” with us if we are at-
tacked. In other words, they will help us
in such a case if and only if it
should suit their own purposes.
No realist can blame them for this
all governments, of course, take the
same pragmatic attitude but at least
let us face the facts of their military
presence here with our eyes open and
our minds uncluttered by historical
myth.

Primary producers’ friend
When Prime Minister Mr Hawke made
Mr Kerin Minister for Primary Indus-
try, I did not think his qualifications as
ex-public servant were sufficient for the
job.
But, since the publication of the
Hawke-Keating budget, my opinion has
changed considerably and I am pleased
to admit my mistake as, according to the
budget, Mr Kerin has done more for the
primary producer than the combined
efforts of the last two ministers Mr
Sinclair and Mr Nixon. Both the last
named gentlemen were elected as pri-
mary producers’ representatives and
members of the National Party. But all
they achieved for the primary producer
was detrimental to them, such as high
tarrifs on machinery, much higher
prices on distillant and much higher
prices on fertiliser.
In conclusion, I would suggest pri-
mary producers in general support the
party who supports them and not the
party who only claim they do.

the paper much. You see, we’ve
been charcoal mellowing whiskey
here at Jack Daniel’s since 1866.
And according to the editor, there’s

SOMETIMES A
JEST ISN'T ENOUGH.
H
Presenting the NCR Tower.
This year, a lot of businesses will go out and buy
personal computers only to discover thousands of dollars
later that they need something more to handle their
problems. Something more powerful. More
expandable. More economical.
That something is the NCR Tower.
When Personal Computers
Aren't Powerful Enough.
Compare the Tower with a personal computer
like the IBM XT and you’ll find there’s no
comparison.
The Tower processes information at
twice the speed. It comes with over four times
the storage capacity. It can stand alone or as part of a large
distributed data processing network. It runs all the different
types of software that persona I computers do. And a whole
lot more. They can help you control inventory better.
Run a data processing department better.
Even manage a nationwide network of hospitals or auto
parts stores better.
In short, whether you run a small business, a
department of a large business or a nationwide network
of businesses, the Tower will help you do business
better. Why does the Tower perform so well?
Because it’s built so well.
It is powered by the Motorola 68000, one of
the most powerful 16-bit micro-processors around.
It comes with other guarantees of high performance
like a Winchester hard disc and the Intel Multibus*
And it offers you the UNIX* operating system.
So it’s simple enough for general
managers (just plug it in and go) or
sophisticated enough for systems
analysts (you can do your own thing).
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Expandable Enough.
Any small business computer will grow as you grow.
The question is, how far? The Tower’s storage
capacity expands from 40 million characters to 214 million.
Translated, that means it will hold anywhere from 13,000
to 71,000 pages of text (it’s not for short story writers)
or from 260,000 to 1,420,000 names and addresses
Multibus is a registered trade mark of Intel Corporation. UNIX is a registered trade mark of Bell Laboratories." Manufacturer’s recommended price.

(you’d better have plenty of triends). Even more important,
up to twelve people can work on the Tower at once with
additional work stations. On different projects.
Or the same project.
When Personal Computers
Aren’t Economical Enough.
Of course, you may save money in the short run by
investing in a personal computer. But if it can’t do
everything you want it to do, it could really cost you in the
long run. What’s more, the Tower becomes more
economical as you add more work stations. With eight
work stations, for example, it ranges from less
than $36,000. Eight IBM XTs, on the other
hand, could cost you $54,304.** Networking
them all together would set you back even

more. And you still wouldn’t have anywhere nearthe power
of the Tower. Quite simply, the Tower gives you something
no single personal computer or group of personal
computers can: enough power, expandability and
economy to handle your business problems. Put another
way, the Tower is a computer you can grow into, not out
of. No other machine on the market offers everything it
does at the price it does.
And finally, it comes to you from NCR. A company
committed to applying innovative computer technology to
today’s business problems. And one which offers its
customers supportand service from 50 offices
throughout Australia.
For more information contact the following
NCR Tower Dealers or your NCR State Office.
We’re more than you think.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Hawke in tears
THE emotionally-loaded ver-
bal duel between Prime Min-
ister Bob Hawke and Leader
of the Opposition Andrew
Peacock culminated at a press
conference held by Hawke in
Canberra. During the pro-
ceedings he wept after be-
coming upset by a question
concerning a member of his
family.
• See story page 39
State budgets
JOB creation was the leading
theme in budgets presented by
the governments of Victoria,
NSW and Queensland. None
of them contained new taxes
and old ones stayed at pre-
vious levels. Victoria even
managed to slash about $72
million off a range of taxes.
Left victory
THE alliance between the So-
cialist Left and Independent
factions of the Victorian ALP
came out on top in pre-selec-
tion ballots for 11 seats to be
contested in the next Federal
parliamentary elections. The
alliance won all but one of the
ballots. The other went to the
moderate Labor Unity group.
Bikies charged
NSW police charged 31 mem-
bers of the rival Bandidos and
Comancheros bike gangs with
seven counts of murder fol-
lowing the Father’s Day mas-
sacre in Sydney. Twenty-one
of the bikies were arrested in
police raids in several Sydney
suburbs, six were charged in
hospitals and one in Long Bay
jail. Later, three bikies gave
themselves up to police and
were also charged. Others
were still being sought.
Protest ends
THE Roxby Downs anti-ura-
nium blockade ended a week
earlier than planned. The
reason was thought to be the
exhaustion of funds by the
protest organisers, the Coali-
tion for a Nuclear-Free Aus-
tralia. However, individual
protesters were planning to
stay on.
Second airport
MINISTER for Aviation Kim
Beazley announced that a sec-
ond Sydney airport would be
constructed either at Wilton
or Badgerys Creek. Wilton is
58km south-west of Sydney,
and Badgerys Creek is 42km
west of the city. The final rec-
ommendation on the site
would probably be made to
Federal Cabinet by the middle
of next year, he said.
Stone successor
THE Federal Government
chose as the successor to
Treasury Secretary John
Stone deputy secretary Bernie
Fraser, 43, who has been in
charge of development and
taxation in the department
since last January. Fraser has
been a public servant for 23
years.
Age changes
ACCORDING to figures re-
leased by the Australian Bu-
reau of Statistics, the percent-
age of Australian residents
aged 14 and under fell con-
siderably during the past 12
years, reflecting a declining
birth rate. In 1971 children
aged 0-14 comprised 28.7 per-
cent of the population but by
1983 this had shrunk to 24.4
percent. On the other end of
the scale, the 65 and over
category increased from 8.2
per cent to 10 percent.
Rupert Lockwood
Vladimir Petrov
CORRECTION
In some copies of The Bulletin this week the photographs of
Soviet defector Vladimir Petrov and journalist Rupert
Lockwood, on pages 60 and 62, have been transposed,
making the captions incorrect. Production deadlines made it
impossible to correct the error in ail copies.
THE WORLD
Embassy carnage
A CAR filled with at least
500 kg of explosives crashed
into the United States em-
bassy annexe in East Beirut,
killing about 23 people
mainly Lebanese waiting for
visas to enter the US and
wounding scores of others.
Those hurt included Ameri-
can ambassador Reginald
Bartholomew. Visiting British
ambassador David Miers was
shaken.
Reagan’s margin
ACCORDING to the latest
New York Times-CBS-TN
poll, President Ronald
Reagan has increased his lead
over Democrat presidential
candidate Walter Mondale to
21 percent. Other polls have
indicated that Mondale has
only 32 percent support
against Reagan’s 62.
Strike ends
BRITAIN’S dock strike,
which halted nearly half of
the nation’s seaborne trade,
was called off after the docks
committee of the huge Trans-
port and General Workers’
Union voted to end the stop-
page which began when the
state-owned British Steel Cor-
poration used non-union
labor to bypass a boycott of
coal shipments. The boycott
had been mounted to support
the national miners’ strike.
Progress in talks
AFTER several meetings last-
ing more than six hours,
Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko and his
Chinese opposite number, Wu
Xueqian in New York for
the UN General Assembly
claimed progress in improv-
ing the strained relationship
between the two countries.
Gromyko was scheduled to
meet President Reagan and
Democratic presidential can-
didate Walter Mondale later
this week in Washington.
Manila riot
RIOT police in Manila broke
up a violent demonstration
outside the palace of Philip


pines President Marcos. The
5000 demonstrators were pro-
testing against the imposition
of martial law 12 years ago.
Police used teargas, water
cannons and smoke bombs in
an effort to disperse the
crowd. After 15 hours the or-
ganiser of the protest, Agapito
Aquino, brother of as-
sassinated former senator
Benigno Aquino, called it off
but vowed to stage another.
Aquino finding
THE five-member board
chaired by retired Justice
Corazon Agrava which had
been investigating the death
of Philippines opposition
leader Benigno Aquino
found there had been a crime
of conspiracy to murder the
senator. The commission
reportedly said Aquino was
shot by one of his guards
while leaving a plane at Ma-
nila airport.
Peace moves
FRANCE and Libya agreed
to withdraw their respective
forces from the central
African country of Chad in an
effort to end its long civil war.
France had supported the
government of President Nis-
san Habre and Libya the rebel
forces under Goukoune
Oueddei.
Israeli cutbacks
ISRAEL’S new coalition gov-
ernment moved swiftly to
overcome the country’s woe-
ful economic problems, inclu-
ding a 400 percent annual in-
flation rate. The cabinet
devalued the shekel, slashed
subsidies on basic foodstuffs
and cut government spending
by $1.2 billion.
Balloon solo
RETIRED US air force
colonel Joe Kittinger, 56,
made aviation history by bal-
looning solo across the Atlan-
tic. He set out in his 10-storey-
high helium-filled balloon
named Rosy O'Grady from
Caribou, Maine, and landed
near the Italian town of
Savona on the Gulf of Genoa.
He said he was planning to fly
across Australia next year.

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
New Right crusaders
challenge the Labor line
Conservatism is a growing force in Australia, despite Labor's political stranglehold. A
new breed of liberal-conservatives is becoming increasingly vocal, filling the void created
by the failure of the Liberal Party to match Labor’s ideas. TIM DUNCAN analyses the
philosophy and the personalities of the New Right and on Page 32 JOHN EDWARDS
profiles Owen Harries, a valued adviser to the Reagan administration, and outlines his
intriguing political progression from left winger to conservative polemicist.
CONSERVATISM in Australia is re-
surgent, its new leading lights brimming
with confidence precisely when they
might be tempted to give up in despair.
The Labor Party is in the ascendant and
the Liberal Party in the doldrums but
spokesmen for the right are emerging
and are making an impact.
The New Right is far removed from
the ratbag right which exists on the
fringes of Australian politics. Its
spokesmen such people as Western
Mining’s Hugh Morgan, Melbourne
University’s Geoffrey Blainey and for-
mer Treasury head John Stone are
serious thinkers concerned with serious
issues.
Aboriginal land rights and the
consequent downgrading of white prop-
erty rights regulation of the economy,
immigration, the repressive role of the
Arbitration Commission and the lot of
the individual are among the issues they
are tackling.
They are acting out of frustration, a
feeling that activist minority pressure
groups are changing Australian society
and making it less liberal. They are
making a greater impact in the world of
ideas than the political right the Lib-
eral Party as this year’s “big three”
speeches Morgan on land rights,
Blainey on immigration and Stone on
government regulation and the Arbitra-
tion Commission have shown.
Representatives of the New Right
are trying to sow the seeds of liberal
thought in a country which never has
provided fertile ground for such ideas
(except for retaining British traditions
of democratic rule, political freedom
and common law).
They are stuck with a society that be-
gan as a wholly regulated penal settle-
ment and which graduated first to col-
onial socialism in the 1880 s and then to
state socialism by the turn of the cen-
tury. By the third decade of this century
ROBERT DORAN
Greg Lindsay of the CIS: socialism is dead
government institutions already were
exerting the most far-reaching regula-
tion of Australia’s labor, capital and
commodity markets. Protection and ar-
bitration were soon matched by official-
ly sanctioned banking cartels. The new
industries of the' mid-20th century
telecommunications, air transport, elec-
tricity production and so on were
placed under the now traditional care of
the state charter.
But it might seem that now, more
than ever, the critics on the right are
outgunned. After all, governments at
both state and federal levels are increas-
ing their financial outlays by record
amounts and with this their
impact on society is multiply-
ing. The Arbitration Commis-
sion has accepted redundancy
controls and moves are afoot
to repeal secondary boycotts
legislation. Except in the no-
torious Roxby Downs case,
new uranium mining is
banned. Sex and race rela-
tions seem to been admitted
broadly to the field of govern-
ment regulation. Government
is putting its stamp behind re-
ligion sacred sites and land
rights seem to be getting more
attention than property rights.
The serious right, however, is
not throwing in the towel.
The right, according to
some of its leading lights, is
very much alive and well. Of
course, its concerns are vari-
ous and often in conflict and
it is, as always, uncomfortable
in wearing the right-wing tag.
But those with an overriding
passion for the freedom of the
individual and a complement-
ing commitment to the effi-
cacy of the market who can
be described loosely as the lib-
eral right feel that they are at last be-
ginning to make an impression on Aus-
tralian political culture. Perhaps like the
left in the 19605, the liberal right sees
itself as the natural wellspring for the
institutional reforms that are required if
Australia is to cope with an increasingly
competitive world.
The liberal right describes itself
vaguely as a community of spirit. By
this its elements deny that they consti-
tute an organised category of thinkers
or activists but they do admit that or-
ganisations are important. Not sur-
prisingly, they emphasise as well the po-
tential contribution that individual


critics can make. For instance, they ac-
cept that the speeches delivered by
Blainey, Morgan and Stone have made
more impact on Australian political de-
bate than the parliamentary Opposition
but they think that further in the back-
ground is a network of sympathetic or-
ganisations whose research, publishing
and discussion activities are having just
as profound an effect on the Australian
political agenda as the efforts of the
more spectacular headline generators.
A list of these organisations would
include the Centre for Independent
Studies (CIS) directed by Greg Lindsay,
in Sydney; the Institute of Public Affairs
(IPA) directed by Rod Kemp, in Mel-
bourne; the Monash University Insti-
tute of Policy Studies (headed by Pro-
fessor Michael Porter); the Institute of
Labor Studies at Flinders University
(headed by Professor Richard Blandy);
and the Australian Institute for Public
Policy (the retreat of former Liberal
“dry” John Hyde, in Perth).
Such a list might also include the
publishers of the conservative journal
Quadrant. But strangely, in discussion
with individuals associated with the
groups mentioned, the Quadrant circle
rarely received much mention. One gets
the impression the magazine’s chief
battle is seen as the Cold War and that it
does not quite fit in with a younger and
more libertarian network, which is not
as comfortable with conspiracy theories
and which is more concerned with dom-
estic institutions than foreign policy.
Such contrasts might also apply to the
other survivor of the 1950 s right, the
National Civic Council, whose sectari-
an orientation and commitment to labor
market regulation often puts it at odds
with the liberal right. Nonetheless, inso-
far as the NCC and the Quadrant circle
enjoy exposing the perks of the left and
what they see as the intellectual fraud in
the socialist tradition, the liberal right
and the old guard to an extent overlap.
The CIS is very much the creation of
the 35-year-old Lindsay, a former high
school mathematics teacher. He recalls
visiting the United States in 1975 and
stumbling across research institutes re-
moved from party politics, all develop-
ing and expounding arguments for a
free society. He returned to set up the
skeleton of what is now the CIS, not to
go out to bat for free enterprise but
rather “to support freedom.”
At first Lindsay had few academic
contacts. Until 1979, the CIS office was
Lindsay’s backyard shed. But soon the
network began to grow. Lindsay met
Ross Parish, an economist at Monash
University, who in turn introduced him
to Porter, who was in the process of es-
tablishing the Monash Institute for Pol-
icy Studies.
As Lindsay sees it, socialism is dead
as an intellectual idea. But he says that

Professor Geoffrey Blainey: S-E Asians have become the “favored majority”
THE AGE
GEOFFREY Blainey, 54, one of
Australia’s best-known historians, is
professor of history and dean of the
arts faculty at the University of Mel-
bourne.
The son of the Rev S. C. Blainey,
he has an impressive list of publica-
tions behind him, including A Land
Half Won, Triumph of the Nomads
and The Tyranny of Distance. He was
awarded the Order of Australia in
1975.
Educated at Ballarat High School
and the University of Melbourne, he
is married with one daughter.
President of the Australia-China
Council since 1979, Blainey ad-
dressed Rotarians at Warrnambool
in mid-March on multiculturalism.
He warned that South-East
Asians had become the “faVored ma-
jority” under Australia’s immigra-
tion program and that the continued
entry of Asians at the present rate
could “weaken-or explode” the toler-
ance extended to immigrants over
the past 30 years.
He believed an increasing propor-
tion of Australians resented the num-
ber of Asian immigrants coming into
the country with little hope of finding
work and “living through no fault of
their own at the taxpayers’ expense.”
The furore his speech caused in-
creased to the point where he was
forced to cancel two meetings at
Melbourne University because of
possible violence.
The chairman and 22 members of
the academic staff of Melbourne
rUniversity’s history department dis-
sociated themselves from Blainey’s
views in a letter to The Age published
on May 19.
In June, he resigned from the
board of the Museum of Australia
saying he could not accept its com-
mitment to multiculturalism. □


one gets nowhere trying to
point that out without intel-
lectual support. Providing
that support, he says, is the
role of the CIS: “On our side
of the social and political de-
bate, until the CIS came
along, there was no flame for
the moths to gather around.”
Some of the moths have
come from the Flinders Insti-
tute of Labor Studies whose
research interests include the
relationship between the labor
market and structural change.
Blandy was a committed
Fabian socialist in the 19605.
He studied in the US at
Columbia University and was
for some years a researcher at
the International Labor Or-
ganisation. But then his views
changed.
“I lost confidence in the su-
perior wisdom of people at
the top of large organisa-
tions,” he told The Bulletin,
“and I lost confidence in the
beneficient effects of govern-
ment intervention.” He explains that his
change in thinking came about as he
was conducting research into the econ-
omics of education: “I became con-
vinced that educational policy was be-
ing run by a set of interest groups, with
objectives not particularly helpful for
young people in Australia.”
The Flinders institute began with a
free trade outlook on tariff matters and
began to apply that outlook to the prob-
lem of protection in the labor market.
As Blandy sees it, Australians’ values
Professor Michael Porter: heads the Monash IPS
have changed “in the post-industrial so-
ciety” but Australia’s institutions have
not. The result, he says, is that unions,
who initially wanted more say in the ar-
bitration framework and wanted to
break its authority, have been able to
substitute their own commands for
those of the formerly independent insti-
tution. In consequence, nothing has
changed and the Australian economy is
still circumscribed by a static labor mar-
ket and still restricted by fixed percep-
tions.
Blandy publishes with both
the CIS and the now revived
IPA Review, the latter edited
by Kemp. The IPA has per-
haps the closest business links
of all the liberal right organ-
isations but Kemp points out
that its business support is
widely dispersed, thus allow-
ing the IPA significant inde-
pendence.
Kemp is a member of an
extremely active Melbourne
family. His father, Charles,
created the IPA in the late
1940 s and still contributes to
the Review. His brother,
David Kemp, is professor of
politics at Monash University,
having withdrawn from active
politics since his time as
Malcolm Fraser’s chief ideas
man. For his part, Rod Kemp
was senior private secretary to
Dame Margaret Guilfoyle
when she was Minister for
both Finance and Social Se-
curity.
One gets the impression
that Rod Kemp never really learned a
political philosophy; rather, he just be-
gan to breathe it. Of all the liberal right
organisations, the Melbourne IPA is by
far the most practical in its outlook and
this reflects both Kemp’s natural prag-
matism and experience with the real
world of running a government.
Titles of liberal right publications
provide a good idea of its agenda. The
CIS, for instance, has published only
one book that covers foreign affairs.
Judging by its economic titles, one of its

JOHN STONE, the recently departed
Treasury head, is a physicist-turned-
economist. Like Bob Hawke, Stone,
55, was educated at Perth Modern
School, the University of Western
Australia and Oxford (on a Rhodes
Scholarship).
After he switched to economics
Stone worked in a succession of pub-
lic service jobs with the United King-
dom and Australian Treasuries and
was a delegate to the International
Monetary Fund. In 1971 he became
number two in the Treasury, to Sir
Frederick Wheeler, and was ap-
pointed to the top job by the Fraser
Government in 1979.
He left the service on September
14 but on August 27 he gave vent to
John Stone: identified economic failings
his monetarist frustrations in a vitri-
olic Edward Shann Memorial Lecture
at his old university in Perth.
He compared the government to
George Orwell’s Animal Farm, in
which the well-meaning pigs were led
to a bitter end by their leader,
Napoleon.
He identified Australia’s economic
failings as financial mismanagement,
protectionism and an ossified labor
market. He was particularly severe on
this last point, attacking attempts to
interfere in a free market by unions,
state governments, the Arbitration
Commission, employer groups and
some big companies.
Stone soon will take up a tempor-
ary position as visiting professorial
fellow at Michael Porter’s Institute of
Policy Studies at Monash.
Stone, father of four sons and a
daughter, is a member of the exclu-
sive Vincents Club (Oxford), Wine
and Food Club (Canberra) and Com-
monwealth Club (Canberra). □


chief concerns is to expose the op-
portunities lost through market regula-
tion and the consequent follies of gov-
ernments which pretend to be able to
bring about change in the direction they
intend. Also active in political science
and philosophy, the CIS has undertaken
what appears to be an attempt to trans-
late the first principles of 18th century
liberal thought to modern times.
Its themes concern the lot of the
modern individual, threatened by large
organisations that monopolise privi-
leges and zealous social en-
gineers who claim the right to
control behaviour. In particu-
lar, it draws upon specialists
in the study of inefficient and
over-regulated industry and it
displays an obvious delight in
exposing snouts in regulated
troughs taxi-drivers in Can-
berra, professional multi-
culturalists on the coat tails of
government, Australian air-
lines with privileges implicit
in an edifice of regulation, ru-
ral producers subsidised by
marketing boards and so on.
Its latest effort, Chaining
Australia, brings the CIS
closer to the foreground of the
political arena. It is an expert
and sustained demolition of a
social policy statement,
Changing Australia, produced
last year by the “social re-
sponsibility” arms of the
Catholic, Anglican and
Uniting churches and released
with the support of the Aus-
tralian Council of Churches.
Drawing heavily on the liberal right
critique of the economic privileges en-
shrined in market regulation, Chaining
Australia says bluntly that Changing
Australia is a recipe for tyranny. This
work, more than any published recent-
Iy, shows how confident the liberal right
has become. If Changing Australia is the
best the trendy left can do, its contribu-
tors argue, then the economic fantasies
of the bleeding hearts can be cut
through like butter.
Significantly, the publication of
John Hyde: once a leader of the Liberal “dries”
Changing Australia coincided with two
widely publicised attacks on the Arbi-
tration Commission the first made by
Stone in Perth, which placed responsi-
bility for youth unemployment squarely
on the shoulders of the arbitration sys-
tem, and the the second made by
Blandy, which exposed the Arbitration
Commission as an “enforcer” for the
union movement.
The IPA in Melbourne, once as-
sociated closely with the Liberal Party,
now seems to have thrown up its hands
in disgust at the inability of
the Liberals to cope with ideas
and has moved towards the
role of social critic analogous
to that of the CIS. It, too, en-
joys reporting snouts in
troughs, whether they be rail-
way unions, empire-building
bureaucrats, public sector
superannuation beneficiaries
or high-taxing state govern-
ments. Kemp does not lead
academic debate quite as
Lindsay does with the CIS.
The IPA has a closer feel for
more orthodox politics: the
perils of union power, the
growth of government spend-
ing and the risks of inflation,
and the politics of the press.
The IPA has an explicit orien-
tation but with a liberal twist.
For instance, if full employ-
ment is desired, then it sug-
gests the reform of the Arbi-
tration Commission, not stop-
gap community employment
programs.

Miner with
strong views on

THE impeccably-groomed Hugh
Matheson Morgan was appointed
executive director of Western Mining
Corporation in 1976, at the age of 35
by far the youngest member of the
board. He is the son of the former
managing director, Bill Morgan, who
headed Western Mining from 1962 to
1971.
Hugh Morgan attended Geelong
Grammar School before studying law
and commerce at the University of
Melbourne. He worked for a short
time as a solicitor and judge’s associ-
ate and in 1965 joined the staff of
North Broken Hill, where eventually
he became director of marketing and
finance.
He holds positions on the boards
Hugh Morgan: genocide claims nonsense
of Alcoa, Broken Hill South and, un-
til last June, the Reserve Bank. His
failure to be reappointed to the bank
board is seen as a result of his criti-
cisms of the government.
In a speech delivered on May 2 to
the Australian Mining Industry
Council, Morgan said that Aboriginal
land rights threatened to wipe out the
mining industry; that the concept rep-
resented a spiritualism that was anti-
Christian and that it would create a
bitter backlash in the wider commu-
nity. Aboriginal allegations of geno-
cide by whites during the 19th century
were nonsense, he said.
He was not unsympathetic to the
needs of disadvantaged people and
not against land rights as such; only
the “avarice” of mineral claims.
The speech followed a controver-
sial address made in January to busi-
ness leaders in London in which he
criticised “Yellow-cake Bob” Hawke
and the “lunatic left” over the future
of the Australian mining industry. □


reform permeates the programs of the
liberal right and perhaps it is because its
elements now feel that they own the re-
formist agenda that they seem so confi-
dent. As Lindsay, Kemp and Blandy all
told The Bulletin, the only significant re-
form that the Hawke government has
achieved, the deregulation of the finan-
cial sector and the floating of the ex-
change rate, is one of theirs. But they
also accept that in other areas the tide is
going the other way, almost with an in-
stitutional momentum of its own. They
point to the accretion of labor market
and industrial regulation, to the halt to
tariff reform and to the entrenching of
sectional interests through potentially
tyrannical institutions such as the Hu-
man Rights Commission.
They suggest that there is a mood of
immense frustration in Australia and
that the apparent inability of Australia’s
aging regulatory dinosaurs to allow the
Australian economy the chance to re-
verse its gradual decline and to improve
historically lower rates of growth is en-
dangering the liberal elements that have
survived in Australian political culture.
Although they express them
differently, their argument can be
reduced to two related propositions.
First, they say, individuals lead econ-
omic lives and individual freedoms are
therefore economic freedoms. A market
system that promotes economic free-
doms promotes personal freedoms and
that, due to lessons of despotism in the
20th century, is a first political priority.
Second, they say, political freedoms are
contingent on economic growth. If pro-
longed economic hardship sets in, then
political freedoms, as individuals
struggles for shares of a static or de-
dining cake, will be at risk,
It is not surprising that the arbitra-
tion system should be the target for the
liberal right. To them it represents privi-
lege, restriction, medieval concepts of
the just price and guild privilege, limits
to structural change and, ultimately, just
more of the same as Australia gradually
loses its options and turns in on itself,
At risk, in their view, is what remains in
Australia of a liberal political culture,
This broad, and to some extent in-
tuitive, anxiety for the future in Austra-
lia perhaps explains this year’s more
How Owen Harries
leaned
from left to right
By JOHN EDWARDS
NO AUSTRALIAN has penetrated fur-
ther into the strange mind of the Reagan
administration than has Owen Harries.
A Welsh-born conservative from Syd-
ney, a Political Science teacher at the
University of New South Wales, once
adviser to the Fraser government and
Gough Whitlam’s predecessor as Aus-
tralian ambassador at UNESCO in
Paris, Harries is a star in the American
right.
He chats with United Nations am-
bassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, lunches
with Secretary of State George Shultz
and dines with conservative intellectual
Norman Podhoretz. Harries is paid by
the conservative Heritage Foundation
in Washington, publishes in the con-
servative Commentary magazine in New
York, speaks at conferences, travels and
lectures, testifies to Congress and ad-
vises the Reagan administration. He is
credited with a big role in its decision to
withdraw from UNESCO.
At 54, the pipe-smoking, convivial
Harries, a charming and amusing man
who enjoys talk the way others enjoy
football, has found a more congenial
world in the United States than ever he
found in Sydney. It is a striking success
but also a peculiar one. Harries is like
the Reagan right in many ways, quite
unlike them in others.
He told a conservative conference re-
cently that he was an agnostic. This is a
wicked view in the Heritage Founda-
tion.
He takes the third world seriously
and is ambivalent in his thinking about
it, another weird sympathy to have in
the foundation.
Harries is in no sense a liberal but
the fit he makes with the American right
is not quite correct. He is essentially a
Sydney anti-communist, a product of
Australian battles of the 50s and 60s,
who has brought to the US the strengths
and weaknesses of his training. He is a
very good polemicist but a poor ana-
lyst; an intelligent, well-read man who
uses his gift to persuade, not to inquire.
Harries was born at the beginning of
the great Depression in a town in the
Amman Valley of Wales. It was on the
west fringe of the coal fields, he recalls,
“with an industrial hell on one side and
lovely rivers on the other.” His father
was a draper. His earliest political hero
was fellow Welshman Aneurin Bevan
a speaker so wonderful, says Harries,
that he has not yet heard anyone better.
Harries grew up speaking Welsh and
went to the University of Wales before
doing a Politics, Philosophy and Econ-
omics degree at Oxford. He served a
stint in the air force (“because I bloody

startling forays into Australian cultural
themes made by three of the most
prominent of the liberal right. Fear for
the future of liberal Australia links the
three speeches which have rocked the
country this year. Each of them denied
the officially proclaimed spirit of con-
sensus and one by one Blainey, Morgan
and Stone were accused of going over
the top and offending orthodox concep-
tions of good political taste.
As Blainey sees it, the speeches
shared the view that “rhetoric has dis-
guised that new rights and privileges
can be granted without taking away
right and privileges from others.”
Morgan puts this another way: “The
three speeches picked up a sense of frus-
tration. There was the observation that
an activist minority, parliamentary and
pressure group, were not only working
against the liberal ethic but not reflect-
ing where Australia really was. Each
said, ‘You’re on dangerous ground’.”
The charges that immigration policy
has taken on the character of a jugger-
naut, that land rights are to be imposed
by twisting arms, that the arbitration
commission reinforces privilege at hid-
eous social cost do not appear to be uni-
formly shared positions of those of the
liberal right. But there does seem to be a
consistent theme that runs through the
liberal right critique.
It is that well-organised sectional in-
terests, with institutional lines running
into the heart of the state and apparent-
ly unchallengeable because of this, are
extracing such favorable and special
treatment from both major parties as to
effectively discount the interests of those
not so well organised and thus in vari-
ous ways to deny them basic personal
freedoms. As the liberal right sees it, ex-
travagant patronage at the court is
putting at risk creativity, institutional
flexibility and economic dynamism.
The push for the de-regulation of
capital, labor and commodity markets,
the reassertion of the primacy of econ-
omic growth and freedoms and the con-
sidered revision of the politics of min-
ority group rights this seems to be the
agenda of the liberal right and, if the
nature of political debate in 1984 pro-
vides a guide for the future, that agenda
will receive great attention. □

well had to”) and was rejected from the
education officer corps because of his
left-wing views.
He sailed for Australia with his new
wife, Dorothy, in 1954 to take up a job
in adult education in Sydney. “Britain
was a dismal place,” he remembers.
“Austerity was dragging on endlessly. I
just wanted to get out. I didn’t think of
Australia as a place to stay but when I
got there I enjoyed it enormously.”
He taught in the Workers Education-
al Association near Sydney University
and found it “the most enjoyable teach-
ing I’ve ever done in my life. There were
housewives, active unionists, a few
PhDs. They were all self-motivated
people who could vote with their feet
and you had to hold their attention all
winter.”
He arrived in Australia a Bevanite, a
left-wing Laborite with some of the
seeds of his later views. The left wing of
the British Labor Party was anti-Soviet
as well as anti-American. It was liberal
minded on issues of personal morality
and accustomed followers to vigorous
polemics.
Harries found in Australia a WEA
staffed by unusually strong minds, the
result of the scarcity of university jobs
before World War 11. His mentor on the
left was E. M. Higgins, a former com-
munist who had been expelled from the
party in one of secretary Lance
Sharkey’s purges. Higgins was still sym-
pathetic to the party. Harries’ mentor on
the right was Harold Eddy, a follower
of the anti-communist libertarian Syd-
ney University philosopher John An-
derson.
Harries’ initial views were close to
those of Higgins; the final conversion
was to those of Eddy. “I was fought
over by the two of them,” Harries says.
“I started having a new education in so-
cialism and communism, largely
through a process of being argued down
and moving in Eddy’s direction.” Eddy
was strongly anti-communist and also
liberal-minded, instanced in his support
for Professor William Orr in his fight
against his dismissal from the Univer-
sity of Hobart.
Harries drank in the 50s and early
60s with the old Sydney push at the
now-demolished Newcastle Hotel,
mingling with liberal-minded people of
different views in a way that became in-
creasingly difficult as the Vietnam war
began to divide Australia in the mid-
60s. But Harries enjoyed himself at the
WEA and remained there until 1965
when he left to become a lecturer in Pol-
itical Science at the University of NSW.
His life widened in the 60s to include
the Australian Congress for Cultural
Freedom and its magazine, Quadrant.
With Donald Horne, Peter Coleman
and Richard Krygier, Harries formed
the core of the Sydney intellectual right
opponents of Arthur Calwell’s Labor
Party and reluctant supporters of suc-
cessive Liberal governments in Can-
berra.
Harries was a strong proponent of
American and Australian involvement
in Vietnam, pairing off on the lecture
circuit with Jim Cairns and other critics
of the war. But Harries’ eclectic social
world split in the 60s. He found there
were parties to which he was no longer
invited.
He was disillusioned enough with
Liberal governments to vote for Gough
Whitlam in 1972 (“If you’re voting for
us, Owen,” Whitlam told him, “I’m go-
ing to win”) but by 1974 was advising
shadow Foreign Affairs minister
Andrew Peacock. Harries wrote most of
the 1975 foreign policy platform of the
Liberals and then worked for Peacock
and Malcolm Fraser in government un-
til he left for UNESCO in 1981. When


Norman Podhoretz: a Harries dinner companion
the Hawke government was elected in
Australia, Harries resigned and moved
to the Heritage Foundation. He will re-
main there until the end of this year and
then return to Australia.
Harries has been anti-communist
since the mid-50s but the character of
his views has changed over the years.
“By the late 50s and early 605,” he says,
“I was becoming more influenced by
Hayek’s Road to Serfdom and also by
reading Edmund Burke. It taught me
there is a right time and a wrong time to
read a book, because Burke hadn’t in-
fluenced me at all when I read him
earlier.
“If you had asked me in 1960
whether I was a conservative, I would
have said no. I would still have wanted
to claim the word ‘liberal’ to describe
myself. But actually I was moving to a
true conservative position. And, apart
from the left/right distinction, I was
also changing in the realist/utopian
position from reading E. H. Carr’s book
Twenty Years Crisis. It is a seminal book
which I still quote.”
In recent years, Harries has shifted
again. In an article written in the 70s but
published in the 80s in Quadrant, he
criticised the claim to “realism” that
former prime minister Sir Robert
Menzies made in his foreign policy.
Harries examined the record and found
Menzies to have been soft on German
re-armament in the 30s and inclined to
concede shortcomings in the post-
World War I Treaty of Versailles. To
Harries, this made Menzies an “ap-
peaser” and he since has frequently
equated “realism” with concession to
the Soviet Union and accom-
modation with it.
Harries now writes often
about the role of “will” and
“conviction” even of
“dreams” in foreign policy
and he criticises the claims of
people who call themselves
“realists.” This is an import-
ant way into understanding
Harries’ thinking.
When Carr wrote his book,
he was contrasting realists
who believed in the balance of
power with Utopians such as
Woodrow Wilson who
thought that goodwill and in-
ternational organisation
could discipline aggression.
But Carr also conceded that
the Versailles treaty was too
hard on Germany, so Harries
contrasts realism today not
with utopianism but with
forcefulness and hard-line
policies against the Soviet
Union. He becomes heated
when talking about the Soviet
Union and insists that it is a
particularly evil power and
not merely a great power.
Convictions such as these give
Harries both his strength and his weak-
ness as an intellectual. His strength is
his conviction and moral force, which
makes him a polemicist of international
standard; his weakness is his want of
scepticism about his own beliefs, which
makes it hard for him to tell us the truth
about the world. It is characteristic that
Harries, who talks about the
Soviet Union so much with
such assurance, has never
been there and cannot speak
or read Russian.
My feeling is that it is hard
to find a good fit between
ideology and foreign policy
and, in foreign policy actions,
we usually end up appealing
to different sets of principles
at different times. Sometimes
we take a stand on issues of
principle, sometimes we con-
cede the superior might of an
opponent, sometimes we have
to concede that the rules of in-
ternational conduct on which
we are agreed will not always
produce outcomes favorable
to us.
It occurred to me in the
course of interviewing Harries
that, although he thought of
himself as a specialist on for-
eign policy, the things of
which he spoke did not really
help with any specific foreign
policy problem. For Harries,
foreign policy is simply the in- !
tellectual arena in which he
chooses to fight ideological battles with
opponents who are ascribed the views
typical of an Australian left-winger of
the 1950 s and 60s.
It was difficult for me to think of out-
comes which would have been very
different over the past few decades if
advice of the kind Harries gives had
been followed rather than the policy
pursued. Harries usually prefers general
principles to analysis in his writing and
speaking about specific foreign policy
problems, so he avoids the ambiguity
and difficulty of actual decisions. One
reason Harries writes and speaks so well
is because of this simplicity.
Over lunch with him in Washington,
I asked him about some particular
issues. This is what he said about them:
■ During our first lunch together
Harries said that America could have
won the war in Vietnam, in the sense
that a government in South Vietnam not
under communist control could have
survived. I asked him whether it would
have meant using more American
troops. At that lunch, he said it would
not and it would not have meant nu-
clear weapons. He said the war was
“lost in the United States, not in Viet-
nam.”
At our second lunch I asked him how
it could have been won and he said that
Lyndon Johnson’s policy was “nibbling
the bullet” and giving “too little, too
late.” Harries said that Robert
McNamara had recommended in 1965
that the US would need to commit
600,000 troops to win. Harries con-
cluded that the US could have won if it
UPI
Jeane Kirkpatrick: another Harries confidant


American troops in Vietnam: the US could have won with more manpower, Harries says
had committed 600,000 troops and if it
had not respected North Vietnam’s bor-
ders.
This is not a very persuasive answer.
The US did have 525,000 troops in the
war by 1968 and one reason Johnson
lost heart was that the US Saigon Com-
mand asked him for 200,000 more. The
US could not conduct a land invasion
of North Vietnam because at all times
the North Vietnamese had more than
475,000 regular troops deployed to de-
fend their territory. Behind the North
Vietnamese was the army of China.
■ American conservatives typically
blame a weakness of Western will for
the presence of Cuban troops in Angola
and Ethiopia, of Soviet troops in Af-
ghanistan and for the existence of a left-
wing government in Nicaragua. In dis-
cussing these with Harries, he said they
were all examples of the “post-Vietnam
trauma” in the US, which had
encouraged Soviet expansionism.
But in the cases of Angola, Ethiopia
and Afghanistan he agreed that no feas-
ible or likely American policy could
have produced results any different
from those we have. He said he did not
know anything about Central America
and it was “impertinent” for Austra-
lians or Europeans to tell the US what
to do there.
■ American conservatives usually
blame the Carter administration for
“losing” Iran. I asked Harries whether
any different policy could have
produced a different outcome.
He said the US should have sup-
ported the Shah completely and ac-
cepted that “whatever needed to be
done should be done” to preserve the
Shah meaning military repression of
his opponents. Harries said that the
Shah could have survived, given this
kind of support.
There is a problem here. The late
Shah was as hard-headed as Harries and
had experience in the business of shoot-
ing his opponents. If the solution of
using the army to repress the opposition
was obvious to Harries, why wasn’t it
obvious to the Shah?
I think the answer must be the one
analysts gave at the time: the army gen-
erals would not repress the Shah’s oppo-
nents, either because the generals them-
selves were opponents of the Shah or
because they could not rely on the loyal-
ty of their riflemen when it came to
shooting mullas. Alternatively, the Shah
knew that he was dying and lost interest
in shootings.
■ American conservatives often op-
pose the anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
treaty with the Soviet Union and the
SALT 1 treaty, both negotiated by
Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. I
asked Harries what he thought.
He said the ABM treaty had “cer-
tainly inhibited the United States and
not the Soviet Union.” He said: “When
the treaty was signed, the US was much
ahead in technology. For the Soviet
Union, arms control is largely a device
for holding the US back.”
When I asked Why Kissinger would
have negotiated this disadvantageous
treaty, Harries said: “I think he believed
that when he was running the show he
was playing with a bad hand and was
playing it the best possible way.” In-
stancing the disadvantages of the ABM
treaty, Harries said that the Soviet
Union had an ABM system around
Moscow.
His view of the ABM negotiation
and treaty is inconsistent with the re-
cord and also inconsistent internally.
American interest in ABMs (and also in
multiple warheads on missiles) was
spurred by the Soviet introduction of an
ABM system called Galosh in 1964 and
by its development of a system potenti-
ally capable of intercepting missiles.
The Soviets wanted ABMs to diminish
what was then a three-to-one warhead
ratio favoring the US. (If the US held a
decisive advantage, why was Kissinger’s
hand so bad?)
The 1972 treaty allowed each side
two ABM sites, including one around
each capital.
In a 1974 agreement (initiated by the
US) both sides were limited to one site
at Grand Forks missile base for the
US and around Moscow.
Twenty Years Crisis, 1919-1939 is still
a wonderful book to read. Carr says in it
that Utopians like to make the facts of
international politics fit their theories
and that they commonly think moral
considerations, such as whether a
country is good or bad, should play a
big part in foreign policy decisions.
Their vice, he says, is naivety while the
vice of the realist is sterility.
Half-a-century ago, these romantics
of politics were all on the left; today, the
Utopians people such as Harries and
quite a number of Reagan adminis-
tration officials (including the President
himself) are on the right. □


SPORT
The big men
who flew are
being grounded
By TIM DUNCAN
VFL ADMINISTRATORS soon may
be forced to think the unthinkable:
could it be that Australian football has
become boring?
Footy crowds in Melbourne are
down this year, having fallen about 7
percent for the home-and-away rounds.
A logical explanation of the fall-off lies
in the nature of the modern game. It
may be that the people who
once made up the crowds are
not convinced that the game
as played now is the spectacu-
lar sport they used to watch.
The administrators have
grasped at other explanations.
Melbourne, some say,
seems to be getting wetter
especially during that critical
two hours before the big
games when the footy faithful
prepare to leave for the
grounds. If footy crowds are
declining, perhaps it is the
hand of God.
Other influences have been
suggested. Some blame the
commercialisation of the
game, arguing that the trans-
fer of stars between clubs has
destroyed traditional fan
loyalties. On what basis can
cheer squads worship their
heroes if soon to find them
playing in an opposition side?
Others trot out the “too much
politics in sport” line. How
can the fans relate to a game
that has degenerated amid a
welter of legal confusion,
financial crisis and talk of im-
pending political interven-
tion? Why bother to barrack
when half the clubs in the
league face liquidation?
The more academic-
minded have come out with
some hard-hitting social
analyses. Melbourne, so the
argument runs, has changed.
Its population is more cultur-
ally diverse and its recreation-
al concerns have multiplied
well beyond the capacity of
the traditional outdoor sports
football, cricket and racing.
Then it occurred to some
fans to ask what it was that
spectators were no longer so
keen to see. Could it be that
the increasing reliance upon handball
and the precise, rehearsed, running and
passing drills had turned the game into
a strange local variant of American
gridiron satisfying enough for the
coaches and the players who could see
the artistry behind it but increasingly
eye-glazing for spectators who yearned
for the return of a game that was played
no longer?
Until recently, one of the favorite
fallbacks of the Saturday afternoon
commentators was the famous “And the
big men fly. ...” They do not say it so
much any more because the big men do
not fly so often. The really spectacular
marks are scarcer because the players
are no longer trained for them. The
game is played to reduce opportunities
for marking skills.
Essendon’s Bryan Wood flies: but VFL marks are getting rarer
THE AGE
More than any other feature of the
game, the high mark provided the
drama for Australian football. It was
unpredictable, spectacular, it looked
dangerous, it often required great cour-
age and, above all, it was beautiful to
watch. But it required time, first so that
a pack of players could develop to com-
pete for the ball and second so that one
of the players could hitch a ride on the
shoulders of another. The result was the
classical Australian Football image
that of a young athlete reaching towards
the sky, airborne with hands sometimes
4m above the turf, snatching a ball whis-
tling down at him from often 60m away.
Very few other goals brought the crowds
to their feet in the rapture produced by
a spectacular mark.
But the packs are not developing so
often. Players do not kick the
ball into no-man’s land
toward a pack as they did.
They have the skill to pick a
man 40m away and pass the
ball directly to him. As vet-
eran Melbourne coach Ron
Barassi told The Bulletin : “If
you kick the ball into a pack,
you’ll risk losing possession.
Nowadays, players are good
enough to pass without much
risk of losing possession and
that is what they’ll do.”
David McKay, a former
Carlton centre half forward
whose trademark was the big
leap, told The Bulletin that he
found when trying to help
Carlton players to improve
their marking skills this sea-
son that the players were re-
luctant to go for high marks.
“They seem frightened to get
hurt and they don’t think it’s
worthwhile,” he said.
It is not that Carlton
players are afraid to get hurt
in other situations. After all,
the tackling drills are more
ferocious than they have ever
been and players consistently
are hurt at training. Rather, it
is that high marking is unfam-
iliar to them and the players
have not developed the skills
they need to mark and not be
hurt. “To mark well, you al-
ways have to keep your eyes
on the ball,” McKay said.
“This means that you have to
know where the other players
are without looking at them.
The only way to know that is
to develop subconscious skills
and to improve your periph-
eral vision. After a while, high
marking becomes an almost
intuitive thing and you can
develop that intuition only
with practice, which means

kick-to-kick at training.” According to
McKay, kick-to-kick has almost disap-
peared from the training programs at
most VFL clubs.
One of the great virtues of the high
mark from a spectator’s point of view
was the contest it provided. Barassi
thinks that the precision of the modern
running game might have put at risk the
general sense of contest in Australian
football, not just the mark itself.
Barassi should know; after all, he
was largely responsible for the changes
in the game which promoted handball
and short passing as the footballer’s first
weapon.
“The survival of the mark is not the
biggest worry,” said Barassi who thinks
that rule changes can be made which
will preserve it. “It’s that often the ball
can go 200 m all around the flanks with-
out the other side touching it. That’s no
good because it’s no contest. Sure, it’s
magic when the passing is working but
it shouldn’t be like basketball. It’s so
boring; there’s no fierce struggle, no
tussle.”
Barassi is not sure how the tussle can
be brought back. He regrets that high
marking has gradually dropped away,
“for there is no question that the mark is
a fabulous thing.” He suggests that
goals kicked from marks might be made
worth more than the standard six
points, as an incentive.
Others have different ideas. St Kilda
general manager and former Brownlow
medallist lan Stewart received a general
nod of approval from football support-
ers when he warned that handball was
out of control and that schoolboys,
watching the latest styles of play each
week on television, were playing with-
out developing marking and kicking
skills.
He suggested establishing rules to en-
sure that the ball was kicked and not
handpassed after the granting of a free
kick. Perhaps not surprisingly, most
VFL coaches frowned on the
idea. After all, they possess re-
markable freedom compared
with coaches of more static
codes such as rugby and soc-
cer working within a frame-
work of rules so loose that
even the umpires regularly
change their interpretations of
what is permissible.
This basic flexibility allows
coaches to put their personal
stamp not just only on club
sides but also on the nature of
the code.
But, if the growing hordes
of bored spectators are a
guide, perhaps the coaches,
(who ultimately rely on spec-
tators for everything they are)
have become their own worst
enemies. □
POLITICS
Hawke tears
set scene for
stormy session
By ANTHONY HILL
THE astonishing sight of Prime Minis-
ter Bob Hawke crying at a Canberra
press conference has ensured that crime,
corruption and the government’s res-
ponse to them will dominate federal
parliament when it resumes next week.
But anger rather than tears will be
the chief emotion as both Hawke and
Opposition leader Andrew Peacock try
to sustain pressure on each other.
Politicians from both sides expect
this to be the last session before parlia-
ment rises for a general election cam-
paign. The House of Representatives is
scheduled to sit for two weeks but Op-
position tacticians are working on the
basis that it may rise within a few days
of an election announcement.
An Opposition tactics committee has
been set up to advise on how best to use
next week further material relating to
the winding-up of the Costigan royal
commission.
Final decisions will be left to Pea-
cock but the current thinking is that no
one will be named. Backbenchers, how-
ever, are hard to control in the heat of
debate.
The government for its part will be
denying strongly that the winding-up of
Costigan was any part of a cover-up, as
Hawke put it last week, “to prevent the
identification of anyone, whatever their
station in life, who may be
involved in this insid-
ious and abominable (drug)
traffic.”
Indeed, the government
will point out that the Fraser
coalition government which
preceded it had planned to
close Costigan at the end of
1982 before establishment of
the proposed National Crimes
Commission. The government
will try to deflect any political
disadvantages perceived from
Hawke’s display last week.
At this stage, it might be
said that the costs of the emo-
tional fallout from the crime
debate are about even.
In a moment of anger in
parliament, Peacock called
Hawke “this little crook ... a


perverter of the law . . . one who associ-
ates with criminals and takes his orders
from those who direct those criminals.”
The outburst appalled even Peacock’s
closest associates. For the next few days,
he was sandbagged verbally and his ca-
reer as Opposition leader was virtually
written off.
And then there were Hawke’s tears
when he spoke of the effect of personal
attacks on his wife and family es-
pecially his daughter Susan who has
had two drug-related convictions
quashed on appeal.
The initial reaction certainly was one
of great sympathy for Hawke, a man
who has never hidden his human frail-
ties. It is not the first time he has wept in
public. He did so when in opposition,
over Israel, and the effect was to re-
inforce the impression of a deeply sym-
pathetic and responsive human being.
Whether this will hold good as Prime
Minister is another matter.
The whole grubby business of poli-
tics is about testing people under press-
ure and last week’s spectacle must at
least raise questions again about
Hawke’s reactions when the going gets
tough.
Deputy Opposition leader John
Howard spoke about Hawke’s “glass
jaw.” And Peacock, while sympathising,
said his family had suffered 18 months
of his being called a cheat, liar and
friend of tax-dodgers.
Said Peacock: “It’s a tough pro-
fession we’re in. And while you must
show grace under pressure, you mustn’t
buckle under it.”
Whatever the effects on
Hawke, one result has been to
bring Peacock back from the
political dead at least for
the time being. While a good
deal of Liberal Party concern
about his leadership persists,
the events of the past week or
so have brought out his fight-
ing qualities albeit with his
back to the wall.
The government has been
put on the defensive over the
crime issue.
More importantly, from
the point of view of electoral
strategy, the crime debate has
diverted attention from the
economy the lowering of in-
flation, unemployment and
interest rates where the
cards have fallen almost en-
tirely the government’s way.
The economic recovery has
few pluses for the Opposition
in the run up to an election
and focusing on other issues
in the last session of parlia-
ment must be seen as a tactical
success, however unintention-
al it might be.
This is not to say that the improve-
ment in the economy will not be the de-
ciding factor in the poll. An election in
early December would allow the gov-
ernment to take full advantage of its
November tax cuts.
Peacock will try to counter this with
fears over the pensioner assets test and
“hidden” Medicare tax but he is unlike-
ly to make significant headway against a
government still riding high in the
opinion polls.
It is here that attacks on the govern-
ment’s credibility over organised crime
assume some importance.
The government denies emphatically
that there has been any weakening of its
attack on organised crime in general or
on the drug trade in particular.
The irony for Peacock is that, even if
matters of substance are revealed, the
long-term beneficiary may well be not
himself but his deputy.
To survive as Opposition leader,
Peacock has to hold if not reduce the
government’s majority of 25 seats in the
enlarged House. If he fails, Howard al-
most certainly will take over.
Howard, who distanced himself clev-
erly from Peacock over the personal at-
tack on Hawke, returned to the fray
after the prime ministerial tears. He said
Hawke was ready to “dish it out” but
also to “threaten legal actions to silence
personal criticism.”
Howard is still breathing down Pea-
cock's neck. So when parliament re-
sumes Peacock will have to prove his
qualities on two fronts one against
Hawke; one against his own party. □
Bob Hawke: tears at his Canberra press conference
CANBERRA TIMES
PUBLIC OPINION
Peacock at a
record low
after attack
FEDERAL Opposition Leader Andrew
Peacock’s approval rating plummeted
to a record low 25 percent in the week-
end after he accused Prime Minister
Bob Hawke of being a “little crook.”
A Morgan Gallup Poll taken on the
weekend of September 15 and 16 shows
that Peacock’s approval rating slumped
by nine points. The poll, published ex-
clusively in The Bulletin, also shows that
Labor would have been returned with
an increased majority had an election
been held at that time.
The poll was taken at the height of
criticism of Peacock for his outburst
against Hawke. A total of 1012 voters
was interviewed. The normal Morgan
Gallup political polling, however,
covers a slightly larger sample and is
conducted over two weekends.
The full poll results will be published
in The Bulletin next week. They will re-
flect to some extent voters’ perceptions
of the apparent improvement in Pea-
cock’s fortunes last week as he ex-
plained the reasons for his criticism of
the government as being soft on crime.
They also will record voters’ reactions
to the sight of Hawke crying as he de-
fended himself and his family.
Early indications from last week-
end’s polling are that Peacock’s and
Hawke’s approval ratings have
improved.
The early indications also are that
Hawke still holds his large lead over
Peacock on whom electors believe
would make the better prime minister.
The initial polling disclosed that 58
percent (up 10) disapproved of the way
Peacock was handling his job and 17
percent were undecided. On the same
weekend, Hawke’s approval rating
dropped 2 percent to 66.
Peacock’s approval is the lowest ob-
tained by the Morgan Gallup Poll for
any leader of the opposition. It equals
Sir William McMahon’s lowest ap-
proval rating as prime minister, re-
corded in April 1972.
On September 15/16, Australian
Labor Party support was 51 percent,
while 42 percent (up 1) supported the
Liberal-National coalition, 5 percent
Australian Democrats and 2 percent
other parties.
Of all electors surveyed, 73 percent
(up 2) said they felt Hawke made the
better Prime Minister while 15 percent
(down 2) said Peacock would. Of L-NP
voters surveyed, 44 percent said Hawke


made the better Prime Minister while 34
percent said Peacock would and 22 per-
cent were undecided.

THE CINEMA
Video threat
a cause
of concern
By BRUCE STANNARD
A 40 PERCENT slump in cinema box
office earnings since February and the
threat that poses to investor confidence
in the burgeoning film industry is forc-
ing the federal government to consider
regulations banning videotape release
of films for at least 12 months after the
end of their initial cinema seasons.
Home Affairs minister Barry Cohen
has had talks with video industry lead-
ers following a strong submission by the
Australian Film Commission in support
of the “video window” concept.
Video industry spokesmen who
are adamant that the government must
stay out of the marketplace blame the
downturn on a variety of factors inclu-
ding a recent paucity of good movies.
However, commission chief execu-
tive Kim Williams claims there must be
a correlation between what he describes
as “the massive downturn in consumer
box office and the huge exponential in-
crease in video rentals.”
“The 40 percent downturn comes
when there are more than two million
video rentals a week,” he said. “In the
space of just 30 months, video penetra-
tion in Australia has gone from 9 per-
cent to 38 percent.”
By the end of next year video
cassette recorders are expected to be in-
stalled in 50 percent of Australian
homes by far the highest penetration
in the world. (The corresponding
United States figure is 18 percent.)
Cohen shares Williams’ concerns
over what he sees as a significant threat
to the multi-million-dollar Australian
film industry which has been nurtured
so carefully by government taxation
concessions.
“As a government,” Cohen said, “we
have a responsibility to ensure that the
development that has occurred in the
Australian film industry over the past 15
years doesn’t simply collapse. Most
Australian films depend to a large de-
gree on getting a substantial amount of
their money back in Australian box
office receipts. What we are concerned
about is that, if the Australian cinema
business continues to decline as it has
done over the past few months, then
Australian films will be seriously affec-
ted by it.”
Cohen described the video window
idea as “a pretty drastic step.”
“It involves legislation and govern-
ment interference in the marketplace,”


he said, “and I’m not sure it can be
done. It may be that there is a great
technological revolution going on out
there in Australian homes, the likes of
which we haven’t seen since the intro-
duction of television.
“On the other hand it may simply be
a fad that will wane.
“We must, therefore, get a clearer
picture of what is emerging before we
start to take drastic action. I have got to
make sure Australian films get a reason-
able return. At the moment, all the pro-
ducers get out of film-video release in
Australia is about $50,000 to $60,000.
That is a fraction of what they could ex-
pect to get if they had a good run at the
cinemas.”
Cohen will be raising these and other
problems in discussions irr-Melbourne
next week with Jack Valeriti, president
of the Association of American Motion
Pictures and Television Producers Inc.
Cohen said his next move would be
to “wait and see” what the box office re-
ceipts are like for the September quar-
ter. “If we do go for the
video window idea,” he
said, “I want to be very
sure it’s going to work be-
cause I don’t believe in in-
terfering in the market-
place unless it’s absolutely
essential.”
The video window con-
cept was raised at a confer-
ence of cinema exhibitors
held in Melbourne in
April. The term “window”
is cinema industry jargon
which refers to the various
means of exploiting a
product.
“If you put three win-
dows together,” Williams
said, “you see the same
thing although each one of the windows
is a different form of exploitation of the
property. In Australia, we have four
windows theatrical release, non-the-
atrical release, video and commercial
TV.
“The distributors maintain that free
market forces should be allowed to op-
erate in cinema. We say no such things
as a free market exists in cinema. There
is one product, the Australian product,
which has this as its primary market.
Overseas product doesn’t really have a
minimum price in Australia. It will take
whatever it can get because its principal
costs and profits are realised else-
where.”
Arthur Griffin, managing director of
RCA/Columbia Pictures/Hoyts Video
Pty Ltd had discussions with Cohen in
Canberra last week and made it clear he
saw no necessity for a video window.
“We see no reason why video re-
leases should affect the potential of the
Australian film industry,” he said. “A
A typical video shop: they constitute a threat to cinemas
Kim Williams: film man
Arthur Griffin: video man
film’s success in this country is based
mainly on its Sydney-Melbourne down-
town first-run season. So, regardless of
video, if films don’t work in the city,
very rarely are they played in the pro-
vincial areas.
“I submit that any downturn in city
box office is due entirely to product.
Until recently, they have had very few
blockbusters and the films they have
had have not had any public appeal.
I’ve seen the cinema industry go
through these cycles before. For some
reason, none of the releases seem to
work and then you will get a glut of
blockbusters.”
Williams says video represents “a
massive cultural dumping exercise, pri-
marily for American product.
“So many of the gains that have been
made in terms of Australians seeing
themselves on their cinema or television
screens have been perverted,” he said.
“Now we are in a position where we
have 3900 titles on release and of those
only 104 are Australian.
“Cinema is a very large
cash generator to the own-
ers of copyright in film.
Video is not. Video is the
only area in film where you
actually see the outright
sale of copyright by the
distributor to the public. In
all other media the copy-
righting is licensed for a
fixed period of years. With
video, the copyrighting is
not one of continuing ex-
ploitation where each
transaction benefits the
producer. There is only
one transaction which ben-
efits the producer and that
is the sale of the tape. But
then the tape can be rented 40 or 140
times and the producer doesn’t benefit
from any of those rentals.
“The only people who benefit from
the rentals are (those who own) the
video shopfronts.
“For a country with an industry as
delicately poised economically as Aus-
tralia’s that is cause for concern,” Wil-
liams said.
“It has to become a much more ag-
gressive retailer,” he said. “We are see-
ing some evidence of that already in the
half-price Tuesday screenings in Hoyts
and Village cinemas (in NSW), the
Bankcard introduction in Hoyts and
Greater Union, the telephone booking
of fixed reserve seating with all of the
chains, the creche facilities which Hoyts
are offering and discount pricing.
“All those strategies will, in the long
term, have a terrific impact on audi-
ences. I think they will start to renew
consumer confidence in the cinema,”
Williams said. □

Not exactly showered with compliments
RON SAW
THE DAY AFTER being admitted to
membership of the Palm Tree Bay
Yacht Club, Benjie and Pamela Frensy
sailed their boat a neat, 26ft Ranger
sloop up from Sydney to the club’s
marina.
It was a pleasant day in early spring
but a blustery north-easter on the nose
made it an exhausting sail and when
finally they tied up Pamela felt that
nothing on earth would restore her soul
so much as a long, hot, soapy shower
perhaps followed by a gill or
two of gin and tonic.
She swung around the
forestay and stepped lightly
ashore; a lithe, stirring sight;
one to bring champagne to the
blood and lust to the mind of
the oldest yachtsman the
oldest Calvinist, for that mat-
ter. At school, she had been
called Orbs.
From either side of a tiny
foyer let into the rear of the
club, tiled steps ran up with,
on the connecting wall, ar-
rows and lettering indicating
the men’s and women’s
changing, rooms. It was
midweek and, with midweek
racing not yet begun, Pamela
had the place to herself. She
struggled out of her slicker,
then the few remaining wisps, and
walked, sighing, into the shower room
and into one of the 10 tiled, doorless
cubicles.
She had been under the hot, relaxing
water for perhaps two minutes when
sounds and snatches of whistling told
her she was no longer alone. She took
no particular notice until she had fin-
ished showering; until she stepped from
her cubicle and saw, covered thickly,
but not thickly enough, with lather, its
head thrown back in what might have
been song, its eyes closed a man.
Pamela Frensy was neither an in-
genue nor a prude. She had known the
difference between the sexes for as long
as she could remember and, having
been happily married for three years,
she was glad about the said difference.
But one of the unwritten laws of society
said that the New Lady Members of
Yacht Clubs were Not To Be Found in
Men’s Showers.
Involuntarily she loosed off a faint
cry; then, with chin in, chest spectacu-
larly out and knees well up, she
bounded to her clothes, dragged on the
still-clammy yellow slicker and, seconds
later, was sprinting back along the ma-
rina now a sight to cause the Oldest
Member, up in the bar, to call to his lord
and pour his rum over his chin.
The night before the Frensys had
arrived, another new member, Howard
Bottle, had sailed south from Coffs Har-
bor. The Palm Tree yachtsmen had
made him so welcome that about 7am
three of them had joined him in his
cockpit for a nourishing breakfast of
Rice Bubbles in Bailey’s Irish Cream;
then, for something rather more savory,
a handle or two of Cooper’s lager.
It was when Howie stood on the
stern of his yacht to piddle that the
trouble began.
In the cockpit of the next door yacht,
wearing what appeared to be a floral
tent, her hair hideous with lightning-
conductors or curlers or ironware of
some sort Howie wasn’t seeing ’em
too well stood a Person. She was
looking aft, apparently mouthing the
Morning Hymn and washing some-
thing pink and frightful in a bucket. Her
eye, which seemed to have all the essen-
tial qualities of a bradawl, took in the
hapless tosspot and her voice cavalry
bugle? klaxon? caused flotillas of sea-
gulls to arise in terror.
“You!” she shrieked. “Are you a
member of this club?”
“Yes. I just...”
“Well, if you’re going to spend your
time exposing yourself to the wives of
other members, I’m going to make
damn sure you’re not around much
longer.”
Howie tried to wrap his clumsy
tongue around a species of defence but
his guests, now into buttered rum, called
him below.
“Don’t get in a barney with that old
trot,” said an architect named Bouncer.
“That’s old Mother Cutting. She cuts
strong men’s balls out for breakfast.”
“I HEARD that, Mr Bouncer,”
brayed the trumpet. “This club doesn’t
need people like YOU, either.”
As Howie farewelled the crapulous
crew, Mother Cutting was on the air
again: “Perfectly good lavatories not a
stone’s throw away yet you
carry on like the Bondi sewer-
age outfall ...”
In a low state of mind,
Howie crept into a bunk and
slept for eight dreamless
hours.
It was about spm when he
came to. He knew at once that
only hot water, relaxation and
perhaps prayer could cure a
tongue that seemed to be
covered with small sticky
blowflies and eyes that were
clouded with blood.
Not daring to look toward
the virago next door, he
sprang on to the marina,
sprinted to the showers, each
jarring footfall opening a flap
that had, apparently, been cut
into the top of his head, and
followed the arrow that said Men.
Howie spent perhaps five minutes
letting the hot jets get his mind in order,
then stepped out of the cubicle and, eyes
closed, lathered everything from his
head south. Somewhere about the loin
level his mind was deranged again by a
squeal that was clearly feminine. He
opened his eyes just in time to see a
splendid haunch moving to the lockers.
His blood ran cold.
Surely to God he had followed the
right arrow. Well . . . Apparently not:
otherwise why were the showers choked
with naked, bellowing women?
It was not a time to argue the toss.
Howie followed the haunch, made a
bundle of his clothes, fled nakedly down
one set of steps and up the next, then
stopped. And screamed.
From a mirror a huge figure turned:
a figure now free of tenting and iron-
work; a figure as naked as he; wearing
an expression somewhere between that
of the awful beast Grendel and that
worn by the oldest inmate of Treblinka
to welcome Himmler on visiting days.
“SO NOW IT’S RAPE!” trumpeted
Mother Cutting. □


Vote on Harry: Clean or Dirty
PHILLIP ADAMS
SOME YEARS ago, Canada had an
Expo. And one of the displays was a
film in which the audience could vote
on plot options. When a man knocked
at the hotel door of a beautiful young
woman, they could vote on her re-
sponse: Fet him in or slam the door in
his face. Needless to say, the majority of
people voted for erotic possibilities
rather than virtue.
Now a Hollywood company is trying
to market the idea under the brand
name Choice-a-rama. They are already
into test markets, with the company’s
president saying that “rural audiences
make choices in exact opposition to
those aggressive metropolitans.” It
seems that city-dwellers go for violence
over non-violence and for sex over celi-
bacy.
Under the system, in rougher sec-
tions of town you will see a rougher
movie. Dirty Harry and The Dirty Dozen
will be even dirtier. Just think: In a
Choice-a-rama movie you could avoid
the bombs going off in The Day After. A
gay audience in San Francisco might
want Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid to get married, rather than mown
down. Had we been able to vote at
Hoyts’ matinees in the 19405, you can
bet the red indians would have beaten
the cowboys.
I think I would vote for any option
that made films shorter. Even the best of
them seem too long. I’d have preferred
Cecil B. De Mille’s The Two Command-
ments. And The Dirty Three. And,
having seen that limp-wristed Pommy
version of Tarzan directed by Hugh
Chariots of Fire Hudson, I’d have voted
to avoid the opening shipwreck. That
way, my fond memories of Johnny
Weismuller would have been unsullied.
(What was that film called? Greystokesl
Or Chimpanzees Of Firel)
My version of The Sound Of Music
would not be quite as long, either. In the
middle of the credits, Julie Andrews
would fall over a precipice.
I FIRST visited France in 1970, seeking
ideas to rejig the demoralised if not de-
funct Australian film industry. Those of
us trying to make features were a motley
and malevolent bunch who treated each
other appallingly. With success so elu-
sive, we tended to be jealous of each
other’s tiny triumphs and were our own
worst enemies.
So you can imagine my delight with
the Society for Film Directors in Paris.
Talking to the members, I found that
the worst thing one would say about
another’s film was “It is interesting.”
Moreover, every director with one
notable exception belonged to the so-
ciety: All the young new wave directors,
plus the living legends such as Tati and
Bresson. The conspicuous absentee?
Jean-Fuc Godard, who regarded the so-
ciety as nauseatingly bourgeois.
Godard was that one-man revolution
who had rocketed to celebrity and no-
toriety with films such as Breathless,
Alphaville and Weekend.
I had never enjoyed his films; I
found them pretentious, technically
sloppy and all but incoherent. And I
was amused by the way in which he had
rejected almost every cinema conven-
tion.
I remember how he began one of his
features by having his two leading ac-
tors sit with their backs to the camera
for 10 minutes all very defiant and
avant-garde.
Now, a controversy has broken out
in Paris which suggests that we are to
witness a public punch-up at least as in-
teresting as Patrick White versus Sidney
Nolan or Mary McCarthy versus Fillian
Helmann. It’s a real heavyweight bout
between Godard and Marcel Ophuls
who made the remarkable television
documentary The Sorrow and the Pity ,
concerning the years of collaboration
and resistance under German occupa-
tion.
“Jean-Fuc Godard,” Ophuls de-
clares, “is one of the most original
thinkers among contemporary film-
makers. But that is not the key to his
universal and lasting notoriety. After
the traumatic discovery of various na-
tional majorities’ unlimited capacity for
treason, selfishness and corruption in
Nazi-occupied Europe, post-war gener-
ations went shopping for intellectual in-
fluences that could rationalise their own
vulnerabilities to opportunism and cow-
ardice.
“In film-making perhaps the most
prestigious of all intellectual pursuits of
that period Godard provided the
recipe for permanent escape from moral
responsibility. In our profession, he set
out to discredit craftsmanship. By show-
ing that acrobats need not bother with
balance and that clowns need not be
funny, he led a mass escape from criti-
cal accountability for bourgeois dilet-
tantes. Now he decrees that ‘politics is
only a movie made in Russia,' declaring
in effect the self-serving amnesty on all
the radical-chic terrorism of the past
two decades.
“In matters of form, flight from re-
sponsibility produces destruction of
values by the promotion of amateurism.
In matters of substance, it produces the
same destruction by resignation and
cynicism.
“In 1968, at the Cannes Festival,
while Francois Truffaut and Fouis
Malle somewhat pathetically were
hanging on the curtain of the festival
hall to prevent further screenings in the
face of De Gaulle’s riot police, Jean-Fuc
was seen to be negotiating a deal with
the Hakim brothers in the lobby of the
Hotel Martinez. And, after French jour-
nalists and television directors had lost
the strike for an independent status of
French state television and many of us
were thrown out on our ears, the same
Godard was the very first film director
to offer his services to the new manage-
ment of the state monopoly.
“If the veterans of the new wave ever
got together to stage a benefit perform-
ance of The Caine Mutiny, I’ve always
thought that Jean-Fuc would be ideal in
the part played on screen by Fred
Mac Murray.”
In recent years, we Australian film-
makers have become very civilised and
supportive. The worst thing we say
about each other’s films is that they are
“interesting.” Indeed, we’ve become a
claque, a pressure group, more con-
cerned with taxation concessions than
with self-criticism.
Perhaps we should declare a mora-
torium on self-aggrandisement and re-
turn to our proud tradition of hacking
each other to pieces. I seem to remem-
ber that back-stabbing was a lot more
fun than back-scratching. □


Circuses, no; zoos, perhaps
DAVID McNICOLL
I GO along with quite a few of the views
about circuses expressed by the Mayor
of Sydney’s Ku-ring-gai, Alderman
Steven Klinger. I have reservations
about condemnation of zoos.
Circuses I regard as spectacles to be
avoided. I have not been to one since
my teens and would not go to another;
though I must admit I have seen circus
scenes on television.
I regard the training of animals to
perform tricks and face hazards they
must abhor as demeaning and often dis-
gusting. If anyone can tell me that a lion
or tiger enjoys leaping through a blazing
circle of fire, then I will get the earliest
possible appointment for them with a
nut doctor. And why should magnifi-
cent bears be forced to dance for the
edification of moronic crowds? Why
should majestic elephants be made to
perform tricks?
I must confess I feel no sadness when
I read of a trainer or a keeper getting his
come-uppance from an animal, just as I
rejoice to read of the occasional bull
bagging a matador.
Zoos? Well, that’s different. Al-
though I don’t visit zoos, I know that
zoo animals are well treated and given
as much freedom as possible in most
civilised countries. What is
more, with the upsurge in
poaching and wild animal
slaughter in Africa, it may be
that zoos eventually will be
the only means of per-
petuating certain species.

spent part of his time in the
Northern Territory.
Asked his opinion about
Aboriginal problems, he ex-
pressed certain very moderate
views. But his views did not
please the elders of the North-
ern Territory Land Council
so they refused him per-
mission to visit Aboriginal
land areas.
I SEE that Actors’ Equity,
backed by the federal govern-
ment, refused to let an actress
from America come to Aus-
tralia to take the lead in a
locally-made film. Result:
cancellation of the film.
Reason given for refusal: such
importations put local actors
out of work. Yet the Australian Broad-
casting Corporation, with full support
from the federal government, is allowed
to import Brits to fill various positions
in the corporation no doubt denying
work to well-qualified Australians.
CLIVE EVATT, QC, who threw in his
hand last week, was one of the most
colorful members of the Sydney bar and
certainly the fount of many of its most
hilarious stories.
I liked the one of Clive and his fairly
regular adversary Justice “Jock”
McClemens. On one occasion, when the
judge’s eyes had been giving trouble, he
ordered the blinds lowered in the court-
room to cut out the glare. The effect was
a sepulchral gloom.
Evatt arrived in court late, with the
judge already on the bench. As he en-
tered, Evatt banged noisily into
benches, knocked over a couple of
chairs, tapped his way forward, his arms
outstretched and, when he reached the
bar table, lit a match.
“Just what do you think you are do-
ing?” asked the exasperated Mc-
Clemens.
“Ah, there you are, Your Honor,”
said Evatt, holding the match aloft and
Circus life: a tiger put through the hoops
peering up at the judge. The court, as
the saying goes, dissolved in laughter.
A COUPLE of years ago, the in cliche
was “at this point of time” or “at this
point in time.”
Today, thanks to Bob Hawke, the in
word is “address.” Everyone is “ad-
dressing” themselves to problems or
questions. Vincent Smith, of television
station ATN, in The Sydney Morning
Herald : “We have not addressed our-
selves to that question yet.” I ask you!
MY HONG KONG correspondent re-
ports that Deng Pufang, son of the
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has
been visiting Hong Kong as leader of a
delegation from the China Welfare
Fund for the Handicapped of which
he is deputy director-in-chief.
Deng, who is crippled, visited vari-
ous institutions, called on the governor,
looked at housing, racecourses and a
film studio.
And how was Deng crippled?
During the Cultural Revolution, the
over-zealous red guards forced him out
of a fourth-floor window at Peking Uni-
versity where he was studying physics.
The result: a broken spine.
MY VISIT to far north Queensland was
an eye-opener. For instance, I was ap-
proached by some responsible citizens
of Cairns to be briefed on the Daintree
rainforest threats. These were not
hippies or greenies but sensible people
concerned about their environment.
They feel that Premier Joh is not
really aware of the dangers to the area
and that he has been manipulated by
politicians and developers.
The other eye-opener was the plight
of the cane farmers. Hundreds of small
cane growers are in the same position as
a wheat or sheep farmer after years of
crippling drought: it’s not shortage of
water, it’s the world drop in prices.
One young farmer told me he had
been borrowing to pay the interest on
his earlier borrowings and that he
would soon have to walk off his farm.
WE ARE inclined to become immune
to shock when we read road toll figures
in the papers. But I heard some figures
last week which really shook me.
At the funeral of a young man killed
in a car smash it was revealed that, of
the 180 lads who left his school in his
particular year, 18-10 percent! - had
died in road accidents. □


BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
Comics: movies made with ink and paper
POP ARTIST Claes Oldenburg once
said: “I am for an art that does some-
thing other than sit on its arse in a mu-
seum.”
He was referring to comic art, some-
thing which in recent years has taken on
a grand respectability. Until recently, all
comic memorabilia was considered gar-
bage good material for the church
paper drive.
But there has been a boom in the
sophisticated comic for the adult in the
past year. One hesitates to use the word
“adult;” it has been defiled almost as
much as has “gay.” When we say
“adult,” read it as a word meaning “a
mature person.”
So, the modern phenomenon is the
bookshop almost exclusively for
comics. Sydney has Comic Kingdom
and The Land Beyond. Brisbane has
Basement Comics and Pegasus Book-
shop. Melbourne has Space Age Books
and Minotaur in good, prime Swanston
Street territory.
The proprietor of Minotaur is Colin
Paraskevas, a comic-lover with an evan-
gelistic fervor. “Comics always have
been looked down on in this country.
People only think of ha-ha comics. Or
of Superman, Spiderman or some super
hero. They don’t think of it as an art
form.”
He cited the French and the Belgians
as the world’s greatest comic-lovers. He
said the French produced comic books
in hard covers with exquisite color
graphics and had TV programs in which
critics got together and discussed the
latest output. The Japanese, too, were
literally berserk over comics.
“They have comics which weekly sell
three million units to children and two
million to adults.”
The new era comic has moved away
from the superhero and into the whole
range of human activity but it is very
imaginative. A lot are mystic, idealistic,
romantic; some are deeply pessimistic
and deal with environmental themes.
In the old days, the comic was re-
stricted because it was believed to be
destined only for the child. Now, all re-
straints are gone: breasts, copulation,
genitals, heads being severed, gushing
blood; they are all there.
Paraskevas says the renaissance be-
gan a little more than four years ago. “It
started with a magazine called Epic,
aimed at a more mature audience. It
worked. Everybody was bored with
superheroes. At first, they were hesitant
to do it but then came the speciality
comic shops. They were
able to sell at discount
prices and so the maga-
zines were able to gauge
exactly the size of their
audience. They became
more confident and exper-
imental in their themes.
“Next came the graphic
novel. They brought out
the comic novel in hard
cover. Marvel had eight
issues out before DC fol-
lowed suit.”
But it was not only the
big publishers. In the new
era, smaller companies
started producing adult
magazines.
And the movement has
spread to Australia. Maga-
zines which sell for 60
cents in the United States
are 95 cents here. Minotaur
air freights them in and
sells them at the same price
as the news-stands but
three months earlier. Tues-
day is the big day. The
comics usually arrive on
that day and the fans are
hanging round the store.
Paraskevas complained
that Australia was the only
country in the world that
did not have its own comic
industry. There have been
bold attempts Reverie and Oz Comics
but the best hope of reaching inter-
national quality is Inkspots whose
fourth issue has just appeared.
Philip Bentley, Greg Gates and Para-
skevas are the editors. The artwork is in
the great Australian black-and-white
tradition, very good indeed and su-
perior to many American magazines.
The current issue says aggressively:
“An Australian comic. It’s not an ego
wank by people who thought they
would like to have a bash at comics. It’s
not by people who plunder tired Ameri-
can underground comics for ideas. This
is not a magazine by people who, in an
exploitive effort to make a quick buck,
plagiarise the American mainstream of
comics. We believe that Australians
given time and opportunity can develop
a voice and style of their own.”
There are four artists in the current
issue: Fil Barlow, a freelance who has
done work for Australian Playboy and
Penthouse; Steph Campbell and Chris
Johnston, who run the GASPP studio
The message from
Australia’s Inkspots
in St Kilda; and Philip
Kanledes, who has the
High Velocity Workshop.
The brilliant Barlow is
only 20. He is gifted at cre-
ating creatures which can
out-Spielberg Spielberg.
Barlow believes that the
new comics are an exten-
sion of the TV and video
boom. “This is entertain-
ment at high speed,” he
says. “It is like reading a
good book only faster.
And you get the pictures as
well.
“It’s a backlash. People
don’t read books that
much any more. It is so
easy to vegetate looking at
two-dimensional movies.
These comics make you
use your imagination. I am
using my imagination visu-
ally to enhance your im-
agination; it’s an exercise.
To me, it is a low-budget
film. All I need is ink and
paper.”
Paraskevas is thrilled
that he can make a living
out of a specialised busi-
ness. Thirty percent of his
comic clients are children,
60 percent are aged be-
tween 18 and 35 and 10
percent are more than 35.
He says it is part nostalgia. People
are comfortable with comics. There’s
something reassuring about them. They
bring back the old days when “things
were pretty good.” Of course, there are
purists who buy for the graphics. For
example: Raw, produced annually in
New York.
Warrior and Escape, from England,
are good magazines with high-quality
storylines. And Metal Hurlant from
France is great every artist has a dis-
tinct style.
But we have a long way to go with
comics. “Do you know,” Paraskevas
said, “I have to be careful not to make
my place too intimidating? I need to
have things other than comics or people
are too frightened to come in. In Aus-
tralia, it is still considered shameful to
be seen reading a comic.”
Inkspots has a print run of 5000
800 go to America and 200 to England.
But just as I was leaving they received
a new English order for 3000. There is
hope yet for the Australian comic. □

In London, a new book by the irrepress-
ible Henry Root recalls the incident
when biographer Michael Holroyd was
invited to dinner at Princess Margaret’s
apartments in Kensington Palace. Hav-
ing been warned to be on his guard
against tyjs hostess’s notorious penchant
for doing impressions at the table,
the nervous Holroyd burst into hoots
of laughter at what he took to be
Margaret’s portrayal of an upper-class
twit. Alas, HRH was speaking in her
normal voice.
Brit battler Chris Humphrey, of Clacton,
Essex, has changed his name by deed
poll to Mr Ha Ha Woof Woof. “It’s my
way of sticking two fingers up at the
Inland Revenue,” he said. “They’ve
treated me like an idiot and a dog. Id-
iots go ha, ha and dogs go woof, woof.”

In Sydney to help promote the publica-
tion of his great-uncle Henry Lawson’s
two-volume Complete Works (see page
70): Peter Lawson, of Magnetic Island,
Queensland. Lawson, 38, born in
Townsville and educated in Brisbane,
did a commercial art course in Mel-
bourne but at 18, as lead guitarist, he
was running a rock group in Townsville,
specialising in the Mersey Beat. At 24 he
drove through Sturt’s Stony Desert to
Birdsville and found his true vocation
as an artist of the outback. Apart from
exhibitions that have made him known
throughout Queensland, he has ach-
ieved fame as a book illustrator not only
of Lawson’s poems and stories but also
of books about Queensland outback
towns notably Don Roderick’s Rav-
enswood and his father Albury Lawson’s
Townsville: An Early History.
On East Sixth Street a beat-up, run-
down, fly-blown section of New York,
Jimmy Carter, the former president of
the United States, donned a hard hat
and a carpenter’s apron and went to
work on a dilapidated six-storey slum
building. He and the former first lady,
Rosalynn, had been planning to holiday
in the Virgin Islands but changed their
minds and went to work for Habitat, an
organisation that builds low-cost hous-
ing for the poor in the US and 11 other
countries. In 13 months, the completed
renovation will contain 19 apartments
which will be offered for $30,000 to
$35,000 each and which will earn not
a single vote.
The latest and 14th novel by Irving
Wallace is called The Miracle, which is
probably a better title than Just plain
Hokum: it depends on your faith. Do
you believe the story of Bernadette, the
peasant girl who had visions at Lourdes
in 1858? Do you believe that Bernadette
could have left a secret notebook saying
that the Virgin Mary will appear again
on a certain date? You don’t have to
believe it: it’s just a novel. But the odds
are that Wallace has another best-seller.
Queensland developer Keith Williams’
new toy $lOO million worth of action
at Hamilton Island is known locally
as “ofif-the-coast Gold Coast” and in-
volves the predictable amount of
razzmatazz. But its main attraction
could well prove to be koalas. Five were
flown to the island last week from Bris-
bane to be met by the current favorite
vacationer: US TV’s Entertainment This
Week compere Dixie Whatley. Animal-
fanciers should relax: the climate is OK
for koalas. So is the eucalyptus.


Among the judges at the Sydney Hilton
final of the Miss Perrier quest will be
fashion photographer David Mist, a fel-
low of handsome if unremarkable
scantlings, and Parisian model Virginia
Wark who, says Mist, will make him
look like a duck. When she was dis-
covered, by Double Bay agent Vivien
Smith, Wark was behind the counter of
a sports store in Shoal Bay, NSW, and
could have been mistaken, had she been
wearing a snood, for a netball basket.
Smith, awestricken, saw that the girl
stood at least 183 cm (6ft in English).
Wark came to Sydney, did well, moved
on to Paris where she lives and did
better because, the fashion industry ex-
plains, the Europeans like tall girls.
Very well, then: for 100 years the
Barnardo organisation, which took its
name from Dr Thomas Barnardo, sent
unhappy, underprivileged young Poms
from Britain to Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and Kenya. But they stopped
coming to Australia in 1965. Now, as
the charity’s new chairman Jennifer
Darvall points out, Barnardo’s looks
after 800 young Australians in NSW
and the ACT. That costs about $2 mil-
lion a year, almost all of which comes
from private donations. But Darvall’s
son, Young Chum, is still Bank-
America’s DINGO boy; and sooner or
later that will do him or BA or
Barnardo’s or all those little Ozzes no
harm at all.
Not long after Australia ll’s America’s
Cup win last year, Faber and Faber, the
London publishers, commissioned Bul-
letin writer Bruce Stannard to do design-
er Ben Lexcen’s biography. Fabers
asked for and got 60,000 words
within five weeks on the grounds that it
would take them a good 10 months of
fiddling with printers and binders be-
fore they could ship the books for sim-
ultaneous publication in New York,
Melbourne and London. Prime Minis-
ter Bob Hawke, who got a lot of mileage
from the celebrations at the Royal Perth
Yacht Club, was on hand in Sydney this
week for the launching at the Cruising
Yacht Club, one year to the day later.
When Father Brian Gore was released
from jail in the Philippines last July,
Stannard again was asked to write the
biography this time by William Col-
lins, Australia. Again Stannard wrote
60,000 words, inside four weeks, but the
local boys were able to turn the manu-
script into soft-cover reality within six
weeks. Poor Man’s Priest: The Father
Brian Gore Story will be in the book-
stores in mid-October.

CHESS
USSR still on top
by Terrey Shaw
THE INCREASING worldwide popu-
larity of chess has brought with it a dra-
matic improvement in playing stan-
dards. This has meant that the he-
gemony which the USSR once enjoyed
is no longer so evident.
Twenty years ago, if a Soviet
grandmaster played in an event in the
West, he won it. The past decade or so
has seen a gradual shift so that these
days it is no longer a surprise to see a
Soviet player finish out of the top three.
Because of this, the recent match in
London between the USSR and the Rest
of the World was expected to give the
Rest a chance to avenge their 1970 de-
feat when they narrowly lost a similar
match over 20 boards by This
time the match was over only 10 boards
but the result, surprisingly, was worse.
The USSR ran home winners by 21-19.
The star performer for the Soviets
was Alexander Beliavsky on board six,
who scored 3/ 2 to / 2 . Although a bit
lucky to beat Yasser Seirewan of the US
in round 1, he conducted a highly
efficient mopping-up operation in the
following game. The only player to lose
two games straight, the unfortunate
Seirewan was dropped from the Rest
team and bundled home on the next
plane after this game.

readers have pointed out, the mate in

nores the proferred Rook and simply
replies 1 ... K-Rl! This leads me to sus-
pect that grandmaster Gligoric may
have declined to play the mate in five on
purpose, rather than as an oversight as I
suggested originally.
Naturally, many regular readers
weren’t fooled, being pretty close to
grandmaster standard themselves these
days thanks to regular helpings of this
column.
In recognition of the restrained na-
ture of the critical remarks in their let-
ters, it seems only fair for me to bite
the bullet and award a second prize for
the clearest explanation of the flaw.
This goes to lan Allen, of St Arnaud,
Victoria. □


ESPIONAGE
Vladimir Petrov:
a decoy for
the MIS moles
As the federal government finally unlocks the Petrov royal
commission papers, RUPERT LOCKWOOD witness over
nine days at the inquiry raises a startling new theory: Petrov,
he suggests, was a decoy to divert attention from Kim Philby,
Anthony Blunt, Roger Hollis and other Soviet agents who had
penetrated MI 5. Lockwood, the alleged author of Document J,
part of which particularly the references to Labor leader Dr
H. V. Evatt and his staff he says was not his work, was the
victim of what he has branded “the high tide of McCarthyism
in Australia. ” He made inquiries about Petrov while serving as
a correspondent in Moscow and his fascinating new theory fits
the warning drawn by London Guardian reviewer Martin
Walker from Nigel West’s A Matter Of Trust, MIS, 1945-73,
that the vaunted successes of MIS “seem now to have been
KGB decoys to protect more important agents. ’’
EVEN Nikita Krushchev, soon to re-
store honor to millions consigned by
Stalin to history’s compost heaps in the
permafrost, was shedding tears. So were
the other hard-faced leaders: Malenkov,
Bulganin, Suslov, Vorishilov, Zhukov,
Mikoyan ... Stalin lay gasping for life
in his high-walled, over-patrolled
Kuntsevo dacha (country house) set in
the Moscow woods. But one was dry-
eyed. He was Vladimir Mikhailovich
Petrov’s boss, Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria,
Security Police minister and Emperor of
the Gulag.
Stalin’s daughter, Svetlana, later
wrote that Beria’s conduct at the death
scene was “very nearly obscene ... the
ring of triumph unconcealed.”
The other Politburo leaders would
have agreed with Svetlana, though not
audibly, that “the utterly degenerate
Beria” showed in his face, “repulsive at
the best of times, now twisted by his
passions cruelty, cunning and a lust
for power and more power still” his
belief “that when my father died no one
in all Russia would have greater power
in his grasp.”
Far away in Canberra, this belief was
strong in the consciousness of Afanasy
Mikhailovich Shorokov, so christened
as a peasant baby in the Orthodox
Church of Siberia’s primitive Tyumen
district in 1907. To get a start on the
right side of the track he changed his
name to Proletarsky and again, to
sound more acceptable for a diplomatic
posting abroad, to Petrov.
How this dilapidated remnant of the
Beria machine, Shorokov-Proletarsky-
Petrov, became the rabbit pulled from
Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies’ hat
on election eve in 1954 cannot be under-
stood without a glance at the life of the
Soviet security chief who ordered the
Canberra posting in 1951.
WHEN CAUGHT working for both
reds and whites in the civil war and or-
dered shot by Sergei Mironovich Kirov
who was commanding transcaucasion
operations, Beria escaped in the confu-
sion of the times.
Kirov was far away in Moscow, so
Beria was able to join the CHEKA in
Georgia on the Black Sea. (The
CHEKA, Extraordinary Commission
for Struggle Against Counter-Revol-
ution and Sabotage, was followed suc-
cessively by the GPU, OGPU, NKVD,
MGB, MVD and KGB).
Beria won the favor of his fellow-
Georgian Joseph Stalin, by low-level
spookery and sycophancy. Kirov, re-
membering his telegram for the execu-
tion of Beria, was still around. Beria or-

job.
As a cultivator of con-
spiracies to feed Stalin’s para-
noia, Beria had green fingers
there were arrests, torments,
shootings, deportations in all
corners of the vast land. This
artificer of faked plots sat at
the centre of the vast Gulag
network of labor camps like a
spider in its web.

Beria and Stalin in 1937-38
must have accounted for a fair
percentage of the 20 million
Soviet war dead.
THE PETROVS, in their Em-
pire Of Fear , made plain enough that
they had inside knowledge of murder-
ous malfeasance on the part of their
boss, Beria. Petrov was on duty at the
NKVD at the time. Mrs Petrov’s then de
facto husband Roman Krivosh and
a close 14-year-old relative were both
caught up in the roulette of life and
death and, by her own testimony,
shockingly treated.
Frame-up, false testimony and tor-
ture were the hormones of the Beria sys-
tem, as Krushchev was to reveal too
late for the credibility of those of us who
had gazed only on the dreamscape of
the Soviet Union.
In their autobiographical work, the
Petrovs spoke of “the dreadful and ap-
palling things that are done in the Soviet
Union by Soviet citizens to Soviet citi-
zens.” Petrov was in the “by,” rather
than the “to,” category.
The Petrovs’ bread was well-buttered
on top: they did not shiver in the never-
ebbing ration queues and Evdokia
Petrov was not obliged to dress in those
collapsed circus-tent models so evident
on collective farm women.
“In the 21 years since we both joined
the OGPU we have both been members
of the select minority of Soviet citizens
who are the governing bureaucracy of
modern Russia, who enjoy a life of
comparative comfort,” they wrote. They
were in an apparat that diabolised criti-
cism: the faintest whimper of protest or
sympathy for Beria victims would have
prevented any posting to embassies
Beria in 1938, head of the hated security police
abroad, as the least penalty: “A foreign
posting is a sign of official confidence in
the Soviet Union; no one who is re-
garded in any way a ‘doubtful’ case is
ever allowed outside the border of the
USSR.”
SHOROKOV, trained as a Red Navy
cypher specialist from 1930, said or did
things that commended him to the
OGPU. Only a trusted Chekist would
have been seconded, as he was, to the
nerve centre the Moscow cypher sec-
tion. There he read signal intelligence
from abroad: he knew codes and
names.
The cryptographer who now called
himself Proletarsky must have per-
formed some service that brought him
to the attention of the highest security
authorities. He was sent to Sinkiang
province in China’s west, then a sphere
of Soviet influence and ambition. Such
a key appointment probably would
have passed over Stalin’s desk for ap-
proval.
The Soviet under Stalin paid great
attention to Sinkiang, with which it had
a profitable export trade and where its
influence remained strong up to the
Chinese revolution.
Leading Soviet representatives sent
by Stalin on missions to China inclu-
ding the best-known of them, Borodin
customarily were executed after re-
turn. But Proletarsky obviously had
given services that cancelled out the
dangers of association with foreign dev-
ils. On ceremonial occasions
in Canberra, Petrov wore the
Red Star, pinned on his tunic
for machinations in this sensi-
tive province. Proletarsky was
soon promoted to major in the
NKVD and given a higher job
in cypher bureau headquar-
ters.
The Soviet push into
Sinkiang was one cause of the
souring of Sirro-Soviet rela-
tions.
PROLETARSKY, like
Shorokov, disappeared from
NKVD records. Diplomatic
passports bearing the names
of Vladimir and Evdokia
Petrov were issued for Swe-
den.
The Soviet ambassador in
Stockholm was the celebrated
Alexandra Kollontai, one of
the few Old Bolsheviks to sur-
vive the purges. This omission
was to be repaired: she went
on to the Stalin-Beria hit list.
She had become far too
friendly with Social Democrat
Swedes.
Petrov was chosen to ar-
range the evidence. Beria pro-
vided Petrov in Stockholm with a lock-
smith and microfilmer: Petrov was to
send negatives of Kollontai’s personal
diary and office and personal docu-
ments to Moscow. They went to work
during Kollontai’s contrived absence
from the capital. It was quite a job.
Kollontai had written reams, including
expressions of grief and resentment at
Stalin’s murder of her de facto husband
General Dybenko (rehabilitated by
Krushchev).
Petrov conceded in later writings
that the Kollontai he was setting up was
a “white-haired old lady of 72, by this
time paralysed and restricted to a
wheelchair.” She soon suffered a stroke.
For an associate of Lenin, she had the
rare benefaction of dying in bed.
Had Petrov felt pangs of conscience
about this conspiracy to frame a
crippled pioneer of women’s liberation
and revolutionary heroine into the
death cells of the Lubianka prison, Swe-
den would have been only too ready to
grant him asylum.
Back in Moscow, he headed the cru-
cial No 6 Section of the cypher bureau
handling secret information from
abroad and communications related to
the “Prisoners’ Kingdom,” the Gulag
Archipeligo of labor camps. Evdokia
(Dusya) Alexeyevna was in the bureau’s
Japanese section. Codes and revised
codes, names and more names flashed
on to Petrov’s desk.

before the man promoted to
colonel’s rank stepped into
the Third Secretary’s office in
the Canberra embassy on
February 5, 1951. Many un-
excavated artifacts of the
Petrov affair may never see
the light of day. Vital docu-
ments in the possession of Sir
Roger Hollis, late British in-
telligence (MIS) chief who
had a major role, went up in
flames. Alan Dalziel, opposi-
tion leader Dr Evatt’s secre-
tary, held many documents
including correspondence be-
tween Evatt and others inter-
ested both in Australia and
overseas. Efforts were made
after his death to have these
documents preserved in the
archives but no trace of them
could be found.
Peter Gruening, United
Press International South Pa-
cific bureau chief and son of
Dr Ernest Gruening, Demo-
crat senator from Alaska, was
preparing a story on the
Petrov affair that disappeared
forever in lethal carbon-mon-
oxide fumes. “Peter Gruen-
ing,” Dalziel recorded, “had
told certain people that he was follow-
ing leads that might break wide open
the political conspiracy of the Petrov
affair. As an American pressman, he
had come upon information that sug-
gested something ‘sinister’ in events
leading up to Petrov’s defection. He was
working on what he had gathered and
hoped to make it public before he re-
turned home to the USA. But that was
not to be ... He left his office one day to
drive to Mascot aerodrome to meet a
business associate from another state.
Peter Gruening never reached the aero-
drome. He just disappeared.”
Gruening left Aston Gardens,
Bellevue Hill, Sydney, on October 28,
1955. His body was not found until
November 6, in a Ford sedan, rubber
hose attached to exhaust, in bush at
Castle Hill.
Justice William O. Douglas of the
United States Supreme Court wrote to
Evatt as a friend of the distressed
Gruening family, asking Evatt if he be-
lieved there were suspicious circum-
stances. Evatt had only suspicions, no
evidence. Dalziel asked: “Why did
Peter Gruening die? He wasn’t the man
to commit suicide. Who stood to gain by
his death?” Correspondence and other
documents concerning the Gruening
mystery were in the Dalziel papers
which disappeared.
HOLLIS arrived in Canberra in 1948
with a list of Australians alleged to be
leaking information to the USSR.
Rupert Lockwood addressing a Melbourne gathering
(Hollis has been named by Chapman
Pincher, the British writer on MIS, as a
Soviet agent since 1937. And now a for-
mer MIS operative living in Tasmania,
Peter Wright, claims strong circumstan-
tial evidence that makes him 99 percent
certain of such a connection.) Another
MIS man, R. Hemblys-Scales, was al-
ready operating in Australia from a
cover post in the British high commis-
sioner’s office when Hollis flourished his
names before Prime Minister Chifley,
Evatt and Evatt’s External Affairs secre-
tary, Dr John Burton.
Officers working under Evatt al-
ready extremely unpopular in Whitehall
and Washington over his resistance to
cold war strategies were on the Hollis
blacklist even though, as Burton submit-
ted, they had no secrets to hand out.
With the aid of a visiting ex-colonial
police chief from Africa, Sir Percy Sil-
litoe, and Hemblys-Scales, the Chifley
government was persuaded by Hollis to
set up the Australian Security Intelli-
gence Organisation (ASIO). When he
succeeded Evatt in External Affairs,
Richard Gardiner Casey had advice
from the shadowy figure of Colonel
Charles Ellis about a “nest of traitors”
in the department. Ellis served as Brit-
ish liaison officer with General “Wild
Bill” Donovan’s Office of Strategic Ser-
vices (OSS), forerunner of the US Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency.
Edward Jay Epstein, reviewing in the
New York Times this year Anthony Cave
Brown’s biography of Donovan,
pointed out that Ellis “had
been working for both the
Germans and the Russians
throughout the war.” This was
a good explanation of why so
many wartime OSS opera-
tions unravelled mysteriously.
AS 1950 dawned, ASIO was
ready for some wild swings
and roundabouts. Menzies
and Casey, Ellis and “the
gnomes of Melbourne” were
calling the tune instead of
Chifley and Evatt, Burton and
Labor’s appointee at ASIO,
Mr Justice Reed.
Burton later branded the
Melbourne “gnomes” as “an
elitist group based on the mili-
tary intelligence services.” He
charged that they had with-
held knowledge from the
Chifley government and that
“they can manufacture
knowledge and I think this is
the case in respect of the
Petrov affair.” He added,
“Perhaps most importantly,
they can smear.”
BY 1950, sweat was gathering
on a few brows at MIS. Kim
Philby, Hollis, Ellis, Guy Burgess,
Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all
had fingers of suspicion pointed at
them.
Diversions and deflections were
needed urgently. Hollis had charted the
way to the External Affairs department
in Canberra.
None other than William Skardon,
who for British intelligence handled the
cases of jailed nuclear scientists Dr
Allan Nunn May and Dr Klaus Fuchs
and was before long interrogating
Philby, inconclusively, walked on to the
stage. The Hollis list of names was
handed over to Skardon, distracting at-
tention from the MIS-ers he was trying
to nail.
I landed at London in mid-1950 after
attending the World Peace Congress in
Sweden that issued the Stockholm Ap-
peal against nuclear warfare and doing
a spfeaking tour in France, Norway,
Sweden and Denmark. Once my over-
searched baggage was repacked at the
airport and accommodation found, a
small Australian left-wing community
in London made urgent contact.
Skardon had walked into Australia
House and into the External Affairs
office of Jim Hill, formerly of the Can-
berra department staff. (He was on the
Hollis list and was called before the
Petrov commission). Skardon looked
the part: clipped military moustache,
black coat, striped pants, homburg hat,
rolled umbrella.

readiness to please great and
powerful friends, there was no
point in asking what right a
British security policeman
had to invade Australian dip-
lomatic territory to intimidate
an Australian civil servant
without warrant or permit.
Skardon charged that
secret documents had been
leaking from External Affairs
in Canberra to the Soviet em-
bassy. Hill, Skardon alleged,
was implicated. So, allegedly,
were another former External
Affairs officer named Dr lan
Milner, a New Zealand-born
academic, and Walter Seddon
Clayton (also New Zealand-
born), a Communist Party
functionary to whom Petrov
later awarded the code name
of “Klod” or “Claude.”
If Hill came clean and
“confessed,” as had Nunn
May and Fuchs, Skardon
would see that things went
easier for him.
Hill, a minor External
Affairs official never within
coo-ee of an atomic or mili-
tary secret, was anything but
flattered by this promotion
into the big league. He flatly denied the
Skardon charges.
Incensed, Hill got in touch with me.
He said that Skardon, for further intimi-
dation, had announced that he soon
would be flying to Australia to supervise
the arrests of Milner and Clayton and
the suggestion was that Hill would like-
wise feel the hand on his shoulder. I
promptly flew back to Australia to warn
communist leaders of what MIS was
threatening.
Why was MIS so desperately anxious
for an Australian diversion that it was
prepared to breach protocol by inter-
vention- in an Australian domestic
affair?
None of Skardon’s foreshadowed ar-
rests took place but the names of Hill,
Milner and Clayton were all on the
Hollis list and in Petrov’s cash-and-
carry documents handed to deputy
ASIO chief George Ronald Richards.
No action could be sustained.
Though Petrov did not reach Can-
berra till 1951 and he did not barter
documents for £5OOO until 1954, names
he allegedly brought from the Soviet
embassy safe in Canberra had been
marked down for attention well in ad-
vance.
From where or whom did Hollis get
the names in 1948 that were to turn up
six years later in the briefcase Petrov
handed to ASIO?
Ashes scattered to the winds do not
give up secrets. Hollis died in London
on October 26, 1973. His death was not
Vladimir Petrov, attending the royal commission
revealed till October 31. Documents,
cassettes and other vital material disap-
peared from the Hollis dwelling in those
crucial four days.
In a London interview not long be-
fore his death, Hollis with the tra-
ditional British addiction to understate-
ment confirmed that there had been
“exchanges” between MIS and the Aus-
tralian government on the Petrov oper-
ation. He refused to comment on Bur-
ton’s statement that the names he sup-
plied in 1948 were practically identical
with names which Petrov swore he had
taken from the embassy safe.
IN THE shadowy world of intelligence,
the strangest alliances and transactions
are possible.
On November 7, 1967, I stood in
front of a chirrupy English diplomat to
watch the anniversary parade from the
stand next to the Lenin mausoleum in
Moscow. He assumed that I was just an-
other foreign correspondent, in-
troduced himself as “scientific counsel-
lor” and rambled wittily on.
Remembering that George Blake was
missing from a British cell where he had
been enclosed for handing over secrets,
I ventured the question: “You haven’t
seen George Blake in the audience, have
you?”
“Be patient, old chap. Be patient,” he
advised.
Sure enough, Blake turned up in
Moscow.
How would Blake travel from prison
to Moscow, through all those
checkpoints, without a gentle-
man’s agreement between
people hardly passing muster
as gentlemen? How would
Hollis acquire a list of Austra-
lian names, presumably from
a Soviet source, to dump on
the desks of a surprised Aus-
tralian prime minister and Ex-
ternal Affairs minister?
Soviet agencies in Austra-
lia were always subject to sus-
picion, surveillance and a cer-
tain isolation. Friends were
sought in political, cultural
and business fields. Newly-
arrived ambassadors, consuls,
cultural and commercial at-
taches would want to know
the names of Australian citi-
zens supporting improved re-
lations with the Soviet Union.
In sheepskins-for-Russia
days, these included judges
(one judge was forced to ap-
pear before the Petrov com-
mission), generals, ministers,
lawyers, doctors, clergymen,
writers, artists, journalists,
civil servants, scientists, ex-
porters, importers and trade
unionists. Names would have
been sent to Moscow and the man de-
coding the despatches was, for much of
the time, Vladimir Petrov. Royal com-
mission evidence showed that he knew
the code names of the Australians on
the Hollis-Petrov list.
Stockholm, where Petrov operated in
wartime, was seething with intelligence
agencies of both sides. The British were
well represented in neutral Sweden.
Petrov’s refusal after his defection to
mention the names of certain key MIS
operatives whose identity would have
been well known to him raised ques-
tions that have been shirked.
FOR PETROV, the decision about
whether the future would offer him
more pelf and power or disgrace and
worse depended on what happened to
his chief, Beria. Beria was confident of
realising the ambitions Svetlana Stalin
saw reflected in his deportment at her
father’s deathbed.
Stalin died in March 1953. Con-
spiracy was rampant. Over the phones
they knew Beria bugged, Stalin’s lieu-
tenants conferred and agreed that the
leadership problem must be settled once
and for all. Yes, yes ... they were unani-
mous that the logical heir was Tovarish
Lavrenti Pavlovich.
Beria went to the fateful Kremlin
meeting believing that he would be
voted authority and power to surpass
that of Ivan the Terrible. But, instead of
nominating him, Krushchev denounced
Beria for mass murder, torture, slavery,

weakening of the Soviet state by frame-
up and execution of the best leaders.
Beria clutched for his holster. Malenkov
pressed the alarm button under the
table. The elite Kremlin guard, fore-
warned, rushed in to disarm Beria.
One of history’s most evil men was
executed on the spot.
Beria’s infamous deputy, Abakumov,
and other MVD chiefs were also shot
without formalities. Many Beria men
abroad got recall notices and defectors
soon were thick upon the ground.
If Petrov had accepted the opportu-
nity to answer questions in Moscow, he
might have had some busy sessions at
the security services’ Lubianka at
Dzerzhinsky Square. He had never been
one to diminish the extent of his knowl-
edge.
Conspiracy and “confession” were
the trade of his species, giving rise to
bitter jokes of this kind in the Beria
camps:
A Beria interrogator charges a
Soviet composer that his musical
score is in reality a devilish code
for conveying secrets to the West-
ern imperialists. “Useless to
deny,” the Beria man warns:
“Your friend Tchaikovsky has
confessed.”
WITH STALIN’s waxed corpse lying
uneasily beside Lenin’s and Beria’s
ashes blown on the cold wind, it was
downhill all the way for the Third Sec-
retary in Canberra. Former Tass corre-
spondent in Australia, Ivan Pakhomov,
was tramping around the departments
trying to pre-empt the defection even
before Beria’s remains awaited “arrest.”
“I knocked on every door,” he told
me in 1966. “Recall Petrov before it is
too late!”
The mills of Soviet bureaucracy
grind slowly. Petrov himself was near to
vindicating Balzac’s theory that bu-
reaucracy is a gigantic mechanism
operated by pygmies.
Report after report had been cy-
phered to Moscow about Petrov’s con-
duct. Complaints were delivered to
Soviet diplomats and to Tass men about
drunkeness, selling of diplomatic whis-
ky and somewhat non-Marxist proposi-
tions to Australian female communists.
PETROV would not have engaged in
merry parties and rutting expeditions if
he had had any intention of obeying the
May 1953 recall-to-Moscow notice. He
had no desire to risk the fate of his
criminal boss.
The royal commission was never
very outgoing about Petrov’s services to
Beria or his tally of victims in the per-
mafrost.
Mr W.J.V. Windeyer, QC, assisting
the commissioners, asked: “You your-
self felt a loyalty to Beria?” Petrov:

“Yes, I felt that.” “Undoubtedly,” said
Windeyer, “Mr Petrov not only felt in-
security but apprehension, because he
was a Beria man.”
While Petrov could not return to
Moscow, he also could not live in Aus-
tralia without political and financial
support. The cryptographer of No 6
Section in Moscow would decode
names in return for food, shelter, cloth-
ing and a liquor cupboard. But not the
names of nervous British intelligence
agents. James Jesus Angleton, former
CIA counter-intelligence chief, claimed
that the Petrovs “had access to (Soviet)
leaders and a knowledge of what was
going on in other countries. They knew
the identities, they knew the names of
hundreds of Soviet intelligence officers
who had been deployed elsewhere in the
world.”
The Hollis-Skardon-Petrov names
from the safe in Canberra did not war-
rant a £5OOO price tag, plus extras.
Through various initiatives of Petrov
after he had discussed arrangements for
defection the names of Rose-Marie
Ollier, French diplomat and Resistance
heroine, of Rupert Lockwood, and
through the J. 35 “ring-in” to Document
J Evatt’s secretaries and various
others were added. Names of conserva-
tive politicians, of anti-Evatt Labor men
and of Lady Jessie Street, fighter for
peace and women’s rights and often in
association with Soviet representatives
to further the cause of Australia-USSR
friendship, trade and cultural ex-
changes, were suppressed to avoid em-
barrassment to establishment interests.
Such suppressions and selectivity
were as nothing compared with
Petrov’s. He speedily and publicly
named Burgess and Maclean as Soviet
agents.
This exposure would cause no flut-
ters in the offices of Hollis, Ellis, Philby
or Blunt. As the whole world knew, Bur-
gess and Maclean had been in Moscow
for three years.
The former cryptographer knew all
about Burgess and Maclean but had
never heard of Hollis, Ellis, Philby and
Blunt.
Angleton claimed that Hollis had
been compromised and recruited back
in the 1930 s while working for the Brit-
ish American Tobacco Company in
Shanghai.
Angleton also charged that Hollis
“made determined efforts” to minimise
the significance of the Petrov defection.
About Ellis, the man who impressed
Casey, British officialdom now has no
doubts.
Philby, ace of them all, soldiered on
from the mid-1930s to 1963 before be-
coming Moscow’s only paid-up sub-
scriber to Private Eye.
Blunt’s activities dated back to 1935.
His immunity from publicity was ended
by journalists in 1979 when he was royal
art adviser.
To denounce Burgess and Maclean
clamorously, without even a whisper of
the names of Philby and Blunt as
Petrov did in 1954 placed him on
about the same level as an Australian
historian of bushranging chronicling a
detailed knowledge of Steve Hart and
Joe Byrne but remaining in complete ig-
norance of the appearance at the
Glenrowan Hotel of Ned and Dan
Kelly.
It is impossible to dismiss the prob-
ability of Petrov contacts with key fig-
ures in British intelligence before he
reached Canberra and was chosen im-
mediately from the large force of Soviet
diplomats in the country as the one to
be studied by ASIO.
The road to Moscow ended at the
Lubianka for Petrov: he could not re-
turn. And, though they still enjoyed
powerful protection, darker clouds of
uncertainty hung over the far more cru-
cial personalities at MIS since the Bur-
gess-Maclean one-way journey.
Petrov was the obvious candidate
and the Australians could be persuaded
that they and not MIS had
masterminded his defection. The
flaming publicity would take the heat off
MIS survivors and the Australian gov-
ernment would be responsive to the
need for a rabbit from the hat before a
difficult general election.
The architects of the show-biz open-

by Act 111. Press gallerymen at the High
Court in Darlinghurst where the inquiry
took place were soon calling their job
“the salt mines of journalism” as it
dragged on with nothing to fire a gun at.
IN MOSCOW, I occasionally had
drinks with Maclean. He was the tall,

to criticise negative aspects of Soviet so-

THE ARTS
In memory of the
genius of Henry Lawson
He was an alcoholic and an eccentric but Henry Lawson could write. Better than
anyone else, he captured the spirit of Australia. And a new collection of his works,
as CLEMENT SEMMLER reports, is a fitting tribute to his brilliance.
PATRICIA ROLFE wrote in The Jour-
nalistic Javelin (her splendid history of
The Bulletin ): “If there is one thing of
which you can be sure, it is that at this
moment some expatriate Australians,
perhaps in a bar on the Costa del Sol to
bemused Spaniards, at a South
Kensington party to bored Brits, in a
Hong Kong restaurant to baffled
Chinese, someone, somewhere, is re-
citing The Man From Snowy River, and
word perfect.
“If this leads to a bit of talk among
the nostalgic, it will go on to Henry
Lawson. They’ll mention the The
Drover’s Wife, The Union Buries Its
Dead or The Loaded Dog. Someone will
say that one day he’ll read the whole of
Lawson; but he never will.”
Well, that someone will never have a
better chance than now. For the enter-
prising Lansdowne Press has just issued
a magnificent two volumes of Lawson’s
complete works.* That they come hot
on the heels of Lansdowne’s successful
venture with the writings of Banjo
Paterson perhaps confirms that Pater-
son and Lawson are linked inevitably in
the ordinary reader’s appreciation of
Australian literature.
This beautifully designed and illus-
trated presentation there are nearly
2000 pages, 200 black and white illustra-
tions and 50 color plates is as fine a
piece of book production as you would
come across in a month of Sundays and
for good measure it was produced,
typeset and printed in Australia.
Leonard Cronin, the editor, believes
this collection can be regarded as defini-
tive since it includes not only works
buried away in old newspapers and
magazines, never before re-printed, but
also all previously unpublished manu-
script material from the Mitchell Li-
brary in Sydney and the Lothian Collec-
tion of Melbourne’s La Trobe Library.
Brian Kiernan, the Sydney academ-
ic, author and Lawson scholar who was
Peter Lawson, left, and Brian Kiernan with the Henry Lawson volumes
responsible for much of the research
involved, is enthusiastic about this new
material. He told me it throws even
more light on Lawson’s astonishing ver-
satility and it is a rich bonus for lovers
of Lawson.
There is, for example, Lawson’s only
play Pinter’s Son Jim which he
wrote in 1879 for his friend Bland Holt,
a famous actor-producer of the day.
Lawson, despite his deafness, enjoyed
the theatre and especially melodrama.
Here he tried his hand at it in four acts.
It was an unperformable disaster,
since Lawson had no knowledge of plot
construction and dramatic technique;
one critic described its story as “wan-
dering from setting to setting like a
drunken Aboriginal on walkabout.” But
Lawson, fortunately, kept the manu-
script and used its themes and charac-
ters for sketches and verse notably his
memorable story The Hero of Redclay
and the poem Ruth.
Among the new material is The Edi-
tor of The Comet, Lawson’s only excur-
sion into what we call science-fiction.
The world having been “butted by the
head of a comet instead of being merely
brushed by the tail of one,” out of the
consequent wreckage appear Lawson
and friends such as E. J. Brady, Rod
Quinn, Victor Daley, Norman Lindsay
and a few others. They set about pub-
lishing a journal on the lines of the de-
funct Bunyip.
It is, of course, a delightful skit on
the early Bulletin, its editor J. F.
Archibald and publisher George
Robertson (who is discovered camping
in St Mary’s Cathedral). Lawson de-
livers broadsides against his pet aver-
sions such as literary critics, women’s
liberationists and the Sydney Law
Courts.
As Kiernan stresses in the first of his
two introductions, Lawson never forgot
that The Bulletin and Archibald
launched him on his writing career and,
although he was soon being published
in other papers, he went on contributing
to The Bulletin for the rest of his life.
His first published poem, A Song of
the Republic, appeared in The Bulletin in
'Henry Lawson: Complete Works: Vol 1, A Campfire Yarn
(1885-1900): Vol 2. A Fantasy Of Man. Compiled and
edited by Leonard Cronin, introduction by Brian Kiernan.
Lansdowne, $59.95.


Lawson as seen by David Low in the Worker of September 13,1922
October 1887. The trembling author, as
he wrote, “a skinny city workboy in
patched pants and blucher boots,” had
read the good news in the Answers to
Correspondents column some time be-
fore: “HAL will publish your Sons of
the South (as Lawson had titled it). You
have in you good grit.”
But an early Bulletin sub-editor, Fred
Broomfield, maintained that Lawson’s
first contribution was a poem, The
Wreck Of The Derry Castle, which
Archibald had consigned to the waste-
paper basket. Broomfield fished out the
messy copy and convinced Archibald
there was something in it. It was the
work of a boy of 17, argued Broomfield,
“who would yet be heard of in the
world.” So it was published in the 1887
Christmas edition,
Lawson and Archibald, if at times
sparring partners, became life-long
friends. It was Archibald who, inadver-
tently perhaps, brought about the
flowering of Lawson’s genius as a writer
of short stories through which he was
to communicate most effectively his
vision of the world,
It was toward the end of 1892.
Lawson, Brady and one or two others
were hanging round The Bulletin office,
Archibald asked Brady what was the
matter with Lawson. “He’s all right,” re-
plied Brady. “He’s not all right,” said
Archibald. “He’s coming here in the
morning with tobacco juice running
down his jaw, smelling of stale beer and
he’s beginning to write about the Rocks.
The next thing, he’ll be known as the
poet of the Rocks!”
Brady suggested that Lawson would
be better off if he could go back to the
bush. So Archibald sent Brady to dig
out of the First And Last pub at
Circular Quay and gave him £5 and a
rail ticket to Bourke where Lawson
went on the wallaby through the back
country up to the Queensland border.
He was back in Sydney in 1893 but from
these months in the bush came some of
his best writing: In a Dry Season,
Hungerford, The Union Buries Its Dead
(the most Lawsonian of all Lawson’s
stories, I think), Rats and the early
Mitchell stories where Lawson put on a
mask and bared his id on drink, women,
marriage and all that life seemed to be
about.
To read these stories again is to
understand how the harsh realities of
the bush appalled him and yet, par-
adoxically, honed his sensibility and
his talent. Almost miraculously there
emerged, as Kiernan puts it so
felicitously, the characteristic Lawson
style, “The spare, dramatic yet nonchal-
ant manner, by which narration, charac-
ter and action are stripped to the barest
minimum to suggest more than is told,
with enigmatic details left to reverberate
...” a style strikingly modern even to
readers today. It is why critics all over
the world have not hesitated to equate
Lawson with Chekhov, Maupassant,
Katharine Mansfield and Frank
O’Connor.
And, when one reads and savors
these stories again, one appreciates that
it all goes back to Archibald and The
Bulletin. As did Lawson. At the end of
Vol 2 is his warm tribute, Three Or Four
Archibalds And The Writer , which
Lawson wrote in 1919 on Archibald’s
death and left in manuscript.
There’s a nostalgic account of a pub
crawl with Archibald down Port Hack-
ing way and of a splendid fish supper
that Archibald cooked at his home
there. Lawson recalls all the advice
Archibald gave him and writes his mov-
ing tribute: “J. F. Archibald was the
friend and the father of Australian Lit-
erature and of Australian Art, for their
own sakes and for the sake of the Land
he was born in ...”
Nor can one leave Lawson’s connec-
tion with The Bulletin without mention-
ing that glorious pageant of Bulletin il-
lustrators who march across the pages
and plates of these volumes treasures
in themselves.
There are reproductions of drawings
by Norman and Lionel Lindsay
(Lawson always preferred Lionel as an
illustrator; the author grumbled once
that Norman did not know enough about
the bush), Percy Leason, Frank Mahony


and others. And especially there are
those marvellous caricatures of Lawson
which have passed into sketching his-
tory by David Low (perhaps the most
famous of all; with Henry stringy, un-
kempt, with larrikinish flat hat and pipe
askew), by Such, Hal Gye and others.
There is Lionel Lindsay’s portrait and
the well-known one by Longstaff which
Archibald, just before his death, com-
missioned for his old friend.
Lawson has attracted increasing at-
tention recently from critics adopting
Freudian tactics in their interpretations
not only of Lawson’s writings but also
of his family background and his per-
sonal behaviour his alcoholism, his
social eccentricities, his bouts of near-
madness and suicidal despair. (On one
occasion he threw himself
over a cliff at Manly but re-
covered with only a broken
ankle.)
I talked about this with
Peter Lawson, Henry’s great-
nephew and one of our most
talented artists of the Outback
(he lives on Queensland’s
Magnetic Island). Peter is in
Sydney to help promote the
new collection. He has illus-
trated previous editions of
Lawson’s poems and stories
and in the leather-bound
deluxe edition of the present
volumes he has a magnificent
painting of The Splitters, one
of Lawson’s best ballads.
Peter Lawson can remem-
ber many family discussions
about “the old man.” He has
no doubt that some of Henry’s
emotional and psychological
problems stemmed from his
domineering mother, Louisa.
Peter agrees that she was responsible for
much of Henry’s neurotic behaviour,
possibly even his alcoholism. Since
Louisa wrote much that was melodram-
atic and over-sentimental, some of these
writing traits were reflected in Henry’s
earlier work. And, since Louisa was a
renowned political activist, Henry’s
early enthusiasm for republicanism
(shown particularly in his verse) and for
socialism stemmed from his mother’s
beliefs.
But Peter rejects psychoanalytical
approaches to Henry and his work such
as those demonstrated by a recent book
by French professor Xavier Pons with
its hints of an unhappy childhood, a
troubled marriage, of castration com-
plexes and homosexual tendencies.
Henry may have been a bit screwed
up but not to that extent, his great-
nephew said. He points to the fact that
in Henry’s 55 years some of which,
toward the end of his life, were wasted
because of alcoholism and chronic de-
pression he produced more than 750
poems and 340 prose pieces, the one
million words of these volumes. There
could not have been too much wrong
with someone capable of that.
But Lawson was guilty of indifferent
writing, especially in his verse. By his
own admission, he wrote some of it
scratching for a few quid. And Robert-
son wrote to Lawson in 1917: “I think
you are the greatest poet Australia has
produced. But much inferior men have
surpassed you in sales and, consequent-
ly, in public estimation because your
unfortunate circumstances and habits
have caused you to publish much stuff
quite unworthy of you.”
Yet there remains a core of ballads
and poems that will endure in our litera-
ture: The Lights Of Cobb And Co, Jack
By Lionel Lindsay: used for the Lawson stamp
Dunn Of Nevertire, The Sliprails And
The Spur, Faces In The Street and the
unfailing, artless charm and appeal of
Andy’s Gone With Cattle.
Nevertheless, the chief delight of
Lawson is his prose as many happy
hours of browsing through these vol-
umes will confirm. It is the robust
humor of The Loaded Dog and Bill The
Ventriloquial Rooster as well as the stoic
philosophy implicit in Send Round The
Hat, The Union Buries Its Dead, The
Bush Undertaker and Water Them Ger-
aniums, written in a style “as rough and
bare as slabs of adzed hardwood” (as
literary historian H. M. Green put it),
that bring home to us vividly the hard-
ships of bush life.
And then there are the warm conver-
sational delights of the Dave and Andy
stories, the Mitchell stories and those of
Joe Wilson and his mates. We can be in
no doubt that we are reading the work
of a genius, untutored as he may have
been. Nothing has been written in Aus-
tralia to equal the best of them. □
MUSIC
Why they’re
crying at
the wedding
By BRIAN HOAD
THIS OUGHT to be a rapturous review
of a magical evening at the theatre; a
paean of praise for art which (in the el-
egant form of the Australian Opera’s
current production of Mozart’s Mar-
riage Of Figaro ) gives wings to the im-
agination, warms the cockles of the
heart and transforms sour confusions
into sweet harmony. Unfortunately,
more mundane matters have intervened
and Mozart has been muddled up with
money and the Mucky Duck Bush
Band.
The Mucky Ducks have just been
handed $2OOO by the Music Board of
the Australia Council to help stage their
new musical, Theban Trilogy, at the
Hole-in-the-Wall Theatre in Perth. The
Australian Opera has just been handed
$4 million and is considering shutting
up shop.
It is the shape of things to come in
the on-going democratic socialisation of
the arts according to the dictates of bu-
reaucratic ideologues in pursuit of the
lowest common denominator.
The Music Board is the first of the
council’s eight boards to share out its
portion of this year’s arts budget. It was
a logical start. In handling grants to the
Australian Opera, the board is dealing
with the biggest and most controversial
area of the performing arts scene. It is
the epitome of lavish waste and elitist
taste to all good democratic socialists
who don’t know a doh from a soh,
Mozart from Salieri or art from amuse-
ment. They, at least, will rejoice.
Interestingly, the Music Board is not
so happy. The chairman, Professor
David Tunley, points out that they were
forced into “a situation of compromise
unsatisfactory to all.” This mood of
pathos has been a recurring theme since
the board first started the softening-up
process last March with a discussion
paper entitled “The problem of the allo-
cation of Music Board funds between
competing uses.”
Although this weird document was a
maze of hedged bets in a swamp of
doublespeak, it did keep reiterating
plaintively that it was opposed to any
reduction in status and funding of the
“national company.” Such opposition
clearly caved in.


The Australian Opera’s grant of $4
million may sound like a great deal but,
if it is one of the busiest opera compan-
ies in the world in terms of the number
of different operas and the number of
performances given each year, it is also
one of the most poorly subsidised. As a
result, its budgeting is extremely tight
and inflexible. It originally asked for
$4,535 million. As the arguments and
cheese-paring continued, the company
explained how it might just be able to
scrape through on $4,285 million. But it
was not prepared, under any circum-
stances, to run the risk of
adding to its accumulated
deficit of $450,000.
The board is, of course,
only too clearly a reluctant
servant of its political masters.
Government policy was ex-
plained most trenchantly in
these columns last May by
Minister for Home Affairs
and Environment (and Arts)
Barry Cohen: . . greater
access to the arts for the
majority of Australians and
increased participation in
cultural activities. Factory
workers have as much right to
enjoy the arts as Mr Hoad’s
arty-farty mates.”
What does he mean? Mem-
bers of the council have been
trying to interpret such oracu-
lar statements under the tutel-
age of Timothy Pascoe, out-
going chairman of the council
and outspoken critic of opera.
It is within this context that
the federal government has
been slowly honoring its elec-
tion promise, slowly restoring
the spending power of the
Australia Council to the level
of 1975-76 (prior to the
hatchet-wielding hiatus of the
Fraser years). There is still quite a way
to go but the latest allocation of $43.58
million for 1984-85 is a considerable im-
provement on $34 million for 1982-83.
And yet, although more money is
available, there are many more mouths
to feed according to the ideology of
democratic socialism. For example, a
new Design Board has been set up with-
in the council to improve national dress
sense, shake a fist at monstrous architec-
ture and encourage better decor in fac-
tory canteens. A modest $470,000 has
been provided for this herculean task in
1984-85.
The bureaucrats are having a par-
ticularly lovely time with administrative
costs surging ahead in leaps and
bounds, from $4,852 million in 1982-83
to $6.88 million in 1984-85.
And, to explain why the bureaucrats
are having such a lovely time, a further
$2.12 million has been allotted this year
to such “general programs” as “arts in-
formation” and “policy and research.”
One outcome is that, although the
council’s total income has grown by
some 28 percent since 1982-83, that of
the Music Board has grown by 22 per-
cent. The council has at the same time
ordered its boards to diversify their
funds into new and mellifluous-sound-
ing areas such as “art and working life.”
As far as the Music Board is con-
cerned, factory workers may rejoice that
a new boost has been given to folk and
jazz and rock ’n’ roll. They may even be
Glenys Fowles and John Pringle in The Marriage of Figaro
interested in a desperate effort to revive
a dying choral tradition. Three new
community music centres have been es-
tablished, taking the total to 11 and re-
quiring only another 189 before demo-
cratic socialisation is complete.
On the other hand, there may be
some alarm that the board is slipping
back into elitism with a new outpouring
of funds to Australian composers. And
it has been setting up instrumental
ensembles which, no doubt, want to
waste their time sawing away at boring
old Bach and Beethoven or worse still
worry the workers’ ears with new out-
pourings of the soul from Butterley and
Brumby and Benfall and Brophy.
The $10.53 million just handed out
by the Music Board in some 242 separ-
ate allotments may look healthy but that
is a false impression. The board’s
overview of the state of the nation’s mu-
sical fabric published last March found
it full of holes. It asked for far more
money than it got to improve the situa-
tion. What it offers now is a patch-and-
darn solution. The board remains as it
described itself last March “twisting
slowly in the wind.”
Its melancholia is understandable.
For the sake of a little window-dressing
at grassroots level it has endangered the
existence of its only major artistic suc-
cess story, the Australian Opera. The
board goes on vaguely hoping that the
company’s financial whizkids will work
another miracle and somehow make up
the difference between the $4
million offered and the absol-
ute minimum required. At the
same time, it has made the sit-
uation even more intractable
by informing the company
that it can expect no further
increase in subsidy for at least
three years.
The board last March
stated its conviction that
“Australia must have at least
one full-time, year-round op-
era company if opera in this
country is to achieve high
standards.” Now it suggests
that the company “abandon
year-round programming.”
A part-time opera com-
pany would be a disintegrat-
ing opera company and the
board of directors is adamant
that it has no intention of pre-
siding over such a situation.
As company general manager
Patrick Veitch puts it: “The
board will not allow the com-
pany to die from slow
strangulation.”
At the time of writing, the
board of directors is sched-
uled to come to its final de-
cision at a meeting on Sep-
tember 25. It would then al-
low time for the bureaucrats to consider
that decision before making a public an-
nouncement. And then?
It has taken 27 years for the Austra-
lian Opera to grow from a ragbag of
dreams into a tightly run business with
annual turnover of $l9 million. As
Veitch points out, it is a public company
subject to the Companies Code. If the
directors cannot see their way clear to
paying off the debt eventually (let alone
incurring more), they must respond to
the rules of the game: “The usual action
to preclude additional debts being in-
curred is a reorganisation under a
scheme of arrangement with creditors
or a liquidation of assets.”
Arty-farties had better see that Mar-
riage Of Figaro while they still have the
chance. Such magical displays of art are
rare at the best of times. The best of
times have passed. The future belongs to
Mucky Ducks. □


OPERA
States share
the triumph
of Caesar
Lauris Elms (Caesar) and Beverley Bergen (Cleopatra) in Julius Caesar
By JOHN CARGHER
THE FIRST completely successful ex-
ecution of what, one hopes, will be a
regular sharing of opera productions
between Australian companies has been
the staging of Handel’s Julius Caesar
first by the State Opera of South Austra-
lia and now by the Victoria State Opera.
Major companies in Europe and
America have done this for years. What
began as borrowings of existing produc-
tions turned into pre-planned joint pro-
ductions, mostly in the field of more
esoteric works which cannot be revived
every other year. What has been the
norm at the Metropolitan, La Scala and
Covent Garden should have been the
norm here long ago. Julius Caesar’s suc-
cess should ensure that the belated
dawn turns into a permanently sunny
day.
An opera by Handel was an apt
choice for this experiment, for his ex-
periences parallel in many ways the
problems troubling state companies.
The London public in the 18th cen-
tury demanded more than just good mu-
sic. Of primary concern were star
singers who engaged in something
closely resembling public competitions
in vocal acrobatics regardless of the
notes the composer gave them to sing.
Competing theatres were forced to add
ever-larger and more elaborate produc-
tions, ballets became almost mandatory
and costs soared.
George Frederick Handel was his
own impresario and went broke. His
popularity was unquestioned but his
creditors wanted to be paid. Yet his op-
eras were really no better than his ora-
torios which were much cheaper to
stage and when his Messiah started the
cash flowing without all the expense of
scenery, costumes and star singers, he
simply stopped writing operas. The Vic-
toria State Opera (VSO) has already
taken to following in Handel’s foot-
steps, giving operas in concert form;
this year it is Berlioz’ The Trojans.
The problem with Handel operas is
the same one which prompted him to
switch to oratorios: you can enjoy the
music without the scenery, for action
there is none. The singing provides the
drama and that Handel’s most import-
ant singers were castrati male so-
pranos who had been emasculated to
keep their unbroken voices puts a
damper on authentic reproductions of
his operas today.
The VSO-State Opera of South Aus-
tralia production of Julius Caesar, apart
from using the same decor, same pro-
ducer and all but one of the same princi-
pals, goes as close to what would have
been seen in Handel’s time as any pro-
duction in 1984 could. Its only failing, a
weakness of the producer, is a positive
asset. Handel had no producers at all:
The public sat around while singers
casually walked onto the stage, cleared
their throats and allowed the action to
proceed when they were good and
ready.
No modern audience would stand
for this and designer-director. Tom
Lingwood has done his best to make
sense of Handel’s very reduced episode
from the life of the most famous Roman
of them all. The settings and costumes
(18th century, as they would have been
in Handel’s day) are beautiful, ap-
propriate and work to perfection;
Cleopatra’s baroque spectacle to seduce
Caesar is a memory worth treasuring.
Lingwood always has been a great
designer. Strangely, he does his best as
producer to hide his own beautiful cos-
tumes and costly supernumeraries in
stygian darkness. Then, in his quest for
authenticity, he has his singers do their
25 or so arias in tableau as Han-
del would have done and leaves the
original English libretto intact even
when, as in the death of Ptolemy, it
rouses gales of laughter and a round of
applause (which surely was not the in-
tention of Mr Handel).
The VSO staging fortunately features
a cast of singers as good as the decor,
not the production. Lauris Elms as
usual cannot be faulted, though her
Caesar’s impact is lessened by
Lingwood’s obsession to put her in dark
corners. This focuses attention on
Beverley Bergen’s Cleopatra who floats
a glorious voice superbly, copes easily
with the elaborate ornamentations and
is an ornament herself in every way;
Elizabeth Taylor’s Cleopatra was flat-
chested compared with Bergen.
The third female cast member, Claire
Primrose, easily holds her own in such
exalted company. Finding three such in-
dividual and varied voices borders on
genius, especially when the libretto
helps not at all to define the characters.
The men are less successful always
remembering that Caesar is sung by a
woman. Graeme Wall, the only change
from the Adelaide cast, has the right
kind of tenor to contrast with the vil-
lainous basses. Of the latter, only David
Brennan’s Achillas can be said to be
first-class. Rex Taylor-Craig’s Ptolemy
looked and acted like Genghis Khan.
The Rantos Collegium produced ad-
mirably Handelian sounds from the
pit, under the uniquitous direction
of Richard Divall. Blessedly, Divall
and his Adelaide counterpart Denis
Vaughan edited their Caesar to an ac-
ceptable length and did not insist on
every written repeat. Thank God! □

Two varying
views of
the past
Examining the post-war migrant experience: Gosia Dobrowolska (second from left) in Silver City
By SANDRA HALL
WHEN Donald Horne first coined the
phrase The Lucky Country for Australia
he gave it a sardonic ring, descriptive of
a nation where the belief in everyone’s
right to a good time was shadowed by a
“lingering puritanism ... a triumphant
mediocrity and the sheer dullness of life
for many of its ordinary people.”
This is an observation for which Aus-
tralian cinema has not had much time
until now, but Sophia Turkiewicz’s Sil-
ver City (nominated in 11 categories of
next month’s Australian Film Institute
awards) makes up for that. Essentially a
story of the post-war migrant experi-
ence, it also takes a look at the dutiful
and deadening Australian heartiness
which dismisses complications and
shrugs off old wounds as if all suffering
and strife were the result of wholly
avoidable accidents.
In Silver City, the 100,000 th dis-
placed person to set foot on Australian
soil is rewarded with a toy koala while a
man caught sobbing over a photograph
of his slaughtered family is told
to pull himself together and remember
that the war is over. With breathtaking
tactlessness, German is used as the offi-
cial language in the migrant hostels and
with a joyless and blustering condescen-
sion the newcomers are reminded con-
tinually of their good fortune in having
fetched up in a sensible country where
nothing much happens.
No wonder, then, that the sophisti-
cated among them resort to a little con-
descension of their own. Australia, they
say, is a country where peasants do
well: “Americans choose brains; Aus-
tralians choose muscles.”
Nina, the Polish girl at the centre of
Turkiewicz’s story (Thomas Keneally
collaborated with her on the script), is
young enough to want to disprove some
of this but her desire to become Austra-
lian is complicated by her love affair
with another Pole, Julian, embittered
both by the war and the complacency of
his new country.
Julian has an ambition to be a lawyer
but lacks the application.
He also has a wife, Anna, who ac-
cepts his discontentment as the price
paid for his survival. Theirs is a mar-
riage forged in shared experiences of
danger and deprivation. It is made clear
to the audience from the beginning that
Julian is not going to abandon it com-
pletely for Nina, any more than he’s go-
Robert Redford, Richard Farnsworth (centre) and Wilford Brimley in The Natural


ing to abandon all feeling for Poland.
He is lost somewhere between the two
countries while Nina is determined to
accept the new.
The film is at its clumsiest in making
this point. Gosia Dobrowolska and Ivar
Kants turn out to be convincing and at-
tractive lovers. He has the kind of vi-
brant intelligence which makes you
wonder why he is not used more often
as a leading man and hers is a vivacious
and responsive performance. But things
begin inauspiciously with a touch of
Hollywood kitsch when the two meet
again by accident after 12 years and on
a train go through an excruciatingly
awkward few minutes of conversation
designed to set up the flashback to the
main part of the story.
The film’s recovery is in doubt for a
while afterward but a richly detailed
evocation of camp life follows, catching
precisely the mixture of elation and
frustration which must have charac-
terised the mood of the migrants. They
were free yet not free, haunted by eerie
echoes of old horrors in these Nissen
hut hostels with their curfews, their
overseers and their separate dormitories
for husbands and wives.
Steve Bisley, cast against type as
Julian’s friend Viktor, makes nicely sar-
donic jokes about these uncomfortable
ironies and Anna Jemison puts life and
intelligence into the rather glumly-writ-
ten role of Anna.
They are all likeable characters, in a
likeable film. It is never more than like-
able because, as those first few disas-
trous minutes in the train signify, it is
not really going anywhere. It is a film of
vignettes acutely and intelligently
observed but without much power.
AS IT SAYS in the sales pitch, Robert
Redford’s new film, The Natural, gives
us yet another hero from an innocent
age on the assumption that these are
such tough, tricky and ambiguous times
that we have to be cheered up constant-
ly with inspirational enactments of
good’s triumph over evil.
So the Redford character, Roy
Hobbs, is not merely an American
baseballer making a name for himself in
the major league during the not-really-
so innocent 19305; he is a man on a
quest, assisted by a mighty baseball bat
carved from the trunk of a tree he once
saw split by lightning and impeded by a
near-fatal weakness for dangerous
women. For this is a particularly male
moral fable, in which all the women are
either angels or witches seemingly
suffering severe cases of penis envy.
Directed by Barry Levinson in a
breathlessly mythic style, with misty
cinematography by Caleb Deschanel
and plenty of slow motion, the story is
based on a novel by Bernard Malamud
but his bleak ending has been replaced
by a much more comforting conclusion
in which Hobbs wins the game and re-
turns home happily quest completed
to live with the good woman he
should have married in the first place.
There are three women in all
Barbara Hershey, as a mysteriously
deranged rich girl who gets her thrills by
seducing and then shooting famous ath-
letes; Kim Basinger as the team man-
ager’s niece, similarly but less spectacu-
larly attracted to winners; and Roy’s
true love, Iris, loyal, forgiving and much
too dreary for the talents of Glenn
Close who has been given the unreward-
ing job of having to play her.
There is also a father figure: Pop
Fisher, the team manager (Wilford
Brimley), who has to be convinced of
Roy’s worth before letting him out on to
the field to prove himself before the
crowd. Pop’s mortal enemy, the Judge
(Robert Prosky, with help from the
shade of Sidney Greenstreet), is sche-
ming corruptly to take the team away
from him.
Robert Duvall enjoys himself on the
sidelines as a weaselly sports reporter
with a taste for blackmail and scandal;
Joe Don Baker is seen briefly making an
impact as The Whammer, Goliath to
Hobbs’ David in an early contest of
skill; and Redford is the perfect epic
hero a golden boy with a slight coat-
ing of bitterness and a look of hard-won
authority.
All in all, it is a rich, old-fashioned
brew whipped up by experts for all
those willing to be intoxicated. And
there’s no hangover not even an after-
taste just an instant charge instantly
forgotten. □

What, you may ask, has a Chameleon got to do with
Toyota Tercel?
Quite a lot actually.
You see, the Chameleon is an amazingly versatile reptile
that has the remarkable ability to adapt to its environment.
So does the Tercel.
It's smart enough to be seen at some of the best places,
and tough enough to handle some of the worst roads.
With nifty front-wheel-drive that easily
changes to all-wheel-drive,while still moving.
All combined with Toyota Suspension Tuning.
Tercel has style and comfort, and is rugged and reliable.
With a surprising amount of passenger and luggage room.
To prove how versatile it is, Tercel has won praise from
around the world. From desert to snow.

BOOKS
From fiction
to faction
to traction
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Bliss, by Jill Tweedie. Heinemann,
$17.95.
Here Today, by Zoe Fairbairns.
Methuen, $19.95.
THESE two novels are examples of
something becoming increasingly no-
ticeable in publishing both in Australia
and overseas the tract disguised as
fiction.
Jill Tweedie’s tract is about an aristo-
cratic English beauty who tries to
change the course of history at least
improve the role of women in a small,
United States-supported South Ameri-
can country with a vicious totalitarian
regime. Zoe Fairbairns’ tract is about a
young wife who in an extramarital en-
counter contracts herpes simplex, which
alienates her husband and reduces her
to such a condition of nervous disarray
that she cannot apply herself to her
usual work as an office “temp.”
You could hardly find two subjects
more suitable for tracts for the (modern)
times than these two, especially with the
addition of a strong feminist tone.
Tweedie’s heroine, Lady Clare La
Fontaine may be seen as downmarket
Mitford or perhaps derived more cor-
rectly from the gossip column of a
newspaper. Beautiful, cold, broke,
bored and promiscuous, she marries
Raul whose family has ruled Ventura
for generations. The Queen Mother and
Prince Charles attend the wedding.
Raul gives Clare handfuls of emer-
aids but, on their honeymoon, is an-
noyed to find that she is not a virgin.
Why she did not deny his charge with
an acceptable lie is not explained, per-
haps for reasons of plot.
In spite of his disappointment, he in-
stalls her in a palace and all might have
gone well except that she becomes even
more bored with life in nightclubs with
drunken viscounts and so develops an
interest in the enslaved condition of the
local village women subsequently in-
troducing them to handicrafts and the
manufacture of herbal medicines.
In case anyone should think that this
novel is an elaborate joke, Tweedie
dedicates it to the World Wildlife Fund
“for its work in preserving the diversity
of things on our planet” and acknowl-
edges the help of the International
Union for Conservation of Nature at
Kew which must be where she re-
searched her jungles.
By a curious coincidence, the title on
the dustjacket is designed in a strikingly
similar way to that on Peter Carey’s
novel of the same name which was pub-
lished years earlier.
FAIRBAIRNS gives the impression
that she assembles her books rather than
writes them.
Stand We At Last was interesting as
a study in generations of women of one
family attempting to make lives apart
from those of the men or being forced
by circumstance to do so. The
characterisation was lively and she had
some good stuff on the perils of being a
suffragette. Here Today presents
Antonia who does not want a steady
job. She enjoys being a temp one
week to learn the job, one week to get
on top of it, one week to become bored
and ready to move on. A night’s casual
love affair changes that.
Her husband rejects - rather nicely,
as it happens a sick wife; she will lose
the flat if she can’t keep up the mortgage
payments; she shows unreliability and
her agency turns cool. In her vulnerable
state, she becomes involved in industrial
action and the search for a “temp”
named Samantha who has disappeared
while working for a resort company.
But Antonia is an unsympathetic fig-
ure; one feels that her husband might
If you are one of the legions who seem not to know the lyrics of Advance Australia Fair, perhaps the All-Time Favourite Australian Song

brand of Sydney beer, the book offers illustrations by Patrick Cook. Here is Cook’s illustration for Click Go The Shears.


have left her even without herpes.
Fairbairns has depicted her as not bad,
not good, just boring, which does not
help make a case for less exploitation of
temps any more than it makes a novel
that you cannot put down. In fact, each
of these novels is fairly easy to put
down. Yet both women come recom-
mended as magazine writers, columnists
and feminists. Better luck next time,
perhaps. □

IN A beautiful poem, “At The Coast,”
from her new collection, The Three
Fates, Rosemary Dobson watches the
stripped gum trees down the hill to the
water and “the daughters of professors”
emerging through them. She can hardly
tell one from the other. “They glow and
flicker in and out of shadow/Like po-
etry behind the print on pages.”
Looking through a widely varied sel-
ection of new volumes of verse, one
hopes for exactly that: the glow and
flicker, the “poetry behind the print.”
There has to be that mysterious move-
ment; just because verse is printed
differently from prose, it doesn’t auto-
matically become poetry.
“.. . all the long water is a dove-grey
rippled sand.” (Gray). “The night as
filled with rain as a plank with splin-
ters.” (Gray). “A red telephone, ringing,
as if boiling over ..(Hart). “That sul-
len, mesmeric reserve of heaviest rain
..(Fitzpatrick). “I look at the stars
tensing into position,/the muffled
moon. . .” (Ryan). “The land, cattle
country,/still, parched,/peeling off in
parts like old plaster.” (Haskell). (In In-
dia) “It is enough to be here, alive, with
the tides of people.” (Viidikas).
But it is hard on some poets to be
looking all the time for the glow and
flicker and not for the intensifying il-
lumination of narrative, lower-keyed
but no less revealing. Julian Croft and
Conal Fitzpatrick are, in miniature or at
more length, primarily narrative poets
telling harsh or celebratory stories.
Fitzpatrick’s “Imagining Illawarra” and
Croft’s “Drunk On A Mast” (both first
published in The Bulletin Literary Sup-
plement) have an abounding vitality to
sustain the long haul of narrative that
not many poets attempt nowadays. It is
good that regions as well as places are
moving into Australian poetry Wol-
longong in Fitzpatrick’s case, Newcastle
in Croft’s. Fitzpatrick’s extraordinary
“Imagining Illawarra” both bardic
and satirical takes in Aboriginal
ghosts, the landscape, Italian workers,
the sea and the stars, not to forget “Pig-
Iron Bob.”
Vicki Viidikas is out of Australia al-
together, firmly settled in India as far
A bed is a bed is a bed.

as firmness or being settled is possible
among those “tides of people.” By no
means all of her works are prose poems
as the publisher’s blurb says but, how-
ever printed on the page, all her work is
characterised by sharp and often indig-
nant reactions that neglect neither the
beauty nor the waste of India. The
Germaine Greer of today, sometimes
sentimentalising over Indian women
such as “Jaisalmere (Rajasthan)” which
ends: “slavery is enough, if you tend
your brain between your legs.”
The two other women among these
nine poets could not be more different.
Some of Rosemary Dobson’s finest
work is in The Three Fates, notably
“The Continuance Of Poetry Twelve
Poems for David Campbell” (also first
published in The Bulletin). She shares
with Robert Gray (and, of course,
Chinese poets) an extraordinarily good
eye for the movement of detail that is
about to become the stillness of poetry.
There is also a generous but not docile
sharing of people, poems, paintings,
and, above all, time.
Gig Ryan’s stance is simultaneously
aggressive and turnaway disillusioned.
Reading her poems is like being locked
in a room and hearing the sound of
angry voices; maybe more like being
locked in a filing-cabinet. There are no
landscapes. She knows why: “The new
morality asks you to shutup.” Bad times
for poets. And for lovers, particularly
those such as a man whose “junkie
girlfriend has no heart,/just an operat-
ing table, well-lit, clinical.”
Kevin Hart and Dennis Haskell and
Julian Croft, bring us a different sort of
sadness, more elegaic, the music still
heard. “Remorse is a kind of quiet con-
tradiction,/A personal conviction,
built/On the sadness of others.”
(Haskell). “Her tongue in your
mouth,/her hand just where it should
be—/but her mind with him.” (Hart).
Andrew Lansdown’s poetry is at best
a precise observation of things and crea-
tures, flowers and rain. He does not let
his Chinese and Japanese masters
down, delicacy does not degenerate into
whimsy. His qualities are apparent in
“Hawk”:
Hunched in an overcoat of feathers
a hawk on a high wire,
like a snapshot of a shrug
As easily as he wields the wind in
his wings
and clamps small creatures in his claws,
he sheds the world from his shoulders.
As well as shedding real light, poetry
has a ghostly presence, a habit of haunt-
ing. I find the most revenants among
Gray’s poems but throughout all these
volumes are poems that will stay with
you. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Not all black and white
by Patricia Rolfe
THERE IS no public issue on which
more people hold firm views based on
pure ignorance than that of land rights
for Aborigines. What is needed is to
know more about the people and how
such laws will work for or against
them.
Sydney barrister Marc Gumbert, who
is also an anthropologist, has written
Neither Justice Nor Reason: A Legal and
Anthropological Analysis of Aboriginal
Land Rights. It will be launched by
University of Queensland Press at
Bennelong Point, site of the Sydney Op-
era House, on October 3.
Gumbert was born in Paris in 1942
and came here in 1949. He has main-
tained links with France and Neither
Justice Nor Reason won him a doctorate
from the Sorbonne a year ago. Most of
the work for the thesis was done in Aus-
tralian universities and the result was
judged by a jury of Australian and
French lawyers and anthropologists.
The central idea of his book is that
the Aborigines did not live as members
of closed, patrilineally related groups or
“hordes,” which British anthropology
made the established model. Instead,
because of climate, varying access to
food and other reasons, they belonged
to a larger and much more flexible as-
semblage, members of which were re-
lated in varying ways.
Marc Gumbert: a new theory of Aboriginal structures
NEWS LIMITED
Gumbert outlines how previous land
rights claims disadvantaged many
Aborigines because of rigid and wrong
findings on who had the right to benefit.
Neither Justice Nor Reason is no blis-
tering attack on current land legislation
but it does offer a very different theory
of Aboriginal structures as a basis for
that legislation. Its value should be that
it will make it impossible for white Aus-
tralia to make a near-enough-good-
enough gesture toward Aborigines and
then regard debts as paid and the sub-
ject closed.
MOST WRITERS believe that they are
getting 10 percent of damn all but, ac-
cording to Book Publishers’ Association
figures, authors’ earnings are rising
faster than are publishers’ receipts. Over
the past four years, total royalties and
fees to authors rose 62.8 percent com-
pared with an increase in publishers’ re-
ceipts of 51 percent and a consumer
price index rise of 34.1 percent.
THE CHARMS of inner-city living
against far-flung suburbs, discovered in
the 1960 s by the middle classes, pre-
served many Victorian terraces and
their cast-iron decoration more
effectively than any National Trust
classification could have.
The pioneer rediscoverer of Austra-
lia’s cast-iron work was Mel-
bourne neurologist Dr E.
Graeme Robertson. His
Victorian Heritage was pub-
lished in 1960. He and his
daughter Joan, who worked
with him on his books and
photography, were inclined to
think that a turning point
came in 1954 when a
Victorian house in Armadale
was refurbished and the cast
iron was not removed.
Robertson’s last book,
Cast Iron Decoration: A World
Survey , was published by
Thames and Hudson in 1975
at the time of his death.
Currey O’Neil Ross next
month will publish Decorative
Cast Iron in Australia , all
Robertson’s Australian re-
search gathered in one vol-
ume for the first time. The
book has been prepared by
Joan Robertson. There are
many new photographs, par-
ticularly of Perth and Bris-
bane. □

NEIGHBORHOOD
Hawke behind Ansett in
Pacific ‘war’ with Qantas
An Air Pacific 737: the future is not nearly as bright as its livery
Ansett Airlines for years has dreamed of extending its wings, as an
overseas carrier. Soon, as ROBERT KEITH-REID and STUART INDER
report, a big step towards fulfilling that dream may be achieved.
ANSETT Airlines and Qantas are wres-
tling for the sickly frame of Air Pacific,
the Fiji government-controlled airline
which they see as having a healthy fu-
ture in the right hands.
Joint managing director Sir Peter
Abeles was in Suva last week to try to
persuade the Fiji Prime Minister, Ratu
Sir Kamisese Mara, to allow Ansett to
manage Air Pacific’s affairs — some-
thing at which the Australian domestic
carrier has been working for years.
As soon as Abeles’ team had left
town, however, a Qantas team headed
by chief executive Keith Hamilton flew
in hoping to put a spoke in Ansett’s
plans.
But Abeles had arrived highly rec-
ommended by Australian Prime Minis-
ter Bob Hawke who a fortnight earlier
had mentioned Ansett’s interest in Air
Pacific to Mara at the South Pacific For-
um both leaders were attending at
Funafuti, Tuvalu.
Hawke told Mara, one of his ad-
mirers, that Abeles and Ansett could get
Air Pacific out of its deep trouble.
Hawke also made an official visit to
Suva, during which he had talks with
cabinet members on matters including
Australian aid.
Ansett undoubtedly is more than
Ratu Mara: overtures from Australia
STUART INDER
anxious to give Air Pacific its own aid
and thereby draw it into an expanding
Pacific network.
Ansett is already operating between
Australia, Vanuatu and Western Samoa
in the colors of Air Vanuatu and the
Apia-based Polynesian Airlines. It has
made offers to service the Cook Islands
and previously has sought a substantial
share in Air Pacific which is 93 percent
owned by the Fiji government.
Minor shareholdings are held by the
governments of Tonga, Nauru, Western
Samoa, Solomon Islands and Kiribati
and Air New Zealand.
Ansett regards Air Pacific as the key
to the development of trans-Pacific ser-
vices and the “right” arrangements
would also be important to Ansett to
help it better utilise its aircraft and its
maintenance section.
The Fiji government holds bilateral
rights for the United States, Canada,
Tokyo and Singapore and for Brisbane,
Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and one
other destination in New Zealand.
It has a service to Hawaii, opened
last December with a leased DC-10,
which it hoped to extend to Los Angeles
to tap the American market for Fiji’s
expanding tourist industry.
But the airline has accumulated


losses of more than S2B million, an
enormous figure for a country that runs
on a total annual budget of S3BO mil-
lion. Air Pacific’s position has become
even worse in recent weeks, with the
government-appointed directors trying
to avoid financial collapse.
To stay airborne, the line has had to
sell planes it needs desperately and sus-
pend or abandon some routes. The
Hawaii route is not performing as well
as had been expected and looks like
being withdrawn in the next few
months.
But the crisis came as Mara was
headed for Tuvalu. The Fiji directors of
Air Pacific resigned, saying they wanted
to make way for new directors who
could commit themselves fully to a five-
year rescue-and-recovery plan devised
with the help of Air New Zealand. The
only surviving board member was the
one appointed by Tonga.
Mara returned, took over direct re-
sponsibility for Air Pacific affairs from
Jonati Mavoa, Fiji’s minister for For-
eign Affairs, Tourism and Civil Avi-
ation. This was no reflection on Mavoa
but an indication of the seriousness of
the situation.
Mara seemed to be the personality
best capable of dealing with three air-
line unions who had been told the
national carrier’s plight was so parlous
that 150 of its 580 employees would
have to accept “voluntary retirement.”
The unions rejected the offer.
A new board was appointed under
the chairmanship of J. S. Thomson,
chairman of Fiji’s Economic Develop-
ment Board. He wasted no time in send-
ing missions to ask Qantas and Ansett
what could be done to help. Thomson
has a reputation for fixing things.
Mara saw Abeles after he and his
team had completed two days of inten-
sive discussions with Air Pacific’s new
board of management. The team inclu-
ded Sydney business consultant Jill
Hickson, a former Qantas executive
who has been adviser to Ansett on Pa-
cific Islands business for the past four
months. Hickson, better known as Jill
Wran, wife of NSW Premier Neville
Wran, has been involved closely with
Ansett’s interest in Air Pacific.
Even more closely involved has been
one-time Qantas chairman Sir Lenox
Hewitt who has been seen in Suva regu-
larly, hoping to entice the government
to take Ansett as an Air Pacific share-
holder or manager or to accept some
other arrangement that would give
Ansett the strategic position it wants.
The answer has always been “No.”
Just before returning to Sydney last
week, Abeles told The Bulletin that the
Fiji goverpment had been given “a var-
iety of options” which meant “more
support and no ownership on our part.”
Ansett was ready to supply any equip-
ment needed, such as a Boeing 767, he
said.
If the government reaction was
favorable, “we will react very fast and
Air Pacific can be turned around im-
mediately.”
Asked whether the US and Asian bi-
lateral rights were the main draw for
Ansett, Abeles said: “Definitely not,
definitely not.” But he agreed that it
would be a pity for Air Pacific to scrap
the Hawaii service, since “Fiji is the key
island nation in trade terms.”
Qantas is understood to be prepared
to outbid Ansett to prevent it spreading
its wings even further than Vanuatu and
Western Samoa. But Qantas also has
been very happy with the present seat-
sharing arrangements that Air Pacific
has on the Qantas services to Fiji and
does not want to see an end to this.
It has offered to extend the seat-
sharing arrangements to Qantas services
to the US, which would mean an end to
Qantas over-flying Fiji on all of its
trans-Pacific services as now happens. It
has offered Air Pacific an immediate
deal to enable it to continue its services
to Hawaii and also extend to Canada.
Qantas is also offering to ultilise Air
Pacific cabin crews and strengthen man-
agement with Qantas people whose
salaries would be subsidised.
A Fiji cabinet decision in response to
these overtures (likely also to include an
offer from Air NZ) is expected quickly.
The Air Pacific board is reported to
favor the Qantas offer but Mara seems
to favor Ansett, which puts Abeles in a
handy position. □
Sir Frank Holmes: a summit call for reform
JOHN FAIRFAX & SONS
NEW ZEALAND
Hard decisions
now face
Mr Popularity
By IAN TEMPLETON
IN SPITE of devaluation, resurgent in-
flation, soaring interest rates, the abol-
ition of subsidies for farmers and tax
incentives for exporters, the popularity
of New Zealand’s Labor Prime Minister
David Lange has climbed to new
heights. His approval rating is above 70
percent and the jovial giant is attracting
the accolade of “statesman” after the
marathon economic summit which
spread a new wave of euphoria through
the business community.
But now the hard decisions are
looming. If the summit could agree that
poverty had reached unacceptable
levels and aid had to be channelled im-
mediately to the poor and unemployed,
the government must find the resources
to fulfil that priority. It has little scope
to extract more revenue from income
tax.
The 6 percent surchage on income
tax which takes the top rate of 66 cents
in the dollar above $38,000 a year yields
only an annual $3l million. The tax
base clearly must be widened, as the
summit agreed, and government
spokesmen have wasted little time in
suggesting where they will be looking
for additional revenue.
One of the first targets
could be to claw back some of
the $2.5 billion paid out in na-
tional superannuation which
is by far the most expensive
item in New Zealand’s costly
welfare state.
Although the Labor Party
committed itself in the recent
election campaign to retain-
ing national superannuation,
it could trim the bill by as
much as $l6O million by in-
creasing the tax on payments
to people who have significant
alternative sources of income.
National superannuation
at the rate of $6500 a year is
paid to all those older than 60,
without any means test. The
cost of the scheme has more
than doubled in the past five
years and the rate of increase
could be even faster with a 33
percent growth projected in
the number of people over 60
by the end of the century.
Economists have been ar-
guing for years that the
scheme is far too generous


and a former chairman of the New
Zealand Planning Council, Sir Frank
Holmes, addressing the summit, was in-
terrupted by applause when he called
for reform of the benefit. If the country
were in a state of crisis, he said, the
superannuation had to be reviewed.
“Something should be done now.”
Critics note that a married couple on
national superannuation receive $lO a
week more than a couple unable to
support themselves because of perman-
ent incapacity and receiving invalids’
benefit.
New Zealanders long have taken
pride in their social welfare system but
now find it shot through with in-
consistencies.
Dr Claudia Scott, from the Econ-
omics department of Wellington’s Vic-
toria University, pointed out to the sum-
mit a conflict between concepts of
equity within the various income
maintenance schemes. The accident
compensation scheme, for example, is
based on the principles of social in-
surance and its benefits are earnings-
related. Sickness and unemployment
beneficiaries receive income support on
the basis of need, assessed in relation to
family circumstances. The family ben-
efit and national superannuation are
based on the concept of rights and are
universal, regardless of need or level of
contribution. Some benefits are linked
to wage levels and others are adjusted to
reflect changes in consumer prices, so
relativities among benefits change in an
unpredictable way.
Scott says that achieving some con-
sensus on tax shares and expenditure
benefits is critical to gaining economic
recovery.
Introduction of a supertax on na-
tional super may require other action to
inject consistency into the social welfare
system and the government is pledged
to establishing a royal commission to
study how that might be accomplished.
The government’s hints of a supertax
predictably have drawn cries of outrage
from the national Opposition whose
leader, Sir Robert Muldoon, introduced
the present scheme in 1976.
A gross $1 billion a year would have
been saved from the superannuation bill
had the country stayed with the old age
benefit and superannuation scheme in
place before 1976. Some authorities be-
lieve that the seeds of economic malaise
were sown in such grandiose welfare
schemes, the benefits of which were set
at levels not financed easily. In some
circumstances, even the unemployed
can draw more in benefits from the state
than lower-paid workers receive in
after-tax income.
The attention being given to national
superannuation may have raised a fu-
rore but the Under-secretary for
Finance, Trevor De Cleene, has not
been slow to push other ideas for new
taxes into the arena of public debate. He
has talked of a tax on assets and of a
retail sales tax. Some of the tax ideas he
has put forward are remarkably similar
to those advocated by present Finance
minister Roger Douglas two years ago
when he constructed a major platform
of tax reform which was not adopted as
party policy.
As De Cleene put it: “We are looking
to change the system so that we do not
have to rely on income tax, because the
bottom people under $24,000 just can-
not pay any more and need relief. We
have got to get it elsewhere.”
De Cleene says that the government
is not receiving much tax from those
who normally would fit into the high-
income bracket. “We are not getting it
from business people on the whole or
the people of real wealth because they
have so ordered their affairs so they do
not receive high incomes.” He added
that he favored the American idea of a
wealth tax for these people. Under that
concept, tax is paid on the annual in-
crease in the worth of assets owned.
“The important thing is, I believe,
there has not been a time in New Zea-
land for many years when the public has
been so willing to accept structural
change. New Zealanders want certainty
and simplicity in the tax system,” De
Cleene says.
With the budget delayed from
October 18 to November 8, Douglas has
some elbow room for the decisions on
tax reform which his colleagues appear
to be urging on him. □
Tuna fishing: the “war” has reached a truce
ROWAN FOTHERINGHAM
SOUTH PACIFIC
Pacific fishing
war defused by
talks with US
By ROBERT KEITH-REID
MOVES to defuse the likelihood of a
tuna fishing “war” between the United
States and Pacific islands mini-states
have got off to a good start in Suva, Fiji.
At a preliminary meeting, 12 Pacific
countries and a US State department
delegation decided that there was quite
an easy way out of the embarrassments
being caused by incidents such as the
seizure in July of big American trawler
Jeanette Diana which the Solomons
said had been poaching inside its 200-
mile offshore economic zone.
The solution perceived is a multilat-
eral treaty between the US and members
of the Forum Fisheries Agency which
has its headquarters in the Solomons
and of which Australia and New Zea-
land are members.
The Americans say that such a treaty
would over-ride controversial US dom-
estic legislation passed years ago, under
pressure by the nation’s tuna fishing
lobby, which obliges the State depart-
ment to slap import bans and other
forms of retaliation on any country im-
pounding the ships of US fishermen
who ignore local fishing and conserva-
tion laws.
Such retaliation is what
America has done to the Sol-
omon Islands which have
been unable to sell the con-
fiscated Jeanette Diana (a re-
serve price of $3.5 million was
put on it) because the US
made clear that anyone who
bought it would be in trouble,
too.
But the State department
has long been irritated by the
ramifications of the US retali-
atory policy.
As more and more US
fishermen moved into the rich
western Pacific tuna areas be-
cause of a decline of catches
in traditional eastern Pacific
grounds, the department
knew that a “Jeanette Diana
incident” would happen one
day. It also knew that US pol-
icy in refusing to recognise
claims by Pacific islands to
ownership of tuna swimming
inside their 200-mile zones
was prejudicing attempts to
win friends in the region as a
counter to possible Soviet ex-
pansion. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Englishman’s new home is his
Australian financial castle
On a visit to Australia, stock market prodigy Garnet Harrison saw it as a land of
opportunity. So, as DA VID HASELHURST reports, he came back to settle and
prove himself correct by building an empire from a modest new beginning.
TWO-and-a-half years ago, a young
Englishman set up a one-man office plus
secretary in Sydney to take charge of an
$BOO,OOO company. Today, he presides
over more than $3OO million in
managed funds and his main company
carries a market capitalisation of $4l
million.
Garnet Harrison, 33, has come a long
way fast since taking the reins of
Keywest Prospecting Ltd in April 1982
and transforming it into a successful in-
vestment and financial services com-
pany.
Quite a few stories have appeared
about the companies in his group
illustrated in the accompanying dia-
gram but not much about the man at
the top.
The Bulletin went to get the answers
in his mid-city eyrie, the 61st floor of
Sydney’s MLC Tower, where his com-
pact suite of offices shares a tiny slice of
the floor with National Westminster and
Santos Ltd. Head office staff has bal-
looned to five executives and two
secretaries and total group staff from
Harrison and his secretary to 68 at June
30 ahead of the purchase of a 50 per-
cent interest in Associated National Life
Insurance Co Ltd which operates in all
states.
Harrison’s compact office has a map
of Australia hanging behind his desk, a
framed, colored photograph of Queen
Elizabeth II on the wall at his right and
from his left he looks out over the
southern suburbs and Botany Bay.
“The rent is cheaper on this side,” he
explains, for the Santos rooms have the
main harbor views.
Harrison’s father was a local govern-
ment officer with the water department
of the Greater Manchester Council.
Harrison attended Stand Grammar
“The same school as Clive of India,” he
points out then went south to study
business finance at the City of London
Polytechnic.
Early in 1970, aged 18, he wrote to 10
stockbroking firms seeking a place in a
research department. He got a job in the
firm of Charlton Seal Dimmock and Co
where now-retired senior partner James
Diggle soon took Harrison under a
wing and gave him particular encour-
agement.
Under stock exchange rules, the
minimum service to be completed with
a firm before membership could be con-
sidered was three years and in that time
a series of examinations had to be com-
pleted: interpretation of company re-
ports and accounts, stock exchange
practice, taxation and techniques of in-
vestment.
Young Harrison bowled the first sub-
ject in his first year, the rest in his sec-
ond, turned 21 in September 1972 and
became a member of the Stock Ex-
change of London in January 1973. A
year later, he was a partner in the firm.
He made his first visit to Australia in
November 1981 in the company of John
Molyneux, who was a director of The
English Association Group PLC a 100-
year-old banking house and funds man-
ager which retains a 10 percent interest
in Keywest.
“In two weeks, I decided I had to live
here,” said Harrison. “Just look out the
window,” he said, sweeping an arm
across the view to the distant Blue
Mountains. “It’s a very exciting country
and what an attractive place to bring up
children.” (Harrison and his wife have
three children, one born in Australia,


Keywest’s Garnet Harrison (left) and director Doug Brown: worked on expansion
DAVID WALLACE
and they live in the north-western gar-
den suburb of Pennant Hills.)
“Apart from that, in a global sense,
the Pacific Basin will be the most dy-
namic growth area of the world for the
next 100 years.”
He recalled having been impressed
in the mid-70s by an Economist survey
which labelled the period from 1776-
1876 as the British century, the next as
the North American century and 1976-
2076 as the century of the Pacific Basin
and United States West Coast.
“Australia because of its legal sys-
tern, language and political stability
has the scope to become a major finan-
cial centre in the Pacific Basin,” he be-
li eves>
Having made his decision, he ap-
plied to migrate, resigned his broking
partnership and began searching for a
corporate vehicle to transform into an
investment house selling financial ser-
vices to the resources industry. He
settled on Keywest Exploration Ltd, an
unsuccessful nickel explorer floated in
1970 and tottering on the mining boards
with an uncertain future. The com-
pany’s 8.5 million 10c shares had sold as
low as 8c in early 1982 and its net cash
assets were down to about $360,000.
Harrison approached Keywest chair-
man Peter Gibb with his ideas.
“Gibb was very responsive,” said
Harrison, “and he is still on the board of
Keywest which we knew because my
former firm had taken a share place-
ment from them in London.”
Harrison acquired 125,000 Key west
shares and was appointed a director and
chief executive in August 1982. At the
next general meeting, a month later,
shareholders approved granting him a
free issue of one million options to ac-
quire shares at 15c each between July
1985 and June 1987. The shares now
trade at 70c.
Two subsidiaries Keywest Finance
and Keyfin Pty Ltd were set up to offer
a range of corporate financial services
including debt funding, leasing and
money market operations. The parent
company’s name was changed to
Keywest Investments Ltd and transferred
to the industrial board.
“I spent the next eight months trying
to come to grips with opportunities and
largely eliminated the resources sector
as a primary area for Keywest,” said
Harrison, who had moved into the chair
in the fading days of the resources
boom.
A large rights issue in November
1982 raised $1.4 million, followed by a
cash placement to raise $500,000 in May
1983. By August, he was ready to move
on his first major acquisitions.
He had persuaded Doug Brown, for-
mer treasurer of Hooker Corporation, to
join Keywest, of which he has become a
director. They set their sights on Mur-
rumbidgee Holdings Ltd, an unlisted
public company and cash-rich
Riverina milk processor based
in Wagga Wagga. It had been
founded as a co-op in 1922,
converted to a public com-
pany 20 years ago and now
had 200 shareholders who
were mostly retired. The
shares had been trading spas-
modically through the com-
pany secretary at $1.50 each,
valuing Murrumbidgee Hold-
ings at about $BOO,OOO. Yet it
had some $2.5 million in ac-
cumulated cash.
In the two years ahead of
Keywest’s takeover bid, Mur-
rumbidgee’s performance had
been:
Net profit Dividend
payout
1981 $837,000 $44,000
1982 $509,000 $66,000
Keywest had to lift its orig-
inal bid of $4.50 a share to a
cash and shares offer worth
$9.50 after a rival bid came in
from a Victorian co-op. But
the dairy group was wrapped
up by the end of the year.
Keywest had a regular cash
flow from the milk operations
and much more interesting
growth prospects through
Murrumbidgee’s 60 percent
ownership of Tatura Cheese Industries
Ltd which makes cream cheese. Seventy
percent of its product is exported to
Japan where Tatura holds between a
quarter and a third of the cream cheese
market, sold through three trading
houses under the brand names Wattle
(Mitsubushi), Dairylands (Toyomenka)
and Garden City (Toshoku). The rest is
sold under generic names in Australian
supermarkets.
Keywest more recently acquired
from Beatrice Foods of the US its Aus-
tralian Yomix Ltd subsidiary which
once dominated local yoghurt sales but
has slipped to hold only 8 percent of the
$4O million market behind the leader
Yoplait (from the Plumrose group),
Dairy Farmers’ Ski brand and Peters,
Considerable efficiencies are ex-
pected to emerge from a rationalisation
of the Yomix-Murrumbidgee businesses
and the group has acquired from Ohayo
Dairy Products Co Ltd of Japan the
technical licence to market a drinking
yoghurt under the brand name Brim.
Test marketing has been completed
in Sydney and a TV campaign will
launch the product in Melbourne, Bris-
bane and Sydney this week,
Within weeks of the August 1983 bid
being made for the dairy group, Har-
rison made a successful approach to
Clayton Robard Management Ltd to buy
a 75 percent equity for $3.75 million.
Clayton Robard was founded in


1981 by three senior defectors from De-
velopment Finance Corporation’s Austra-
lian Fixed Trusts group Ross Smyth-
Kirk, Bruce Bird and Dietmar Tucha.
They retain the other 25 percent and
management control.
At the time of the acquisition,
Clayton Robard had about $BO million
in funds under management. Today, it
has:
■ $ll5 million in equity trusts;
■ $65 million in property trusts;
■ An advisory contract over $lOO
million in investible funds for As-
sociated National Life Insurance Co
Ltd Key west’s recent 50:50 joint ven-
ture purchase with Koitaki Ltd, a listed
investment company controlled by
Michael Darling and his father, BHP
director L. G. Darling.
In the year to June 30, 1984, Key west
reported a net profit of $1,032 million
(previously $48,000) of which Clayton
Robard contributed $727,000 for a full
12 months and the Murrumbidgee dairy
group $296,000 for seven months’
trading.
The balance of earnings came from
financial services under the control of
the small head office team.
Apart from Harrison and Brown,
who are executive directors in Keywest,
the other three head office executives are
financial controller Arthur Napper (for-
merly assistant controller at Hooker
Corp) and money market underwriters
Peter Connolly and Bob Cassano, both
directors of Keywest Finance Ltd.
Keywest is shaping up to something
like what Harrison envisaged, with
three arms:
■ A steady cash flow from the dairy
business, with growth prospects from
the development of new milk-based
products.
■ Financial services with marketing
links to be developed between Clayton
Robard’s successful unit trusts and the
association with ANL Insurance.
■ A resources sector involvement to
be restricted to no more than 10 percent
of group funds through a reconstruction
and name change for Cliffminex.
Following its heady expansion,
Keywest has on issue 57 million shares
and 1.6 million options. At 70c, the
company is valued at $4l million. On
end-of-year capital (before the recent
one-for-four rights issue at 40c), the
company produced earnings equivalent
to 2.57 c a share. So it is selling at 27
times last year’s earnings.
An investment analysis from Ord
Minnett predicts the group will earn
$2.25 million after tax equal to 3.84 c a
share on present capital, putting the
shares at 70c on a P/E multiple of 18.
The market, then, is rating the com-
pany as a prime go-go stock and will be
expecting Harrison and his team to be
stayers for the next few years. □
CARS
Odd man out
planning to
hang in here
Volvo 760 saloon assembly in Sweden: on the line at Clayton in December
By ALAN KENNEDY
AUSTRALIA’S biggest importer of
European cars, Volvo, has re-stated its
commitment to assembling cars in this
country in spite of the federal Labor
government’s post-1984 plan which
makes Volvo odd man out. The senior
vice-president of Volvo worldwide, Lars
Malmros, and Jan Walldorf, who is
head of Volvo Australia, said that they
had no other choice.
Malmros said the company has de-
cided to pay a 100 percent duty on the
importation of completely knocked
down (CKD) cars assembled for Volvo
by Nissan at Clayton in Victoria.
The government car plan phases out
import quotas until only a 57.5 percent
duty is to apply to imported cars by
1992. The plan states specifically it aims
to discourage CKD operations.
However, Walldorf said: “We have
to do this. Demand for our cars is up
and there is no spare capacity in Volvo
anywhere in the world. If we wish to
meet demand in Australia, we will have
to assemble cars at Clayton.”
Walldorf said the bias against CKD
assembly puzzled him as the line at
Clayton employed about 200 people
using welding and paint skills which
would be lost if Volvo had to close it.
“The plan is very strong on manufac-
turers bringing state-of-the-art skills to
the local industry but it forgets about
the downstream benefits of a line like
Clayton,” he said.
He added that he believed the dis-
tinction between the badge engineering
(mix and match) going on among the
big five Australian manufacturers and
what Volvo was doing was very fine.
Clayton gave flexibility of operation
and the company intended to assemble
its 760 saloon on that line from
December. “We are determined to keep
the line open,” he said.
Walldorf remained optimistic about
the plan “I don’t think it is the ulti-
mate but it is better than previous
plans” and is extremely confident of
the future of cars such as Volvo and
BMW which are small-run manufac-
turers when compared with the likes of
GM-H, Ford and Nissan.
The plan calls for a reduction in the
number of Australian manufacturers
from five to three. This is beginning to
happen: Ford and Mazda are moving
closer together with their basically iden-
tical models Mazda 626 and Ford
Telstar, Mazda 323 and Ford’s Laser;
Nissan and GM-H are combining on
engines and GM-H has just released its
re-badged version of the Nissan Pulsar,
the Astra; Mitsubishi and Toyota are be-
lieved to be talking.
Volvo believes that people will react
against dull conformity as the big

WILDCAT
International magnates pay a visit
TWO international mining magnates in
Australia in September ... Harry Op-
penheimer, 75-year-old chairman of the
diamond giant De Beers Consolidated,
and Harry M. Conger who is chairman
and chief executive of Homestake
Mining Co of the United States.
Oppenheimer wound up his first tour
of Australia for eight years in Sydney
last week after having visited the Argyle
diamond mine in the Kimberleys.
Conger arrives this week to inspect
his company’s gold exploration and
production ventures, the principal one
being Homestake’s 48 percent interest
in the Kalgoorlie Mining Associates
partnership on Western Australia’s
Golden Mile. Homestake acquired its
equity in 1976 by injecting $8 million
into rationalising the mines in a part-
nership with WMC, Gold Mines of Kal-
goorlie and Poseidon Ltd. It has built up
a portfolio of gold exploration joint
ventures in Queensland, the Northern
Territory, WA and NSW and soon may
indicate its intentions on a possible float
of its Australian operations.
On Wall Street
THE middle-ranked Sydney broking
firm of Lamploughs has joined the big
firms in opening an office in New York
through an affiliation with Wall Street
firm Oppenheimer Inc, in whose offices
will be based Lamploughs’ former Lon-
don manager Peter Graves.
Oppenheimer, in turn, will install a
representative (Wayne Froud) in
Lamploughs’ Sydney office. Lamp-
loughs becomes the sixth Australian
broker to establish a presence in New
York since A. C. Goode and Co led the
way in 1980 to be followed by Potter
Partners, Ord Minnett, J. B. Were and
Son and Bain and Co.
Coincidentally, Keith Parry num-
ber two equities partner in Bain and Co
until he sold up in December 1980, to
leave the broking industry joined
Lamploughs last week as an adviser.
Inventive Aussies
WITH Australian inventions scoring
two of the year’s awards for the top 100
innovative industrial products first mar-
keted in the past year, Science and
Technology minister Barry Jones had
something to crow about.
The innovation awards of the US Re-
search and Development Magazine went
to Adelaide’s high-technology Mineral
Control Instrumentation Pty Ltd, for a
device which measures extremely accu-
rately the ash content of coal on a con-
“The threat of competition from foreign banks has really pepped up service!”
veyor belt, and to The Broken Hill Pro-
prietary Co Ltd, for the Big Australian’s
infra-red instruments that determine
properties of mineral and of other
samples.
MCl’s Coalscan is already up and
running at various Australian mines. It
uses a process developed by the CSIRO
and the University of Queensland and
licensed to MCI under the Siroash
label. The machines cost about $200,000
each.
The BHP machine, called Circom,
looks at the infra-red spectrum of a
sample material.
From this, computer analysis can de-
termine chemical composition or such
useful properties as the quality of an ore
such as bauxite or the energy content of
coal.
The eventual range of applications,
in almost every processing industry
from foods to chemicals, is virtually un-
limited.
Pleasant surprise
SHAREHOLDERS in Central Kalgoor-
lie Gold Mines NL had a pleasant sur-
prise at last week’s annual meeting in
Perth. They were shown one of two gold
bars which represented the first 2500 z of
production from the company’s leases
on the Golden Mile, between North
Kalgurli’s Fimiston leases and Kalgoor-
lie Mining Associates’ highly mech-
anised Mount Charlotte mine.
Drilling by Central Kalgoorlie in the
past two years has delineated more than
300,000 tonnes of proven ore from sur-
face and near-surface deposits and
mining has started on the Mount
Ferrums and Hidden Secret leases.
A plant the company bought has
been commissioned on its leases and,
though it has capacity of 100,000 tonnes
of ore a year, talks proceeding could see
that increased to 250,000.
Production from Central Kalgoor-
lie’s ore in the next three years will
finance on-going exploration not only
in Kalgoorlie but also on its newly-
acquired Kambalda West leases near a
gold discovery by Western Mining Cor-
poration.
Central Kalgoorlie has become one
of those little Aussie battlers striving to
move into the bigger league without be-
ing tempted by the lucrative offers from
other companies.
Kalgoorlie Mining Associates must
be keeping a quiet eye on Central Kal-
goorlie’s plans for deeper drilling in the
next few years, as limited deep drilling
of its Mount Gledden lease just south
of Associates’ $6O million Cassidy shaft
has indicated a geological environ-
ment conducive to Mount Charlotte-
styled mineralisation. □


THE CHARTIST
Seltrust - still a case for caution
by Russell Lauder
ON AUGUST 30 Seltrust Holdings di-
rectors announced a loss for the June
half year and expressed concern about
the financial position of the group and
the fact that the ultimate parent BP was
not prepared to stand fully behind
Seltrust.
Since then the shares have visited
their nadirs for the year and their lowest
level since 1982.
With the benefit of hindsight it is
easy to say that nobody in their right
senses would have been holding the
stock in August 1984 but what interpre-
tation could one have put on the charts
on Seltrust in recent months?
In asking the question I’m fully
aware that chartists are an argumenta-
tive lot and do not speak with a unified
voice (true also of that other school of
analysts, the fundamentalists). Never-
theless the following propositions ap-
pear to stand up:
• The 12-month Coppock indicator
on Seltrust based on 10 weightings be-
gan falling in October 1983, signalling
the end of the primary uptrend dating
from the middle of 1982 as illustrated by
the above Bridge Data chart. A turn up
from negative territory would be
required to confirm the commencement
of the next primary uptrend. To date
this has not happened, so buyers of the
stock since late last year have been
wrestling with a bear. The stars on this
chart represent the closing monthly
share prices.
• The monthly range chart plotted
back to 1980 puts flesh on the bones of
the three major trend channels which
have encompassed Seltrust’s share price
over this period. Note the unusually
high turnover since January 1984, which
tends to be uncharacteristic of Austra-
lian bear markets. It is never comforting
to see share prices consistently falling
on heavy volumes.
• The weekly bar chart covering the
past two years shows that for the past
four months Seltrust has been trading
below its 16-week moving average save
for three weeks at the height of the
sharemarket rally in August. This was
and is a sign of weakness.
It is difficult to see how one could
have wrung a bullish comment from
these charts in recent months and it
would seem likely therefore that the
buying has come from counter-cyclical
investors happy to buy in gloom or per-
haps traders looking for some gearing
should nickel prices start moving ahead.
The charts still spell out caution on
Seltrust. □

THE MODEST FARMER
From Shann to Stone
by Bert Kelly
WHEN I wrote last week’s column sug-
gesting that John Stone, like other
prophets of the past and present, prob-
ably would have to spend a lot of time
crying in the wilderness, I had not read
his Perth lecture. I have now and I feel
embarrassed that my comments were
too shallow.
When I heard that Stone had given
tongue as and when he did, I was sur-
prised that he could not wait to unbur-
den himself until he had retired from his
post as head of Treasury. However, now
I know that he had been asked to give
the Shann Memorial Lecture, I can
understand that the parallel between
what Professor Shann said in the late
20s and what Stone had weighing on his
mind in 1984 would make the tempta-
tion to jump the gun by two weeks im-
possible to resist.
I have worn a ministerial muzzle and
know the frustration of not being able
to say what cried out to be said, so I can
understand how Stone’s bureaucratic
muzzle must have irked him. I
encouraged him to lay it aside when he
gave the Stan Kelly Lecture in 1981 and
I am grateful for that.
But this time he was completely free
at last and the opportunity to compare
Shann’s experience with our present
prospect was an opportunity just too
good to be missed.
To me, Professor Shann has been a
shadowy figure with a reputation I did
not appreciate properly until now. My
father was appointed to the Tariff Board
in Melbourne in 1929, straight from the
farm and without any academic econ-
omic training. Being pitchforked into
this responsible position, with the De-
pression and unemployment growing
worse every week, was not pleasant. My
father looked for guidance from pro-
fessors Giblin and Copland who were
both Melbourne-based and from Shann
who was, unfortunately, far away in
Perth.
Because communications were not as
developed as they are now, the first two
loomed larger in my understanding
than did Shann.
However, since reading Stone’s lec-
ture, I understand what clarity of
thought and independence of mind
Shann showed. For instance, few people
realise how tariff protection was then re-
garded as a sacred cow.
Sir Keith Hancock, in his great book
Australia, wrote in 1930: “Protection in
Australia has been more than a policy, it
has been a faith and a dogma. Its critics,
during the second decade of the 20th
century, dwindled into a despised and
rejected sect suspected of nursing an
anti-national heresy. For protection is
interwoven with almost every strand of
Australia’s economic nationalism.”
Yet Shann could see and said
what harm our protection policies were
doing to us in 1928, something that most
people now realise.
It is frightening trudging with Stone
in Shann’s footsteps, watching us make
the same mistakes as Shann warned his
generation to avoid in 1929. The profli-
gate state and commonwealth expendi-
tures are the same now as then, also the
strangling web of red tape, the reliance
on tariff protection rather than market
forces to guide us as to what to produce
and, worst of all, the regulation of labor
markets.
Shann warned his people about them
all and Stone did well to remind us that
we are plodding down the same tragic
path.
Shann was strongly critical of the ar-
bitration system of his day and this is
still with us in an even worse form, with
this latest labor protection award the
last straw. The fight to alter our present
arbitration system radically will be the
big battle now that the intellecual one
about lowering trade barriers is just
about won.
Stone, too, is scathing in his condem-
nation of the power and incompetence
of arbitrators who try to regulate the
price for labor while ignoring the sup-
ply and demand for it. But his particular
hatred and that is not too strong a
word is for the high minimum wages
we fix for young people. But let him
speak for himself: “The truth is that our
system of wage determination today
constitutes a crime against society. It is,
starkly, a system of wage determination
under which trade union leaders and
people preening themselves as ‘Justices’
of various arbitration benches combine
to put young people in particular but
many others also out of work.”
I can understand now why Stone
spoke out as and when he did. If I had a
great timebomb like that ticking away in
my heart and head, I would grab any
opportunity I could to get it out of my
system.
However, I do not think a man who
can think and speak like Stone will have
to spend much time crying in the wilder-
ness. There is too great a hunger among
ordinary people to have the facts faced
fearlessly for that to happen. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A strike at the Cross
SHAREHOLDERS in Westralian Gold
Mines Ltd may be intrigued to learn that
their major asset is a Kings Cross night-
club and tourist hotel.
This investment was not envisaged
when the company floated 12 months
ago with a prospectus seekng $609,000
underwritten by Adelaide broker N. C.
Shierlaw and Associates.
The prospectus told us that the com-
pany had a string of gold prospects scat-
tered through Western Australia which
cost $70,000 to put together and which
the directors revalued to $BOO,OOO ahead
of the float. Directors and associates
then held 4.6 million shares ahead of the
public offering of 2.9 million 20c shares
and lc options.
The prospectus also told us that the
directors were Thomas George
Whitbread (chairman), mining and
drilling contractor Walter Turner,
Boulder goldminer Rickard Rakauskas
and geologist John Clema.
The prospectus described Whitbread
as a “company director and manager
with experience in raising capital for de-
velopment of Australian projects from
overseas sources.” It might have added
that he is a former director of Cam-
bridge Credit Corporation which
crashed in 1974 with accumulated losses
of $7O million. The Corporate Affairs
Commission report of 1977 said
Whitbread did not have an adequate
understanding of his duties as a director
of a large public company and, “in any
event, did not have sufficient ability to
discharge them.”
Well, the CAC inspectors may eat
their words now. For Whitbread was
able to announce on March 14 that
Westralian Gold Mines had formed a
new subsidiary Westralian Properties
Pty Ltd which had bought “a hotel
complex in Sydney with the settlement
taking place on March 13.” To help
finance it, Westralian Gold Mines
placed 750,000 shares at 40c to raise
$300,000 remarkable, since the com-
pany’s shares this year have traded as
low as 12c and as high as 30c.
The 66-room Bernly Private Hotel
and associated Manzil Room nightclub
cost $l.B million, with the balance on
mortgage. It was bought from one
Joseph Geirsh who had acquired it for
$450,000 in October 1978.
The Speculator was alerted to these
changes following a board reshuffle
and, when we visited the Manzil Room
last week, we were delighted to find the
new manager to be former Sydney
stockbroker Charles Negrine the man
who put the deal together. Negrine as-
sured us that the business had an excel-
lent cash flow and would prove to be a
top investment.
The old Manzil Room has been
cleaned up and the late Johnny
O’Keefe’s daughter Vicki and her band
were the night’s top attractions. The ho-
tel has been refurbished and is getting
70 percent occupancy from the budget
end of the overseas tourist trade. But
why can’t shareholders be told about it
in more detail?
The asset was even a surprise to two
new directors Peter Engelbrecht (who
bought the W. T. Turner holding of 1.4
million shares in July) and Dr Peter
Richardson, the Perth gynaecologist
and former senator. They visited Syd-
ney a week ago, with some trepidation,
but went away more than pleased.
Westralian Gold has on issue 8.25
million 20c shares trading at 17c, valu-
ing the company at $1.4 million. At
June 30, liquid funds remaining
amounted to $155,000. The company
also has 7.5 million options to acquire
shares at 20c, expiring currently.
The outlook is anybody’s guess but
I’ll punt that, with Engelbrecht installed
as chairman and chief executive, the
shares will be revived to encourage op-
tion holders to inject more cash.

cial center with a per capita gross national
product of over $5,000, ” he says. ‘Now this
city-state is being handed over to a
people who earn $3OO a year. Does
that make sense? We can 7 just hand
things back as we did in Africa. ”
The questions are full of pain—
but they haven’t stopped history
from running out on Hong Kong.
This week, after two years and 22
sessions of bickering and bargaining,
Chinese and British negotiators will
initial a document, reportedly run-
ning to more than 200 separate para-
graphs, that will guide the transfer of
the jewel of Asian capitalism to com-
munist control in less than 13 years. It
is a remarkable agreement: on July 1,
1997, Hong Kong will become a “spe-
cial administrative region” of the
People’s Republic of China, enjoying
an extraordinary degree of local
autonomy for at least another 50 years. The
pact guarantees Hong Kong residents con-
tinued freedom of travel; it calls for the free
exchange of currencies, and the preserva-
tion of the local legal system—with final
appeal in Hong Kong, not Peking—and it
will continue private property ownership.
While officially under Chinese sovereignty,
Hong Kong will continue to manage its own
Howe and Deng: Sharing ‘a most important vision’
finances and function as a free port on the
principle of “one country, two systems.”
British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe hails the idea as “a most important
vision, a most important piece of statesman-
ship.” Provided, of course, that China lives
up to the bargain.
Hong Kong residents recall that when
the communists took power on the main-
land in 1949, they promised private
industrialists in Shanghai and other
major cities that they could stay in
business. Afterward, however, the
government compelled the so-called
national bourgeoisie to sell their as-
sets to the state at a low fixed rate,
and thenceforth persecuted them as
“capitalist tails that had to be cut
off” the socialist economy. Few in
Hong Kong questioned the sincer-
ity of Peking’s latest pledge, but
changes in China’s political climate
have been as frequent as they have
been radical. Hong Kong’s business-
men are not likely to forget that
35,000 Chinese died in the ultra-
leftist violence inspired by the Cul-
tural Revolution, a 10-year plunge
into chaos that ended less than a
decade ago.


Forty-four-year-old Joyce Ma is the
daughter of a commercial family that fled
Shanghai in 1948; she grew up prosperous
and married into wealth. But rather than
enjoying the life of a rich Chinese housewife,
Ma started a chain of nine high-fashion bou-
tiques that last year generated $l2 million in
sales. Now she plans to open another shop in
the bustling—and expensive—Central Dis-
trict. “That shows how much confidence I
have in Hong Kong, ” she says. "We are
expecting a mini-boom for at least the next
five years. In that time people will try to make
as much money as they can—and Peking
will have to prove the laissez-faire system that
it promises will continue. If people are not
convinced, they will leave. ”
The Chinese have plenty of incentive to
try to make sure that at least the economic
side of Hong Kong stays more or less as is.
In 1983, the colony was a net purchaser of
$5.3 billion in mainland goods, providing
the Chinese with nearly 40 percent of all the
hard currency it received that year. Hong
Kong is already home to a large
branch of Peking’s Bank of China, its
14 sister banks, massive pro-Peking
labor unions, some 80 businesses—
from supermarkets to brokerage
houses—with mainland backing and
half-a-dozen communist-run publi-
cations. And the city is increasingly
turning toward the mainland. Be-
cause of the uncertainty surrounding
the transfer, Hong Kong business-
men are for the most part deferring
new investment at home. Meanwhile,
however, the Chinese government
has approved $4 billion in investment
proposals from Hong Kong, and al-
though only about a quarter of that
money has actually been disbursed,
Hong Kong still controls approxi-
mately 30 to 40 percent of the main-
land’s total foreign investment. In
addition, the colony’s financial sec-
retary, Sir John Bremridge, notes
that the value of goods shipped
through Hong Kong to the People’s
Republic grew by an extraordinary
139 percent in the first half of this year.
Meanwhile the two governments are up-
grading their communications and trans-
portation links, with a trunk highway
between Hong Kong’s New Territories
and the mainland’s Guangdong Province
scheduled for completion by 1986. Traffic
volume is expected to grow fivefold by 1990,
to 25,000 vehicles a day. Most observers
expect that Hong Kong will increasingly
fall back on its traditional role as an impor-
tant gateway to the mainland—particularly
as China seeks to upgrade its commercial
ties to the West. The Chinese may also use
Hong Kong to initiate capitalist experi-
ments-such as the stock market listing of
state-run enterprises—that would not sit
well in socialist surroundings. “It will be
easier for them to tolerate free-market ac-
tivities in Hong Kong and easier for foreign-
ers to continue coming here,” says Tim
Williams, manager for China at the British-
owned Lloyds Bank International.
Ng Chung Yin, 3 7, was a left-wing activist
during a Hong Kong student movement in
the 19605. His politics were accepted in the
colony, but, Ng discovered, Peking took an
entirely different view. While traveling to the
mainland in 1981, he was detained by Chi-
nese authorities after he had visited local
dissidents who had been active in China's
short-lived democratic movement. Nonethe-
less, Ng welcomes the coming Chinese take-
over. “I've been anticolonialist since the late
19605, "he says. "The future of Hong Kong is
a Chinese issue, not a British one. "Ng, now a
journalist, believes, however, that Hong
Kong must be assured of a continuation of
personal liberties. “A change in the leader-
ship could have direct and grave conse-
quences, ” he insists. "Hong Kong people
should push for direct elections. The more
democratic Hong Kong is in 1997, the less
chance China will have to intervene."

Nash, Joyce Ma: If China reneges on economic freedom, the rich and the enterprising will flee
A telling fact about the new accord is
that all but an elite handful of Hong
Kong’s 5.5 million people were scarcely
even asked what they might like for their
future. At Peking’s ironclad insistence, the
entire matter has been treated from start to
finish as a strictly bilateral issue, to be
negotiated solely between the governments
of China and Britain. More than a million
copies of the final text are being printed in
Chinese for public distribution in the colo-
ny, along with 250,000 in English; over the
next two months, a special office set up by
the Hong Kong government is supposed to
assess public reaction and opinion. The
British Parliament—in which the colony
has no official voice—will debate the ac-
cord and then vote. But in Hong Kong
itself there will not even be a referendum.
In reality, Hong Kong has always had
more freedom than democracy. The colo-
ny’s Executive and Legislative Councils
are largely rubber-stamp affairs whose
members are appointed by the British
governor—currently Sir Edward Youde, a
Chinese-speaking career diplomat former-
ly stationed in Peking. Earlier this year the
government did present a “green paper”
outlining a series of modest reforms involv-
ing indirect elections for local represent-
atives. But to many residents, the proposal
was too little and too late. One group,
called the Hong Kong Observers, com-
plained that the plan would “fritter away
precious years that Hong Kong can ill
afford on a muddled experiment.” Instead,
they proposed that a small number of Leg-
islative Council seats be opened to direct
election within the next four years,
For its part, Peking has paid lip service
to respecting the “democratic aspirations”
of Hong Kong’s citizens. But it seems
unlikely that the Chinese will extend Hong
Kong’s political freedom beyond what is in
place in 1997—and many residents fear
that liberty could be curtailed even before
Britain’s 99-year lease on the colony ex-
pires. One recent concern was Peking’s
proposal for an Anglo-Chinese “joint liai-
son group” that might have become a
Chinese-controlled shadow government
well before 1997. Last month, however,
Howe announced that Peking had agreed
that the liaison group would “play no part
in the administration of Hong Kong” and
that it would not even be based in Hong
Kong until 1988.
Hong Kong was even more dismayed by
the prickly negotiations for the transfer —
and some residents fault Britain for having
brought up the issue in the first place. “It
could have been a classic Chinese solution,”
says Nash, who recalls that when Portugal
raised the question of the status of its colony
in Macao during the 19705, China quietly


A Very Important Tourist
“I am thoroughly enjoying myself,” said the 40-year-old man
in a polished wheelchair, one of nearly 30,000 eager punters
spending a Saturday afternoon at Hong Kong’s Happy Valley
racecourse. As a guest earlier this month of the Royal Hong
Kong Jockey Club, he was sitting in the elegant stewards’ box,
watching intently each time the thoroughbreds leaped from the
gate and puffing cigarettes that he pulled from a sleek metal case
with a lighter built in. He made one wager, on a horse named
“Loyal Stag,” happily pocketing all of $6.70 when it turned up
later in the winner’s circle. Among Hong Kong’s sky-high rol-
lers, that was nothing to write home about —unless your name is
Deng Pufang and your father is China’s top political leader,
Deng Xiaoping.
By the time he finally flew home to Peking last week, Deng
Pufang could boast of having seen the glittering future heart of
Chinese capitalism. Though officially described as purely pri-
vate, his 23-day tour —in-
eluding a side trip to near-
by Portuguese Macao —
may well have been the most
important, and thorough,
top-level Chinese visit to
the colony since the 1949
revolution. While his father
kept a wary eye in Peking
on the final round of talks
on Hong Kong’s future,
the younger Deng—wheel-
chairbound since his back
was broken during the Cul-
tural Revolution —visited
with everyone from ship-
ping tycoons to fellow para-
plegics. Some people saw
him as a polite young heir
inspecting a new estate —
but he was also clearly trav-
eling as his father’s emis-
sary. “The visit is a show of
the old man’s concern,” ob-
served U.S. Consul General
Burton Levin, a veterafi China watcher. “He wants to say, ‘We
have a lot to learn from Hong Kong’.”
Experience: That is a message many in the colony would clearly
like to hear. Throughout the discussions of Hong Kong’s post-
-1997 future, one of the colony’s great fears has been that Peking,
no matter how sincere its assurances, simply doesn’t understand
what makes its madcap capitalism work. The elder Deng is one of
very few Chinese leaders with any real experience at living
abroad: as a young communist activist, he studied in France from
1920 to 1926. Earlier this year, he paid a surprise visit to
Shenzhen, a Chinese “special economic zone” that borders on
Hong Kong’s New Territories. Otherwise, the highest-ranking
Chinese official to have had formal contact with the colony has
been Xu Jiatun, a former Jiangsu Province Communist Party
chief who heads the Hong Kong office of China’s state-run news
agency and functions as Peking’s de facto ambassador.
Especially given its timing, Deng Pufang’s tour was predict-
ably packed with symbolism. His only formal position is head of
the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, a newly estab-
lished agency assigned to helping the estimated 20 million
disabled Chinese. Deng and a delegation from the fund visited
hospitals, rehabilitation centers, public-housing estates and old-
age homes to press home their interest in welfare services. A
standard Mao-era Chinese complaint was that capitalist soci-

eties neglect their poor and needy. Deng
Pufang indeed noted at one point that
the welfare services in Hong Kong and
China were very different —but he added that the two systems
could learn from each other and that “it wasn’t a matter
of ideology.”
On another level, his presence provided a living example of the
price China has paid for political turmoil —and Peking’s power-
ful reasons for wanting to avoid any repetition. Once a promising
physics student, Deng Pufang became embroiled during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution in a violent dispute between rival
factions of militant Red Guards. In 1967, shortly after his father
fell into political disgrace, Deng was forced by his enemies out of
a fourth-story window. The fall broke his spine, and despite a
four-month stay in a Canadian hospital three years ago, he has
been in a wheelchair ever since.
Unexpected: The visit also seemed designed to show that
Peking emissaries can be just plain folk. Despite a formidable
phalanx of bodyguards and antiterrorist security agents, Deng
tried his hand at snooker,
archery and Ping-Pong. He
negotiated a special obsta-
cle course for paraplegics in
the physiotherapy room at
one medical center. During
his two-day stop in Macao,
he unexpectedly joined a
folk dance performed by
handicapped local people—
and showed olf some im-
pressive acrobatics of his
own with his wheelchair.
But when a host later tried
to compliment him on his
seemingly robust health, he
answered starkly: “I’m still
in a wheelchair.”
Deng’s busy forays from
the the posh, downtown
Mandarin Hotel also took
in stops closer to the nuts
and bolts that make Hong
Kong work. He wheeled
about the floor of the colo-
ny’s Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange, met television stars,
dined at the villa of a movie mogul, had tea with Governor Sir
Edward Youde and visited members of the colony’s executive
and legislative councils. At the high-tech electronics factory of
Elec and Eltek Co., chairman David So took the occasion to
pointedly remind his guest that Hong Kong industries have
flourished due to “a low tax structure and an administration
which allows a laissez-faire system.” The potential fruits of
Hong Kong-style capitalism were underscored when shipping
czar Sir Y. K. Pao and industrialist Henry Fok each presented
$1.3 million in contributions to his fund for China’s disabled,
which collected a total of $7.3 million during the visit.
Shortly before he boarded the plane back to Peking, Deng
hinted to journalists that he might visit the colony again. But he
balked when asked if his father might be considering a similar
excursion. “That’s his business,” he said. Asked for his own
observations on the colony, he replied that he had found it
“better than I expected.” That was not quite the starry-eyed
enthusiasm that anxious observers in Hong Kong might have
wanted. But in a cautious game of getting-to-know-you that still
has more than a decade left to play, the hope of many in the
colony was that Deng Pufang’s modest good luck at the races
will be Hong Kong’s harbinger of winning days ahead,

shelved a proposal for negotiations. “But no
Chinese leader could have formally agreed
to a continued foreign administration after
1997; if he did, he would face the firing
squad in Peking.” Yet the negotiations be-
gan in September 1982 when Prime Minis-
ter Margaret Thatcher paid a call on Chi-
nese leader Deng Xiaoping in Peking. Fresh
from her victory in the Falklands war,
Thatcher stressed her “moral responsibil-
ity” to the people of Hong Kong. That did
not sit well with Deng, who insisted that the
talks be concluded by September 1984—in
part because the Chinese leadership clearly
hopes that settling the Hong Kong question
will aid their efforts to entice Taiwan back
into the fold. At one point during his discus-
sions with Thatcher, Deng reportedly
turned to his translator and growled: “You
tell this old cow that when the Chinese say
something they mean it.” And while the
talks concluded amicably enough, they did
not allay the fears raised by Deng’s recent
claim that Peking would have the right to
station troops in Hong Kong, ostensibly for
its defense. The week he made that state-
ment, Hong Kong’s emigration lawyers
were swamped by requests for advice.
Banton Ma’sfather was a self-made bank-
er who wanted his 10 children to have
everything—including foreign passports.
“My parents saw it coming a long time
ago, ” he says. “They knew 1997 would be a
problem. ” Accordingly, he was packed off
to high school in Arizona and college in Los
Angeles, and now the 24-year-old Ma is an
American citizen. Friends without such an
escape route are becoming panicky, says
Ma, and even those who can leave are
concerned because “they don V want to start
from scratch all over again. ”
Last week the negotiators tidied up the
touchy question of the status of the 2.5
million Hong Kong residents who carry
special British-Hong Kong passports that
give them all the protections of British citi-
zenship except the right to live in Britain.
The Chinese are naturally reluctant to per-
mit dual citizenship, but they reportedly
agreed to a post-1997 travel document that
would admit Hong Kong residents into
Britain and third countries —presumably
even those with poor diplomatic relations
with China —and afford them British con-
sular protection. For entry into China, how-
ever, Hong Kong residents will need a
separate entry permit, allowing China to
monitor its own border traffic.
Those with more ample means or solid
connections overseas have never put much
stock in the distinctly second-rate Hong
Kong-British travel documents. Even be-
fore the 1997 issue heated up, local emigra-
tion lawyers did a booming business in
arranging foreign passports. Some took the
relatively lengthy routes required for the
United States, Australia or Canada. Oth-
ers used shortcuts—in some cases, a bank
deposit or investment of as little as
slo,ooo—offered by less discriminating
governments in Central and South Amer-
ica. Until now, only a small percentage
have actually emigrated. But according to
one recent survey, up to a third of the
colony’s managers are making contingency
plans to leave the colony in the next five

years—a potential brain drain that could
undermine Hong Kong’s efforts to boost
the quality of its goods and services.
Of equal concern is the likelihood of
accelerating capital flight. Amid the uncer-
tainty surrounding the colony’s future,
local investors have bought billions of dol-
lars of foreign securities, real estate and
currencies. Hong Kong received a major
psychological blow when Jardine, Mathe-
son, the oldest and most prestigious of its
British-run trading houses, announced last
March that it was switching its legal domi-
cile to Bermuda, in order to assure itself
the continued protection of London
courts. And last week the financial mar-
kets turned up unconfirmed rumors that
Cathay Pacific Airways, the colony’s unof-
ficial flagship carrier, was accumulating
shares in another carrier as a hedge against
the future. The Chinese will have to be
circumspect, if only to ensure that Hong
Kong is not stripped of its major assets
before they regain control.
Is Hong Kong being “sold out,” as critics
of the deal in Parliament are bound to con-
tend? That assumes, of course, that the colo-
ny is somehow Britain’s to sell, a notion
Peking firmly rejects. A famous old phrase
in the Far East calls Hong Kong “a bor-
rowed place, living on borrowed time.” For
all the Union Jacks fluttering and portraits
of the Queen hung on post office walls, no
one in the colony has ever needed reminding
that better than 98 percent of its people are
Chinese, and that China itself lies only a few
miles away across an undefendable border.
In that sense, Hong Kong has long existed
only on China’s suffrance, a fact that has
been made plainer now, and will become
even more so in years to come. If nothing
else, the colony’s hard-headed businessmen
have always prided themselves on being
realistic. The task they face now is to make
the best of a less than perfect deal.
The crowded waters of Causeway Bay are
home to more than a hundred Hong Kong
families who live and work, much as their
ancestors did, on the small wooden boats
known as sampans. Suzie Lei, 43, was born
into the floating community, and as a young
girl joined the rest of her family in scraping
down the hulls of British warships that pulled
into a nearby Royal Navy base. In the long
years since, luck and hard work—the classic
Hong Kong virtues—have brought her what
is by sampan standards astonishing success: a
lucrative contract for doing maintenance
work at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, a
gold-and-silver Rolex watch and, as ofa year
ago, ownership of a modest apartment house
ashore. “Maybeafter 1997thebuildingwon V
be mine, "she said last week. “Maybe all the
rich people will take their boats and go away. ”
But if the prospect had her worried, it didn’t
seem to show. “The newspapers, ” she said
confidently, “say everything will be OK. ”

Some Billion-Dollar Questions
Electronics workers: Will the West clamp restrictions on access to high technology?
STUART FRANKLIN— SYGMA
As Hong Kong is coaxed into China’s
orbit, it enters a new economic era
studded with multibillion-dollar question
marks. Last year the colony ranked 18th on
the list of global traders —ahead of Brazil,
Mexico and even China itself. Like any eco-
nomic power, its commercial ties are gov-
erned by a host of international treaties and
conventions, covering everything from tar-
iffs and airport safety to copyrights and the
mails. In some cases, such as key textile-
import quotas, Hong Kong has long been
treated as a sovereign nation; in others, nota-
bly access to advanced technology, the colo-
ny has remained under Britain’s umbrella.
But all that will have to be re-examined
between now and 1997, and the shape of
what emerges will be crucial to defining
Hong Kong’s economy in the 21 st century.
Some of the expected changes should
prove relatively painless, particularly if, as
expected, the Sino-British accords give post-
-1997 Hong Kong the right to enter on its own
into international commercial agreements.
The colony’s energetic overseas trade repre-
sentatives, for instance, already have their
own offices in many major world cities, and
even those still working out of British con-
sulates or trade commissions could be shift-
ed easily into Chinese missions. Still, there is
lingering concern over Hong Kong’s postco-
lonial status. Among the key issues:
■Tariffs: As a colony, Hong Kong partici-
pates through Britain in the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which
sets rules for world commerce through a
complex system of tariff ceilings, import
quotas and ongoing talks on trade liberaliza-
tion. From Hong Kong’s point of view, that
arrangement has worked admirably: British
representatives to the Geneva-based body
haveon occasion even advanced the colony’s
interests ahead of their own.
China does not belong to GATT —a situa-
tion that arose years ago because of the split
with Taiwan—but it does maintain a large
unofficial presence in Geneva. Peking al-
most certainly will refuse to allow Hong
Kong fully independent membership. But
even a less formal autonomous role, which
the Chinese seem to be promising, could
raise problems if China and the former colo-
ny become embroiled in a trade dispute.
■Textiles: Hong Kong already has an effec-
tively independent voice in the Multi-Fiber
Arrangement (MFA), which was estab-
lished under GATT to regulate textile trad-
ing—source of 40 percent of the colony’s
export earnings. MFA quotas are based on
bilateral agreements between producing
and consuming nations; until now, Hong
Kong’s have been far larger than those of
China, which joined the group only this
year. Even if Peking allowed the colony a
degree of MFA autonomy, two clear dilem-
mas could arise after 1997: Will China try to
expand its own exports by taking over a
portion of Hong Kong’s quotas? Or will
importing countries use the occasion to at-
tempt to abolish Hong Kong’s quotas, argu-
ing that it is simply a part of China? Says
Lawrence Mills, a British businessman who
runs a $4O million-a-year apparel-exporting
company in the colony: “We could face a
protectionists’ field day.”
■Technology: As a communist country, Chi-
na’s access to Western high technology is
restricted, particularly by the United States.
Hong Kong faces no such limitations; in
fact, the colony’s thousands of electronics
manufacturers rely heavily on U.S.-made
equipment and parts. In theory at least,
Hong Kong companies seeking to upgrade
their products and production techniques
could begin to face the same sort of restric-
tions as their mainland counterparts. But
the colony’s business community and diplo-
mats are optimistic that China’s own rapidly
widening access to sophisticated Western
technology will close the gap by the time
Peking formally takes over.
■Aviation: Commercial landing rights at
Hong Kong’s heavily traveled Kai Tak Air-
port may be the most immediate problem.
China’s General Administration of Civil
Aviation (CAAC), which runs the state air-
line, had reportedly been pressing for full
control over air travel in and out of the
colony after 1997. That was grim news for
Cathay Pacific, the highly profitable Brit-
ish-owned company that is Hong Kong’s
unofficial flag carrier. The issue was report-
edly one of the last sticking points between
Chinese and British officials negotiating the
final takeover agreement. But according to
one report published last week in Hong
Kong’s left-wing, pro-Peking press, China
has essentially given in, agreeing both to
recognize Hong Kong’s existing bilateral
arrangements on landing rights and to allow
the post-1997 local government to continue
to negotiate its own such agreements.
Ultimately, solutions to all these issues
will depend in part on developments in the
coming decade —and especially China’s own
progress at economic modernization. The
accord announced last week points the way
to amicable agreements. But with billions of
dollars —and the interests of dozens of other
trading countries—potentially at stake, no
one is expecting that path to be easy.

AUSTRALIA
A Besieged Prime Minister
Even by the rough-and-tumble stand-
ards of Australian politics, the outburst
was extreme. On the floor of Parliament two
weeks ago, opposition leader Andrew Pea-
cock accused Prime Minister Bob Hawke of
being a “little crook” and “a perverter of the
law in this country who associates with crim-
inals and takes his orders from those who
direct these criminals.” The attack followed
months of mounting allegations that the
Hawke government has in effect protected
various supporters who may have been in-
volved in criminal activities. Last week, the
usually combative prime minister finally
seemed to crack under the strain. When
asked at a press conference how the contro-
versy was affecting him and his family,
Hawke broke down and cried.
Hawke is enmeshed in what is rapidly
becoming one of Australia’s biggest political
scandals. His opponents charge that the
prime minister has tried to thwart a formal
inquiry into alleged misbehavior by a High
Court judge, and that he forced a federal
commission to cut short the largest investi-
gation into organized crime in the country’s
history. “The effect of Mr. Hawke’s . . .
actions is to protect some of the most power-
ful criminals in Australia,” Peacock said in a
statement issued last week. “And Mr.
Hawke knows it.” Hawke
denied any wrongdoing. “I
can say without equivoca-
tion that this government
and this prime minister
will do nothing to protect
anyone, whether that per-
son is known or not known
to me,” he said at last
week’s press conference.
Just what political dam-
age the crime issue will
create is an open question.
Hawke has repeatedly in-
dicated he would call early
elections in December, a move designed to
consolidate his power. With that in mind,
some Australians say Peacock has taken up
the corruption question solely for political
reasons. “The Liberal leaders are trying to
regain their lost hegemony with all the sub-
tlety of a [motorcycle] gang,” says Geoffrey
Barker, a columnist for the Melbourne Age.
But so far Labor leaders appear undaunted.
Polls show Hawke’s personal popularity is
running high—6B percent —while his party
leads the Liberals by a 50-to-41 margin.
“We’re worried about [the scandal] as an
issue but not for its electoral impact,” a top
Labor official told Newsweek’s Carl Rob-
inson. He did not seem troubled about any
fallout from Hawke’s crying at the press
conference —or during a radio interview the
next day.“Hawke,” he said, “is showing
people that he’s got feelings just like them.”
The scandal began in February when the
Age printed 524 pages of transcripts of con-
versations between top crime figures and a
wide range of politicians, public servants,
judges and police officials. The conversa-
tions had been illegally recorded by a special
branch of the New South Wales Police and
were inadmissable in court.
But the tapes were the most far-
reaching, and specific, indica-
tion of wrongdoing in Austral-
ian history—including charges
of bribery, illegal gambling,
prostitution, drug deals, fraud-
ulent land schemes, attempts
to influence judges, ties to
American mob figures and
even murder.

ment officials condemned the
tapes as an invasion of privacy
and demanded to know who
leaked them. In New South Wales, a Labor
stronghold, Parliament enacted legislation
making it a crime to possess any tapes or
transcripts from illegal wiretaps. And the
state’s premier, Neville Wran, promptly
called a snap election so his party could have a
full four-year term to weather any protracted
crisis. That proved to be a shrewd move.
Shortly after Labor was re-elected, Rex Jack-
son, then state minister for corrective serv-
ices, was charged with conspiring to release
prisoners early in return for favors. He plead-
ed not guilty but resigned his post. In other
cases, a magistrate was charged with “per-
verting the course of justice” and a former
police commissioner is under investigation
for interference in a legal case.
But the most highly publicized case has
been that of Lionel Murphy, a High Court
justice, former federal attorney general and
Labor Party stalwart. In March a Senate
committee began investigating
Murphy for allegedly attempt-
ing to influence a civil case in-
volving a friend, a charge Mur-
phy denied. At first the Hawke
government refused to cooper-
ate. It backed down, however,
when Liberals on the inquiry
panel formed an alliance with
another opposition party, the
Democrats. Last month the
Senate probe ended in a dead-
lock. But the government again
lost out to the Liberal-Demo-
crat alliance when it tried to
give a special prosecutor exclu-
sive rights to the inquiry.
Hawke has also kept the Senate, special
prosecutor and other investigators from
looking into the tapes’ full content, provok-
ing a flood of cover-up charges. “The tapes
are about organized crime,” says Bob Bot-
tom, the investigative reporter who original-
ly obtained the transcripts. “You’ve got
crime czars talking about bumping people
off. They run the heroin trade in Australia,
they run the brothels, they burn down prem-
ises. All that is being ignored.”
Pressure: Critics have also accused
Hawke of thwarting another investigation,
this one by a four-year-old royal commis-
sion. Led by respected Melbourne attorney
Frank Costigan, the commission has been
looking into organized crime. Under pres-
sure from his own power base, the right
wing of the New South Wales
Labor Party, Hawke ordered
the commission to disband. In
its stead, he wanted the newly
formed —and significantly less
powerful —National Crimes
Authority to handle all investi-
gations begun by the commis-
sion. When Costigan pleaded
for more time to prove several
important businessmen were
financing Australia’s drug
trade, Hawke refused. Howev-
er, after pressure from the op-
position, the prime minister
last week agreed to make public the Costi-
gan Commission’s final report, due Oct. 31.
The report will undoubtedly stir things
up even more. Last week the National Times
printed a leaked portion of the study, using
code names such as Gomorrah and Goanna
(Aboriginal for monitor lizard) for the busi-
nessmen under investigation. Goanna, for
instance, was described as close to Hawke
while linked to drug deals, pornography,


land fraud and a murder. “[Gomorrah] pro-
duces and imports pornography, and dis-
tributes it around Australia,” read one ex-
cerpt quoted by the Times. “He has engaged
in blackmail, relying upon sexual indiscre-
tions of others.”
It was the Costigan Commission, the Na-
tional Crimes Authority and the Age tapes
that prompted Peacock to his “little crook”
attack on the House floor two weeks ago.
The House speaker forced Peacock to with-
draw the word “crook” as “unparliamen-
tary language,” and the prime minister
threatened a defamation suit. For his part,
Peacock has been unrepentant. Ever since
Hawke came to power, said the opposition
leader, “I’ve had to suffer being called a liar,
immoral, a cheat, a friend of the tax dodgers
and a consorter of those who should be in jail.
That’s affected my family, and we’ve had 18
months of it, not a week.” The political
climate in Australia is clearly overheated.
But with elections expected in December —
and the Costigan report due later this
month —it looks as if Hawke and his oppo-
nents are only warming up.

INDIA
Chariots of Saffron:
An Actor’s Comeback
In 320 movies, Nandamuri Taraka Rama
Rao, 61, fought demons singlehandedly and
always won. But his toughest role has been
as a gadfly to Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi. Two years ago he retired from his
film career, donned saffron robes and
founded the Telugu Desam Party in An-
dhra Pradesh. Appealing to the state’s 60
million Telugu speakers, he rode through
the countryside atop his Chevrolet truck
(which he calls his “Chariot of Divine En-
lightenment”). He made so many party
converts that he was elected chief minister.
In August he had a falling out with his
finance minister, a Gandhi supporter, who
persuaded the state governor to depose him.
That sparked a month of bloody protests
and sectarian clashes that took more than
50 lives.
Rama Rao turned the mayhem to good
advantage. He took his “save democracy”
campaign to New Delhi. In a theatrical
gesture, Rama Rao dabbed a spot of holy
ash on his forehead, combed his hair and
rolled to the presidential palace in a wheel-
chair. India was already in an uproar over
Gandhi’s dismissals of chief ministers in
Kashmir and Sikkim. Facing a general elec-
tion by the end of January, the prime minis-
ter apparently decided she didn’t need more
trouble from Rama Rao—and last week,
the governor of Andhra Pradesh reinstated
him. “The will of the people has prevailed at
last,” he said. For a man who once played
the god Krishna, victory seemed only
natural.
THE PHILIPPINES
A Nervous Waiting Game
Even Ferdinand Marcos, normally so
cocksure, seemed nervous last week,
Like everyone else in the Philippines, the
president was waiting for the long-overdue
report of the independent Agrava commis-
sion investigating the assassination of Be-
nigno Aquino. Addressing a group of top
Filipino businessmen, Marcos deliberately
distanced himself from the Philippine mili-
tary’s contention that a lone communist hit
man had killed the opposition leader. “I did
not say that was my opinion,” Marcos in-
sisted. He added that he would accept the
findings of the board, however damaging to
his government, and take appropriate ac-
Demonstrators under attack in Manila: Was it a prelude to more violent upheavals?
tion. If members of the military are found
responsible, he said, those named would be
immediately suspended from duty and then
court-martialed.
The president was obviously anticipating
an explosive report. The question is: how
explosive? Newsweek has learned that the
board is virtually unanimous in its convic-
tion that segments of the Philippine military
planned and carried out the assassination,
But behind closed doors at the Philippine
Village Hotel, various panel members have
haggled, shouted, stormed out of the room
and even burst into tears during their delib-
erations. They were evidently arguing over
what tone the report should take and how
specific its conclusions could be. There were
differences of opinion on how high up in the
military the conspiracy reached, what
names to name and what action to
recommend.
The focus of much of the acrimony was
apparently Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed
forces chief of staff who runs the nation’s
vast, shadowy intelligence network and
who has long been considered Marcos’s
most intimate and trusted ally. Ver’s name
has cropped up repeatedly during the 10
months of the hearings. One witness told
the board in Los Angeles that he had once
received an order from a Philippine general
to kill Aquino and that the general had
informed him that the order came from Ver
and from Marcos himself. But that was just
hearsay, and it was unclear whether the
board had any more substantial evidence
pointing to Ver. The chief of staff himself
has denied any link to the assassination, but,
like the president, he has said that he will
abide by the commission’s findings.
Chairman Corazon Agrava was said to be
particularly worried that a tough report
could stir a mass upheaval. She had cause
for concern; the country seemed even more
restless than usual. Late in the week Benig-
no’s brother Agapito led about 20,000 peo-
ple on a demonstration march toward Ma-
lacanang Palace. About 2,000 of them spent
the night near the Mendiola Bridge leading
to the palace. Early the next morning,
around 2,000 troops defending the palace
prepared to move. After warning the dem-
onstrators to disperse, the police attacked
the crowd with clubs and tear gas. At least
six people were injured. And, from high
officials to ordinary citizens, the nation
couldn’t help but wonder whether the latest
march to Malacanang was just a prelude to
yet another nationwide outbreak of unrest
and violence.

Talking Again
Reagan and Gromyko may well inject some realism into their superpower feud
JAMES L. LONG ASSOC
After years of long-distance
squinting at the leaders of the
Politburo, Ronald Reagan will
finally meet one of them this
week. Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko might have
played Ming the Merciless in
the president’s worst scenarios
of the Evil Empire. By the same
token, the Soviets still consider
Reagan the world’s most dan-
gerous cowboy. But both men
suddenly seemed willing to do a
little business. Gromyko is the
most powerful and adept Soviet
diplomat since the revolu-
tion—his standing, if anything,
enhanced by Konstantin Cher-
nenko’s health problems and the apparent
lack of clear leadership in the Kremlin. Af-
ghanistan, the Korean Air Lines disaster
and Euromissiles have widened the gulf be-
tween East and West. But for several hours
Reagan and Gromyko will sit down to share
lunch and trade complaints. And if the ses-
sion goes well, they might be able to put more
realism into their superpower feud.
Before the White House meeting, the two
men will warm up with some preliminary
flourishes at the United Nations. Gromyko
will put offhis speech to the General Assem-
bly for three days, letting Reagan go first and
giving the Soviets time to craft a response. At
midweek, Moscow’s great stone face will
meet with Secretary of State George Shultz
to slog through superpower disputes on
trade, human rights and Third World revo-
lutions. When he sits down with the presi-
dent at the end of the week, he will probably
mix tough words with a probe for ways to
revive arms control. As a seasoned nyet
man, he is sure to demand U.S. concessions
in exchange for even the slightest nod in
return. For Reagan, the problem will be to
show flexibility and firmness in just the right
proportions and at just the right time. Would
he play to his rugged past form? “I never take
hard lines with anyone,” the president an-
swered diplomatically.
‘Czar’: Reagan’s strategists said he intend-
ed to offer Gromyko further cabinet-level
contacts, building to a 1985 superpower
summit. But the more pressing question was
how far the two sides would go to get arms-
control talks restarted. The administration
is split between pragmatists who hope to give
the talks new life in a second Reagan term
In Michigan last week: Hoping to be firm, but flexible —and to win a summit in 1985


and hard-liners opposed to any significant
change. Among other ideas, Reagan may
tell Gromyko that he is prepared to create a
new arms-control “czar” powerful enough
to fend off obstructions from the ideological
right. Whether Reagan would change field
on arms control as abruptly as he did on
China was still an open question. In talking
to Gromyko, he has ruled out any new con-
cessions to lure the Soviets to the table, but
will offer new high-level talks aimed at reviv-
ing the stalled START talks. “The fact that
he’s Ronald Reagan and would never be soft
on the Russians puts him in a unique position
to accomplish [arms reduction] in a second
term,” said one White House moderate. The
hard-liners were sure to resist, but the dan-
ger of the impasse was beyond dispute.
While the Soviets and the Americans have
lost time with mutual suspicions, recrimina-
tions and delays, weapons technology has
hurtled forward, creating killers that may
one day be impossible to control.
At the less dangerous level of domestic
politics, Gromyko’s arrival will spill clum-
sily into the finals of Campaign ’B4. The
visit undercut a favorite rebuke from Wal-
ter Mondale: that Reagan was the first
president since The Bomb never to have met
with his Soviet counterpart. After the White
House confirmed the get-together, Mon-
dale announced that Gromyko would meet
him as well. The Soviets said they had not
accepted Reagan’s re-election as inevitable;
they denied playing politics while there was
still time to make an impression on him. But
no one really believed that. Mondale game-
ly planned to tell Gromyko that only the
president could speak for the nation, that
President Mondale would “drive a tough
bargain” and that “world survival demands
true progress on arms control.”
Propping: Neither the president’s mes-
sage nor the challenger’s will sound entirely
new to Gromyko. He has been a regular
White House visitor since Franklin Roose-
velt’s days. But he hasn’t been welcome
since 1979, when Soviet troops invaded Af-
ghanistan. Reagan’s advisers touted Gro-
myko’s return as the administration’s great-
est diplomatic challenge. The president has
been prepping for a high-level dialogue with
the Soviets for more than a year. Even after
a Soviet fighter shot down Korean Air Fines
Flight 007 last year, Reagan began asking
for articles explaining the Soviet leadership
and negotiating style. He has met with Rob-
ert Massie, author of “Nicholas and Alex-
andra,” a biography of the last Romanov
czar, and with Massie’s wife, Suzanne. He
has also had several meetings with former
national-security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
will brief him early this week.
In addition, White House aides have de-
briefed a range of “Gromykologists,” glean-
ing tips for dealing with the old pro from
such disparate figures as Richard Nixon
and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Gromyko has
confounded U.S. negotiators for years.
“He’s a tough bird,” says one aide. “Diplo-

mats who’ve dealt with him on basic issues
have known him to lie —not just to deceive
but to lie when he knew they knew he
was lying.”
Reagan will disclose some of his negotiat-
ing cards at the United Nations. As in other
recent statements, he will probably call for
better U.S.-Soviet relations and new arms-
reduction talks. Also according to form, he
will extoll democracy, Western prosperity
and U.S. strength. “As I will tell [Gromyko],
we seek no territorial expansion and are
making no effort to impose our will on any-
one,” Reagan said at an lowa rally last week.
“But we will never again allow the United
States of America to let its guard down.”
His basic attitude about arms control re-
mains unchanged: that the Soviets walked
out of the negotiations, and that they must
take the initiative to return. Reagan also will
run through his list of concerns about Soviet
behavior—including the occupation of Af-
ghanistan, Moscow’s support for guerrillas
in southern Africa and for Cuban proxies in
Africa and Central America, Soviet med-
dling in the Middle East and Soviet arms
shipments to the Third World. According to
U.S. intelligence reports, the Kremlin’s
arms shipments to Nicaragua are running 50
per cent higher than last year; supply lines to
Cuba and Angola also have increased. Rea-
gan will be “very serious” about such mat-
ters, says one senior State Department
official.
For his part, Gromyko probably wants to
talk tough and listen hard. In his speech be-
fore the U.N. General Assembly he is likely
to trot out past Soviet arms-control propos-
als, ranging from a “code of conduct” for
nuclear powers to a comprehensive test-ban
treaty. The rhetoric will also be “sharply
critical” of the United States, according to a
Soviet source abroad. Specifically, it will
“heap blame on the U.S. for tensions in the
world today and for the lack of any arms
agreement. On the other hand, it will strong-
ly support the U.N. system.” When Gromy-
ko gets to Washington, he will no doubt have
his own list of U.S.-Soviet grievances—and
blame them all on Reagan.
That he could come to Washington at all
was one sign that feelings over the KAL
atrocity and NATO’s missile deployment
are cooling. More important, the Soviets can
read U.S. opinion polls offering them little
hope that Reagan will lose. Soviet optimists
believe that Reagan’s conciliatory signals
might translate into better relations. The
pessimists —the clear majority—believe
that, once re-elected, Reagan will revert to
his visceral anticommunism. Gromyko’s
meeting will help the Kremlin size up those
prospects closer to the source. If Reagan
shows that he can become more “pragmat-
ic,” Soviet sources were hinting in Moscow
last week, the Kremlin might find it possible
to resume strategic-arms negotiations.
No one could count on that. Presidential
adviser Scowcroft, for one, said he had “nev-
er seen Gromyko in a more assertive and
aggressive mode.” Under a string of feeble


Kremlin leaders from Brezhnev to Andro-
pov to Chernenko, Gromyko has won wide
leeway to run foreign policy under the broad
guidelines set by the Politburo. His decision
to delay his U. N. speech showed flexibility in
a system that usually produces rigid texts
two months ahead of time. His inspection
trip to Washington coincides with a major
Soviet re-evaluation of policy toward the
West, a process leading to the 27th Commu-
nist Party Congress in 1986 and a plan gov-
erning Soviet policy into the 19905. Thus
Gromyko’s meeting with Reagan, and the
diplomacy that follows, could well deter-
mine the course of U.S.-Soviet relations for
the next five years—just as the shadow of
Afghanistan has hung over the last five.
The Soviets apparently included Mon-
dale in Gromyko’s schedule to hedge their
election bet. Mondale aides said a Soviet
academician suggested the meeting through
Mondale adviser Barry Carter shortly be-
fore Gromyko’s meeting with Reagan was
announced. Mondale’s staff sent feelers to
the Soviet Embassy, which helped arrange
the session with unusual speed. In private,
Mondale plans to query Gromyko on the
Middle East, arms control and other details
of U.S.-Soviet relations; in addition, he can
be expected to issue an appeal on behalf of
dissident Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov.
Reagan’s national-security adviser Robert
McFarlane called Mondale to offer briefings
on current U.S.-Soviet issues; Mondale’s
advisers intended to accept.
Results: Politically, Mondale’s strategy is
to raise expectations for Reagan’s session
while hoping the meeting will not produce
spectacular results. Mondale’s aides said
that at the very least, Reagan should negoti-
ate a date for a superpower summit or arms
talks. As president, Mondale has pledged to
seek regular U. S.-Soviet summits and to halt
nuclear testing temporarily, challenging the
Kremlin to do likewise.
The ultimate results of Gromyko’s as-
sorted stops are likely to be modest, but any
progress at all would ease the dangerous
tension that now afflicts both nations. Mod-
erate Reagan strategists talked of renewed
arms-control negotiations in the first spring
of a new administration and hoped for a
summit conference later in 1985. And even
the Soviet press came up with a very left-
handed concession: a recent series of arti-
cles commemorated the Hitler-Stalin pact
as an act of realpolitik. The inference was
that a deal with Reagan might be justified
on the same grounds. A summit was still a
distant prospect. But as the president and
the emissary from Moscow felt their way
forward, there was a chance, however faint,
that the talks would put the United States
and the Soviet Union on a more businesslike
footing. And everyone would be a little safer
for that.

The Gromyko Method
The old Sphinx meets the president: A firm conviction that time is on Moscow’s side
His negotiating technique combines guile with ‘nyet.’
This week Ronald Reagan will find him-
self face to face with a diplomat who has
served longer than any other living states-
man. In 1945, when Reagan was making
movies, Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, a
polished actor himself, was Soviet ambassa-
dor to the United States, the man behind
Joseph Stalin’s shoulder at Yalta. Since
then, he has served as United Nations am-
bassador and foreign minister, bargained
with nine U.S. presidents and outlasted four
Soviet leaders. The president may or may
not be surprised at what Gromyko has to say;
but he can be sure that Moscow’s top talker
will rely on a very well-tested set of negotiat-
ing techniques. The Gromyko method:
Master the details. If Gromyko is credited
with one thing by all the U.S. officials who
have dealt with him, it is his impressive
mastery of detail. He is routinely able to sit
through long meetings without taking notes,
then answer his adversary’s arguments
point by point from memory. He also has an
encyclopedic knowledge of history—much
of which he has gained firsthand. In his
memoirs, Henry Kissinger recalls: “It was
suicidal to negotiate with [Gromyko] with-
out mastering the record or the issues.”
Given Gromyko’s powers of concentra-
tion, former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow
Malcolm Toon recommends that Reagan
“do a lot of homework.” One former secre-
tary of state, citing stories that the president
sometimes naps during cabinet meetings,
offered two words of advice: “Stay awake.”
It wasn’t just a joke. Gromyko judges his
adversaries largely by their alertness and
command of facts, and he is not shy about
showing contempt when he thinks others are
not prepared. At a 1983 press conference in
Bonn, after fielding a flurry of questions
about NATO’s Euromissile deployment, he
told reporters: “If you were to be examined
on the details [of the Euromissile issue], I
doubt many of you would get an A. ”
Put the other side on the defensive. If he
holds true to form, Gromyko will probably
start the Oval Office meeting by reciting a
long list of Soviet grievances against the
United States. In 1977, he warned Jimmy
Carter against “the dirty game” of trying to
play China off against Moscow; he also be-
rated Carter for inviting Soviet dissident
Vladimir Bukovsky, whom he called “a
common criminal,” to the White House.
This ritual may be partly for domestic con-
sumption: former Kissinger aide Helmut
Sonnenfeldt suspects that Gromyko takes
home a transcript of his harangues to show
the Politburo that he has defended Soviet
positions “to the last bastion.” But the tactic
is also intended to put the other side on the
defensive. Sonnenfeldt’s advice to Reagan:
stay “placid and serene.”
Seek something for nothing. A standard
Gromyko ploy is to seek concessions simply
for agreeing to talk. “Whenever possible,”
Kissinger recalled, “Gromyko tried to sell
even the opening of a negotiation: that is to
say, he would demand a concession as a price
for sitting down at the bargaining table.” If
Reagan expresses a desire for further talks
with the Soviets, Gromyko will almost cer-
tainly ask for something in return —a mora-
torium on testing antisatellite weapons, per-
haps, or concessions on strategic weapons.
Attack the secretary of state. In previous


With JFK, 1963: Stern lectures, calculated anger and occasional flashes of humor
UPI
visits to the United States, Gromyko’s strat-
egy has almost always been to be very tough
in the first encounter with the secretary of
state. Zbigniew Brzezinski writes in his
memoirs that in the fall of 1977, Gromyko
was “surprisingly hard” in his U.N. session
with Cyrus Vance. It turned out to be “only a
softening-up tactic,” however, and later he
was more flexible with Carter. Gromyko is
likely to do the same thing this year. He
knows that Reagan is eager to show that he
can do business with the Soviets before the
election, so he will probably appear unyield-
ing with George Shultz in hopes that it
will make the president easier to deal with in
Washington.
Never miss a chance to say ‘nyet.’ During
his stint as U.N. ambassador from 1946 to
1949, Gromyko used the Soviet veto so
many times that he became known as “Mr.
Nyet.” (He also stormed out of U.N. coun-
cils so frequently that baseball fans started
joking that a batter who had walked had
“pulled a Gromyko.”) In 1979, when Vance
met with the Soviets in Vienna, he kept track
of Gromyko’s “nye ts ’’and counted 12 in all.
Apparently Gromyko feels that the repeti-
tion of the word creates the right atmosphere
for negotiation, by frustrating adversaries.
Throw tantrums, if necessary. Usually,
Gromyko is cold as ice. Once, when an irate
U.S. delegate to the United Nations pound-
ed a table under his nose, Gromyko didn’t
blink; then he asked dryly whether the table
was reinforced. If the situation calls for it,
however, he can display calculated flashes of
temper. In his book “Caveat” Alexander
Haig concludes that such tantrums were
thrown “for tactical reasons” —to stall or
throw the other side off-balance. Gromyko
has other delaying tactics. Although fluent
in English, he uses —and sometimes nitpicks
with —translators, a ploy that gives him time
to ponder his answers. He can also launch
into pointless digressions. Kissinger recalls
one session when Gromyko wasted several
hours with an arcane argument about how to
count missiles.
Don’t depart from the script. The most
famous thing that has ever been said about
Gromyko was Nikita Khrushchev’s caustic
remark that the foreign minister, if com-
manded to, “would sit on a block of ice with
his pants pulled down without asking a
question. ” In fact, Gromyko has never been
a mindless apparatchik. But he has always
followed orders. His loyalty is largely re-
sponsible for his survival under Stalin,
Khrushchev (who delighted in humiliat-
ing Gromyko), Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri
Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. It
also means that now, even though Gromy-
ko has far more influence than in the
past, he will dutifully follow the script Mos-
cow gives him —and not offer any conces-
sions to Reagan which have not been au-
thorized by Chernenko and the Politburo.
Use humor occasionally. Be-
hind the poker face, Gromyko
does have a sense of humor, and
he can use it to shrewd effect.
Dean Acheson, who dismissed
many postwar Soviet diplomats
as “boorish,” credited Gromy-
ko with a sardonic wit. And
Kissinger tells a story of how
Gromyko helped break the ten-
sion of the SALT I talks. The
U.S. delegation’s Xerox ma-
chine had broken down, so Kis-
singer, “knowing the KGB’s
reputation for Orwellian übiq-
uity,” asked Gromyko “wheth-
er he could have some copies
made for us if we held certain
documents up to the chandelier.” Mordant-
ly, Gromyko replied that “unfortunately the
cameras were installed by the tsars; they
were adequate for photographing people,
but not documents. ” Sometimes Gromyko’s
humor is so dry as to be undetectable. Says
one Western diplomat in Moscow: “There’s
one way to tell he’s cracked a joke.
He laughs.”
Be self-efladng. Gromyko has always
gone to great lengths to be as self-effacing as
possible. When a reporter once tried to ask
him a personal question, Gromyko coldly
replied: “My personality doesn’t interest
me.” When under instructions to warm up
to the Americans, Gromyko reportedly
showed up for a 5-to-7 Foreign Press Associ-
ation party at 6:55, shook hands with the
host, then looked at his watch and said it was
time to go. In his U.N. days, such aloofness
fascinated women: female members of the
Soviet delegation nicknamed him “Krasa-
vets-Diplomat” (“Handsome Diplomat”),
and American bobby-soxers called him
“Diplomatic Dreamboat No. 1.” Others
found thefrostiness off-putting. “Compared
to Gromyko,” said one former congress-
man, “the Sphinx is like the Grand Central
information booth during rush hour.”
Of course, Gromyko does have a personal
side. He and his wife, Lidia, have two chil-
dren: Anatoly, a specialist in African affairs,
and Emilia, a diplomat’s wife. He relaxes by
playing chess with Lidia and reading prerev-
olutionary Russian archives. He has a weak-
ness for Hollywood movies (particularly
“Gone With the Wind”), and has been
known to read American comics. His favor-
ite pastime, however, is bear hunting—a
sport he pursues in much the same manner as
his diplomacy. “He’s methodical,” says Hel-
mut Sonnenfeldt, who once hunted with
Gromyko. “It’s his whole style: he stalks his
quarry with great care and agility.”

up Gromyko’s style, Kissinger writes that he
always “preferred steady pressure to the

opposite number to extract otherwise un-

That will undoubtedly be his approach

probably won’t trouble Gromyko if he
comes away from the White House empty-
handed. What he is banking on is that it will
matter to Ronald Reagan.

The Coattail Jitters
Senate candidate Shamie on primary night: An underdog basking in a White House glow
AP
What effect would a Reagan sweep have on Congress?
For weeks, despondent Democrats have
been urging Walter Mondale to show
some heat. There was heat enough to spare
last week in Fresno, Calif. —105 degrees’
worth —and with beads of sweat dotting his
face, Shirt-Sleeve Fritz finally began to give
off sparks. “I’m not trying to get elected
president... by hiding from the American
people,” Mondale declared. “I am here to
earn your trust and support. That’s the
difference between these two candidates.
I’m answering your questions. I’m specific
about our plans for the future . . . Mr. Rea-
gan is moving around this country in a
question-free zone, a celluloid capsule...”
The fervid rhetoric—backed by a series of
tough new television ads —didn’t seem to
faze Ronald Reagan, whose campaign con-
tinues to look as if it were orchestrated by
Betsy Ross with a little help from John
Philip Sousa. An exuberant Reagan rally in
Hammonton, N.J., featured fireworks and a
blizzard of tiny parachutes containing min-
iature American flags. The Flag-Waver in
Chief limited his campaigning to just two
days last week, a languid pace justified by
his commanding lead in the polls.
Those surveys continued to frighten con-
gressional Democrats—and fueled new
speculation about the length of Reagan’s
coattails. At issue, along with the presiden-
cy, was whether the new Congress would be
receptive to Reagan’s programs. Demo-
crats weren’t exactly abandoning the ticket:
they were just trying to pretend that Geral-
dine Ferraro was campaigning alone. At
Ferraro rallies in Philadelphia, Chicago
and Dallas, Mondale was rarely mentioned.
When she appeared at the University of
Texas at Arlington, the sign tied to the
cottonwood trees behind the outdoor podi-
um read simply, “Ferraro ’84.”
Mismatch: Mondale himself claimed that
“we are gaining.” But the polls still say
mismatch. A CBS-New York Times survey
showed Mondale trailing by 21 percentage
points. An ABC poll showed Reagan with a
lopsided lead in five battleground states,
including a 29-point edge in Texas. Poll-
taker Mervin Field analyzed 36 state polls
and concluded that for now Reagan is the
unquestioned dean of the Electoral Col-
lege—leading Mondale by a margin of 486
to 7. “It’s just phenomenal,” said Field.
“It’s never been as bleak at this point in time
for the candidate who has been behind.”
Confronted with persistent evidence of
another Reagan tidal wave, congressional
Democrats are trying desperately to erect
sea walls against the onslaught. Only the
bravest Democrats are still willing to pre-
dict that they will win the six seats needed to
regain control of the Senate—and Republi-
cans are beginning to talk about coming
close to maintaining their current 55-45
majority. The arithmetic in the House
(where Democrats hold a 266-167 majority)
is more complex. The pressing question is
not a Republican takeover, but whether the
GOP will win enough seats to give Reagan’s
programs an ideological majority. By most
estimates, the Republicans need to pick up
about 25 House seats to come close to re-
storing the halcyon days of 1981, when
Democrats lost their veto power over Rea-
gan’s tax and budget plans. But most GOP
strategists acknowledge that a Reagan
sweep may net them only about a dozen new
House seats.
‘Antsy*: “The traditional wisdom is that
coattails are not what they used to be,” said
Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, the chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Com-
mittee. Until the 19505, victorious presi-
dents often carried a tide of like-minded
legislators. In 1932 Franklin Roosevelt
helped elect 90 new Democratic congress-
men and 13 senators. But the arrival of tele-
vision and the growth of split-ticket voting
changed all that. In every presidential elec-
tion since 1956, there have been at least 114
congressional districts that voted for a presi-
dential candidate of one party and a House
member of another. True, the Republicans
did win 12 Senate seats in the 1980 Reagan
landslide. That helps explain why this year’s
lopsided presidential polls have produced a
new crop of jittery Democrats. “I’ve had
people who are going to win with over 60
percent of the vote tell me they are antsy,”
said Rep. Tony Coelho, who heads the
House Democratic campaign committee.
Both vice presidential candidates spent
the week practicing coattail politics. In Chi-
cago, Ferraro managed to bring together
Mayor Harold Washington and archrival
Alderman Edward Vrdolyak in an unprec-
edented unity pose. The momentary rap-
prochement was less a tribute to Ferraro’s
skills as a negotiator than a grim recognition
by Washington and Vrdolyak that the en-
tire ticket may all hang together in Novem-
ber. “Punch Number 10,” was the battle cry
in Chicago—a reference to the ballot lever
for straight-ticket voting.
Vice President George Bush added a
hastily arranged pep rally for Massachusetts
Senate candidate Ray Shamie to his New
England itinerary. Shamie, an unabashed
Reagan clone, devastated moderate Elliot
(The Resume) Richardson in last week’s
GOP primary. “Today is Ray Shamie’s
day,” Bush declared. “Ray Shamie is a
staunch supporter of the president . . . and
Ronald Reagan stands with Ray Shamie.”
While underdog Shamie basked in the White
House glow, beleaguered lowa Sen. Roger
Jepsen demonstrated how to lose points dur-
ing a visit from the president himself. Cam-
paigning with Reagan at a church picnic,
Jepsen gushed about how happy he was to be
in Cedar Rapids. One small problem: Jepsen
was in the nearby town of Fairfax —and
didn’t understand when the annoyed crowd
tried to correct him.
Although Mondale is not a divisive figure
like George McGovern, many Democratic
House incumbents are stressing their inde-
pendence from the national ticket. When


Mondale campaigned in Birmingham, Ala.,
last Friday, Democratic freshman Rep. Ben
Erdreich arranged to be on the House floor
in Washington. Few Democrats are more
adept at playing split-ticket politics than
California Rep. Jerry Patterson, who in
1980 ran 46,000 votes ahead of Jimmy Car-
ter in his Orange County district. Although
he briefly appeared with Ferraro last week,
Patterson is chary of her running mate.
“I’m not running on a Mondale-Patterson
ticket,” he said. “I’m not a Mondale clone.”
Single Issue: In contrast, Patterson’s op-
ponent —former Rep. Robert Dornan—is
holding onto Reagan’s coattails as if he were
a presidential valet. Dornan an enthusi-
astic endorsement from Reagan and the
former congressman’s bumper stickers
read, “Dornan + Reagan = Slope.” Still,
Dornan is realistic about the value of trickle-
down politics: “Coattails are like a single
issue, and no single issue is worth more than
2 percent.” Reagan strategists agree—they
rule out for now using the campaign to
maximize congressional victories.
Even though there arejust six weeks to go
before the real Super Tuesday, the polls are
likely to stay frozen until the meetings with
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
and the Oct. 7 debate. But if the president’s
lead holds up, the real question on Election
Day may be: will the voters reward Reagan
with an obstruction-proof Congress?
WALTER SHAPIRO with HOWARD FINEMAN and
GLORIA BORGER in Washington and bureau reports
Meese: ‘No Problems, E d'
Presidential counselor Edwin Meese 111
has long been known as No Problems
Ed for his serenity in the face of trou-
ble. Last week, after a 5 Vz -month investiga-
tion, an independent investigator appointed
to look into a number of charges against
him came to the same conclusion: no prob-
lems, Ed. Meese had been accused of every-
thing from obtaining federal
jobs for people who loaned
him money to illegally keep-
ing a pair of cuff links given
to him by the South Korean
government. And he sighed re-
lief as the contents of Jacob
Stein’s 385-page report became
known. The investigation, he
said, “was essential, for it af-
firmed what my family and I
have always known —that we
have paid our debts with
our own money and that we
have never taken advantage of
official position to obtain private gain.”
If Ronald Reagan wins re-election and
the Republicans maintain control of the
Senate, Stein’s report will probably jump-
start Meese’s long-stalled confirmation as
attorney general. No evidence was found,
said the investigator, that U.S. Postal Serv-
ice Gov. John McKean got his job because
of an unsecured $60,000 loan he had earlier
Exonerated: Relief
KARL SCHUMACHER
given Meese. Questions concerning inter-
est-free loans to Meese’s wife, the purloined
Carter debate briefing papers and eight oth-
er areas of inquest were also deemed unwor-
thy of prosecution. Stein repelled pressure
from Senate Democrats and Meese’s lawyer
for an ethics judgment by stressing that
illegalities, not ethical niceties, were the
focus of his search. “I submit
no comment,” he wrote, “on
the propriety of [Meese’s]
conduct.”
Contradictions? Meese’s crit-
ics, however, were not so cir-
cumspect. Ohio Democratic
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
who pushed hardest of all for
the investigation, said the find-
ings were “replete with contra-
dictory statements,” and con-
tinued his assault upon Meese’s
fitness for attorney general.
And a fuzzy photograph pur-
portedly showing Meese in possession of
Jimmy Carter’s debate briefing books—a
picture the investigators had ruled incon-
clusive—was making the Washington
rounds. But it was clear that another of the
president’s men had come out on top. “I
know [Meese] will be a truly distinguished
attorney general,” said Reagan after the
findings were announced.
The Heckling Squads
Placards at the ready, they show up almost everywhere that
Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro appear in public—
chanting, heckling, jostling for position when the television
cameras pan the crowd. Many are anti-abortion activists, others
are college-age conservatives—and recently, they have tested the
poise and patience of the Democratic nominees day after day.
In Arlington, Texas, last week, Ferraro confronted a noisy
group of about 500 hecklers with feisty wit: “If I had a record like
Ronald Reagan’s, I wouldn’t want anybody to hear about it
either.” And at the University of South-
ern California campus, where his speech
was disrupted repeatedly by boisterous
demonstrators, Mondale lashed out in
anger. “What a spectacle this is,” he
complained. “They’ve got a Republican
Party spending three times as much as we
... a president who is running all over
this country and not answering a single
question . . . and that’s not enough.
They’ve got to bring in a couple of kids
here to heckle us, try to prevent us from
being heard. They ought to be ashamed.”
Tricks: To the frustrated Mondale, the
heckling smacked of dirty tricks. At
USC, he compared his tormentors to
Donald Segretti, Richard Nixon’s chief
trickster in 1972, and in Seattle the next
night, he continued to vent his frustra-
tion. “I have not done this to Mr. Reagan,
MIKE OKONIEWSKI —AP
New York protester: ‘What a spectacle ’
and if I thought anybody was doing this to him on [my] behalf. . .
I’d try to stop it,” Mondale said. Reagan also expressed his
disapproval. “Good Lord, no,” he said, asked if his supporters
had any role in organizing the hecklers haunting Mondale and
Ferraro. But there were reports that local Reagan-Bush organi-
zations were coaching hecklers, and Lyn Nofziger, a member of a
Reagan-Bush “truth squad” following the Mondale campaign,
indicated that the Reagan staff was urging supporters to tone it
down. “We feel frankly that it would be to the president’s
advantage if the American people get to listen to Mondale day in
and day out for the next 6Vi weeks,” he said dryly.
Reagan’s own campaign rallies have been remarkably free of
disruption—partly because the Secret
Service has carefully monitored the
crowds, and partly, it seems, because
Reagan’s handlers stage-manage his
outings with a careful eye to their image
for TV. But in Brattleboro, Vt., last
week, Vice President George Bush got a
taste of what Mondale and Ferraro have
been getting when his speech was dis-
rupted by a group of chanting peace
activists. Afterward, Bush suggested
that the demonstrators who had inter-
rupted his Vermont speech might have
been retaliating for the rough treatment
Mondale and Ferraro have received. He
may be right—and if the current compe-
tition in incivility continues, both sides
can look forward to a decidedly raucous
campaign.

Ali: ‘l’ll Whip This Thing'
PETE AXTHELM
Perhaps he made the first payment back
in Miami in 1964, when he outlasted a
fearsome Sonny Liston and left him sitting
in his corner in defeat. He paid again in 1967
before a Houston draft board when he re-
fused to be inducted into an army that was
fighting a war that he opposed. The result-
ing 3 Vi-year exile cost him his prime as a
fighter. When he returned, the marvelous
legs were slowed to mortal level, and the
price on his career was hiked again: as pretty
as he proclaimed his face to be, Muhammad
Ali had to stand close to his rivals and
absorb punches to survive.
He took the punches with grace and guile,
courage and style. He left a little of him-
self in New York and Zaire and Manila.
Throughout the often joyous journey, he
was not only a symbol, but a prism through
which a generation viewed its world. Those
of us who cheered him, despised him or
chronicled him all got to use him to further
our beliefs and dreams. He, in turn, exulted
in his ability to entertain and enrage. But
last week we outsiders could only watch
with sadness. It was Ali, now 42, who
checked into a New York hospital, brave as
always but blurred in speech and thought, to
pay again the price of fame.
Ali’s doctors emphasized that he was not
simply punch drunk. They mentioned Par-
kinson’s disease, then settled on Parkin-
son’s syndrome, a collection of symptoms
similar but not identical to the disease.
The signs had long been familiar to Mu-
hammad’s friends: slurred speech, shaking
hands and a remote and masklike face.
Sycophants: As long ago as 1978, when he
mustered all his ring genius to reclaim his
title from young Leon Spinks in New Or-
leans, friends begged him to quit. But pro-
moters knew that he could still make mil-
lions for them and for himself. Admirers
remembered what he meant to civil-rights
and antiwar movements, and hoped he
would stay on center stage. And the army of
sycophants that he bankrolled was always
there, ready to reassure him in unsteady
moments that whatever the doctors and
bleeding hearts said, he was the greatest.
The profiteers and camp followers, of
course, were never hit by the likes of Joe
Frazier and George Foreman. Ali took
those blows with an enduring nobility, as if
they would forge his character for still
greater missions: he would preach Islam
and peace, he would help youth—after the
Spinks fight, he even planned to start his
own United Nations. The grand schemes
seemed poignantly hollow last week when
he shambled listlessly into the hospital and
put on a brave front by performing a few
simple magic tricks for visitors.
The truth is that he was the greatest.
History may never determine if he was a
better fighter than Dempsey or Louis or a
few others. But no boxer ever dominated the
sports scene quite the way Muhammad did.
He could be puerile in his prefight rantings,
cruel in his taunting of poor overmatched
Floyd Patterson, hypocritical in the blatant
womanizing that served as counterpoint to
his high-toned religious lectures. But he was
always larger than the ring in which he
floated. He knew that, and he loved it. That
was why, long after he needed neither the
money nor the punishment, he insisted on
staying in the spotlight.
“The man who has no imagination stands
on the earth,” Ali once said. “He has no
wings, he cannot fly.” He was speaking
before the “Thrilla in Manila” in 1975,
and his lofty imagery and gutter taunting
prompted his noble foe Joe Frazier toward
equal, if more earthy eloquence: “I want to
Ali entering hospital: What price glory?
WILLIAM LAFORCE JR—DAILY NEWS
hit him, step away and watch him hurt,”
said Joe. “I want his heart.”
Both men gave their hearts in that fight.
It ended after 14 gut-wrenching rounds.
Frazier, who couldn’t see, pleaded with his
handlers to let him go on. Ali, in victory,
likened the experience to a glimpse at death.
In retrospect, it should have been the grand
finale. But this Greek tragedy was to go on.
Ali’s hubris was his imagination. He had to
keep flying on battered wings.
Loss: That led to the burlesque loss of the
title to Spinks, the cunning reclamation, the
pitiable comeback against Larry Holmes.
Belated retirement didn’t lower the price
that had been paid. “At the Olympics in Los
Angeles, there were thousands chanting,
‘Ali! Ali!’ —and he didn’t even smile,” says
Dr. Max Novich, medical director of the
National Boxing Safety Center. ABC pro-
ducer Peter Bonventre experienced an even
sadder moment at those Olympics. As a
Newsweek writer, Bonventre had once
spent weeks traveling the globe with Ali;
Muhammad had occasionally burst into
Bonventre’s room in the early hours of the
morning to discuss everything from good-
looking women to the possibility of life on
Mars. Bonventre met the champ again in
Los Angeles. Ali didn’t recognize him.
At one impromptu press conference in
the hospital last week, Muhammad tried
gamely to recall the old faces and bring back
the old banter. “I’m not suffering,” he said.
“I just always feel tired.” In little more than
a whisper, he added, “I’m ready to meet
Allah.” But moments later he rallied again:
“I’ll whip this thing. I’ll whip it!”
The Rev. Jesse Jackson flew in to support
Ali the next day, and when the old champ
left the hospital, both the famous and the
unknown gave him their thoughts and pray-
ers. But even the somewhat reassuring
words of Ali’s doctor bore a tinge of unin-
tended irony. “We expect him to respond to
medication,” said Dr. Stanley Fahn, “and
lead a normal life.” This is a man who has
always traded normal life for principle and
religion, ego and vision. Let him be normal
medically. Emotionally, let him live on ac-
cording to the epitaph he wrote for himself
long ago, the one that perhaps sums up his
tumultuous journey across our conscious-
ness: “When you can whip any man in the
world, you never know peace.”


HOW THE AGUSTA GROUP MAKES
The A 129 Mongoose pictured below is the most advanced
helicopter in its class in the world today. It is also the first
specialised defence helicopter produced in Europe. And it
was conceived, designed and built by Agusta Group tech-
nology.
Producing a helicopter like the A 129 demands immense
technological know-how. But the Agusta Group has some
impressive resources to call on. Avast organisation of scien-
tists and technicians devoted exclusively to research and
development. And a massive fund of expertise that covers
the whole field of aeronautics. From Agusta’s Helicopter
Division, through its Airplanes Division to its Systems Divi-
sion.

nology in action. In terms of advanced systems: the A 129 is
the first helicopter to use an Integrated Multiplexing
System. This monitors and controls the Al29’s mechanical,
electrical, electronic and warfare systems, managing auto-
matically all flight and mission functions.
In terms of new materials: the A 129 makes extensive use of
advanced composites, developed and produced by the
Agusta Group at its own new plant in Anagni.
In terms of survivability: because this factor is so vital for a
dedicated helicopter, advanced technology has been
applied to this end in key areas (rotors, transmission, fusel-
age, flight controls).
In terms of day/night capability: the A 129 incorporates ad-
vanced infra-red systems allowing round-the-clock combat
readiness even in bad weather or low visibility.
These are just a few examples of the advanced technology
that went into the making of the A 129. There are many
more. And the kind of technological breakthroughs that
make the Al 2 9 the formidable defence helicopter it is find,
thanks to the Agusta Group structure, applications in many
other sectors, both military and civil.

More Madness
In Bloody Beirut
Another suicide attack by Islamic terrorists raises
questions about U.S. diplomatic security in Lebanon.
GEORGE SEMERJIAN
The East Beirut annex after the blast: A nightmare of bodies and debris
Rescue workers treating an injured Marine:
It was just before noon in East Beirut. At
the U.S. Embassy annex, Lebanese civil-
ians lined up for visas, and diplomats made
their morning rounds. Suddenly a Chevrolet
station wagon raced through a checkpoint of
concrete blocks 150 yards from the yellow
stone building. Lebanese security guards
opened fire, but the car sped past the gate.
Inside, a British diplomatic bodyguard
parked in a Land Rover pumped five M-16
rounds at the runaway. The driver slumped
forward and the wagon veered sideways.
Then it hit a parked car and exploded with
the force of 385 pounds of TNT. “I heard
shooting and saw skid marks,” said U.S.
Marine Cpl. Larry Gill, who was outside the
annex. “Then all the lights went out.”
With the power of a recurring nightmare,
the suicide strike in Beirut last week recalled
the bloody Marine massacre and the bomb-
ing of the U.S. Embassy in West Beirut. This
time, 12 were found dead —including 2 U.S.
servicemen, 6 Lebanese embassy employees
and at least 4 civilians visiting the annex —
with 60 wounded. A call to a French news
agency said the attack had been carried out
by Islamic Jihad, the same shadowy band of
pro-Iranian fanatics that claimed responsi-
bility for last year’s bombings. The group
had vowed revenge after the United States
vetoed a recent United Nations Security

Council resolution condemning Israel’s oc-
cupation of southern Lebanon. But a spokes-
man for the suicide bombers made it clear
they also had a larger aim: to drive all Ameri-
cans out of Lebanon.
Options: For Ronald Reagan, the bomb-
ing revived a political problem that he had
hoped to put behind him by pulling the
Marines out of Beirut. Awakened at 5:55
a.m. with news of the blast, the president
held an emergency briefing for reporters
before leaving on a campaign swing through
the farm belt. He said security at the annex
had been adequate, and denied that the at-
tack dramatized the failure of his Lebanon
policy. He also insisted there was little he
could do to prevent kamikaze strikes on U.S.
diplomats. “We can’t . . . crawl in a hole
someplace and stop performing,” he said.
Other U.S. officials agreed that the adminis-
tration had no easy options: the Islamic
Jihad offered no clear targets for retaliation.
And withdrawing all American personnel
from Beirut would make it appear the Unit-
ed States was knuckling under to terrorists.
Still, the president faced some stiff criti-
cism after the bombing—particularly over
security at the shattered embassy annex.
During a campaign stop in Birmingham,
Ala., Walter Mondale faulted the adminis-
tration for moving U.S. diplomats to East
Beirut before precautionary reinforcements
were complete; he also asked why Marines
had been taken off the embassy checkpoints
and replaced with U.S.-trained Lebanese
guards. “The American people now must
have answers to some very basic questions,”
the Democratic challenger said. On Capitol
Hill, House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip)
O’Neill promised that the House Intelli-
gence Committee would investigate the
bombing. And Charles
Percy, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, an-
nounced plans to take a
panel to Beirut to look
into the security issue.
Of all the questions,
the most disturbing was
why the Americans had
been moved to East Bei-
rut when, as State
Department spokesman
John Hughes put it, the
security improvements
at the annex were only
“75 percent” complete.
After the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in 1983,
most of the Americans
moved to the British Em-
bassy in West Beirut. In July, when all but
two or three moved to East Beirut, security
officers did put up two checkpoints in front
of the annex. They also erected concrete
blocks between the checkpoints and the
gates to slow down approaching cars. But by
last week, engineers had yet to construct a
steel gate that was supposed to go alongside
the concrete blocks, or to activate television
scanners on the rooftop of the annex.
In July, U.S. officials also decided to with-
draw 90 Marines previously assigned to the
mission and to replace them with only 14
servicemen and a contingent of American-
trained Lebanese guards. Officials said they
took the step because they believed East
Beirut was safe, but critics charged the
administration simply wanted to eliminate
the chance that any more Marines might
be killed during the fall campaign. After
the attack, State and Defense Department
sources each claimed that the other depart-
ment had made the decision to draw down
the troops. But White House spokesman
Larry Speakes insisted the move had been “a
collective government decision. ”
Warning: Another question was why se-
curity was not stepped up after the Islamic
Jihad threatened to launch a new strike three
weeks ago. On Sept. 6 the U.N. Security
Council voted on a resolution calling on
Jerusalem to lift restrictions on civilians in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. The
United States vetoed it, and on Sept. 8 a
caller phoned a Beirut news , agency and
warned that the Islamic Jihad would launch
an attack in retaliation. Based on that call,
officials in Washington did send out an alert
to all U.S. facilities in the Middle East. But
apparently the warning produced no specif-
ic new precautions—only what Hughes last
week called “increased vigilance.”
There were other signs that the Ameri-
cans had let down their guard in East Beirut.
Their new location, in the suburb of Aukar,
was a far cry from the bombed-out battle
zone of West Beirut. It was lined with trees
and tastefully decorated villas. The annex
itself stood on a hillside with a spectacular
view of the Mediterranean. In the days be-

Sifting through the rubble: Adding to an appalling toll


BOB CONRAD, MARTA NORMAN— NEWSWEEK
fore the blast, diplomats told reporters
they felt comfortable in their new sur-
roundings and had no fear, for example, of
going out to restaurants in East Beirut.
Local residents were not so complacent:
they wrote a letter to the mission warning
of safety problems. But they said officials
at the annex refused to accept it. “We had
been dreading that something like this
would happen since the Americans moved
here,” said Dr. Phillip Souhaid, 28, a den-
tist whose home was damaged in the blast.
Accounts: Whether any of the precau-
tions that could have been taken would
have prevented last week’s attack was an
open question. It began at approximately
11:40 a.m., when the Chevrolet wagon
approached the northernmost of the two
annex checkpoints. According to various
accounts, the vehicle may or may not have
had Dutch diplomatic license plates. It
stopped when it neared the checkpoint but,
when questioned by Lebanese guards, the
driver shot one of the interrogators and
sped into the embassy grounds followed by
a hail of fire. It was a security officer
assigned to guard British Ambassador Da-
vid Meirs who managed to hit the driver,
forcing him off course. The terrorist had
evidently planned to crash into a garage
beneath the annex and bring the building
down on top of him.
Instead, the car bomb went off about 10
yards from the annex. It blew a crater eight
feet deep in the road and shattered windows
within a radius of half a mile. When the
smoke cleared, dozens of victims lay scat-
tered in the rubble. A rescue team of U.S.
Marines, Red Cross workers, Lebanese
Army troops and Christian militamen even-
tually found 12 dead. The two Americans
were Army Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth
V. Welch, 33, of Grand Rapids, Mich., and
Navy Petty Officer 1/c Michael Ray Wag-
ner, 30, of Zebulon, N.C.; both had been
assigned to the defense attache’s office.
At the ambassador’s office on the fourth
floor the British envoy, Meirs, was paying a
courtesy call on his American counterpart,
Reginald Bartholomew. Meirs had just
stood up to say goodbye when the car bomb
exploded. The blast threw Bartholomew,

JAMES PRINGLE— NEWSWEEK
who was still seated, onto the ground. A
shower of concrete fell on top of him, but he
was saved by a sofa that shielded his body.
Bartholomew was taken to the hospital,
where he placed a call to Washington and
talked with Secretary of State George
Shultz. A day later he was released and
driven under heavy guard to his residence at
Yarzie, above Beirut. With much of the
annex in ruins, most of the rest of the U.S.
mission also decamped to the ambassador’s
residence.
Task Force: In Washington, Reagan offi-
cials did their best to play down the crisis.
When word of the bombing reached the
State Department, both the president and
Shultz were called immediately. Shultz
rushed to the State Department to set up a
special task force to monitor the situation;
he also ordered a support team to leave for
Beirut to assist Bartholomew. Reagan got a
lengthy briefing from aides. But his aides
decided against cancelling his trip to the
Midwest, and he limited his immediate re-
action to the briefing on the South Lawn.
Almost everyone in the administration
appeared to oppose the option of retaliating
against the suicide bombers. The Israelis
had set one sort of standard for such cases in
American victims Wagner, Welch
the Middle East, striking back whenever
they are hit and applying rather broad guide-
lines for their targets. But no one in the
administration was confident about where
to strike back. According to American intel-
ligence reports, Islamic
Jihad is no more than a
nom de guerre used by
a scattered collection
of Lebanese Muslim fun-
damentalists. “This is
not an organization that
comes from one village,
or has a command post or
a leadership structure,”
said one Pentagon ana-
lyst. “There isn’t any-
thing to direct an air
strike against or drop
commandos on.”
Whoever they are, the
suicide bombers most
likely receive financial
and logistical support


from Iran and Syria. But
officials worried that any
strike on. Teheran or Da-
mascus would only endan-
ger innocent civilians—and
provoke the terrorists into
more acts of violence. The
president also had to weigh
the political consequences
of retaliation. With a com-
fortable lead in the polls, he
had considerable room for
maneuver. But no one want-
ed to risk the fiasco of a
revenge strike that might
only add even more Ameri-
can casualties to an already
appalling toll.
There were several other
possibilities for action. One
was to reduce the size of the
mission in Beirut. But at the
time of the latest attack,
the size of the contingent
was going up, not down. De-
pendents withdrawn earlier
were beginning to filter
back. And the main re-
sponse to yet another suicide
assault was a courageous,
but perhaps foolhardy, stiff
upper lip. Administration
spokesmen argued that re-
ducing the American con-
tingent would mean ef-
fectively abandoning the
U.S. presence in Lebanon —and giving the
terrorists what they want. They stressed that
the Marines withdrawn from Beirut earlier
this year had gone to Lebanon on a tempo-
rary “peacekeeping” mission. The diplo-
mats, on the other hand, had agreed to
certain risks when they took their jobs.
Vulnerability: The more relevant issue
was whether enough was being done to cut
those risks. Some critics argued that double
security gates should be installed at all Bei-
rut embassy buildings; others favored a
corps of fast-acting, counterterror guards
better equipped to stop groups
likelslamic Jihad. In theshort
term, however, all the diplo-
mats planned was a move
back to the vulnerable embas-
sy in West Beirut. The quar-
ters there stand beside an open
tennis court and soccer field; a
ridge topped with tall apart-
ment buildings overlooks the
site, easy turf for experienced
terrorists. U.S. officials point-
ed out for the umpteenth time
that no precautions could
serve as an absolute guarantee
against terrorists willing to sacrifice their
lives in suicide attacks. But the argument
was beginning to sound a little hollow.
Given his determination to stand pat in
Lebanon, Reagan did what he could to turn
the decision to his political advantage. He
spent most of his trip to the Midwest explain-

AP
Picking up the pieces: Except for the deadly aim of a British guard, it might have been worse
ing why the United States could not pull its
diplomats out of Beirut. “We can’t with-
draw in the face of this kind of terrorism,”
he told flag-waving supporters in Cedar
Rapids, Mich. The crowds in lowa and
Michigan seemed smaller and less enthusi-
astic than others Reagan has drawn in recent
weeks, but that may have had less to do with
Lebanon than with the coolness of farmers
toward candidates from both parties.
Before the details of the Beirut attack were
fully known, the Democratic candidates
treated it with circumspection. Campaign-
ing in Dallas, Geraldine Fer-
raro stressed the right of the
United States to have and pro-
tect embassies abroad; she
also voiced support for the
U.N. Security Council veto
that had apparently provoked
the car bombing. Mondale,
meanwhile, spent the first 24
hours after the bombing re-
viewing news accounts and
talking to foreign-policy ana-
lysts and friends on Capitol
Hill to get a better picture
of what had happened —and
whether he could usefully attack the presi-
dent over the bombing.
A day after the attack, Mondale went on
the offensive. He called an unscheduled
press conference at the Hyatt hotel in Bir-
mingham to make his criticisms about secu-
rity at the embassy annex; in particular, he
questioned whether the administration had
paid sufficient heed to the findings of the
Long Commission investigation into securi-
ty lapses at the Marine compound last year.
But even as Mondale spoke, the Reagan
forces moved to undercut his message. Presi-
dential campaign aide Lyn Nofziger flew to
Alabama and held his own news conference
down the hall from Mondale at the Hyatt
Birmingham. Nofziger did not answer any
of Mondale’s specific charges but suggested
that the challenger’s decision to criticize the
president on the sensitive issue of terrorism
was a sign of “desperation.”
Reminder: For the moment, the odds
were that the Beirut bombing would not hurt
Reagan significantly. It did give the Demo-
crats a chance to recall the overall failure of
Reagan’s Lebanon policy; but Mondale had
to be careful about that issue, since he was an
early supporter of the Marine mission.
Whether out of cynicism or realism, voters
were also unlikely to be swayed by the deaths
of two more Americans in Lebanon. The
danger was not over, however, especially
given the plans to move the American diplo-
mats back to West Beirut. And with one
blow, the latest atrocity reminded everyone
of how vulnerable Americans remain in
Lebanon —and how easily a larger foreign-
policy disaster could still slow down the
president’s re-election bandwagon.

LIBYA
Kaddafi: A Change of Heart?
RANCINAN— SYGMA
Mitterrand and Hassan, Foreign Legionnaires near Ndjamena: Morocco’s ‘union’with Libya paved the way fora troop withdrawal in Chad
Was Muammar Kaddafi actually mel-
lowing—or was it just another pass-
ing mood? A few weeks ago the radical
Libyan leader stunned East and West alike
by agreeing to “unite” his country with
staunchly pro-Western Morocco. Then last
week he concluded an agreement with
France: both nations would simultaneously
withdrawtheirforcesfromstrife-tornChad.
Across Africa and the Middle East, moder-
ates hoped that the two moves were signs
that the region’s biggest troublemaker had
suddenly decided to quiet down. But skepti-
cal Kaddafi-watchers everywhere could
only wonder whether the mercurial strong-
man would stick with his nice-guy course for
very long.
There were several expla-
nations for Kaddafi’s at-
tempts to make up with his
erstwhile enemies. His ad-
venture in Chad had turned
intoastalemate. After Libya
sent troops to back a rebel-
lion in the former French
colony 13 months ago,
President Franqois Mitter-
rand countered by dispatch-
ing 3,000 soldiers to aid
Chad’s government. “Con-
trary to what people think,
Kaddafi is a pragmatic
man,” said one top French
official. “The military op-
tion in Chad proved
unworkable . . . and the [re-
bellion] was falling apart.”
Kaddafi also had prob-
lems at home. The Libyan
economy was foundering,
mainly because a worldwide
decrease in oil consumption
Kaddafi: A pacific mood
ARAL—SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
had drastically reduced the nation’s rev-
enues. Under the circumstances, Western
analysts say, many Libyans started to object
to Kaddafi’s costly scheme in Chad. Domes-
tic unrest came to a climax last May when a
band of militants stormed the leader’s head-
quartersinTripoli.Thecoupattemptfailed,
but it may have provoked Kaddafi’s latest
efforts to placate his neighbors so that he
could turn to shoring up his power at home,
Quid Pro Quo: Fortunately for Kaddafi,
one of his neighbors was eager to help. King
Hassan II of Morocco sensed that Kaddafi’s
difficulties could be turned to Morocco’s
diplomatic advantage. Libya has long
backed the Polisario guerrilla movement,
which threatens Morocco’s
hold on a stretch of territory
in the western Sahara. In a
daring move, Hassan sug-
gested a new Libyan-Mor-
occan “union” —an exag-
gerated notion probably
designed to play to Kadda-
fi’s old dreams of pan-Arab
unity. One of the main con-
ditions of the pact was that
Libya would quit arming
the Polisario. In return,
Hassan apparently pledged
to help Kaddafi improve his
relations with the West.
Reagan administration
officials reacted unfavor-
ably to the pact; they
seemed perturbed by Has-
san’s courtship of a leader
they had worked so hard to
isolate. But the king stuck to
his course, confident that
the Americans wouldn’t
abandon him. “Hassan says
. . . that the bottom line is that he sits on the
most strategic straits in the world,” said one
senior Western diplomat in Morocco. “And
there’s no way we would pull the rug out
from under him.”
The king now firmly believes that his
gamble is paying off. Moroccan officials
insist that Libya’s new agreement with
France is a direct outgrowth of the Libyan-
Moroccan union. France and Libya had
tried to negotiate over Chad, but the talks
kept breaking down. Shortly after Morocco
and Libya signed their treaty, however,
Mitterrand suddenly flew to Morocco for
private talks with Hassan. Then two weeks
ago, French Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson flew to Tripoli for two days of
private talks with Kaddafi. By early last
week, the accord had been hammered out,
with both sides agreeing to a “total and
simultaneous” withdrawal of troops start-
ing this week and ending late next month.
“We are people who respect our agree-
ments,” Kaddafi said afterwards in an inter-
view on French television. He added that
the disengagement of forces in Chad would
be a “prelude to a new era of cooperation
between Chad and its neighbors.”
Suspect: However encouraging that
sounded, American diplomats still weren’t
rushing out to embrace Kaddafi. “Kaddafi
is looking to attain some vestige of interna-
tional respectability,” says one State De-
partment official. “But it’s not necessarily a
change in his goals.” He remains a prime
suspect in a wide range of recent plots, from
the mining of the Red Sea to a new scheme
by Libyan pilgrims to take over the Grand
Mosque in Saudi Arabia. Still, the latest
diplomatic initiatives may be a step in the
right direction. Even if Kaddafi’s pacific
mood eventually blows over, for the mo-
ment, at least, his peace pacts could help
reduce the danger level across the region.

Taking technology
<c


step at a time.
Technology is just another word for tools.
A ladder and a silicon memory chip are equally
elegant illustrations of what that means. They allow people
to do work that might otherwise be beyond their reach.
IBM is in the business of improving tools (though we
do spend more time on memory chips than on ladders).
Our million-bit chip has the largest capacity ever
produced on an existing manufacturing line. We
developed disk and tape drives for transferring data at a
record rate of three million characters per second. The
electronic packaging in our largest computers is the
densest in the industry.
That IBM can claim these individual accomplishments
is really not the point. New records are set all the
time in our industry and we expect to continue setting
them ourselves.
But there is a message in them.
It’s a message about a company’s resolve and its
ability to recognize what kinds of tools you need.
Resolve means having the right people and giving
them the right kind of support.
Resolve also means committing to the tough business
of technology: exploring promising but uncertain ideas,
pursuing flashes of insight but never straying from
the certain rewards of improving tools one step at a time.
Recognizing the kinds of tools you need means
understanding the kind of work you do. That’s true whether
our tools serve you, your company or your country.
If you’re looking for a company that will provide the
technology you need when you need it, you can look at the
records we’ve set today.
But you might also look at the IBM record itself. It’s
an unparalleled display of the tools you’ve needed.

SOUTH AFRICA
A Costly Victory at the Mines
Prime Minister P. W. Botha strove to
strike a note of optimism last week as
he opened the first South African Parlia-
ment to seat Indian'and Colored legislators.
“Our gathering today,” he said, “indicates a
continuation along the road we took to cre-
ate a community of peace, prosperity and
justice.” But even as Botha spoke in Cape
Town, his rosy vision was shattered by a
new burst of violence outside Johannes-
burg. Thousands of black gold miners had
walked off the job demanding pay increases.
When they attempted to confront mine offi-
cials, police unleashed a spray of tear gas
and rubber bullets. Within 24 hours, mine
bosses and leaders of the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM) reached agreement
on a 16 percent salary hike for the
black miners. But the victory was
tinged with sorrow: 9 strikers were
killed and 600 injured.
Still, the gold-mine accord was
a milestone in the history of
South African industrial rela-
tions. The two-year-old NUM,
which represents not quite 7 per-
cent of the country’s 460,000
black miners, successfully called
its first legal strike and proved
that at least some mining compa-
nies acknowledge its clout in the
mines. Edward Gush, chairman
of the gold and uranium division
of the Anglo American Corp.,
which owns seven of the eight
mines covered by the accord,
hailed the resolution of the strike
as “a victory for responsible col-
lective bargaining.”
Defiance: The miners’ strike
was just one indication of a mount-
ing spirit of defiance in South Afri-
ca. The latest round in the chal-
lenge to apartheid began a month
ago when black leaders engineered
a largely successful boycott of the
elections to the country’s new
three-chamber Parliament. In the following
weeks, more than half a million black stu-
dents boycotted classes to protest inequities
in the educational system, black tenants in
Sharpeville staged violent demonstrations
against municipal rent hikes and black
mourners braved police whips and tear gas
to commemorate the seventh anniversary of
black leader Steve Biko’s death while in
police custody. Last week residents of
Soweto stoned buses and cars and set up
roadblocks to press their demands for the
release of Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s
top black leader, who is serving a life sen-
tence for treason.
Although the riots in Soweto and other
townships quieted by the end of last week,
the threat of further civil unrest remains. At
several of the 26 mines where the NUM has
not yet achieved recognition, wildcat strikes
persisted for days after the union and mine
owners reached agreement. More than
16,000 black miners were finally forced to
abandon their protest action when mine
owners threatened to fire them,
Fierce resentment over chronic unem-
ployment and a system that refuses to
grant some 18 million blacks a political
voice has been sharpened by the swift and
sometimes ruthless police reaction to civil
disturbances. Over the last month at least
900 blacks have been injured in the con-
frontations with police troops, 56 blacks
have been killed and several black political
leaders have been arrested and placed in
detention. “There is an undercurrent of
CLIVE LLOYD
An injured miner: Challenging apartheid
tension that won’t go away,” warned a
British diplomat in Cape Town.
The negotiated settlement at the gold
mines probably won’t change that. By dem-
onstrating that a threat to close down the
mines—which produce half of South Afri-
ca’s export earnings—can bring white mine
owners to the bargaining table, the accord
gave black workers a new sense of hope.
And since most black miners still earn less
than a third of the salary paid to most white
miners, it seems certain that the black min-
ers will continue to press their demands.
But as blacks try to use their industrial clout
to obtain higher wages, they may also have
to pay the steep price of additional
bloodshed.

“AND THEY
SAID IT COULDN’T
BE DONE...”
Anyone who has been involved in making investment
decisions on the development and marketing of oil and gas
will be familiar with the cynics saying “it can’t be done.”
You need quality technical and economic studies to
prove them wrong. You need them fast, and you need them
at low cost.
There is a way.
In as little as two days, and for as little as $l5OO, Williams
Brothers Consultative Services can deliver a computer-
generated mini-report which tells you everything you need
to get started. Things like:—
□ The capital works required to recover, gather, treat and
transport oil and gas to a market place.
□ A capital cost estimate to install these facilities.
□ A cost estimate showing the expected operating costs for
the above facilities.
□ An economic analysis of the project showing sensitivity
to cost of services, oil and gas selling prices, etc.
How? By drawing on our vast pool of information and
experience...accumulated over 13 years of involvement in all
the major gas and oil development projects in Australia.
Next time you’re plagued by the it-can’t-be-done
brigade, call Williams Brothers.
It can be done. And we’ll give you the figures to prove it.

The Unstoppable Dollar
Charting the dollar, trading in Paris: ‘When everyone’s convinced that the market can only go up, it usually turns down ’
UPI
The currency’s rise reflects a worldwide sense of confidence in the U.S. economy.
It may prove to be the longest-running
mystery of modern financial times: Why
on Earth Does the Dollar Keep Soaring?
Despite huge deficits in America’s balance
of payments, the dollar keeps smashing all
its old records. Last week, it hit all-time
highs against the British pound and the
French franc, set a 10-year record against
the German mark and a seven-year record
against the Swiss franc. On Friday, heavy
dollar-selling by the West German central
bank caused a sharp drop in its value, but
that may well be no more than a pause.
Exuberant currency traders predicted that
the rally would continue well into next year,
not stopping, said one, until the
dollar is worth 11 French francs,
up from last week’s already hard-
to-believe level of 9.59 to the buck.
The spiraling greenback has
confounded repeated forecasts
that it was cruising for a fall. For
months, the experts had argued
that the dollar’s strength was a
reflection of high American inter-
est rates, brought about by the
heavy Treasury borrowings need-
ed to cover the federal budget defi-
cit. Enticed by these high returns,
foreign investors bought up dol-
lars by the billions so that they
could buy Treasury securities. But
when interests rates eased recent-
ly, the dollar got even stronger.
Now many economists and trad-
ers think the currency is being pushed up by
what amounts to a worldwide vote of confi-
dence in the American economy.
The United States continues to boom,
they say, and can support annual rates of
real economic growth of about 4 percent for
months to come. Just as important, the real
rate of return on American investments has
been higher than anticipated—because in-
flation has not reasserted itself, as it usually
does this far into a recovery. In fact, the
Commerce Department indicated last week
that the inflation rate in the third quarter
may actually fall below the 3.3 percent rate
of the second quarter, making the outlook
Airbus celebrates a contract: A boom for Europe’s exports
REBOURS —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
for American investments still more attrac-
tive. By contrast, slower-growing European
economies don’t offer comparably high re-
turns and Fortress Japan remains all but
closed to foreign investors. Says Allen
Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon
University: “We’re simply far and away the
place to . . . invest in for the time being.”
Trade-Offs: On balance the superstrong
dollar has been a boon for the United States.
It has reinforced the disinflationary trend by
reducing the price of imported raw materials
and has helped keep domestic producers
honest by making the prices of finished im-
ported goods cheap. And it has made vaca-
tion jaunts to Paris and Rome ex-
traordinarily inexpensive. There
have been trade-offs, of course. Ex-
port-oriented U.S. firms have lost
sales overseas because of the dol-
lar’s strength and have had to lay
off workers, as did industries like
steel, shoes and textiles that were
hurt by low-priced imports. But
most economists say that jobs cre-
ated by new import activities have
made the job front a net plus for
Americans.
America’s trading partners
might be expected to feel the oppo-
site effect, but that has not been
entirely the case. Some Europeans
complain that the high interest
rates supporting the dollar have
bled investment capital from their


economies, and many worry that the rising
cost of imports will add to Europe’s infla-
tion. But most countries have decided to
stop complaining and to enjoy the surge in
export possibilities. The high-valued dollar
has helped France increase its sales of high-
fashion apparel, wine, aluminum and auto
parts in the United States. And Europe
celebrated ecstatically recently when its
Airbus Industrie won an important jumbo-
jet contract from Pan American World Air-
ways. The export boom has become so pow-
erful, in fact, that economists on both sides
of the Atlantic believe that the decades-old
U.S. trade surplus with Europe will soon be
decisively reversed. Two years ago, Ameri-
can exporters outsold the Europeans by
some $4.1 billion; this year, that margin will
favor Europe by an estimated $l4 billion.
Mild Retreat: No one knows how long the
dollar can continue to rise. Even revisionist
economists like Meltzer say the U.S. cur-
rency is overvalued; he estimates that in the
months ahead it will decline about 10 to 15
percent from its current level. In this sce-
nario, the president and Congress would
move to reduce the budget deficit next year,
leading to a gentle decline in interest rates.
With the European economies doing rela-
tively better then, more European investors
would keep their money home —and the
dollar would stage an orderly and compara-
tively mild retreat. But there are still many
conventional theorists around, including
some of the top strategists at the Federal
Reserve Board, who think that such a “soft
landing” for the dollar grows more unlikely
with each rally of the greenback.
This school maintains that the United
States simply can’t go on indefinitely selling
its securities to foreigners, in effect borrow-
ing massive amounts overseas. Stephen
Marris of the Institute for International
Economics points out that, by next year,
America will have more foreign debt than
Brazil and that it would add as much as
$B5O billion to its current total by 1990.
When foreign investors become fully aware
of these rising obligations, their confidence
could vanish overnight, says Marris, and
they would begin to pull their capital out of
the U.S. “There’s no question that the dol-
lar is riding to a fall,” he says.
Marris may be right—but perhaps for the
wrong reasons. The dollar’s lengthy climb
has been in large part psychological and the
greenback may eventually decline as irra-
tionally as it has risen. “The dollar is com-
pletely captive of capital flows in the short
run —but the short run by definition doesn’t
last forever,” says a senior Federal Reserve
official. “It’s when everyone’s convinced
that a market can only go up, usually, that a
market finally turns down.” In light of the
dollar’s sudden downturn at the weekend,
that simple old contrarian view may be the
safest path for currency experts to follow.

Reagan’s Steel Quota Ploy
Unloading foreign steel: Saving an industry or playing election-year politics?
Ronald Reagan’s commitment to a free
marketplace has temporarily taken a
backseat to the expediencies of his re-elec-
tion campaign. Hoping to score a big politi-
cal bonus in the economically hard-pressed
Midwest, President Reagan has ordered
“voluntary” quotas that would slash for-
eign steel producers’ share of the American
market from the current high of 25 percent
to about 20 percent for the next five years.
The administration was quick to character-
ize the President’s action as a “trade liberal-
izing” act, but trade experts were equally
swift in labeling the move as unmistakably
protectionist.
The government’s invitation to foreign
steel producers to negotiate their own im-
port limitations is roughly the equivalent of
asking an Army private to “volunteer” for
kitchen duty. During the next 90 days, feder-
al officials will forge agreements with Japan,
South Korea, Brazil and other foreign sup-
pliers who have either been selling steel at
prices below those of U.S. producers or are
considered too restrictive in their own steel
import policies. Imported steel in Japan, for
example, accounts for only 5 percent of the
market, compared with 25 percent in Amer-
ica. Although quotas will vary depending on
each country’s share in the
American market, everyone
must cut back: those who refuse
could be punished by having to
pay higher tariffs on all their
exports to the United States.
Foreign manufacturers were
ready for the bad news. In an-
ticipation of a crackdown, Jap-
anese steelmakers have boosted
exports to the United States,
raising their share of the Ameri-
can market from 5.1 percent
Brock: ‘Achievable ’
BRUCE HOERTEL
last year to 6.5 percent today. Tokyo is
confident that it can preserve at least some of
that gain in the coming negotiations, and
other countries have struck a similarly opti-
mistic note. “It’s a lot better than it could
have been,” said a Brazilian steel official,
referring to the possibility that the White
House could have adopted the stiffer, man-
datory quotas sought by U.S. producers.
The key question for foreign steelmakers is
how tough the United States will actually be
in the talks. Last week U.S. Trade Repre-
sentative William Brock said that the ad-
ministration’s goal of limiting imports to
18.5 percent of the American market was
“achievable.”
Whether the Reagan plan will be enough
to save the critically ill U.S. steel industry is
uncertain. American mills are operating at
only 57 percent of capacity—and the coun-
try’s economic boom has not taken up the
slack. Steelmakers stand to reap billions in
profits from hefty price rises made possible
by the quotas, and they have informally
pledged to reinvest the windfall. But indus-
try analysts say this still won’t enable an
upgrading of obsolete plants or the offset-
ting of high labor costs. In fact, analysts
warn that higher steel prices will probably
further depress the market as
steel users switch to cheaper
materials, such as aluminum or
plastic. As a result, most of the
250,000 unemployed steel
workers have little hope of be-
ing called back soon. Not sur-
prisingly in an election year,
the one to benefit most from the
government’s helping hand
may be candidate Reagan.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Smart Thermostats: A Cool, and Warm, Idea
Higher energy costs have
forced many people to re-
strict the heating and cooling of
their homes. Many now set back
their thermostats at night and
shut off air conditioners when
they are out. Such frugality can
cause discomfort at times. Few
people enjoy waking up in a cold
room or coming home to a house
that is hot and close. Recently,
however, several firms have
introduced programmable ther-
mostats equipped with micro-
processors that could offer a cool
solution to a sticky problem.
Quad Six, Inc., of Ann Arbor,
Mich., has developed one of the
most sophisticated new thermostats. The Weather Wizard
allows users to program thermostats to adjust temperatures up
to six times a day at different intervals each day of the week.
The thermostat is equipped with a nine-volt battery that allows
it to be programmed before it is installed on the wall. Program
options appear on a liquid-crystal-display (LCD) screen. To
set a schedule, the user holds down a button marked “slow”
until a clock on the screen displays the desired time for the first
heating or cooling change. To set temperatures, the homeown-
The Weather Wizard: Programmable climate control
er holds down a button marked
either “heat” or “a/c” until the
desired temperature range is
indicated on the LCD. Once
the thermostat has been pro-
grammed, the user resets the
clock to the actual time.
Homeowners leaving on a
brief vacation can program the
Weather Wizard to maintain a
constant temperature for up to a
week and then return automati-
cally to any set point in the origi-
nal heating and cooling sched-
ule. The thermostat is adaptable
to any electrical system.
The Hunter Division of Rob-
bins and Myers, Inc., of Mem-
phis, Tenn., has designed a programmable thermostat that
looks like a pocket calculator. The Energy Monitor can be set
in advance to meet four designated temperatures on a five-day
schedule and two temperatures' for each day of the weekend. It
also keeps track of the amount of time a furnace or air condi-
tioner is turned on during a given day or week so that a user can
compare various programs against utility bills and choose the
one that yields the greatest energy savings. Both the Energy
Monitor and the Weather Wizard cost about $lOO.
Tropical Ice Skating
Skating without ice may seem as con-
trary to nature as sailing without wind or
stargazing at midday. Nonetheless, peo-
ple have tried for years to make this cold-
weather sport more accessible by con-
cocting artificial surfaces that mimic the
real thing. Early attempts were clumsy;
one inventor sought a U.S. patent in 1896
for a rink made of cardboard soaked with
wax. Other experimental sur-
faces lacked the right mix of re-
sistance and glide. Now a Mi-
ami, Fla., firm has developed a
plastic ice that some say is nearly
perfect, and could have enthusi-
asts even in tropical climes en-
joying this pastime all year.
Astro-Ice, manufactured by
Skate-USA, is made of an ultra-
high-density polymer resin that
is pressed into one-inch-thick
panels measuring 2 by 4 feet. The
panels are joined into a nearly
seamless surface by interlocking
Astro-Ice strips, and can be in-
stalled on any level surface. The
plastic is primed with a silicon-
based spray that conditions the
surface and reduces friction.
Still, Astro-Ice is slightly more resistant
than real ice, and has about nine-tenths of
its glide. According to the manufacturer,
the artificial ice doesn’t damage skate
blades, but they do need to be sharpened
more frequently. The ice is also quite
impervious to marks and scrapes, render-
ing it unusable in compulsory figure-
skating events, which require contest-
ants to trace out clearly visible shapes.
In some ways Astro-Ice may outper-
Skaters on Astro-Ice: Plastic with grip and glide
form the real thing; some ice dancers say
working against its grip makes them
stronger. Its main advantages, however,
are low cost and easy maintenance. As-
tro-Ice rinks don’t require the expensive,
energy-consuming equipment needed to
refrigerate, insulate, dehumidify and re-
surface artificial ice, and need only daily
vacuuming and thrice-weekly scrubs.
An Olympic-size Astro-Ice rink can be
installed for about $300,000, roughly
two-thirds the cost of a refriger-
ated rink of the same size, and
maintenance costs are one-tenth
as much.
Astro-Ice is easily taken down
and transported and can be set up
outdoors, provided it is shielded
with a tent; ultraviolet rays break
down the polymers in the resin.
Rinks equipped with Astro-Ice
have already been installed near
New York City and in Budapest,
and an international ice-dance
troupe is touring with Astro-Ice
equipment. Skate-USA plans to
market the ice worldwide and
expects strong demand in tropi-
cal countries.

For art’s sake.
Is photography becoming more technology
than art?
If so, the Hasselblad camera does not
want to join the trend. The technology of
the Hasselblad, advanced as it is, has one
purpose only: to be the photographer’s
servant, not his master.
To become the perfect servant, each
Hasselblad is built by hand. It spends a full
year in the factory before graduating.
This dedication to Art and Quality has
made it the faithful servant of astronauts on
the moon, as well as most great photogra-
phers here on earth.
The continuing technological develop-
ment of the Hasselblad is aimed at the Art
of Photography. Not the Art of pushing a
button.
It is not technology for technology’s
sake, but for Art’s sake.

The law
all at sea
over killing
WHEN the cook and chief
steward of the Hyundai II fell
out fatally somewhere on the
high seas between Samoa and
Hawaii on September 6, the
cook ended up in the brig and
the body of Yoon Kwang
Hyuk, 41, was stored tempor-
arily in the ship’s freezer.
But the arrival of the South
Korean boat at Brisbane 11
days later pointed to a serious
deficiency in Australia’s laws
dealing with such matters.
While Federal Police
waited a few days for Yoon’s
body to thaw before an autop-
sy could be performed, the al-
leged killer’s legal status was a
matter of great uncertainty.
Under the common-
wealth’s 1979 Crimes at Sea
Act, offences committed on
ships en route to Australia can
be tried in Australian courts
or in the ship’s country of reg-
istry. However, the Act de-
pends on a separate agree-
ment between Canberra and
the states allowing state police
and courts to take over inves-
tigations and trials. Queens-
land has yet to sign.
So, while the Hyundai II
swung at anchor in Moreton
Bay with the master anxious
to put the cook ashore for his
own safety, investigating
police faced not only a lan-
guage barrier but also a legal
maze.
Authorities in Seoul volun-
teered to take the cook out of
Australia’s hands but a further
complication arose with fed-
eral Attorney-General Gareth
Evans seeking assurances
from South Korea that no
death sentence would be
imposed.
Finally, the master’s pleas
were heeded and the cook was
ferried to Brisbane’s Boggo
Road jail on a charge of “be-
ing a person suspected of be-
ing likely to commit an immi-
gration offence.”
From Brisbane, the cook
was repatriated in the com-
pany of Qantas security offi-
cials last Friday.
Drummed out
of the force?
OF COURSE, the British
police are a model of propri-
ety and politeness when it
comes to confrontations with
the massed ranks of militant
striking miners. Nevertheless,
some occasional falls from
grace do crop up as this
item from the front line sug-
gests: PIT POLICE BAN
ZULU DRUMMING.
South Yorkshire police
have been banned by their
Chief Constable, Peter
Wright, from “tribal” banging
of riot shields when facing
picketing miners.
Senior officers said the
beating was “provocative.” A
spokesman said they had
received complaints about
“the tactic of beating the staffs
on the shield like Maori war-
riors and Zulus.”
Policemen disobeying the
order could face disciplinary
action.
Apart from his fine record with horses, Sydney gallops trainer Theo
Green has turned out such a long list of top jockeys - including Ron
Quinton and Malcolm Johnston - that he has become regarded
widely as THE man to whom to become indentured. At least, that
might explain this heading from the Sydney Daily Telegraph (Sep-
tember 20) on a story which contained no mention whatsoever of
anyone called Theo.
Blackmailing
turnover
The British Financial Times
reports from America on a
woman who specialised in
blackmailing clergymen by
trapping them in compromis-
ing positions. “In six months,
she blackmailed 12 such vic-
tims,” said the report. As the
newspaper commented: “So
what? Two revs a month isn’t
that fast.”

A fable for
the YUMPIE
IRREPRESSIBLE London
Spectator columnist Taki has
a contemporary fable that il-
lustrates the moral dilemma
facing the modern YUMPIE
(Young, Upwardly Mobile
Philanderer).
A mouse and a lion are
walking along when the lion
falls into a manhole and is
trapped. So, he yells for help
and the mouse tells the lion to
wait while he gets a rope and
his Ferrari.
The mouse ties the rope to
the car, throws a line to the
lion and pulls him out.
Next day, the mouse falls
in and asks for help from the
lion which the lion offers by
lowering his you-know-what.
The moral of the story?
When one is generously en-
dowed by nature, one does
not need a Ferrari.


Sorry about the suspense,
crossword solvers. In last
week’s issue, on the Games
page, we inadvertently repeated
the solution from the week be-
fore. Here’s the correct solution
of the September 18 puzzle
which should have appeared.
Herald goes
head hunting
HAVING lost the real estate
classified assault against The
Age, The Herald in Mel-
bourne has returned to head
hunting.
When Harry Gordon re-
turned south from Herald
group stablemate the Courier-
Mail in Brisbane to take up
the post of editor-in-chief of
the flagship, his first appoint-
ment was former Age editor
Les Carlyon, acknowledged
as one the best newspapermen
in the country.
Carlyon, who had spent
years breeding horses, lec-
turing journalism students
and more recently composing
pithy columns for The Sydney
Morning Herald, has now
been followed by a posse of
Age writers. The latest to cross
over is sports editor Neil
Mitchell.
Mitchell also once news
editor may not be the last
senior Age man to break
ranks. His crossing is seen as
making it easier for others
who had resisted Herald blan-
dishments over long lunches.
But whether the blood of its
morning rival can save the
afternoon Herald, which has
dropped almost 200,000 in
daily circulation in 15 years, is
yet to be seen.
Resuming service
YEARS ago, when Aristotle
Onassis had his own airline
Olympic he had a fetish for
clean toilets on the planes and
all his aircraft coming to Aus-
tralia carried an extra crew
member to keep them clean. It
will be interesting to see if this
custom still exists when the
Greek airline arrives back in
Australia on December 8.
The Greek government,
which bought Onassis out, has
brought the modern fleet up-
to-date and 70 percent of
planes are less than three
years old. Olympic’s wide-
bodied 747 s will arrive in
Australia every Wednesday
and Saturday morning and
depart the same morning.

It is my expectation and

prosecutions, then, so be it: it
would be my hope that it hap-

The effect of Mr Hawke’s

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
VERY OFTEN, seemingly “safe”
plays are a lot riskier than those in
which the risk is blatantly obvious.
Leaving a blot is an obvious risk.
Under pressure there is a tendency
to make any move other than leav-
ing a blot.
Look at the illustration. It’s 14-
13 to Black in a 15-point tourna-
ment match. The Crawford rule is
in force, so the cube has no rel-
evance. White is behind a 5-point
prime, Black has split his back
men; it’s all very tentative. White
throws a 5-3; what’s the play?
The solid arrow shows a com-
mon reaction 812 to W 8 (hit-
ting) and continuing to W 5. Black
is on the bar and White is “safe”
with builders on the 7, 6 and 5.
The problem is that White has
forced Black into a corner if
possible he must attack the White
blot on 82. Black can do this with
rolls of 1-5, 1-4, 2-5, 2-4, 3-5, 3-4 or
2-2; with a 1-1 he will re-enter and
move both men from B 3 to B 2
hitting. Adding these, we see that
Black will attack the White blot on
B 2 with any of 14 rolls. If this hap-
pens, White will be on the bar
facing a 5 point board (22:11
against re-entering) while Black
will escape with high numbers or
cover B 2 with low ones.
Consider an alternative: Sup-
pose White hits twice 812 to W 5
and W 6 to W 3. Of course, he
leaves a blot on W 3 which appears
risky but to hit it Black (with two
men on the bar) needs a direct 3 or
double 1. That’s 12 shots in all
two fewer than the “safe” play. It
also gives White distinct gammon
(and match) possibilities.

Opening lead queen of

THERE IS no question that the
finesse, valuable weapon though it
is, can be abused.
Here is a striking case where
declarer resisted the temptation to
take a finesse and scored a game
as a result.
The bidding was spirited and
South wound up in five hearts. He
ruffed the queen of spades and
drew two rounds of trumps, end-
ing in his hand. Then declarer led
a low club toward the jack, giving
up the opportunity to finesse
against the king.
It did not matter what West
did. If he went up with the king,
dummy would play low and
declarer would be able to cash the
A-Q of clubs and discard two dia-
monds from dummy. On this line
of play South would lose only a
club and a diamond.
And, if West did not take his
king of clubs, dummy’s jack
would win and the end result
would be the same declarer
losing just two diamond tricks.
Suppose, though, that South
had started the clubs by leading
the jack from dummy. He would
have lost the finesse and also the
contract because the defenders
would have taken two diamonds
and a club for a one-trick set.
The question from the start,
from declarer’s viewpoint, is
which opponent has the king of
clubs. If West has it, the finesse
should be avoided. If East has it,
the finesse must be taken to ensure
the contract.
South solved the problem sen-
sibly when he decided West was
more likely to have the crucial
king.
The opening lead indicated
that East had the A-K of spades.
Since West had over-called the
heart bid with a queen-high suit, it
became probable that he would
have the preponderance of
strength in the side suits.

Rouge Homme.
The true expression of Coonawarra.
The best Coonawarra red wines bear
several distinguishing features.
The regional ‘mintiness.’ The intense
varietal flavour, complex, yet with great
elegance.
More often that not, you’ll find the
best Coonawarra red wines also bear the
Rouge Homme label.
A fine example is the 1981 vintage Claret.
It has outstanding character and has been
acclaimed by Wine Show Judges, winning a
Gold Medal at the 1984 Brisbane Wine Show.
Rouge Homme. No wine more
faithfully expresses Coonawarra.
