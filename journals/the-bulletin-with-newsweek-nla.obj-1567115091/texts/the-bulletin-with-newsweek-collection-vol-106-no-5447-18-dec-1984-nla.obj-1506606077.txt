Individual, progressive, active,
competitive, dynamic. Such are the
qualities of the successful.
These are the people who set the pace
and standards for others. They seek
distinction, not status.
Yet, there is really only one car that
reflects the individuality, excellence and
dynamism that such people demand.
The BMW 735 i.
Through more than half a century of
automotive experience BMW has learned
what it takes to satisfy the aspirations of
these demanding people.
Certainly, the BMW 735 i has the latest
that advanced design and technology can
offer. From electrically-operated front
seats, to the most sophisticated computer
controlled engine management system in
the world.
But a BMW offers you more than that.
Sheer driving pleasure.
The sporty personality of the BMW
735 i has been formed through a long and
successful involvement with motorsport.
Two key attributes that you will enjoy as a
result, are responsiveness and agility.
Another reason for the superb drive-
ability of the BMW 735 i is the safest
braking system in the world - ABS.
Such features of the BMW 735 i are
but a few examples of a desire to raise the
design of the automobile to new heights,
in the constant pursuit of excellence.
That is why BMW cars have always
satisfied even the most discerning drivers.
The choice of a BMW reflects their own
personal qualities, to which they - like
BMW - owe their success.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Voting confusion
Your cover (B, December 11) showing
our fearless leader committing a poss-
ible informal error strikes at the very
heart of Australia’s claim to having a
literate electorate.
You are undoubtedly preparing the
way for a Teletext election the next time
where, on inter-active video, we signal
our confusion on a keyboard or with a
mouse.
Your past reputation for supporting
the underdog K. Packer, P. Garrett,
A. Peacock, et al is well known to us
media watchers, so be warned. We can
always switch our allegiance to the Pig
Breeders Gazette or other weeklies.

Universal suffrage
I have always held a sneaking regard for
the Duke of Marlborough, a man whose
enthusiasm for the principle of uni-
versal manhood suffrage was less than
whole-hearted. Asked his opinion of the
idea, the old duke is said to have
replied; “I don’t believe in the collective
wisdom of individual ignorance.”
The federal election results appear to
demonstrate that a significant propor-
tion of those individuals whose col-
lective judgment chooses and directs
those entrusted with the national well-
being does not have even enough in-
telligence to fill out three simple, virtu-
ally idiot-proof ballot papers.
Perhaps our politicians are wiser
than we realise. Perhaps it is because
they know the true value of their “man-
date” that they usually ignore it.

Choice on Saturday
Since coming to live in far north
Queensland five years ago, I have been
a very happy subscriber to The Bulletin.
I wonder if the editor could (or would)
devote some space asking subscribers to
express their wishes as to: What film
would you like to see on Saturday
nights?
Saturday, December 1, after spend-
ing some time on Election 84, we found
that the ABC provided us with Barbary
Coast{ 1935). Cristofero Colombo! Who
chooses our Saturday night movies and
how do they choose them? Who pays
them to make our choice? My mind
boggles at the thought that Mr Myer
might have anything to do with that
choice.
After Countdown, it is probable that
our young people (bless them) change
over to video or go to a disco or a party.
Jolly good; we have enjoyed all that.
But surely the oldies should get a better
deal from the ABC on Saturday nights
in this day and age.
To start the possible ball rolling, I
would choose Picnic at Hanging Rock,
The Man from Snowy River, the films
starring Sir Laurence Olivier, Margaret
Rutherford, Bob Hope (to name a few),
then the Sherlock Holmes classics. If we
need to go further back in time, what
about the delightful Tom Walls-Ralph
Lynn films? There are many more, of
course.
My congratulations to Messrs
Adams, Saw, Batman, McNicoll AND
Pierpont for adding to the joy of The
Bulletin.

new Zimbabwe, he may have been able
to present a more comprehensive
picture of things to your readers.
The two jokes with which he begins
the article are in bad taste, to say the
least. To use the term “kaffir” twice in
the article proves only that he is not
familiar with the implications of this
derogatory term. It is not something to
be used as a joke, as any Zimbabwean
would have told him in no uncertain
terms.
As a white Zimbabwean, I resent
being categorised among those who do,
as he puts it, live beneath a “glass
dome” with “Happy Black Sambo” to
run after them. We (and I speak for the
majority those who are not
millionaires and who do not have life-
styles anything like those with whom he
came into contact) most definitely not
only take an interest in the traditions,
language, culture and religions of our
black comrades but we also take an
active part in Zimbabwean life and
strive to stamp out all that remains of
the status quo as it was in colonial
Rhodesia.
(I also wonder how many sentences
of your dominant local vernacular
Phillip Adams speaks). His use of
the English language is questionable I
refer you to the use of “worst still” in
reference to the five and six-year-old
children!
I should also like to know what Mr
Adams refers to by “National Health.”
To my knowledge, there is no such thing
as yet in Zimbabwe. There are medical
aid schemes and there is a service for
those who are unable to pay medical
costs for whatever reason.
As for the elephant cullings being
done for the ivory, this is a serious
allegation. In times of drought, vast
numbers of animals must be destroyed
for obvious reasons. Although I am not
“in the know,” as Mr Adams’ inform-
ants claim to be, this is a sad fact of life
which we have come to accept. Whether
the elephants died of starvation or were
humanely culled, there is no doubt that
the ivory would be available for market-
ing. There are very strict controls in the
usage and marketing of ivory, which
would prevent even the most corrupt
ministers from taking their cut.
As a woman, I take great exception
to the paragraph about white women
being increasingly unhappy despite
their luxurious lives. I resent being
lumped along with the ever-decreasing
numbers of discontented rich whites I
am far from discontented but rather
accept that women have a long way to
go in the struggle for their rights and
feel elated by the small steps that we are
taking in this regard.
There are few luxuries in my life and
I wonder what the word “luxury”
means. If it means a television, swim-
ming pool and servant, then, I have no
luxuries. If it means a roof over my
head and a healthy, well-fed child, I
admit that I belong to the privileged
whites to whom he refers. I will prob-
ably never be able to afford a holiday
outside this country, not because of any
restrictions placed on me by the govern-
ment but because I do not manage to
save a cent of my salary each month.
Belonging to the “beleaguered
whites,” I earn less than most of my
black colleagues. They are better
qualified and more experienced than I
in the teaching profession and are paid
accordingly.
In concluding, may I say how easy it
is to judge perfunctorily. Should Mr
Adams ever be in the position to “do”
Zimbabwe in more depth, may I suggest
that he ignores “let’s scare an Aussie”
tales of people being munched in tents
(if this incident occurred, it received no
publicity) and avoids the international
“you are nowhere, or anywhere” joints
and witnesses first-hand the real and
positive Zimbabwe.
In ignoring the very sound and
sensible advice not to walk in game-
parks, he left himself open to a real
dose of African Adventure which could
have ended up in him receiving
(posthumously?) some really good
publicity of the Front Page variety.

Human rights
In the edition of The Bulletin for
December 4, under the heading “Hu-
man rights,” appears an article entitled
“Storm over report on affirmative ac-
tion.” The penultimate paragraph of
that report reads: “Dame Roma
Mitchell, Chairman of the Human
Rights Commission, told The Bulletin
she had nothing to say about Moens
that was fit to publish.”
Your reporter, Mr Tony Abbott,
telephoned me on Tuesday, November
20, and spoke to me for a period of
between 30 and 40 minutes. During that
conversation, he told me that he had the
letter which the Human Rights Com-
mission had sent to Dr Moens giving the
reasons for the rejection of his report.
He then asked me to elaborate some of
the reasons and I did this. At no time
during that conversation did I say that I

Is your car ins
Most luxury cars have lines that are remi-
niscent of a box.
The Rover 3500 SE and Vanden Plas, on
the other hand, have lines that are reminiscent of
the Ferrari Daytona.
Most luxury cars have four doors and a boot
Whereas the Rover has four doors and a
hatchback
A design that turns heads and turns the Rover
into a station wagon.
(All you do is fold down the rear seat)
Judging by its shape you might think the Rover
also has superb aerodynamics.
You’d be right It also has the performance
to match.
Furthermore, to keep it in shape we put the
bodyshell through a highly advanced rust-protect-
ion process known as cathodic priming. Then we
underseal it
And then we paint it, giving it more coats than
you’d find in a film star’s wardrobe.
MORE TITAN MEETS THE EYE.
The Rover is just as attractive on the inside as
it is on the outside.
Instead of a long list of options it has a long list
of standard equipment, which is so comprehensive


s
ch good shape?
it prompted the motoring press to write that Rover
‘.. includes just about every automotive mod con
you can think of or dream about.’
The checklist (equally important to the health
and comfort of the Rover driver) is another long list
Every car must pass literally thousands of
mechanical and electronic checks before it’s allowed
out of the factory
The result is Rovers spend the maximum time
on the road, and the minimum time off it
Which leads us to a claim that no one else can
make.
DOES YOUR WARRANTY LOOK AS
GOOD?
Instead of a one year warranty there is a two
year or 40,000 km warranty, whichever comes first
What’s more, Rover undertake to pay the labour
costs of regular maintenance (as set out in the
owners handbook) for three years or 40,000 kms,
whichever comes first.
Which, if you buy a Rover, will leave your bank
balance in as good a shape as your car.

The perfect shape to be in.

The new Singapore
Michael Meagher’s article on Singapore
(B, November 27) reflects my senti-
ments expressed on my return in Sep-
tember last from my third visit to that
city. The tourist image of the blending
of Asian cultures in a modern city is a
myth.
As for the idea that Singapore is a
bargain-hunter’s delight forget it. The
Straits Times published an article com-
paring a variety of goods bought in
Singapore, Hong Kong, Paris and Lon-
don. In most cases, goods could be
bought for less in Hong Kong and in
some cases cheaper in London or Paris!
We had a party of 13 on our tour and
we all agreed that we would not re-visit
Singapore, although many of us had
enjoyed a stay there before.
Old Singapore has gone and with it
its cultures and uniqueness. In its place
is any other western city with its
myriads of hotels (all half-empty), tall
buildings and smog.

Everingham’s endurance
In the article “Campaigning with Paul
Everingham On the hustings with the
King of the Kids” (B, November 20), I
read with interest: “In this marathon
eight-week campaign he will have
knocked on more than 100,000 doors
and spoken to just about every one of
the Territory’s 70,000 voters.”
I seek clarification of the figures. If,
indeed, this is how they should read, I
inquire of (reporter) Bruce Stannard to
explain. Assuming that on average two
legal voters live under the same roof (as
parents or otherwise), if only 70,000
(voters) reside in the Territory, how can
it be necessary to knock on 100,000
doors?

Unnecessary confrontation
David Barnett’s article on Medicare (B,
November 20) covers this subject well
but I would like to make some points
regarding the increase in the cost of
health services which occurred between
1970 and 1975. This increase was largely
related to the move toward equal pay
for female employees which is very
important in the hospital industry
where the majority of employees are
females; the introduction of sessional
payments for doctors and the phasing

“I keep telling him what he needs is a vested interest”
out of the honorary system; and the
introduction of reasonable pay rates for
resident medical staff at hospitals.
These factors are covered briefly in
the Penington report and in earlier
articles which Penington quotes.
It is a sad fact that fear of a doctor-
generated rise in health costs (non-
existent) has been the rationale for
attempts to control medical practice.
This has resulted in unnecessary con-
frontation with doctors, as your article
has explained.

Aid to Ethiopia
In her article on Ethiopia (B, December
4), Tess Lawrence strikes a pessimistic
and somewhat nihilistic note that
cannot be allowed to go without
challenge.
Her opening paragraph, while
capturing some of the agony and horror
of the Ethiopian situation, follows the
rather well-worn path of media cover-
age over the last few weeks. It is
sensational and hits the keynotes of
shock and horror. It might, in her own
words, qualify for being either “the best
and worst of journalism” of which we
have seen a lot.
More offensive, however, is the slick
manner in which Ms Lawrence lumps
all civilian relief agencies (or NGOs)
together as “groupies of the Great
Famine. Such cynicism does disservice
both to her apparent sensitivity as a
reporter and to the valuable work of the
NGOs.
Agencies such as Austcare and its 14
member agencies (which include,
among others major concerns, such as
the Australian Council of Churches,
Australian Catholic Relief, Save the
Children Fund and UNICEF) have
been aware of the situation in Africa for
some considerable time and have en-
deavored to bring it to the attention of
the Australian public.
This year alone, successful appeals to
Australians have raised millions of
dollars for emergency and long-term
relief programs within Ethiopia and
other drought-affected African
countries. In August, for example,
Austcare raised $200,000 which was
distributed through its member
agencies. Furthermore, Austcare was
able to distribute yet another $1.48
million at the request of the federal
government specifically for emergency
relief work in Africa. We believe this
money has been effectively employed.
Reports from field workers and from
Australian representatives of such
agencies as UNICEF, who have visited
Ethiopia, confirm this for us.
Was Ms Lawrence too busy criti-
cising the response of some of her
colleagues or too overawed with the
dimensions of the tragedy in Ethiopia to
see the valuable work that has been
going on and will continue for the next
12 months at least?
Perhaps Ms Lawrence might like to
return to Ethiopia and look at the work
that is being done by “the groupies of
the Great Famine,” then write a report
on the positive aspects of Australia’s
humanitarian response. Then, at least,
the Australian public will be better
informed about the work of the agencies
they are supporting so generously.

Andrea Shoebridge (B, November 27)
imputes to me an “impassioned defence
of the alcohol industry’s right to direct
its messages to all sections of our
community including minors.” I
made no such defence: I propound no
such right. Indeed, I made no comment
whatever for or against further tighten-
ing of the rules governing alcohol ad-
vertising on television. My letter
suggested that public commentators,
who are so astute at detecting and
decrying commercial interests, seem
strangely blind to the existence of
regulatory interests.

Biblical education
After listening to one of the leading
lights among homosexuals in Brisbane
make a plea on the ABC radio program
AM for more community education on
homosexuality, I wondered what kind
of education he was referring to. Is it an
education program in our already
atheistic, humanistic, state school
system, encouraging our children to
accept homosexuality as acceptable be-
haviour and indeed a “satisfying”
lifestyle?
Or maybe he had in mind an educa-
tion program using the only textbook
that speaks very clearly on all the
various sexual perversions (including
homosexuality) in today’s society.
The textbook referred to is, of
course, the Bible. God’s only Word to
all mankind.
The Bible has some interesting in-
formation for homosexuals and, of
course, any other people wishing to
know God’s Laws. Remember, this is
God’s Word speaking to us not a
narrow-minded religious fanatic. I
quote from firstly Leviticus 18:22, “You
shall not lie with a male as one lies with
a female; it is an abomination,” and
again in Leviticus 20:13 ... “If there is a
man who lies with a male as those who
lie with a woman, both of them have
committed a detestable act, they shall
surely be put to death. Their
bloodguiltiness is upon them.” With
regard to the AIDS disease, I quote
Romans 1:27, “And in the same way
also the men abandoned the natural
function of the woman and burned in
their desire toward one another, men
with men committing indecent acts and
receiving in their own persons the due
penalty of their error.” AIDS?
Perhaps, if we had maintained this
kind of education, there would be no
need to educate us about homosexuality
and AIDS and about the risks I run by
receiving blood from a homosexual.

‘Comedy of errors’
I always enjoy reading “All their own
work” but I was a little surprised to see
in that column (B, October 30) a phrase
alleged to be the work of Avis Miller,
Principal of Annesley College, Ad-
elaide.
The apocryphal saying, “Our mother
who art in heaven” was actually the
creation of an over-zealous and highly
imaginative journalist of one of
Adelaide’s daily newspapers. The same
newspaper recognised the fact and
published a written apology three days
later.
The whole episode was a comedy of
errors. In the first place, while the
Uniting Church has adopted a modern
version of the Lord’s Prayer for use in
worship, it has not altered the gender of
“God.”
In the second place, the phrase “Our
mother who art in heaven” is an an-
achronism. Why would someone sub-
stitute non-sexist for sexist language
and at the same time retain the archaic
word “art”?
In the third place, the writer of the
article failed to see that the sexist phrase
“headmistress” has been replaced by the
non-sexist term “principal.”
But the most significant error of all
was the failure of the journalist to
discern the world of difference between
attributing feminine attributes to God
and tampering with the original words
of Jesus and Scripture.
In future, I hope that journalists will
be a little more careful in their research
so that what is printed in that column
does not end up being all their own
work.

AUSTRALIA
Australia to play key role
in Kampuchea talks
The latest tragic developments in the crisis over Kampuchea may act as a catalyst to
settlement with Australia playing a key role. DENIS REINHARDT analyses the
situation and its possible implications for our standing in the region.
THE AUSTRALIAN government is
uniquely placed to force a diplomatic
solution to the Indo-China conflict
centred on Kampuchea.
Both Vietnam and Thailand have
given first signs that, if Prime Minister
Bob Hawke and Foreign Minister Bill
Hayden again pursue the latter’s first-
term shuttle diplomacy, Australia may
not only host historic initial peace talks
in Canberra but be welcomed as an
intermediary.
The immediate ramification of this is
that regional perceptions of Australia’s
status as a mature neighbor and in-
dependently-minded middle power will
rise.
Apart from the obvious international
and perhaps domestic kudos, success in
this delicate diplomacy would carry
with it important commercial ad-
vantages as the strongest growth in the
international economy is taking place in
this region.
Information obtained by The
Bulletin suggests that some secret
Australian diplomacy has taken place
already.
To help engineer a lasting peace
settlement in Kampuchea, Hayden and
Hawke would not only have to bring the
three major parties Thailand,
Vietnam and China to the conference
table but also conduct extensive
negotiations with Soviet leadership and
keep United States sensitivities well in
mind.
Almost alone in South-east Asia,
Vietnam isolated but tied by necessity
and ideology to the Soviet Union is
wallowing in an economic trough.
With reputedly the world’s fourth-
largest standing army, Vietnam’s
economy remains burdened by the war
in Kampuchea.
Next April, the 10th anniversary of
the fall of Saigon now Ho Chi Minh
City will be celebrated. But the spoils
of reunification are to be a hollow
treasury.
On the northern border with China,
Vietnam’s best regiments are tied down
against a Chinese army matched in
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden: Thais keenly await a visit
equipment but numerically superior.
The Vietnamese say that Chinese
military onslaughts are linked to every
initiative which Vietnamese troops take
in Kampuchea, six years after they
overthrew the genocidal Pol Pot regime
in Pnom Penh.
Using Thai military ports on the Gulf
of Thailand, Chinese arms continue to
flow to the 30,000-strong Pol Pot army
active in northern Kampuchea. Along
the southern stretches of the Thai-
Kampuchean border, the non-com-
munist Sihanouk and Heng Samrin
factions claim an additional 20,000 ir-
regulars who also are sustained by
supply lines over Thai territory.
Against this backdrop, argue the
Thais, Vietnamese leaders have decided
on a decisive thrust against the resist-
ance factions. Vietnam maintains an
occupation force of some 180,000
troops in Kampuchea, combined with
the 30,000-member army loyal to the
Pnom Penh leadership.
Thai military intelligence early last
month detected a major Vietnamese
troop movement toward an encamp-
ment at Nong Chan controlled by the
Son Sann faction, the Khmer Peoples
National Liberation Front, just over
the frontier from the Thai city of
Arantaprathet.
The attack came on November 17.
The Thai army’s contiguous Burapa
Force Command within a few days was
exchanging fire with Vietnamese patrols
sent into the no-man’s-land between the
frontier and the anti-tank canals which
Thailand has dug one kilometre inside
its territory.
The fighting forced 20,000 refugees
to flood into a blue plastic tent camp in
the buffer zone.
The Bulletin found Son Sann’s
guerillas continuing to operate from the
camp on Thai territory while United
Nations aid officials struggled to pro-
vide food and shelter for the refugees.
“What we are witnessing,” said Col-
onel Chetta Thanajro, before a huge
wall map in a sandbagged bunker back


from the front showing opposing troop
deployments, “is a last-ditch attempt by
Vietnam at a military solution.”
Thailand with its capital,
Bangkok, barely four hours’ drive from
the Kampuchean frontier is not keen
to fight a direct war with Vietnam. At
the very least, it wants a neutral regime
in Pnom Penh.
Thai Foreign Ministry officials in-
dicated to The Bulletin that the possibil-
ity of a wider demilitarised zone inside
the Kampuchean frontier had been
broached with Australia as a potential
intermediary.
The deputy to Thailand’s Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila, ambassador
at large Chavat Atayukti, said that his
government had become “utterly con-
vinced” that Vietnam would “attempt to
ignore the world for another five or
even 10 years if it is able to achieve this
military solution in Kampu-
chea.” Thailand, he con-
cluded, found it difficult to
trust anything that Vietnam’s
leaders said or did.
Vietnam will not be able to
succeed in the drive against
the Kampuchean resistance
without a major regional con-
flagration, say the Thais.
In answer to questions put
to him by The Bulletin the
Thai Foreign Minister went
one stage further: “If they are
able to achieve this military
solution, then, of course, there
would be a settlement. But
this would not be a settlement
because it would still be an
injustice and a threat to our
security.”
One reason why a military
solution is unlikely is the
natural ally which Thailand
has found in China against
what both argue is Vietnamese
expansion. China having
seen a friendly neighbor, in
the guise of the Pol Pot regime, deposed
is determined not to have a hostile
regime on its southern flanks as it does
further west on the Burmese frontier
where Kuomantung army remnants
pose an irritant.
The Thais keenly await the first visit
of Hayden following the Australian
general election, primarily to ascertain
whether the new Hawke government
will again pursue attempts to convene
peace talks.
From a position of open hostility to
such early initiatives, Savetsila now
regards himself as a personal friend of
Hayden.
Hayden also has a good working
relationship with Vietnam’s Foreign
minister Nguyen Co Thach.
A strong (though not dominant)
grouping within the Vietnamese leader-
\
Troops of the Son Sai faction in a border refugee camp
Thai soldiers at the border
ship is arguing that the country must use
models and friendships apart from that
offered by Russia.
Thach is a key exponent of this
viewpoint.
Although intelligence from Hanoi is
sparse, their views seem to be opposed
by an essentially military faction who
having fought wars for 30 years are
blinkered against the wider option.
Nevertheless, powerful changes are
occurring within the Vietnamese
Poliburo. Hanoi’s most powerful com-
munist, Secretary-General Le Duan,
visited India in September his first
trip to a non-communist country. The
76-year-old had delivered in July a
widely publicised speech to the Viet-
namese Central Committee defending
liberal and controversial economic
policies and urging wider economic and
political relations with the
outside world a remarkable
somersault. Hayden appears
to have “read” this change.
Almost alone among
western Foreign ministers,
Hayden was able to read and
be advised of the signs
because of Australia’s active
diplomatic presence in the
Vietnamese capital.
The goodwill which this
has generated toward Aus-
tralia within the Thach camp
should not be under-
estimated.
The Chinese leadership ap-
parently recognised this im-
plicitly when Hawke visited
China this year. Senior
Politburo member Hu
Yaobang used the opportun-
ity to ask Hawke to convey a
secret message of goodwill to
the Hanoi leadership.
If Hayden wants to go
further, he will have to talk to
Moscow.
In the complex world of inter-
national diplomacy, Moscow holds
the key to real movement in Vietnam’s
attitude to allowing a neutral adminis-
tration in Pnom Penh.
As a pre-condition for normalising
relations with Russia, China has
demanded that Moscow drop its back-
ing for the Vietnamese occupation of
Kampuchea.
The Soviets have publicly rejected
such a shift but a senior Russian
minister is due in Peking soon to discuss
closer links.
Although the Russians and Chinese
need no intermediaries, Australians
should not be surprised if their Foreign
Minister surfaces in Moscow or Peking
next year with Kampuchea on his
agenda. □


THE ELECTION
Redistribution
saved Hawke
from defeat
The polling booth at the Sydney Town Hall: a close call for Labor
By RICHARD FARMER
THE HAWKE Labor government
would have lost this month’s federal
poll but for the changes in the electoral
boundaries. With most of the postal and
absentee ballots in, it is clear that
Labor’s primary vote has fallen some
1.8 percent. If the boundaries for this
election had been the same as those
when Hawke took office last year, the
Liberal-National Party coalition would
be back in power.
Defeat in such a way would have
been unfair. The 1983 boundaries were
weighted against Labor while those for
this month’s poll were drawn so that
either side could win with 50 percent of
the votes. After allocating minor party
preferences, Labor has ended up with a
51.3 percent share down from 52.5
percent in 1983.
Labor’s position is complicated a
little by the abnormally high informal
vote this time. The figures put Labor’s
vote on its own at 47.6 percent. Yet, if
protest votes and people who voted
incorrectly by mistake but who clearly
favored the Hawke government are
added back in, it might have been 49
percent. The two-party preferred vote
under this scenario would be virtually
unchanged on that when Hawke first
won office.
That protest vote gives a certain
poignancy to the surprise that Labor
Party ministers felt when they received a
request on the eve of the Prime
Minister’s policy speech for what was
quaintly termed as “vision.”
With the next-to-final draft of his
speech before him, Hawke had decided
that there was too much standing-on-
the-record. He perceived a shortage of
appeals to the people about the sort of
Australia which the Australian Labor
Party would bring. What was needed
was more “ vision.”
In hindsight, Hawke’s judgment
clearly was correct given that a
significant part of the informal vote is
believed to have been a protest from
disgruntled people who normally would
vote Labor. The extent of such protests
must await an analysis of the informals
by the Electoral Commission and de-
tailed polling which the political parties
are carrying out. But Labor Party
officials are sure that they suffered with
their own faithful for the very reasons
that made them acceptable to so much
of the business community.
Hawke’s problem was that “vision”
is impossible to conjure up overnight.
That was the request made by the Prime
Minister’s staff and few ministers could
respond to it. For the “vision” Hawke
wanted had to be “vision” which did
not cost money and did not upset
significant groups.
THE ALP
The right moves
to clean up
the SA mess
FEDERAL MINISTER Chris Hurford
is the leader of a new right-wing faction
established in the South Australian
Labor Party. The new faction is a
response to the inability of the centre
faction to control the left-wing trade
unions which now dominate the branch.
That domination has recently led to
the endorsement of leftist candidates in
two safe state Labor seats. In both cases
the official Labor candidate was beaten
by a moderate Labor man who left the
party to contest the election as an
independent. The upshot of the two
defeats in Elizabeth and Semaphore is
that the government of John Bannon no
longer has a majority.
State ALP Secretary Chris Schacht is
being blamed within the federal party
for much of what has gone wrong. Since
Schacht became secretary the balance
between left and centre which existed in
South Australia for decades has
changed. At party conferences the
centre group around Schacht lost the
support of right wing unions which let
the left take control by default.
Hurford, with more than a little help
from ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, vice
president Simon Crean and NSW
Labor Council secretary John Mcßean
during a recent meeting in Adelaide of
the ACTU Executive, has now gathered
these right-wing unions around him.
They certainly do not have the
numbers on their own, but combined
with the centre faction they will make
things more difficult for the left in
future.
Premier Bannon must certainly hope
so. He is reluctant to go to the polls
before October next year because of his
fears about what the public thinks of a
left dominated Labor Party. As well as
the party’s losses in Elizabeth and
Semaphore in the state sphere, left
candidates polled especially badly in
the federal election. In the once safe
Labor seat of Hindmarsh, for instance,
John Scott registered a swing against
him of up to 12 percent in some booths
which were transferred under the
redistribution into the electorate from
Hawker where people could previously
vote for the moderate Ralph Jacobi. □
Richard Farmer


In the post mortems being carried
out within the ALP, there is agreement
that the second Hawke government
should be slightly more daring than the
first.
The loss to the informal category of
traditional, concerned Labor voters
who felt betrayed but could not bring
themselves to vote for any other party
could be as high as 130,000 to 140,000
people throughout the country. That is
about one-third of the informal votes
cast 10 days ago above the normal level
of around 2 percent.
With 90 percent of the House of
Representatives vote counted, the total
number of informal votes Australia-
wide was some 593,000 equal to 6.7
percent of total votes cast. The expecta-
tion before voting ended was that the
informals would be around 185,000. If
Labor analysts are correct in that
135,000 people deliberately voted in-
formal as a protest, that accounts for
320,000 of the 593,000.
The balance of the informals are
people believed to have been misled by
the new voting system for the Senate
who simply marked a “1” on their
House of Representatives paper.
Initial surveys by the Labor Party,
which tend to be confirmed by
scrutineers’ reports, suggest that for
every three people who accidentally
voted informal two had put their mark
next to the Labor candidate for every
Liberal who did the same.
On those assumptions, it is possible
to adjust the analysis of the vote in a
way which gets closer to the real result
on December 1 compared with that of
March 1983:
NATIONAL ANALYSIS
Actual figures
ALP 47.6%, down 1.8%
Liberal 34.4%, down 0.2%
National 10.7%, up 1.7%
Democrat 5.4%, up 0.3%
Others 1.9%, no change
Figures adjusted for “misled” voters
ALP 48.2%, down 1.2%
Liberal 34.1%, down 0.5%
National 10.6%, up 1.6%
Democrat 5.2%, up 0.1%
Others 1.9%, no change
Figures adjusted for “misled” and “protest” voters
ALP 49.0%, down 0.4%
Liberal 33.5%, down 1.1%
National 10.5%, up 1.5%
Democrat 5.1%, no change
Others 1.9%, no change
That adjusted analysis holds very
little joy for Hawke. Even without the
ballot paper confusion, Labor’s vote
would have been down 1.2 percent.
With it, the decline was 1.8 percent. On
the most favorable interpretation of the
result for Labor gained by adding
back the disgruntled, deliberate in-
formals the decline was still 0.5
percent on the 1983 figures. □
PUBLIC OPINION
How the pollsters
estimated the
election result
AFTER A long record of accuracy with
its election forecasts, the Morgan
Gallup Poll over-estimated by 3 percent
the ALP vote of 48 percent for the
House of Representatives on December
1 but was accurate within 1 percent with
the Senate.
Table 1 shows that two other
national surveys based on personal
interviews (McNair’s and SRG/
Saulwick) also over-estimated the ALP
vote whereas two surveys conducted by
telephone on election-eve (Spectrum
and Telegraph/Channel 10) were more
accurate.
Only Morgan Gallup and Spectrum
published predictions for the Senate.
Table 2 shows that Morgan Gallup’s
estimate for the ALP in the Senate was
correct within 1 percent.
Three unique features of this month’s
election were:
■ The first television debate between
the Prime Minister and the Leader of
the Opposition on the Monday evening
before the election.
■ The first television and radio com-
mentaries on the election on the
Thursday and Friday before the elec-
tion.
■ The first facility to vote a party’s
Senate ticket simply by making only
one mark.
The 6.7 percent informal vote was 4.7
percent higher than the average in-
formal vote of 2 percent for the House
of Representatives over the past five
elections. The facility to vote a party’s
ticket by making only one mark cut the
informal vote for the Senate to 5.4
percent. A mistaken belief by some
electors that one mark would also
suffice for the House of Representatives
is given as one of the reasons for the
increase in the informal vote.
Pending an analysis of the informal
vote by the Electoral Commission, it
seems that three-quarters of the excess
of 4.7 percent over the usual 2 percent
were probably ALP supporters ie, 3.5
percent ALP to 1.2 percent L-NP and
others.
Applying those figures to the actual
House of Representatives vote of ALP
47.7 percent, L-NP 45.0 percent,
Democrats 5.3 percent and others 2.0
percent, the “intended” vote for the
House of Representatives was prob-
ably: ALP 49 percent, L-NP 44 percent,
Democrats 5 percent, others 2 percent.

PICKERING’S WEEK


THE LAW
Inquest sinks Costigan theory
“Mr Packer may attend that (inquest)
if he wishes and he will there learn all he
needs to know.’’ (Royal commissioner
Frank Costigan, QC, November 1984.
Final report, Volume 1, para 3.051.)
That declaration more a taunt than
an invitation backfired very badly for
Costigan in a Brisbane coroner's court
last week as his much publicised murder
theory and the irrational basis for it were
torn to pieces by every witness including
the very experts Costigan had called but
failed to question properly. In a classic
case of tunnel-vision, Costigan hit upon a
sensational but absurd scenario of evil
and wickedness in high places and with a
“ be-your-own-pathologist” approach set
about trying to find the pieces to make it
work. BR UCE STANNARD was in court
to watch it all come apart.
THE VITAL credibility of the Costigan
royal commission final report has been
severely damaged in its first public
examination the coronial inquiry into
the death of former Queensland bank
manager Percival lan Coote which last
week firmly rejected Costigan’s murder
theory in favor of the original police
finding of suicide.
A procession of expert witnesses
among them four highly qualified
forensic pathologists and two
ballistics specialists including
Costigan’s own Victoria
Police expert revealed a
string of glaring in-
accuracies, misapprehen-
sions, inconsistencies and un-
founded suppositions upon
which the royal commission
based its most serious finding.
The exhaustive, week-long
inquiry ordered by the
Queensland Attorney-Gener-
al on Frank Costigan’s
recommendation and con-
ducted by one of the state’s
most respected magistrates
assisted by its most dis-
tinguished barrister, Cedric
Hampson, QC, demolished
the murder theory point by
point and exposed Costigan’s
investigative techniques as
slipshod, selective and often
incompetent.
Although coroner Robert
Bourgoure declined to make
any specific criticism of
Costigan, his carefully
reasoned suicide finding is in
itself a stinging indictment of
the controversial royal corn-
mission which originally set out to
investigate the Federated Ship Painters
and Dockers Union but which
burgeoned into an all-embracing inves-
tigation into organised crime in
Australia.
The 45-year-old Coote’s body was
found face-down beside his car which
was parked with its headlights on in an
exposed and open vacant lot just off the
busy Pacific Highway at Loganholme,
south of Brisbane, on the evening of
Thursday December 16, 1982. An old
single barrel .410 gauge bolt-action
shotgun which had belonged to his late
father was found nearby.
In his murder theory, propounded in
a document entitled “Squirrell (sic)
Analysis,” Costigan named two murder
suspects: Sydney businessman Phillip
Carver and his brother-in-law, Gold
Coast property developer Brian Ray, a
business associate of Australian Con-
solidated Press chairman Kerry Packer.
(“Squirrel” was Costigan’s code-name
for Packer.)
Despite Costigan’s confident con-
clusion that “murder was the only
alternative,” the coroner found there
was a complete lack of evidence to
support a finding of murder. There was,
he said, no basis whatsoever for
Phillip Carver: “An evasive and unimpressive witness”
DAVID MAY/SUNDAY SUN
suggestions that either Ray or Packer
might have had anything to do with
Coote’s death.
Costigan’s belief in the murder
theory relied substantially upon
Carver’s confidential sworn evidence
before the royal commission in which
he claimed to have spoken by telephone
with Coote shortly before his death.
Although Carver at first refused to
answer the coroner’s questions about
that alleged conversation, on the
grounds that he may tend to incriminate
himself, Carver subsequently said he
had called to threaten Coote over his
role with Ray in bringing fraud charges
against Carver which led to a 12-month
prison sentence from which he had then
only recently been released.
Carver said Coote had cried on the
phone and told of threats from an
armed man. Mrs June Coote, who was
never called to give evidence before
Costigan, told the coroner she had
absolutely no recollection of the call.
Carver also said he had spoken five or
six times to Coote’s office in an attempt
to speak with him. However Coote’s
secretary, Gayle Coward — who knew
Carver and knew his voice — told the
coroner she could remember no such
calls.
The coroner tried to trace
and verify these calls but
failed because a Telecom
computer had then not been
installed and regular records
were not kept long.
Costigan recommended
that fraud charges against
Carver be dropped in return
for his assistance to the royal
commission — a request
turned down by the then New
South Wales Attorney-Gener-
al Paul Landa.
The coroner, who
described Carver as “an evas-
ive and unimpressive witness
upon whose evidence 1 could
not rely,” said he was not
prepared to find that the
phone call to Coote had been
made.
Central to Costigan’s
murder finding was the mis-
taken belief that the entry
wound in Coote’s chest
measured a massive 8cm x
6cm.
Questioned about Costi-
gan’s faulty assumption, one
incredulous pathologist, Dr
Anthony Ansford, director of


the Institute of Forensic Pathology, told
the inquest that such an entry wound
“would have needed some sort of
mortar shell.”
The coroner was told that the entry
wound was only about the size of a coat
button. He found that it measured just
two centimetres.
It was only when the shot, fired with
the muzzle on contact, penetrated into
the chest cavity that it spread out to
form a cone-shaped wound measuring
Bcm x 6cm.
Costigan’s error led him to conclude
that the blast which killed Coote was
consistent with murder, the killer
having fired from the hip from a dist-
ance of between 500 mm and one metre.
Detective Senior Constable Gary
Wilkinson, the detective who initially
investigated Coote’s death, confirmed
that the commission had asked if he
understood the external measurement
of the fatal wound was Bcm x 6cm.
Wilkinson said he answered “yes” to the
question but had understood it to mean
the wound in the chest wall.
Wilkinson said it seemed as if he was
agreeing with the commission. “But,” he
told the coroner, “it is not my recollec-
tion and it is not what I said in my
report.
“My recollection of the real external
wound was that it was about I.3cm in
diameter.”
The “Squirrell Analysis” said
Wilkinson had measured the wound.
That was also wrong, he told the
coroner. Wilkinson said he had relied
only on the measurements obtained by
the pathologist conducting the post
mortem.
Dr Ronald Wright, the pathologist
who conducted the post mortem on
Coote’s body on December 17, 1982,
did not include either the dimensions or
a description of the entry wound in his
formal report which subsequently was
handed over to Costigan. However,
toward the end of his report, he did
describe “a large defect in the chest wall
measuring 8 x 7cm.”
This clear reference to the size of the
internal wound was backed up by an X-
ray which the royal commission copied.
Photographs were also taken of the
small entry wound.
One photographic print which
showed the small entry wound almost
precisely its orginal size was held by
Wright and referred to during his
evidence before the commission but no
one bothered to ask to see it, let alone
have it tendered in evidence.
Costigan therefore went on to order
his own ballistic evaluation from Detec-
tive Sergeant Brian Thompson of the
Victoria Police, based on the utterly
false belief that the entry wound was 8 x
6cm.
Thompson told the coroner he had
PAUL LENNON /DAILY SUN
assumed, because of those dimensions,
that there had been a number of entry
wounds on the skin. He had drawn the
conclusion that the shotgun blast
making a wound that large would have
to have been fired from a distance.
Those findings clearly cemented
Costigan’s belief that he was dealing
with murder.
In Brisbane last week after being
shown a color photograph which
revealed the entry wound was only 2cm
in diameter, Thompson carried out
further ballistics tests using the gun
which was said to have killed Coote. He
also used ammunition of exactly the
same type.
Thompson told the coroner he now
realised that the royal commission had
given him the wrong dimensions of
Coote’s chest wound. Thompson said
that he was now firmly of the opinion
that the muzzle of the shotgun had been
in contact with Coote’s chest at the time
of discharge.
This evidence was corroborated by
senior Brisbane pathologists who said
that, in their opinion, the muzzle had
been in contact with the body. The
director of the Laboratory of
Microbiology and Pathology and the
assistant director-general of the
Scientific Support Service in the
Queensland Health department, Dr lan
Wilkey, said he was surprised by the
royal commission suggestion that the
shot had been fired some distance away
from the body.
He said he was completely satisfied
that the wound on Coote’s body was a
contact wound. “It has all the features
of a contact entry wound,” he said. “It is
inconceivable that the shot was fired
away from the body.”
Des Sturgess, a prominent Brisbane
criminal lawyer who appeared for Ray,
returned again and again to the mis-
takes and misapprehensions and what
he called the “sheer nonsense” of
Costigan’s “Squirrell Analysis.”
Sturgess elicited from every expert
witness testimony which amounted to
ridicule for the royal commission’s
murder theory.
Wright told the coroner that he had
tried unsuccessfully to explain his belief
to Costigan that Coote had taken his
own life by bending over the gun with
its butt resting on the ground and
pulling the trigger with his right hand.
In the royal commission’s Volume
10, Chapter 10, under the heading
“Cause of Death,” Costigan reports
Wright as having said Coote was “un-
lucky to die” because only a single
shotgun pellet had severed his main
coronary artery.
Wright told the inquest that he had
never held or expressed that view.
Wright said that the main coronary
artery was severed was irrelevant since
Coote also had suffered substantial
damage to his left lung and the blood
vessels supplying it. Any one of those
injuries could have caused his rapid
death, Wright said.
He agreed with Packer’s counsel,
Malcolm Turnbull, that Costigan
seemed to have no interest in the suicide
theory.
During cross-examination by
Sturgess, Wright said Costigan’s
“Squirrell Analysis” had been “entirely
wrong” in its statement that there was
an abrasion on Coote’s forehead which
bled. Wright said it was a superficial
abrasion only. “And yet,” Sturgess said,
quoting from the “Squirrell Analysis”,
“‘the suicide theory says this may have
been caused by him falling to the
ground and striking a rock. But no
blood is found on the rock which in any
event is not under his head.’ Now, that’s
a profound non-sequitur,” Sturgess
said, “because there was no bleeding.”
Sturgess also questioned Wright on
the “Squirrell Analysis” statement that
the discovery of the gun not in the grip
of the hand was surprising. “It ought to
have been there,” the “Squirrell An-
alysis” said. “No force of recoil should
have removed it.”


Royal commissioner Costigan (second from left) with Douglas Meagher, QC
THE AGE
Sturgess: “Now, that’s just absolute
nonsense, isn’t it?”
Wright: “I believe it is, yes. I think
I’ve demonstrated how easy it could be
done.”
Wilkinson said that, during a
luncheon adjournment at the royal
commission, counsel assisting the com-
mission Douglas Meagher, QC had
told him he and Costigan “intended to
destroy” Kerry Packer.
Wilkinson told the coroner that
Meagher had described Packer as being
“involved in organised crime in
Australia”. “I don’t remember the entire
words,” Wilkinson said, “but one was
that: ‘He’s a prominent criminal and
myself and the commissioner intend to
destroy him.’ ”
Turnbull asked Wilkinson if he got
the impression that Meagher was trying
to influence his evidence before the
royal commission. “I would not
imagine Mr Meagher would attempt to
influence my evidence,” he replied, “but
some other person might be influenced
by that.”
Turnbull asked: “Do you think, if
you were not so experienced, you might
have been more inclined to lean toward
that theory?”
“If I was a layman,” Wilkinson
replied.
“Did you get the impression Mr
Meagher or Mr Costigan hated my
client?” Turnbull asked. “They
obviously did not like him. I don’t know
whether they hated him,” Wilkinson
replied.
Turnbull subsequently asked the
coroner to subpoena Costigan or
Meagher to explain inconsistencies and
inaccuracies in the “Squirrell Analysis”
and in 30 pages of the commission’s
hitherto secret Volume 10 in which it
was concluded that Coote had been
murdered.
Turnbull argued that all the evidence
in the inquest had completely
“disowned” Costigan’s murder theory.
It was, he said, in the public interest that
Costigan and Meagher should be called
upon to explain their conclusions.
The Volume 10 extract and the so-
called “Squirrell Analysis” had been
given immense publicity and had done
terrific damage to his client. Turnbull
said it was fair to say that, “without
exception, all witnesses both expert
and lay have discounted it (the
commission analysis) and even the bal-
listics expert appointed by the royal
commission has disowned it.”
The coroner decided it was un-
necessary to widen the inquiry.
The inquest was told about an inves-
tigation into the Capalaba branch of the
then Bank of NSW after Coote had left
as its manager and gone to work for
Ray as finance controller of Savannah
Investments, the property development
company he managed at Victoria Point.
Coote was to have been arrested or
summonsed on 19 fraud charges on or
soon after the day he died. The most
serious charge involved misappropria-
tion of $116,906 of the bank’s money.
lan Scotney, an auditor with the
bank’s internal audit division, told the
coroner he had discovered that Coote
had over-lent money. The audit also
had disclosed other irregularities such
as false documents and accounts.
Scotney said no customers had suffered
but the bank had lost a total of about
$350,000.
Detective Sergeant Jerzy Moczynski
and Detective Sergeant Hilary Huey of
the Brisbane CIB Fraud Squad were
called in to investigate the bank’s ac-
counts in August 1981 when they were
provided with 78 vouchers relating to
nine customers’ accounts. By December
1982, their investigations extended to
more than 40 accounts. *
Moczynski told the inquest they had
traced the movement of funds through
each of the accounts and through the
entire bank system a process which
was necessary, he said, because Coote
had forged various documents in order
to conceal the large debit balance in
various accounts.
Scotney said there was no evidence
to indicate a fraudulent connection
between Coote and Packer, nor was
there any evidence that Ray or his
family had been connected with any
fraudulent activity.
The coroner said he was satisfied that
the fraud investigation was related to
Coote's death. He said he was con-
vinced that when news of the investiga-
tion was brought to Coote at any early
date it had greatly distressed him.
Evidence on the final day of the
inquest said that an insurance policy
which had no suicide clause and was
worth nearly $200,000 was paid out
soon after Coote’s death.
The royal commission took no ac-
count of this, although this was cited in
the inquest as a powerful incentive for
Coote to take his life. Coote knew his
widow would benefit to the extent of
5186,000 if he was dead. If he were in
prison and out of work, his family
would benefit only by $7400.
All the documents relating to the
insurance policy were tendered to the
royal commission and offered the most
compelling reason for Coote to take his
life and yet no mention of this was
made either in Volume 10 or in the
“Squirrell Analysis.”
“1 believe the deceased did believe
he had adequate reason to take his own
life,” the coroner found.
One final, vital piece of evidence
completely misunderstood by Costigan
involved Coote’s use of an unexpected
bonus to purchase a $6OOO bank cheque
to pay a taxation debt. Costigan’s
“Squirrell Analysis” concluded that the
“only explanation” for purchasing the
bank cheque was that Coote wished to
avoid tax. This was “quite extraordinary
for a man supposedly depressed by his
situation. It is the action of a man who
intends being around for some time.”
What Costigan overlooked, however,
was that Coote would have known as a
former banker that the use of a bank
cheque was a certain method of paying
the debt since personal cheques are
considered null and void from the date
of death. □

As in the current series, the
Australians were playing a ferociously
talented West Indies team who boasted
the finest fast bowlers in the world.
On the start of the last day, Australia
in its second innings had to score 460 to
win. This task went from the hopeless to
the impossible with the crash of three
early wickets Colin McDonald, Les
Favell, Bob Simpson. Norm O’Neill
and Peter Burge stopped the rot for a
while but the ninth wicket crashed at
207 soon after the tea interval and
Australia faced defeat as slow bowler
Lindsay Kline joined Ken Mackay at
the wicket.
The first Test in that series had been
the historic tie at the ’Gabba in Brisbane
the first in Test history. Australia had
won the second Test and the West
Indies the third.
The West Indies side then looked
every bit as powerful as the West Indies
side today. The captain was Frank
Worrell and the stars included Gary
Sobers, Wes Hall, Rohan Kanhai and
Lance Gibbs. Hall, the great fast bowler,
was at the peak of his prowess and
started his bowling run from near the
sightboard.
Ken Mackay nicknamed Slasher
with heavy irony was not, however,
easily intimidated. With Slasher, you
got your money’s worth. He could bat
all day and half the next without an
anxious moment or a change of expres-
sion. Playing at Lord’s against England
in 1956, he took 264 minutes to score 31
runs a world record not universally
envied. Whenever Slasher walked out
on the Sydney Cricket Ground, the wits
on the Hill used to call out: “Where’s
your mattress, Mackay?” This was not
only because he scored so slowly but
also because they knew that he would be
there for a long, long time.
Sometimes, even his fellow Queens-
landers became a bit impatient with
Slasher. There was the time at the
’Gabba in 1949 when he took five hours,
22 minutes, to score 81 against Victoria.
The trouble was that Slasher’s job
most of the time was to “go in and stop
Drama in Adelaide: Lindsay Kline survives once again
the rot.” Rot-stopping no longer a
highly developed art takes time.
Slasher was an absolute master at it. “I
had to bat slowly so many times, I got
used to it,” he said.
A lot of people mocked the dour
Queenslander. He had this funny walk.
He was pigeon-toed and had flat feet.
He shuffled to the wicket. One English
cricket writer said he could forgive a
man for limping but not on both legs
at the same time. Slasher had droopy
eyelids and he chewed gum. Nor was he
any stylist with the bat. He would
crouch over it in a stance that made the
purists wince. His hook shot always
looked as if he had been startled by a
tap on the right shoulder.
The English Test captain Peter May
once said: “This man doesn't hit the
ball; he squirts it.” And he would bowl
his medium-pacers in a funny, cramped
style that looked as if he were going to
trip himself up.
Slasher never made a century in a
Test match, never even made it into the
nervous 90s. But he established his own
records. He was the first man to bat for
more than seven hours in his first Test
match. Len Hutton said: “Bowling at
this chap Mackay is like bowling at
Westminster Abbey.”
He never had any professional
coaching. He had no sponsors. He did
not even own a set of pads until he was
selected for Australia on the England
tour in 1962 when he was 29.
Because of his funny gait and his
unorthodox left-handed batting style,
the selectors had never been in a hurry
to select him.
These were the days when Sheffield
Shield players gave up their jobs and
earned 15 shillings each day they played
in the interstate competition. He had
been an outstanding schoolboy crick-
eter and played his first international
match for Queensland against Wally
Hammond’s English touring side in
1946. Slasher went on to play 37 Tests
for Australia between 1956 and 1963.
He made 1500 runs for Australia and
10,000 for Queensland.
The situation at the Adelaide Oval
during that fourth Test was made to
order for him. Slasher liked nothing
better than to defy opposing bowlers in
a crisis. Stumps were still nearly two
hours away when Lindsay Kline came
to join him at the wicket. Slasher had
been there since 2.30 and had scored 14.
Kline remembers it well. He plays
lawn bowls these days and runs his fire
protection equipment factory in
Melbourne. On that afternoon in
Adelaide, he little realised that he was
about to play his longest and most
important innings in Test cricket. When
the Australian wickets began to col-
lapse, he had gone out to the practice
net to take some deliveries from Norm
O’Neill. “I was bowled nine or 10
times,” Kline recalled last week. “I
knew nobody expected a lot of me. As I
walked onto the field, I heard people in
the members’ stand saying, ‘Well, it
won’t be long now.’
“Slasher said to me, ‘Just play every

ball as it comes along.’ Although I was a
bowler, I knew he thought I could bat a
bit and that gave me confidence. Also,
he wasn’t one for a lot of words which
probably helped. He’d just say, ‘Mid-off
has gone back’ or ‘Watch the marks’ or
‘Square leg has moved five yards closer.’
He had a very fine cricket brain which
people often didn’t realise and he was
a great team man. Early in the innings,
he farmed the strike but then he decided
we’d take one end each and just battle it
out. He would take the River end
because it was more difficult and I
would take the Cathedral end. At one
stage he said to me, ‘Get those pieces of
turf off the wicket’ and, to save time,
(Alf) Valentine took off his cap and
swept the wicket with it. I concentrated
hard. I made 15, including a four, I
think.”
At five o’clock, West Indies skipper
Worrell took the new ball and Hall
began rocketing down thunderbolts.
Slasher and Kline continued their calm
defence with Slasher nonchalantly
chewing as he played each ball with
superb dead-bat technique. Worrell
took Hall off after only three overs with
the new ball and the captain continued
the attack himself in company with
Sobers. A ring of fieldsmen surrounded
the bat, waiting for a catch.
“Every man on the field except the
bowler could pick Mackay’s pocket,”
said an ABC broadcaster.
The last ball of the second-last over,
Slasher scored a single to face the last
over against Hall who was the fastest
bowler in the world. In seven balls,
Slasher was hit twice. The eighth was a
no-ball (overs were longer then) but
members of the crowd thought it was all
over and had to be cleared from the
field. The last ball reared up at Slasher’s
ribcage. He saw the ball could not hit
the wicket and dared not risk an edge.
He played it with his body and the next
day they photographed the bruise and it
made all the papers. Slasher became a
hero not only to Queensland but to the
whole of Australia. He and Kline had
stayed at the wicket 109 minutes and 35
seconds. It was an innings that became
a legend.
“It wasn’t till afterwards that we
discovered that we’d stopped the nation
that everyone was listening or watch-
ing,” said Kline.
At the fifth Test, in Melbourne, it was
appropriately Slasher (with Johnny
Martin) who ran the winning single a
bye to give Australia victory in the
series.
When he retired, Queensland ran a
“bob in for Slasher” campaign and
400,000 shillings ($40,000 in 1966 terms)
was raised.
Ken “Slasher” Mackay died in
Brisbane in 1982, inappropriately of
heart failure. □
EDUCATION
How to guard
children
against AIDS
A demonstration outside the NSW parliament
By GEOFFREY PARTINGTON*
WHILE THERE IS little doubt that the
main cause of the spread of AIDS is the
promiscuous lifestyle among a great
majority of homosexuals, many victims
of AIDS will be children and non-
homosexual adults.
The response of homosexual activists
to the death of babies from AIDS in
Brisbane and to the threat of an epi-
demic of plague proportions has not
been to review the lifestyle they have so
long extolled to the rest of us, but rather
to warn against “hysteria.”
Adelaide homosexual group, the
Catch 22 Collective, describes wide-
spread concern about AIDS as evidence
of “religious bigotry and long-standing
hatred of homosexuality.”
AIDS has already claimed more
victims in Australia in a few weeks than
has nuclear radiation over 30 years of
testing and of uranium mining, but
those who endanger all our lives calmly
advise us to avoid panic and hysteria.
Educators must surely reconsider the
way in which over the last 10 years
governmental agencies in Australia
have actively aided the spread of
homosexuality among the young by
insisting that its attractions be brought
to the attention of high school students
by “selected homosexuals.”
In 1977 the three royal com-
missioners on Human Relationships,
Justice Elizabeth Evatt, Ms Anne
Deveson and Dr Felix Arnott,
recommended that “education courses
should reflect a view of homosexuality
as a variation of sexuality” and that
“education should be given to children
in schools, to parents, teachers and
medical schools about homosexuals and
that selected homosexuals should be
involved in such programs.”
There is indeed a case for involving
selected homosexuals, preferably a
selection from gay people suffering
from terminal AIDS, in educating
young people about the realities of this
particular alternative lifestyle, but the
royal commission urged that the
selected homosexuals should explain
that the homosexual lifestyle is a valid,
positive and healthy alternative.
South Australia naturally was ahead
of the pack and actually anticipated the
royal commission recommendations. As
early as 1976 South Australia issued a
teachers’ handbook for health educa-
tion in Years 8-10 (13 to 15-year-olds)
which suggested that “guest speakers
from relevant community groups be
invited to present points of view for
discussion on such topics as
homosexuality, abortion, family life,
venereal disease, etc.” Helpful ad-
dresses were provided for teachers, in-
cluding “Radical Lesbians v. Com-
munications Collective,” Gay Liber-
ation, CAMP '(Campaign Against
Moral Persecution) and “Doctor
Dunstan, Revolutionary Bookshop.”
The Government of Victoria for
some time offered more resistance. In
1979 the Melbourne Gay Teachers’ and
Students Group published the book
Young, Proud and Gay which included
among its gems: “1 pity them, the ones
that call themselves ‘straight’ ... for
missing out on something really beauti-
ful,” “if you find anal intercourse a little
hard, it may be that you need to practise

For the protection of people, their property,
their crops and livestock, Cyclone products are
renowned for their reliability and innovation.
Good ideas like Cyclone “Pool-Line” safety
fencing and gates, the famous “Ringlock” stock
fence, Cyclone Butler grain silos, stock handling
yards and the Cyclone “Protector” farm
building. The list of Cyclone products is
extensive, providing such things as scaffolding,
materials handling and storage systems, to
handy products for the home gardener. All this
reflects the Boral reputation for innovation in
other fields such as building products and
industrial engineering.
We’ve prepared a book called “Our
Credentials” which shows all of Boral’s

a bit for the pleasure to come through,
just like anything else that’s new,” and
“ideas that sex is only for marriage
really do screw people up.”
The then Education minister later
Victorian Premier, Lindsay Thompson,
directed high school principals to
remove this book from their libraries. In
retaliation the Victorian Secondary
Teachers’ Association and the Techni-
cal Teachers’ Association of Victoria,
prominent in recent months for their
generous gifts to Mr Arthur Scargill,
bought up copies of Young, Proud and
Gay and distributed them free to all
their school branches. These unions
claimed that “teachers need resources
such as Young, Proud and Gay because
much of the currently available material
is incorrect and unhelpful.”
In Victoria and several other states
children have ready access to books
such as Young, Proud and Gay in their
school libraries, but fairy stories, Enid
Blyton and most of the corpus of world
literature have been purged because
they are alleged to perpetuate sexual
stereotypes by displaying men and
women, boys and girls, in “traditional
sex roles” and by using “sexist
language” such as “mankind” and
“postman.”
Teacher unions have actively pro-
moted the right of homosexuals and
lesbians not only to be employed as
teachers but to proselytise. Meetings of
radical homosexual groups are ad-
vertised and sympathetically reported
in union journals and union confer-
ences give considerable attention to
lesbian and homosexual issues.
In the SAIT Teachers’ Journal exten-
sive coverage was given to the discus-
sions on these issues at the 1984
Adelaide Conference of the Australian
Teachers’ Federation. Louise Sekulic
wrote that her highlights included
“remembering that heterosexuality is
but one expression of sexuality,” while
Janet Giles noted that “the protection of
the rights of male homosexual and
lesbian teachers was a major issue for
discussion at the ATF Conference.”
The notion that children have any
right to be protected from proselytising
or even from predatory homosexual,
and lesbian teachers was not reported as
having been mooted at the ATF Confer-
ence.
Another “expression of sexuality”
which has recently been advanced as a
valid, positive and healthy alternative is
paedophilia sexual relationships be-
tween an adult and a child of the same
sex.
Not surprisingly paedophilia is not
conceived by its practitioners as a form
of adult lust but as a “sexual right of the
child.” Paedophiles, like mainline
homosexuals, have developed what they
term a “political” argument, that “the
nuclear family is inherently oppressive
of the child with the power relations
skewed irreversibly in favor of the
parents and particularly the father.”
The rights of paedophiles and of
“boys who love men” are frequently
advocated in mainline homosexual
publication such as Gay Community
News and Out Rage.
When the Delta Task Force formed
by the Victorian Police arrested
members of the Paedophile Support
Group in Melbourne late in 1983 on
charges of systematic corruption of
minors, mainly schoolchildren, Out-
Rage attacked the arrests as “a threat to
all gay people.”
Some feminists, even including some
radical lesbians, have to their credit
criticised male homosexuals who have
abused public positions of trust, as
social workers, foster parents or
teachers, to seduce boys in their care.
Increasingly though, this strand of
moral concern has shrunk among
mainline homosexual and lesbian
groups.
The workshop on “Lesbians and
Paedophilia” at the 1982 national con-
ference for lesbians and homosexual
men concluded that no boundaries can
ever be set for what is sexually “correct”
or “normal” and the slogan was
advanced that “their struggle is our
struggle.”
Most lesbians and homosexuals are
not paedophiles, but they see them as
allies in the same struggle against
“bourgeois and patriarchial gender
relationships.”
Similarly the members of royal com-
missions, departments of education and
teacher unions who “normalised”
homosexuality and lesbianism and
facilitated its widespread advocacy in
our schools were not themselves
homosexuals or lesbians for the most
part. They too held that there is no
enemy on the left and that all enemies
of the traditional family deserve
encouragement and are in some sense
part of a common movement of liber-
ation.
On other occasions the left establish-
ment will apparently go out of its way to
defend the right of all minority groups
to receive full initiation into their own
ethnic traditions and moral beliefs, but
this solicitude is never extended to the
moral traditions of British Australia, to
the Christian values which all our
schools, state as well as independent,
accepted at least implicitly until only
some 20 years ago. That tradition and
those values have been and continue to
be the main target of assault by a motley
coalition of special interest groups.
Now the chickens are coming home
to roost. Now, as with the bubonic
plague, leprosy or cholera, personal
afflictions have become public concerns.
Our progressivist establishment even
now remains uncertain whether still to
oppose any restrictions on homosexual
activity or to seek self-preservation.
The Queensland Government has set
an example for all other Australian
governments. The policies of Sir Joh
Bjelke-Petersen and of Lin Powell,
his Education minister, on homosexual
activism are little different, the left
should remember, from those of Fidel
Castro and the late Chairman Mao.
Whatever steps may be proposed to
safeguard Australia from the ravages of
AIDS, immediate steps must be taken
throughout the commonwealth to pro-
tect school children from homosexual
interference with their minds or with
their bodies. □


ABORIGINES
Row continues
over flight
of the stones
NEVILLE G. PERKINS, general man-
ager of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, com-
ments on the story of the removal of the
Strehlow collection from Australia ...
THE ASTONISHING article “Flight of
the sacred stones,” by Tim Duncan (B,
November 13) stands out to be con-
siderably challenged and corrected.
As one of the persons named in this
article and as a proud Aranda descend-
ant of Central Australia, I must register
a strong protest about the way
in which your reporter has
exercised much journalistic
licence in presenting a report
riddled with so much bias and
a number of inaccuracies.
More importantly, how-
ever, I must deplore at the
outset the outrageous actions
of the Strehlow Foundation in
exporting from this nation to
foreign shores one of our most
sacred and priceless collec-
tions of Aranda tjurungas and
cultural material ever to be in
the hands of non-Aborigines.
That representatives of the
foundation have, without
prior consultation with the
appropriate Aranda elders
and community leaders,
removed this most sacred and
significant collection from
South Australia in such a
clandestine manner is one of
the most provocative and in-
sensitive acts of this century
against my Aranda people,
our culture and the Aborig-
inal community at large.
It is extremely distressing
that the export of this collec-
tion by the foundation has,
wittingly or unwittingly, con-
tributed to the further
desecration and destruction
of our traditional Aranda
culture and heritage. Many of
my people are deeply sad-
dened and shocked by the
extreme over-reactions of the
Strehlow Foundation in May
this year. We are a proud,
dignified people with a rich
culture and values. Many of
our people have been in
mourning for the sad loss of a
very sacred and integral part
of our being, heritage, culture
and ceremonies.
Without revealing too much, I can
indicate for the benefit of your readers
that these sacred tjurungas are made of
specially selected stone and wood with
ancient markings of most significance to
initiated Aranda men in Central
Australia.
They probably date back thousands
of years into the Dreamtime and they
are vital to the continuation of our
Dreaming, culture, ceremonies and
traditions. These tjurungas are powerful
objects used to instruct initiated Aranda
men mainly in Aranda law, traditions
and secrets at special ceremonies. They
are not mere chattels for export or for
any commercial gain or for the pleasure
of non-Aborigines.
For your reporter and his various
correspondents to suggest that this most
sacred Aranda collection had to be
Professor Strehlow and wife: tjurungas not for women’s eyes
VIC GRIMMETT
removed from Australia for, inter alia,
protection against “political attack,”
“political chaos” and to avoid blood
being spilled is most absurd. If Pro-
fessor Ted Strehlow were alive today, I
do not believe that he would have
allowed the foundation to go to such an
extreme.
As your reporter has presented only
one side of the story and has not
bothered to contact Aranda community
leader Charles Perkins or myself to
obtain our side of the story, I hope you
will be decent enough to allow me the
opportunity to enlighten your readers
with the necessary facts.
During August 1977, I was advised
for the first time by a number of Central
and Western Aranda elders that Pro-
fessor Strehlow who was an eminent
anthropologist and so-called expert on
Aranda traditions had gath-
ered over the years a most
sacred, priceless collection of
Aranda tjurungas and other
traditional material. He had
obtained Aboriginal
ceremonial objects for his per-
sonal collection in his travels
throughout Central Australia
and specifically he had taken
possession of ancient Aranda
tjurungas in a “surrender
ceremony” near Hermanns-
burg Mission some time in the
19505.
Professor Strehlow was not
only an eminent anthropol-
ogist who grew up on Aranda
culture and traditions but he
could speak Western Aranda
fluently and he was taken into
close confidence by our
Western Aranda people in the
early days. He was trusted and
highly regarded by our people
in those days.
When Professor Strehlow
was entrusted with the ancient
Aranda tjurungas at the “sur-
render ceremony,” I was told
that he was requested to
return with the tjurungas per-
iodically to participate in
further ceremonies where the
secret laws and traditions
could be passed on to the
initiated Aranda men.
Sadly and regrettably, Pro-
fessor Strehlow apparently
did not return with all the
tjurungas required for these
important ceremonies. Con-
sequently, the ceremonies
could not be properly con-
ducted and a number of
Aranda initiates over the
years were denied the op-
portunity to have passed on to
them ancient traditions and
secret laws.

When I was elected as the member
for Mac Donnell in the Northern Terri-
tory Legislative Assembly in August
1977 a predominantly Aboriginal
electorate in which Aranda people are a
significant force I was asked by
Aranda elders, some of whom have
since passed away and should not be
named, to approach Professor Strehlow
in Adelaide for the return of these
tjurungas and ceremonial objects to
their rightful place in Central Australia
to enable the proper continuation of
Aranda ceremonies, culture and
heritage. This I did not only as the
member for Mac Donnell and on behalf
of my elders but also at the request of
the Central Australian Aboriginal Con-
gress, Central Land Council and Cen-
tral Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid
Service. Indeed, I was fully supported
also by Aranda elders and leaders in the
mission to seek the return of these
tjurungas and other cultural material.
Not long afterward, I approached
Professor Strehlow in Adelaide for the
return of the tjurungas. In addition, the
ABC This Day Tonight program or-
ganised a television interview between
him and myself. However, Professor
Strehlow, seemingly on the advice of his
wife, refused not only to return the
tjurungas to their rightful place but also
refused to allow any limited access for
future Aranda ceremonies in Central
Australia.
We were most disappointed and
disillusioned with the attitude adopted
by Professor Strehlow at the time,
despite our genuine approach. A
number of our elders were heartbroken
and concerned for the future of Aranda
culture and ceremonies.
There were subsequent appeals over
the years by some Central and Western
Aranda elders to Professor Strehlow to
return the tjurungas and other
ceremonial objects but, regrettably, to
no avail. At one stage, we were even
considering legal action in the form of
taking out a writ of detinue to recover
the Aranda property in the possession
of the foundation. It was a most
frustrating experience.
When Professor Strehlow later
passed away, we learned by accident
that he had done the extraordinary
thing of bequeathing this most sacred
and priceless collection of tjurungas to
his second European wife Mrs Kathy
Strehlow who should not be in
possession of these tjurungas because
they are meant only for secret Aranda
men’s business. That Mrs Strehlow was
bequeathed custody of the collection of
tjurungas and other Aranda cultural
material made the matter even more
complicated and frustrating. To add
insult to injury, it was later revealed that
the foundation, for a fee, had given
photographs of secret Aranda initiation
Charles Perkins: he attended a protest meeting west of the Alice
ceremonies which to our consternation
were published in a German magazine
and subsequently seen by women and
the uninitiated around Australia.
So strong is the feeling among
Aborigines, both Aranda and non-
Aranda, that about 120 traditional
Aboriginal elders and community
leaders all men met at “Thata” in
Ellery Creek (100 kilometres west of
Alice Springs) in November this year to
discuss The Bulletin article and the
export of the Aranda tjurungas and
other cultural material. Women were
excluded from this meeting due to the
nature of the business.
Charles Perkins and I were sum-
moned to attend this meeting, along
with the various lawmen, elders, custod-
ians and leaders of the Central and
Western Aranda tribal groups. Present
also were senior traditional men from
the Warlpiri, Pitjantjatjara, Anamtjera
and Loritja tribal groups of Central
Australia.
This most historic meeting resolved
that the Prime Minister and Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs should take whatever
action necessary to secure the immedi-
ate return of this Aranda collection to
Central Australia. It was further
resolved that there would be another
meeting early in the new year to decide
where this collection should be per-
manently located and preserved, should
it be returned.
Mr Helmut Pareroultja, an Aranda
community leader of Hermannsburg
and a member of the Strehlow Founda-
tion, claimed at this meeting that he had
no prior knowledge of the export of this
Aranda collection from Australia and
that he was most surprised to hear what
had happened.
To our surprise, this meeting was
told that Mr Bob Liddle — one of the
persons named in The Bulletin article —
had agreed to the export of the Aranda
tjurungas by the foundation. Mr Liddle
was severely criticised for his actions by
this meeting.
It is a great pity that Tim Duncan did
not bother to contact Charles Perkins or
myself for we would have genuinely
assisted him with a number of pertinent
facts concerning the foundation and he
could have presented a more positive,
balanced, correct and fair report on the
saga.
The lawmen, custodians, elders and
leaders of our Aranda people are most
anxious and determined to secure the
return of this collection to its rightful
place in Central Australia. We are
hopeful that the Prime Minister and
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will
greatly assist us in this most important
quest.
We will not rest until this very
significant part of our Aranda Dream-
ing, culture, heritage and law is returned
to its rightful place and to its real
owners.
Neville G. Perkins O.A.M.
GENERAL MANAGER
TIM DUNCAN replies:
1. It was not The Bulletin which said that
blood would be spilled; it was the
Hermannsburg elders referred to by
name in the article and accurately
quoted.


2. Charles Perkins may like to be
described as an Aranda community
leader but he is not a traditional elder
and he has no recognized expertise in
sacred Aranda traditions.
3. Regarding the “surrender ceremony,”
Neville Perkins does not state whom his
informants are. As far as The Bulletin is
aware, he has not spoken with any of
the elders who actually worked with
Strehlow. The Bulletin spoke to two of
them at Hermannsburg. Furthermore,
the overwhelming view of the
Hermannsburg elders was that the
tjurunga should not return to them.
They said this because they were
worried that no one was left alive with
sufficient knowledge and authority to
take proper responsibility.
There is no basis for Perkins’ implied
view that Strehlow himself was
somehow to blame for the ancient lore
dying out. But for Strehlow, even less of
Aranda culture would have been
recorded and preserved. It is up to
Perkins to identify which men gave their
tjurunga to Strehlow on the understand-
ing that he would cart them back to the
Centre regularly.
4. Perkins’ 1977 attempt to take the
collection back was a political move.
None of the land councils, legal aid
services and congresses he mentions
that supported him have any traditional
authority over the Strehlow tjurunga.
That authority was never tendered by
those who worked with Strehlow and
gave him their tjurunga.
5. The collection was part of the
Strehlow estate. Even in Aranda tradi-
tion, it would be legitimate for that
estate to be held in trust for Strehlow’s
son Carl. There is no evidence that
Kathy Strehlow has treated the collec-
tion with disrespect. She has not put the
sensitive tjurunga on public display.
6. The November meeting according
to the foundation, the Warlpiri,
Pitjantjatjara and Anmatjera people
have no traditional authority even to
discuss the Aranda tjurunga. Who
“summoned” Charles and Neville Per-
kins to this meeting? No senior people
who had worked with Strehlow were at
it, according to Bob Liddle.
Perkins says that Helmut Pareroultja
had no knowledge of the export of the
tjurunga. This is quite so, as the article
makes clear. Pareroultja gave the foun-
dation his blessings to do what they
thought was necessary.
At that meeting, Pareroultja had a
stand-up argument with Charles Perkins
and the latter was accused of muscling
in on an area where he had a vested
interest.
Finally, Neville Perkins seems to
have ignored both his role and that of
Charles Perkins in contributing to the
climate of distrust which led to the
export of the collection. □
DINING
BYO - that
can go for
the food, too
England's wittiest gastronome,
CLEMENT FREUD, recently visited
Melbourne. The experience, as can be
seen from the following piece which
appeared in Punch, was a culinary disas-
ter.
TRAVEL broadens the mind: I know
I read it in a guide-book. I write from
Melbourne where a man’s chance of
getting food manifesting even an
element of regional excellence is as
likely as are Australia’s chances of
beating the Windies at cricket.
Twelve thousand miles (20,000 km)
from Wimpole Street, I breakfasted on
United Dairies-type orange juice, a
mundane selection of Kellogg’s cereals
in cardboard boxes, heavy croissants,
cold toast, gold-foil-wrapped packets of
butter and plastic tubs of marmalade
imported from sunny West Germany.
Had I gone out of my hotel, turned
left and taken the third street on the
right, I could have gone to the
McDonald’s, next to the Chinese take-
away across the road from the Regency
coffee-shop.
Goodness knows, I did not expect
grilled wombat, koala soup or goanna
(what they call the lizard of Oz) on
toast, not even souffle'ed emu, but it
would have been good to have come
across just one item of food that was
different and local.
We gave the world brown Windsor
soup, bubble and squeak, toad-in-the-
hole and milk and nut chocolate: the
Australians countered with pie and it
was our sort of pie at that, the kind that
crouches in the glass cupboards on the
counters of British pubs. Even their
tomato ketchup is boring heavy on
coloring, flavoring, stabiliser, emulsifier
and mono-sodium glutamate.
When I mentioned my disappoint-
ment to a local citizen, he said there
were always Sydney oysters beaut,
sweet, small and reasonably in-
expensive (until you consider just how
small they are).
He was right but oysters which might
so easily be the base of a sensational
new Antipodean billibi that classic
forgotten soup made from the liquor
and beards of Colchester natives
rescued from the barrel between the
oyster’s legs, simmered with white wine
and double cream, sieved and garnished
with oyster quenelles are mostly
served at room temperature with a
cocktail sauce. Australian rooms are
currently warm.
The raw materials here are
sensational: beautiful meat, an almost
infinite variety of marvellous fresh fish
and seafood, excellent veges (even
vegies) and, in two weeks of receptions
and dinners and parties and outings
here and there, the most original dish
was a cold stroganoff.
I am not at all sure that the in-
novative temperature was intentional.
Coleslaw is around and potato salad


straight out of the industrial caterer’s
handbook: also lettuce leaves in varying
states of disarray, sliced tomato and
parsley tiber alles.
What is smashing is the Australian
wine: crisp clean whites, mellow reds
that mature in half-a-dozen years or less
and these are proudly sold under local
names no longer do they bear mis-
leading appellations Franglais. You buy
the wine at a grog shop for anything
from $3 - for what you would expect
for that sort of money to about $lO
for marvellously well-made char-
donnay or decent local champagne.
Then you look for a restaurant bearing
the magic letters “BYO," which means
Bring Your Own, and for a charge of 30
cents a person they open the bottle and
supply a pedestrian glass.
The best non-meal I found for in-
expensive consumption with the wine
(which they sell at the right tempera-
ture) was at a place in a northern suburb
where, under the modest heading of
“Sausages,” they served half a dozen
varieties one pork, one veal, one
coarsely grounded and garlicky, an-
other heavily spiced with chilli pepper,
a saveloy and a frankfurter.
Now, why can they not invent an
Australian sausage? Is it that the East
European ethnic minorities who have
ever been the sausage-makers for the
rest of the old continent are jealous of
their secret smoking and blending pro-
cesses?
It does not seem a lot to offer up
to a new country and the world, I
would have thought, is just about ready
for a new radical delicacy based on
Rother pig.
Ozage is an ideal name. If it catches
on, I would like a small royalty: I have
always wanted to be able to say that I
had worldwide business interests.
If you should read this and ask
whether the man has forgotten his vows
of fatless, saltless veges (or beaut
vegies), the answer is, “Not on your
nellie.” It has been a hard road forego-
ing official hospitality in favor of a not-
too-French french bean but your
correspondent has borne up and his
hostesses have been only middling per-
plexed.
About Ozages, let us not forget that
casing contains neither calories nor fat
and is well shaped to receive a mixture
of spinach and egg-white and herbs and
ginger and onion. Such a Vegozage
would be baked in the oven in a little
white wine and be served with a selec-
tion of acceptable relishes such as
mustard, horseradish and hot chilli
sauce.
As for a wine substitute, I have
decided that none is acceptable and that
a glass or three now and then can
be walked off in an extra 15 minutes of
daily exercise. □

THE ARTS
Honors galore from the world’s
most novel monarchy
The Caribbean island of Redonda has been handing out fancy titles to writers
for more than a century. DENIS PITTS talks to the king and queen who are restoring
the honors' significance after a spree.
“HAVE A BEER," said the King of
Redonda. He clicked open a can from
his refrigerator and frothed it into a tall
glass.
“I don't drink at lunchtime because
I'm a workaholic and, anyway, it’s
been a heavy sort of weekend. The
queen is knocking up some bread and
cheese. She'll be along in a minute."
Such an occasion would make even
the most cynical observer believe that
Alice really did get to Wonderland. It
was a beautiful summer day; blackbirds
were chattering in a superb English gar-
den and here was an ever-cheerful bald-
headed man announcing himself to be
the lawful king of a foreign tealm and,
what's more, meaning it.
There was only one answer; to sit
back, drink the beer, eat bread and
cheese and listen.
The Redonda story has been told
and retold wherever London’s lesser
literati gather to damn their publishers,
abuse agents and drown each others'
sorrows in lesser-quality wines. It is a
tale tinted with Irish
whimsy, tinged with
fantasy and touched with
sadness.
It began in the year
1865 when Matthew
Dowdy Shiell, an Irish
trader, sailed to Mont-
serrat in the Caribbean
with his free-slave wife
and their eight daughters.
As they sailed past the
desolate and inhospitable
island of Redonda (named
by Christopher Colum-
bus), a son was born.
Shiell the elder, who
like so many Irishmen
believed himself to be de-
scended from the kings of
Ireland, declared his new-
born to be the King of
Redonda. Fifteen years
later, Matthew Phipps
Shiel (he was to drop the
final M’) was crowned on
the windblown summit of
The kingdom of Redonda: populated by booby birds, lizards and rats
King Juan II, publisher and novelist Jon Wynne-Tyson
the rock by the Bishop of
Antigua.
This was a capricious
piece of annexation.
Redonda offered nothing,
it seemed, except some
dangerous rock faces, a
population of booby birds,
lizards and rats. To land
was usually impossible
because of heavy surf.
Shiell senior had
achieved his purpose, how-
ever: He had a king in the
family.
Matthew Phipps Shiel
went to England to study.
He tried medicine but that
ambition soon was to be
displaced by a capacity to
write. And write he did
passionate, flamboyant
and wholly undisciplined
novels which brought him
literary acclaim.
The most noted of these


was The Purple Cloud. Eventually, it was
made into a film The World, the Flesh
and the Devil with Harry Belafonte.
While the young king was enjoying
success in England, his father was fight-
ing a losing battle with the British gov-
ernment.
Redonda did have a value, it seemed.
It took the form of thousands of tonnes
of guano solidified bird droppings
which sold well then as fertiliser.
A mining company moved in and the
British formally annexed the island.
Shiell protested vehemently. The British
had gunboats but they did not dispute
the sovereignty vested in the king-in-
exile.
Filipe the First, as he
called himself, died in
relative obscurity in 1947.
He had been granted a
Civil List pension.
Shiel bequeathed his
title, his island, his robe of
office a velvet smoking
jacket and millions of
words of manuscript to his
literary executor, John
Gawsworth. There had
been a crown but it was
lost.
Gawsworth was a poet
who had peaked too soon,
a brilliant bibliographer
and an opportunist. Within
months of Shell’s death,
the second king who
declared himself to be
King Juan I and had him-
self crowned in an upstairs
room at a Soho, London,
pub was busying himself
in the creation of a “liter-
ary aristocracy.”
The new monarch
produced, at some considerable ex-
pense, a birthday honors list in which he
ennobled some 44 writers and sundry
intellectuals. Arthur Machen became an
archduke; Arthur Ransome, Eden
Philpotts, Frank Swinnerton and Dylan
Thomas were dukes. Lawrence Durrell
and Henry Miller were to become the
Dukes of Cervantes Pequena and of
Thuana, respectively.
More honors were to follow. J. B.
Priestley, Rebecca West, Dorothy L.
Sayers and Stephen Potter were among
a host of writers distinguished and
otherwise whose names appeared on
court circulars printed on 18th century
hand-made paper.
Grand-sounding “orders” were in-
troduced. Publishers, magazine writers,
a whole collection of hacks, found
themselves possessors of the non-exist-
ent “Star of Redonda.” Fabian of the
yard (Robert Fabian, a much-publicised
detective of his time who produced his
memoirs) became the Duke of Verdugo
and commissioner of police. The vicar
of Soho was appointed to the “arch-
episcopal see” of an island totally
without hope of a congregation.
It was all good, harmless and eccen-
tric fun much of it centring on the
bars of Bloomsbury, Soho and Fleet
Street.
The problem was that the king was
beginning to disintegrate.
Juan I had a taste for Burgundy.
Having sold much of the artefacts of the
State of Redonda it was a time when
American cultural foundations were
bidding large sums of money for any-
thing British and literary, including
Shiel’s regal smoking jacket
Gawsworth became less and less
Juan II plants the national flag on the island’s summit
choosey about handing out honors.
He was desperately poor and was
prepared to offer a knighthood to
anyone who would buy him a drink at
the bar of the French Pub, a particular
haunt of the literary demimonde in Lon-
don, or at any bar within 500 metres of
Bloomsbury Square.
Gawsworth even sold the manuscript
of the Redonda national anthem a
fine, resounding piece by Leigh Henry
with lines such as:
God who gave our island soil
In trust for ever more
Grant Grace that by our faith and toil
We hold our heirloom pure.
The disintegration continued. Any
publican prepared to allow King Juan I
a pound or so on the slate could expect
to become a grand duke by closing time.
The crunch came when Gawsworth
put a small-ad in The Times offering the
kingship for £lOOO (about $1450).
The replies came in their hundreds.
Even the Crown Prince of Sweden,
clearly bored with being a prince, sent a
£5O deposit. There was a good night in
the French Pub when Gawsworth
cashed that cheque over the bar.
The potential sale was too much for
the “genuine” literary aristocracy. A
Privy Council meeting was held in the
Fitzroy Tavern and the king was
forbidden to sell his realm. Soon after,
Gawsworth now a sad, discredited
and lonely figure who had taken to
sleeping in doorways and cardboard
boxes disappeared from the London
scene and died. Only a few cronies
who were aware that he once had won
the Benson prize for poetry and been a
freeman of the City of London
mourned him.
THE STORY MOVES to
the present and to a garden
in Sussex where the present
king and his queen are
opening cans of beer and
serving bread and cheese.
Juan II turns out to be
publisher and novelist Jon
Wynne-Tyson, a man of
wit and charm, who has
been more than sparing in
the handing-out of honors
since his accession in 1970.
He described himself as
a “reluctant monarch.” He
was appointed both Shiel’s
and Gawsworth’s literary
executor which made him,
by precedent, the royal
successor.
“The problem that I in-
herited was that Gaws-
worth had debased the
whole literary currency by
handing out honors to his
drinking companions,”
Juan II said.
“The original concept was an excel-
lent one.
“A Redonda dukedom was an hon-
or, a kind of recognition which the
recipient enjoyed because it was amus-
ing, harmless and because it was be-
stowed by fellow writers.
“The sad truth, however, was that
Gawsworth had an ulterior motive: he
was a great collector of literary memor-
abilia and he was able to flog the letters
of acceptance from the famous.”
Wynne-Tyson may be self-effacing
about his kingly role in this curious
drama but he was the first monarch to
set foot on the island since Filipe I was
crowned there.
The first royal return to Redonda
was sponsored by a wealthy American
industrialist, A. Reynolds Morse, a
man deeply imbued with a fascination
for Shiel and his writings.
Morse is also the Grand Duke of
Redonda.
The landing party consisted of


Wynne-Tyson, Morse and sundry other
Americans and residents of nearby
Montserrat. They were accompanied by
Rastafarians (“They were sent along
to make sure that this wasn’t some kind
of coup,” said Wynne-Tyson. “The
Antiguan government has no sense of
humor.”) and were viewed only by the
boobies and goats as they scaled the
320 m heights.
“It was a bloody dangerous oper-
ation,” said the king. “Those above us
were sending down whacking great
boulders and we were lucky no one was
hurt.”
When they reached the summit, the
king read a proclamation (“... to con-
firm our right and desire to invite
friendly and fruitful co-operation with
the government of Antigua...”) and
planted the flag of Redonda.
The flag was a tricolor of blue (for
the sea), green (for the vegetation) and
brown (for the patches of earth to be
found on the island). The green part was
made up by the present queen from the
remnants of a pair of Marks and
Spencers pyjamas.
The party then set out to explore the
little kingdom.
The guano mining had long since fin-
ished, although the workings remained.
The new feature was a wooden shack,
perched dangerously on a high ledge,
with a large sign declaring itself to be
the REDONDA POST OFFICE.
Wynne-Tyson knocked on the door
to find, to his amazement, a
postmaster in full uniform complete
with gold braid and selling first covers
of a stamp issue.
The members of the party returned
to their various countries and little more
was to be heard of Redonda until this
year when Wynne-Tyson returned to
the island with Queen Jennifer who was
to set foot there for the first time.
Wynne-Tyson had spent a winter liv-
ing in a hut and writing a book in which
a king of an island curiously similar
to his realm - is heavily featured. The
book, published by Pythian, is called So
Say Banana Bird.
“The first visit was intended to publi-
cise a re-issue of some of Shiel’s books
in America,” he told me.
“The second visit, to be truthful, was
to publicise my own book. It seems only
reasonable that I should use my title
thus.
“Apart from that, I shall remain a
quiet and retiring king and I shall grant
honors only to those who perform some
kind of service to Redonda (he created
five dukedoms to those who ac-
companied him on his first visit), par-
ticularly in terms of the environment.”
And his queen? Jennifer Wynne-
Tyson is one of those pleasant, middle-
class ladies who is much more suited to
that well-manicured Sussex garden than
to scrambling over rocks on a distant
desert island.
Queen Jennifer and her husband
have never used their titles in public.
Jon Wynne-Tyson shudders at the
thought.
“We have a friend who uses her
duchess title to get seats in restaurants
and it works for her. How can I ring and
tell people that I am the queen?” asked
Jennifer.
There could well be a postscript to
this story.

THEATRE
STC gets set
for launching
at Wharf
By GLENDA THOMPSON
THE SYDNEY Theatre Company’s
new home, in the shadow of the Harbor
Bridge, is an old Walsh Bay cargo wharf
cunningly reworked. Company per-
sonnel moved in two weeks ago. The
state government spent $4 million on
the conversion.
The finger wharf posed a problem
for the architects wanting to make it
into a theatre, rehearsal rooms, offices
and workshops. The pragmantic step
would have been to put the theatre
closest to the shore, for easy access, but
that would not have made the most
spectacular use of the site.
Getting people to the end of the
wharf and making the old wooden
structure safe was the brief.
The clever solution was to install a
fireproof tunnel of steel and concrete
stretching the length of the 350 metre
structure.
The tunnel opens on to each public
and work area and has smoke extractors
and its own set of stairs. With a
sprinkler system and other measures,
fire protection cost $1 million.
The tunnel looks modern there has
The new Wharf Theatre, converted from an old Walsh Bay cargo wharf, to be the home of the Sydney Theatre Company


been no attempt to trick it out as an
original part of the 62-year-old wharf.
The integrity of the shell has been
maintained. The tarred floors and
woodbeam walls remain rough. Three
big roof gantries have been left in one
room as a reminder of its heritage. The
building carries a National Trust
classification.
The top of the tunnel doubles as a
mezzanine walkway and viewing
platform to the many rooms along its
length. Starting at the scenery building
workshops, the viewer progresses from
scenery assembly and painting to the
wardrobe and then to spaceous
rehearsal rooms and the 320-seat
theatre.
The foyer on the tip has wide water
views and two decks which will attract
patrons on hot nights.
The paint floor is one of the largest in
Australia it can take the biggest stage
cloth needed in any theatre in the
country, according to general manager
Donald McDonald.
Most areas receive natural light and
air. “It’s the ideal working environ-
ment,” says McDonald. “It’s marvellous
to be in one place.
“We’ll be a real theatre company for
the first time, in a sense. Up to now, the
scenery’s been made here; the paint
shop’s at Glebe, wardrobe stores at
Ultimo ...”
The company, formed in 1978 on the
demise of that of the Old Tote, will
continue to use the Drama Theatre at
the Opera House for its main produc-
tions. The new theatre will be for
intimate and experimental works pre-
viously staged at The Stables in Kings
Cross. Administration was at the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s building in
Woolloomooloo.
McDonald says that people will be
encouraged to visit the wharf, to take
classes, hold functions there and hire
costumes. He believes the foyer would
be ideal for late-night cabaret.
One of the three rehearsal rooms in the new theatre
“Whatever revenue we can get from
these sources will relieve pressure on the
box office and subsidies,” he says.
The Sydney Dance Company will
share the scenery workshop and box
office. It is moving in downstairs at the
wharf. The rest of the building is
earmarked as craft studios.
The dance company already shares
the Drama Theatre at the Opera House.
The Wharf Theatre’s first offering
will be a season of 10 one-act plays
starting about January 19. Premier
Neville Wran will open the building
officially on December 13.
Wran’s office was closely concerned
with the project, according to govern-
ment architect David Churches. Con-
servation expert Churches, and private
practitioner Vivien Fraser did the job
jointly.
Churches says that the Maritime
Services Board, which owns the wharf,
wanted to pull it down. “Those build-
ings have a fantastic quality, through
their sheer size. We set out to prove a
radical new use could be introduced
sympathetically.
“Unfortunately, conserved buildings
are often turned into tourist traps.” □

poser for
funny-bones
The Castanet Club: a potent and much-needed national tonic
By BRIAN HOAD
THERE WERE 101 or possibly 1001
so-called comedy acts on the fringe of
this year’s Adelaide Festival. At any
rate, it was the biggest turn-out that
anybody could remember and, for the
most part, it was awful.
God knows that we could do with a
good laugh in troubled times but the
comedians at Adelaide seemed mostly
intent on generating primal screams
with displays of raucous anarchy, ram-
pant paranoia and political hysteria.
Democratic socialists of the arts
world (who tend to believe that genius
resides in every soul, needing only the
monetary encouragement of govern-
ment to bring it into bloom) tried to
argue that these monstrous displays of
self-indulgent amateurism were not
only socially significant but also
cathartic as if the arts were nothing
more than some sort of therapy which
ought to be financed by Medicare. But
audiences in general did not agree and
tended to look for more reliable
catharsis at the nearest bar.
And then, quite unexpectedly, there
arrived from fun-loving Newcastle
(New South Wales) a group called The
Castanet Club which put on a convinc-
ing demonstration that life is still full of
delightful whimsies, fanciful escapades
and eccentric pranks. They did not
bother their audiences with holocausts,
plagues and famines or pestilential
politicians. The Castanet Club offered a
carefully constructed illusion of in-
nocence regained and generated
much present laughter. Audiences loved
them.
Naturally, they were given the Best
of the Fringe Award and theatrical
agents present also became excited. So
The Castanets (who had not ventured
beyond their home town before) soon
were raising the spirits of Sydney and
Melbourne and even Edinburgh
(Scotland) where people wondered
whether Newcastle might be some sort
of time capsule or possibly a place on
another planet.
They are radiating good cheer in
Sydney again at The Gap, a roomy
hideaway on the top of the Trade Union
Club, until December 22. And then they
are off to a three-week stint at the
Festival of Perth. And then they will
tour Western Australia for a bit. After
that ... they are not sure. For, despite
their undeniable success and full
houses, they are scarcely managing to
earn a living wage. They lost quite a bit
on the expensive sortie to Edinburgh.
The dilemma is that they are the
biggest cabaret act in existence some
15 of them, at the latest count. It just
happened that way as this group of
actors and musicians first began to gel
together to have fun and give fun in
Newcastle in 1982.
This force of numbers, bobbing
about in perpetual motion with ir-
repressible energy breeding high spirits,
is very much part of their success. But,
while they are large, cabaret rooms are
small. And thoughts of adapting
themselves to larger, more formal
theatres are fraught with the danger of
losing the informality and the intimacy
which are both vital ingredients in their
recipe.
They have clean minds, clean hearts
and clean fingernails, they say, sending
themselves up. But that is how it seems
and that is all that matters. Nobody
including themselves is sure whether
they are best described as a band of
comics or as a comic band. Certainly,
they each seem to play an instrument or
two or three. But they sing and dance
and tell funny stories, too.
Their songs range with nostalgic
abandon from Blue Moon to As Time
Goes By, from Get Happy to Abba-
Dabba Honeymoon all very popular
among this group’s many young fans.
There is no sense of cynicism or
send-up in their performances. Such
songs are treated with affection, if with a
gentle twist from time to time to defuse
sloppier sentiments. So velvet-voiced
Lance Norton sang Aquarius from Hair
in formal evening suit, no beads.
Other groups cater to the market for
vocal nostalgia but not like The Casta-
nets. The songs are but a part of their
uniquely kalaedoscopic mix. Bowling
Man does an amazing impersonation of
a television set. Shirley Purvis offers the
lowdown on a housewife’s life at Yowie
Bay. Maynard Crabbes presents a slide
show of Newcastle’s most famous sites
and sights. Resident poet Kevin Man-
cini recites his work and does an excel-
lent imitation of Donald Duck.
The prevailing sense of casual but
carefully choreographed chaos creates a
fair-go situation in which you might
find Leslie the doorman suddenly on
stage to demonstrate the art of be-bop.
Whether or not he is a Castanet seems to
be beside the point. He is very good at
be-bop.
Even party games become possible
as the party mood builds such as
Urman Urstwhile’s extraordinary
environmental sculpture The Wave,
created as if by magic from an eagerly
willing audience of waving arms and
writhing bodies through which Casta-
nets cruised sporting sharkfin hats.
It is all very fresh and vivacious,
irresistibly heart-warming and con-
tagiously hilarious. The Castanet Club
is clearly a potent and much-needed
national tonic and should be
treasured as such, particularly by
Medicare. □


DANCE
A full-scale
Freudian
nightmare
By BRIAN HOAD
THOMAS MANN wrote his novella
Death in Venice in 1912. Luchino
Visconti based his finest film upon that
story in 1971. Benjamin Britten’s last
great opera, Death in Venice , emerged in
1973. Now, Graeme
Murphy has taken a dive
off the same spring-board
to produce a new full-
length work for the Sydney
Dance Company: After
Venice.
The Canadian Opera
Company this year invited
Murphy to work as
choreographer on Britten’s
opera. Dance is a vital
component of that ex-
traordinary work. The
pivotal role of the beautiful
youth, Tadzio, his young
friends and his family are
all silent dancing parts.
Delving into the many-
layered meanings of
Britten’s opera and Mann’s
novella, Murphy finally
evolved very personal
variations on the original
theme on his return to
Australia.
The bare bones of
Mann’s narrative are all
there: the tired, ageing author
Aschenbach seeking renewed inspira-
tion in the sensually seductive world of
Venice; his silent infatuation with
Tadzio; the ensuing mental struggle
between reason and passion, love and
lust; -the slow erosion of the will; the
triumph of passion and lust; and death.
Where Mann (and Visconti and
Britten) filled in the picture with subtle
ambiguities and understatements,
Murphy has allowed the erotic under-
currents to surface to often shocking
effect. Mann placed his Aschenbach in
some melancholic, erotic dream-world;
Murphy has re-sited him in a full-scale
Freudian nightmare.
Where Mann evokes Apollo and
Dionysus as the rival forces at play,
Murphy attempts a more direct impact
by personifying Love and Lust. The
Death that pervades his Venice is a
black, cavorting harlequin oddly ap-
propriate to this tragi-comedy which
Murphy communicates with a compel-
ling sense of raw urgency.
Tadzio is no innocent, androgynous
young god but a viciously exploitative
little punk with garishly blonded hair.
And Aschenbach’s fatal infatuation
becomes all the more pathetic for that.
The music which Murphy has chosen
amplifies his interpretation. The work
opens and closes with some familiar
murmurings from Mahler (and echoes
of Visconti’s film).
But Mahler's soulful melancholia
the ceaseless, anguished struggle be-
tween the spirit and the flesh which
pervades his music and which so per-
fectly matched the world of Mann’s
Venice in 1912 has little in common
with Murphy’s world which is rather
Garth Welch (dark hair) as Aschenbach, Paul Mercurio as Tadzio
more Sydney and now. And so. between
the prelude and the postlude he has
placed Olivier Messiaen's vast
Turangalila Symphony. This 90-minute
soundscape is self-indulgent, auto-erot-
ic, orgiastic stuff" defying both form and
time in its pursuit of mindless ecstasy.
Composed in 1948, it sounds now like a
precursor of the electronic mood music
of modern times. It is the music of
forgetfulness, an opiate, and so
Aschenbach drifts toward doom with
hardly a struggle.
The Venice which entraps him is, in
Kristian Frederikson’s stage designs, a
monumental graveyard a collection
of great lowering monoliths seemingly
carved from the fossilised debris of
centuries of history; yet silently, eerily
moveable to form huge blank walls or
sinister alleys or that awful labyrinth of
the mind in which Aschenbach is lost.
They roll back and feeble sunlight
struggles through occasionally but
death and decay dominate.
And here Murphy creates a dozen
scenes of richly inventive and deeply
disturbing dance drama.
The narrative roughly follows Mann.
In the first five scenes the characters are
established, the infernal machine
wound up. There is a particularly affect-
ing episode as the portly Aschenbach
seeks his lost youth in a duet with the
nubile Tadzio. Tadzio’s unpleasant
nature is first underlined in an outburst
of jealousy over his young friend Jashu
and Jashu’s girlfriend a powerfully
explosive trio. And there is an ex-
traordinary conclusion to the first half
as Aschenbach, searching the past to
understand the present, evokes his
former self and his former wife and
Love and Lust join them in
a particularly haunting
ensemble.
The infernal machine
unwinds with frightening
speed. Tadzio and his
mother join together to
bare their souls in inces-
tuous lust. Lust too (dis-
guised as the hotel barber)
catches up with Aschen-
bach, dyes his hair, rouges
his cheeks and leaves him
capering ridiculously.
Aschenbach’s increas-
ingly feverish imaginings
carry him into a bathhouse
where Tadzio, as Angel of
Death, presides over a
homo-erotic orgy. Death
himself brings plague upon
the whole city. Aschenbach
dies with Tadzio finally in
his arms.
The work’s often shock-
ing exploration of the
darker passions of the hu-
man soul are made toler-
able only by the subtleties of the
inspired choreography and the elo-
quence of the dancers. Garth Welch is
particularly memorable, winning com-
passion for the pathetic Aschenbach
in a performance of great dramatic
sensibility.
The glacial lust of Janet Vernon’s
Mother-Whore will disturb many a
libido. Paul Mercurio’s deadly, danger-
ous Tadzio strikes a fine balance be-
tween the repellent and the attractive.
With homosexuality under a social
cloud again, many might find this work
repugnant. But the advertisements warn
that it is for adults only and any adult
worth the title will accept that the
universal powers of Dionysus in all
their manifestations can be harnessed
only through understanding. Murphy
has created in After Venice, a timely,
brave and powerful morality for the
theatre. □


TELEVISION
Winners on
way through
a wasteland
By RON SAW
IT’S ALL pretty frightful, now isn’t it?
There is not one major show worth
talking about, let alone looking at. Even
the movies are lousy, unless you want to
sit up until the early morning. And what
makes the frightful more frightful still
what puts a huge, crushing, dispiriting
weight on the average mind is the
certain knowledge that this, this Non-
Rating Period, will continue until some
time in February.
Then, all the kids who have been at
home for the summer holidays and have
been bored rigid by this awful garbage
will go back to school. The new, good
shows will be served up to their parents
and the poor young swine either will
have to hurry home to watch Sesame
Street with their five-year-old siblings or
sink even deeper into tele-
vised tedium.
But wait! There is, to warm
you with a really good cliche,
Light At The End of the
Tunnel.
Thanks to the Australian
Children’s Television Foun-
dation, $3.8 million pea-
nuts, really, but better than a
poke in the eye with a burnt
stick has been spent on a
series called Winners.
The writers, producers and
directors include people such
as Paul Cox, Tony Morphett,
Bob Ellis, Anne Brooksbank
and Richard Mason.
The total of that creativity,
egocentricity, eccentricity and
old-fashioned talent means
that, should the series be a
complete flop, the combined
production teams, turned
loose in a field with a barrel
and bucket of pigs’ trotters,
could make anything by The
Three Stooges seem like a
training film for Calvinist ac-
countants.
But there will be no flop
if only because (as happened
in Canada) kids will be get-
ting comedy, drama and ad-
venture that does not treat
them as mewling infants.
The first program in the
series will be ready about March.
Nobody has bought anything so far but
a few programmers should be sniffing
the wind by now unless there’s a
closed season on imagination, too.
I AM reluctant to give the impression
that I am here to butter up the Nine
network.
1 must repeat, though, that the sports
stories being served up in Sydney by
Mike Gibson, lan Chappell, Johnny
Tapp, etc continue to make the
newspapers look as if Ita Buttrose were
still in charge.
One Sports Sunday recently had two
racing stories worth their weight in gold.
First was Mark Suleau’s piece on Picnic
in the Park, the bush galloper which
Sydney trainer Theo Green let go for a
lousy $5OOO and which on the Gold
Coast keeps winning in what appears to
be a canter; then, from Kentucky, came
the story of the thoroughbred stallions
which earn up to $500,000 a service a
dizzying tribute to potency that makes a
top sire worth $l5O million in theory,
even though it is the practice which
matters.
GOOD Afternoon Australia (10) made
itself worthwhile inside its first week,
thanks mainly to Kate Lee. Gordon
Elliott is good but Kate’s head is better
Trainer Malcolm Raabe, jockey Chris Smith and Picnic in the Park
THE COURIER-MAIL
and, in a show which lets you see more
than her head, so are her pins.
Her best well, most stimulating
interview was with a bug-and-bitie-
fancier named Mark Dawson who told
her that, if bitten by a redback spider, a
problem in country thunderboxes, she
should apply a bag of icewater quickly.
The thought of Kate untrousered and
icy-rumped in a home garden of golden
sunflowers is one of the things that
makes TV all worthwhile.
THE SEVEN network must get its
British comedy shows in job lots from
some charitable historical institution
possibly the Blackpool Pier Memorial
Society or the Friends of Souf’end-on-
sea Music ’All.
Consider Lore Thy Neighbor, a
witless waste of time about a clutch of
dolts in what seems to be a pub. Sample
dialogue:
“My farver was very generous,
y’know: ’e left everyfing ’e ’ad to the
orphanage.”
“Wot?”
“Fourteen kids ... waaaha-ha-
hawaaahaha.”
The usual studio audience of cretins
and throwbacks helps with the howls
and screams, while from the average
Australian viewing audience comes the
sound of 20,000 jaws thudding on
chests. But:
“The laughs just keep
coming,” says the station an-
nouncer, trying hard, and
next we get Father, Dear
Father with two puddeny
girls, and their duddy Patrick
Cargill overacting us all half-
mad.
In one scene, Duddy is
guess what wearing no
trousers. Waaa-herhaaaha.
Heee-hee. Waahaaher. And,
to the girls’ nanny:
“The flut’s not ready. The
builders got a week behind.”
“Oh, the poor man.”
Waaaaa-herhaaa-ha.
The best thing about it is
that you can switch it off.
But then comes Monday
night and, you’re told,
“Monday night is Fun Night
on ABC.” That means not
only a re-run of Butterflies
(which was moderately funny
first time around) but a brand
new comedy program called
Don’t Rock the Boat, with two
pretty awful boys living in a
sort of boatshed while their
farver’s chasing a bird in Lon-
don. And:
“Let me do the washin’ up,
eh?”
“ ’Elp yerself.”
Waaa-her-ha-her-ha. □


FILMS
Gremlins:
the other side
of Cinderella
By SANDRA HALL
THE GREMLINS which give Steven
Spielberg’s new production its title look
a little like E.T. (although with fur and a
purr), behave like Jekyll and Hyde and,
like the creature in Alien or the pods in
Invasion of the Body Snatchers, have a
talent for metamorphosis.
All in all, they give value for money
and after the raucous predictability of
Ghostbusters they have the genuine
whiff of anarchy about them. Gremlins is
likely to keep you suspended in a
queasy state of excitement somewhere
between wonder, hilarity and disgust,
like all the best horror movies.
This is a mood which Joe Dante
( Piranha, The Howling ) is becoming
especially adept at achieving using a
sly, conspiratorial pitch which invites
the confidence of an audience then slaps
it in the face with the slightly more
stylish equivalent of a wet fish (he has
moved on since Piranha ). The good in
his films behave as disgustingly as the
bad pushed to extremes by such
punishing treatment that the audience
can only sympathise and urge them on.
It is an uneasy relationship people
do not seem to be altogether sure
whether they ought to be laughing
during certain parts of Gremlins but
laugh they do. The invitations are ir-
resistible more often than not.
Spielberg and most of the writers
and directors he has encouraged in the
past few years are in love with the films
of their childhood and Dante and Chris
Columbus, who wrote Gremlins’ screen-
play, conform to the pattern. Their film
takes place at Christmas in Kingston
Falls, in the small-town America of the
television sitcom, a setting as prettily
packaged as a doll’s house and just as
fragile.
Like destructive children, the film-
makers have constructed it with love so
that they will enjoy demolishing it all
the more. It has other elements
borrowed from childhood, too. Mrs
Deagle, the town’s wickedest citizen, is a
mixture of Scrooge and the Wicked
Witch of the West; when the gremlins
finally take over the town, they relax
after the mayhem by gathering in the
local picture theatre and screening Walt
Disney’s Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs gorging themselves on
popcorn and Coke like any old-
fashioned Saturday matinee audience;
and when the film’s characters turn on
television as they do frequently it is
mostly to watch horror movies of the
50s, from which the audience can catch
intimations of what is to come.
Dante salutes more recent films, as
well. He has references to E.T. while
visual echoes of Blade Runner and
Indiana Jones animate the pre-credits
sequence in which Gizmo, the good
gremlin, is introduced.
Gremlins (generic name: mogwai)
multiply in water and if fed after
midnight they change from being
benign-looking creatures into ingenious
and ferocious reptilian types with claws,
fangs and a great talent for mimicking
A scene from Gremlins: cheerfully entertaining and exploitive
the worst of human society. Kingston
Falls may not offer much scope for
being too exotic about this but they do
their best, crashing cars, demolishing
buildings and wiping out anybody in
their path.
They are accidentally cloned from
Gizmo who remains uncorrupted by
them and it is up to Billy (Zach
Galligan), Gizmo’s minder and the
film’s hero, to stamp them out. His
mother (Frances Lee McCain) helps by
disposing of one in a blender and
another in a microwave oven, the results
of which Dante spatters liberally across
the screen.
The message delivered in a po-
faced homily at the end is as old as
Pandora’s Box and can be applied to
the environmental issue of your choos-
ing but it strikes the same sly,
iconoclastic note as the rest of the film
and to say that Dante and Columbus do
not mean a word of it seems fairly safe.
They are cheerfully and entertainingly
exploitive about this.
JOHN Milius exploits, too, but with
a doleful tenacity that suggests he might
believe as well in the triumph of the
individual and the glory of the Ameri-
can way.
He used to dramatise these senti-
ments in well-crafted and sensitively
realised films such as Big Wednesday
and Jeremiah Johnson (his screenplay)
whose heroes find dignity and self-
satisfaction in testing themselves
against nature.
But lately, with Conan the Barbarian
and now Red Dawn , Milius has taken to
the bludgeon and never mind the audi-
ence.
Red Dawn takes place in another bit
of small-town America, a corner of
Colorado which is minding its own
business one day when Soviet-backed
Cuban and Nicaraguan troops arrive
and take over.
Americans do not play gridiron
football for nothing, however, and a few
right-thinking members of the local high
school team the Wolverines have
the presence of mind to take to the
mountains where they spend the next
few months waging guerilla war with a
rapidly growing arsenal of weapons
plucked effortlessly from whoever
happens to be passing. But even the best
of times cannot go on forever and it all
ends in tears (Milius has his sentimental
side) after a lot of boring acting though,
curiously, relatively little violence. □

Village suburban cinemas; in Melbourne

BOOKS
Bumper crop for gardeners, cooks
The problem of what to give as Christmas presents is becoming ever more pressing.
Worth considering is the wide selection of books on gardening
and cooking. SUE WAN NAN looks over the range.
“GOD Almighty first planted a garden.
And indeed it is the purest of human
pleasures.”
Sir Francis Bacon,
Of Gardens, 1620
So starts Garden Design (Macdonald
Futura Australia) and indeed it is a
fitting quote, for Garden Design is pure
exalted pleasure (at, unfortunately, the
exalted price of $39.95).
This hard-backed, coffee-table book
is a lavish presentation of the history,
principles, elements and practice of
garden design, written by seven British
and American garden writers and
architects/designers.
The illustrations are breathtakingly
inspirational, although I do not think
the book is entirely practical. Too many
of the examples and ideas seem more
suited to a chateau and 40 hectares than
to a suburban plot but perhaps that is
just my lack of imagination.
This certainly would be a welcome
addition to the gardening library, if you
feel generous.
A much more practical publication is
The Garden Book (Doubleday Australia,
$16.95) by John Brookes (who, inciden-
tally, wrote the introduction to Garden
Design).
Brookes is a leading British garden
designer and writer and this soft-backed
book is packed with color photographs
and illustrations, good ideas and clear
and detailed advice.
Being English, many of the specific
plants and materials might not be avail-
able (although a special Australian
plant selection guide is at the back of
this local edition).
Apart from expected chapters on
planning and constructing a garden,
The Garden Book also has 50 pages on
various types of gardens small walled
garden, suburban garden, sheltered
corner, ground pattern garden, etc
each shown in two or three styles.
This is a book I really recommend
for any gardener, novice or otherwise.
Two more titles worthy of considera-
tion on your list: Exotic Indoor Plants
(Macdonald Futura Australia, $24.95)
and The Easy Guide to Indoor Plants
(Bay Books, $5.95).
Exotic Indoor Plants is another
English publication, which becomes ap-
parent whert you find plants such as
frangipani and hibiscus listed as
“indoor.” Nevertheless, it is a very
practical book, generously illustrated
and clearly detailed.
The Easy Guide to Indoor Plants is an
Australian production, written by
Sylvia Woffenden. Its contents and style
are very similar to Exotic Indoor Plants,
although the guide is a softback and
much thinner (and more economically
priced). It is sure to be popular with the
army of avid and unsuccessful indoor
plant growers.
These last two books are included as
indulgences, rather than as orthodox
manuals ...
The Salad Garden (Doubleday
Australia, $16.95) is a fascinating guide
to a wealth of salad plants the
traditional lettuces, tomatoes, herbs, etc,
and the unusual (fancy a little purslane
on your plate, or some good king
henry?) Anyone interested in growing
salad vegetables (they are so much
crisper and sweeter straight from the
garden) will be enchanted by this one. It
is an indulgence because, being English
(yes, again!), heaven knows where you


are going to get the seed. Nevertheless,
it is very interesting.
The last book is Australian, to be
enjoyed while sitting in your garden in a
season of mellow fruitfulness.
Stumbling on Melons (Lothian
Publishing, $24.95) is a selection of
articles by T. R. Garnett, first published
in The Age newspaper in Melbourne. It
is not so much about gardening as about
wandering thoughtfully through a gar-
den, as Garnett writes on subjects as
diverse as the best ways of building a
bonfire, the navigational ability and
strength of a wasp and, incidentally,
gardening.
This is a joy for those of us who
regularly do not read his press articles
and may well be so to all those who do.
COOKBOOKS are like love affairs -
plenty are offered but few live up to
expectations.
Lord knows how many cookbooks
are published each year there are 45
in my office, all of them new this year
and all available now. To some, you
would not give shelf-room. Most are
okay, if unexciting. Only a handful are
dazzlingly good. (Okay, yes, I know:
“good cookbook” is extremely sub-
jective./think a “good” one is accurate,
logically and clearly set out, liberally
photographed and excites and enthuses
the reader. On the other hand, I do not
like pretentious recipes that involve
what my food-technologist brother-in-
law calls “mucking about with food,”
calling for three different sorts of
vinegar or hours of tarted-up pre-
parations.)
One of the best of this year’s lot is
The Complete Book of Baking
(Lansdowne Press, S2B). I guarantee
that you would want to try its dazzling
array of breads, pies, pastries, cakes,
biscuits and baked desserts even if
(like me) you have always shuddered at
the idea of baking.
The photographs look perfectly
delicious and the recipes a wonderful
collection of the standard and the exotic
Take a deep breath at its outrageous
price and think of it as a standard
reference book, which it will be.
On the same theme (and, at just
under S2O, not quite so expensive) is
Cakes and Pastries a World-Wide
Cornucopia of Classic Recipes
(Doubleday Australia). This is the most
wickedly mouth-watering collection of
famous cakes and pastries from Europe
and America: things such as
Sachertorte, Linzertorte, buche de
Noel, Simnel cake, plumb cake topped
with masses of glace fruit, strudels, pies
and puddings... and lots more. It is an
English production but, fortunately,
does not have too many muscavado
sugar, double cream and Bramleys to
decipher.
At the other end of the price scale are
two first-rate offerings: The Com-
monsense Book of Sauces and The
Australian Women’s Weekly Barbecue
Cookbook, both costing less than $5. The
Commonsense Book of Sauces (Angus &
Robertson, $4.95) is, in the tradition of
these titles, a no-nonsense number with
a wondrous larder of sauces (about 270
of them) for all sorts of meats including
game; for seafood, pasta, vegetables,
salads and desserts. It also helpfully
suggests what sauces go with what food
a decision which I frequently find
more difficult than the sauce itself.
The Barbecue Cookbook (Australian
Consolidated Press, $4.98) is in the
tradition of these Women’s Weekly
books a tempting array of anything
which you could eat with, besides and
during a barbecue. It includes lunches,
brunches, desserts, picnics, garden
parties and celebrations. Liberally
photographed, it is outstanding value,
I am generally cautious about
overseas-published cookbooks, as I find
the unfamiliar terms and ingredients
bewildering, but two new ones which
really cannot be ignored are Homes and
Gardens Cookbook, by Michael Smith
(Allen Lane, $29.95), and Yan-kit’s
Classic Chinese Cookbook (Doubleday
Australia, $19.95).
The Homes and Gardens volume,
though expensive, is a glorious general
cookbook from one of Britain’s most
handsome magazines. Many of its
recipes are not commonly provided in
Australian books and are a refreshing
change.
The Classic Chinese Cookbook is one
of the best I have seen of its kind,
although you have to be flexible with its
English ingredients (especially in the
fish section which often calls for things
such as halibut and sea bass). One of the
good features of The Classic Chinese
Cookbook is its 40 pages of detailed
photos and descriptions of Chinese
ingredients, equipment and techniques
and it has a very good glossary. Nearly
every recipe is illustrated, so that you
know what you are aiming at (some-
thing which I find extremely helpful),
This is a good one for someone attempt-
ing authentic flavor and presentation.
An Australian publication and one
particularly suited to our climate is lce-


David Campbell: A curious question of schooling.
Cream, Sorbets and Frozen Delights
(Nelson, $19.95). Author Carol Odell
follows the evolution of ices and ice-
creams in Australia, England and Am-
erica and searched out-of-print
cookbooks for this display of frozen
delicacies.
Finally, two I love: The Book of
Sandwiches (Macdonald Futura
Australia) which, at nearly $2O, is far
too expensive for what it is (notebook-
sized, no pictures, uncoated paper) but
is yet a glorious collection of
sandwiches fillings, breads, and styles
that has me itching to throw a Sunday
lunch and serve only them.
The Food Repair Handbook
(Macdonald Futura Australia, $14.95) is
a real joy very informative and very
funny, about coping with disasters in
the kitchen. For example, “Sauces
should never be left to their own
devices. Almost without exception if
ignored, they will curdle, burn, go
lumpy, go thin, boil away to nothing or
splatter themselves all over the kitchen
out of sheer malice ... the disaster-
prone cook would be well advised to
leave the touchier members of the
family well alone and to approach even
its less neurotic members with caution.”
Author Michelle Berriedale-Johnson
is the first person to admit publicly that
you can trip over the cat and send the
roast skittering over the floor. Her
rescue suggestions are always practical.
(Where did you drop it? Under the
kitchen table out of sight of the guests?
Put it back on the platter and cover the
damage with decorations. Under the
dining-room table? Give everyone an-
other drink and repair to the emergency
store cupboard.)
I wish that I had this book years
ago! □
Fighting for
perspectives
of our history
By GERARD WINDSOR
Clubbing of the Gunfire: 101
Australian War Poems, edited by
Chris Wallace-Crabbe and Peter
Pierce. Melbourne University
Press, $14.95
SMALL copies of worthy books
infantry tactics, the Bible, Ginger Mick
commonly have been issued to sol-
diers in modern wars. Melbourne Uni-
versity Press has just issued another,
atmospherically miniature, military
volume. Clubbing of the Gunfire is an
anthology of responses to wars in which
Australia has been involved since the
Sudan crisis of 1885.
The troops, I would suggest, who
might cherish it most are those who fight
for fresh perspectives on our national
history.
Clubbing of the Gunfire is an alterna-
tive history of Australia’s second cen-
tury. I am not sure the book realises this
itself. But the outline is there.
The way poets have written about
our wars is revealing. For a start, it
suggests that World War I has been the
easiest at least for the national
imagination to cope with.
The Sudan and Boer wars divided
Australia as much as involvement in
Vietnam did. The first poem here is an
anti-imperialist attack on the New
South Wales contingent arriving to fight
the Mahdi and is by Banjo Paterson.
The best poem in the first 60 pages
(which includes drivel by name writers
including Brennan and Lawson) is a
rollocking sattire on Kipling by the
forgotten Randolph Bedford. It ends:
I put on my specs in Port Phillip, and I
spat on Sydney Quay,
But I'm the bloke that hits it in once no
serving my time for me!
And I cleaned my nails over Brisbane,
and I sneezed for an hour at Perth,
And then I came home on the English
mail and I wrote of the Big Wide
Earth
So Rhodes and ME are partners he
sticks to the boodling side;
But I run the rhyme-department, and I
cut my swathe very wide.
There’s ME and Rhodes and the Empire
and the last has me to thank
For I’ve yarded God and branded him
JB over E' on the flank
The “Great War” has had two sets of
poetic commentators its con-
temporaries and writers of the 19705.
The latter have written markedly better
but the thematic response of both
groups has been variations of horror.
Much more interesting has been the
response to 1939-1945. The range and
quality of verse written during that war
and so much of it by participants
speaks volumes about the intellectual
climate of Australia in those years.
Surrealism and modernism are strong
presences, jostling the lyrical and classi-
cal notes that were to dominate after the
war. But the range of subject matter and
tone is equally wide. The war was, in the
present editors’ words, “more diffuse
and pluralistic,” and provided a wider
experience than the horror of the
trenches. World War II being definitely
95 percent boredom (and only 5 percent
sheer terror) inspired Kenneth
Mackenzie to love poems; Kenneth
Slessor and David McNicoll to the wry,
detached sardonicism of the war
correspondent.
Individuals asserted their claims
more strongly and so Blarney is
crucified in Inscription for Dog River.
And so, too, did detail assert itself. The
vividness of John Millet’s long-after-
the-event poem Tail Arse Charlie is
unmatched by the recollection verses of
any World War I participants. Millet
can be heart-stopping:
A gunner severed from the airframe
goes whirlwinding down in his hutch
Again, the social effects on Australia
are caught by poems such as Elisabeth
Lambert’s Wartime Capital whose sting
is a lament for the mother forced into
factory work.
Contemporary poets, however, have
not gone near this war. Is it merely


because it has been so well covered
already? We can condemn the “Great
War” but take pride in Australian
heroism and success. We can feel
righteous, justified, or smug about the
Asian wars. The trouble with 1939-1945
is that we can feel the cause was just but
remain disconcerted by Australia’s part
in it.
One statistic in particular is troubl-
ing: In 1914-1918, 60,000 Australians
died and only 4000 were taken prisoner
whereas 33,000 Australians died in
1939-1945 but 27,000 were taken
prisoner.
Significantly, only one prisoner-of-
war poem, not a good one, is in this
anthology. We can handle the defeat at
Gallipoli but the defeat at Singapore is a
different matter.
Exposure to horror might be said to
be maturing but a far more profound
loss of innocence was involved in our
World War 11.
One effect is that the heroic or even
the merely admiring note is never struck
in the poems of our Asian wars. The
best of them tend to be allegories an
intelligent manoeuvre by poets who
need to distance themselves from their
own over-simplifying anger.
There are other suggestive leads in
this book for example, the strikingly
non-religious nature of whatever com-
fort is taken in death.
This is a handbook that deserves
long life but only after some surgery. A
book from our premier history publish-
ing house should not be telling us that
W. B. Dailey was a premier of NSW,
nor that 1600 Australians (of whom
1300 were casualties!) went to the Boer
War.
Nor should it be providing
biographical notes on all contributors
except those we do not already know
about. Melbourne University Press
clearly has inadequate research facilities
and would appreciate hearing from
readers who know anything about the
poets, H. P. Ellis, R. Stewart, R. S.
Byrnes, J. Elgar Owen, G. A. Wagner, F.
B. Fletcher and Mary Bell.
These biographies 17 pages of
them are another book in themselves
and deserve a separate review. Why, for
instance, of the 58 writers, are we given
details of the schooling of only four
David Campbell at Kings, Kenneth
Mackenzie at Guildford Grammar,
Brennan who “attended Roman
Catholic schools” and Buckley,
“educated by the Jesuits”? Was school-
ing immensely significant to these but
not to others? Are private schools worth
recording, others not?
When you have finished with the
poems, move on to the poets and work
out the quirks and biases of their
biographies. Perhaps there is another
alternative history of Australia there. □
BOOK BULLETIN
Gandhi first is on the way
by Patricia Rolfe
THE FIRST book on Indira Gandhi
written since her assassination will
come in a rush from Picador in joint
publication with Chatto and Windus.
The Nehrus and the Gandhis: An Indian
Dynasty will be published, as a
paperback, in early January and will be
on sale here in March at $6.95. Chatto
will share costs but the imprint will be
Picador; a hardback will follow.
The author is Tariq Ali with a
foreword by novelist Salman Rushdie.
Tariq Ali son of a wealthy
Pakistan family studied at Oxford
University and in the 19605, as a fairly
noisy and troublesome Marxist,
manned the barricades during the great
days of demonstrations and dissent. He
was in India several times this year and
last, working on a book of reflections on
the changes he saw in India. He was, it
seems, willing to change speed and
direction and get out a book to follow
events but would not do it on Gandhi
alone.
MELBOURNE writer Robin Klein, who
received a $25,000 senior fellowship this
year from the Literature Board of the
Australia Council, is the first children’s
writer to get such a large grant. It took
years before the board decided in the
mid-70s that children’s writing needed
the professionalism to be eligible and
that although some children’s writers
Children’s book writer Robin Klein
BRIAN FERGUSON
make enough money to live on, success
was sporadic with most.
Klein began writing part-time in
1978. She has 15 books out, eight
published in one year, but last year she
made only $7OOO. She has no doubt that
writing for children is a full-time oc-
cupation.
This Christmas, Oxford is publishing
Penny Pollard's Letters and
Thingnapped! Penny is a fair bit of a
tearaway and the series is aimed at the
10-to-ll year age group but often
reaches small children and teenagers.
Thingnapped! \s a sequel to Thing. In it,
Thing is locked inside Stephanie
Strobe’s en-suite bathroom sur-
rounded by spa-bath and half-eaten
chocolates. Thingnapped! sold out in
three days in Melbourne but the precis
of the plot rather explains why Klein is
still somewhat suspect with the
children’s literature establishment. It
tends to approve of books which
children obstinately refuse to read.
WHAT LUNACY would induce a
small packager to buy an expensive
Swiss-made book at the Frankfurt Book
Fair after every other English-speaking
publisher had turned it down?
Michael White, one half of David
Bateman Ltd, operates from Buderim in
Queensland while his partner David
Bateman has headquarters in New
Zealand. On a hunch, they
took an option on Koenig
Pferd, 448 pages, all color
with eight eight-page gate-
folds and eight pages of an-
atomical overlays, produced
by Hallwag in German and
French.
To translate and produce
the book in Europe would
have been too expensive so, as
Noble Horse, it has been
translated in New Zealand
and will be printed in Hong
Kong. At this year’s Frankfurt
fair, Bateman pre-sold more
than 20,000 copies to major
distributors in the United
States, Britain, South Africa,
Australia and New Zealand.
Noble Horse tells you all
you would ever want to know
about horses. With special
sections added on subjects
such as Phar Lap, the Light
Horse and the Walers, it is to
be sold through Collins late
next year at around $BO.

A black day in store for the Wops and Poms
RON SAW
I’M ON THE SIDE of the darkies. I’ve
said it before and I’ll say it again.
In Sydney the other day, Hugh
Morgan, the executive director of
Western Mining, confused this
wretched issue of Australian Aboriginal
land rights with plain, rational talk of
genealogical evidence, etc. Well, never
mind about all that. I’m on the darkies’
side and I think it’s high time a few
more of us jumped out of the closet and
made our position clear. Mine is for the
best of all reasons: venality.
The Australian blacks’
ploy is so simple that no
legislator is game to question
it. For instance:
Tom Tits, a mail-sorter of,
say, Marrickville, NSW, has
skin that is darker than that of
most of his friends and
neighbors and is generally ac-
cepted as an Abo as what
used to be called “a native
within the meaning of the
Act.”
In fact, his parents crossed
from New Guinea to
Thursday Island and then to
Queensland and NSW, and
Tom is about as aboriginally
Australian as Margaret
Thatcher. But situations like
that are, pusillanimously, put
into the Too Hard basket by
the average bureaucrat; and
Tom and his wife, Philomena,
a proud, genuine Afghan,
both qualify for all the
benefits, whatever they might
be, heaped upon Australian blacks by a
government trying to buy rectitude.
Genealogy shapes as another evil and is
ignored.
About the time of the Whitlam
government Tom, following a dozen
successful examples, discovers that the
Sturt Highway, out near Balranald,
crosses a patch of One Tree Plain that is
profoundly sacred to his tribe.
Philomena backs him up and so do
other canny black activists; and the
government
a) diverts the highway for eight
kilometres at a cost of $25 million,
b) declares the sacred site off-limits to
anybody who hasn’t a note signed by
Tom, and
c) gives Tom and Philomena $2O million
to soothe the trauma of past indignities.
My course is equally clear:
My mother’s family, the Togninis,
came originally from Piedmont, at the
foot of the Italian Alps. They lived on
the shores of, swam in and probably
caught their breakfast prawns in, Lake
Maggiore. In pre-Roman times they
worshipped that lake and I’ve no doubt
they still do.
I must fly to Torino to tell the
provincial government that it is allow-
ing irrigation, tourism and God knows
what else to despoil and drain off the
lifeblood of not just honest Piedmon-
tese generally but the Togninis in par-
ticular; and on their behalf I will accept
either the lake, with full boating and
prawning rights, or 960 billion lire,
whichever comes first.
From Italy I fly to Northamptonshire
in the English midlands. The first Saw
in Australia got seven years at the
Northampton Assizes for an offence no
greater than pinching five jewelled
tiaras from a strongroom, four pairs of
knickers, three spencers and two pairs
of pantihose from a clothesline and a
partridge from a pear tree in the
grounds of Rockingham Castle.
For 500 years the Saw family had
provided the castle with bootblacks and
milking maids and the name
Rockingham was so sacred that they
gave it to a beach some 30 miles south of
Perth when they moved to the New
World. There are still some 3,896,402
Saws in the district and on their behalf I
will accept Rockingham Castle, with
mining rights, in default $BOO million,
Of course there will be litigation.
Some plump and plummy silk will arise
and ask his lud by what right some
demned colonial comes mewling to Her
Majesty; and I, supported by founda-
tions of Aboriginal example, will knock
’em dead on the benches,
“Me lud,” I will say with the elo-
quence which has rung from pub to pub
in Paddo, “if four hundred and fifty
million Australian darkies can cop a
poultice by saying nothing
much more than that the road
to Gundagai winds over the
bones of the grandpappies,
laid to rest circa 7 million BC,
why shouldn't a good Digger
get a bit of freight from you
Poms?
“I wouldn’t have the
to mention this back in
Oz but somewhere, about 200
years back in my past, there’s
a Pom. You jerks packed him
off to what you imagined to be
purgatory and now he’s biting
back. Pay! How much? Well,
the Wops are unbelting 960
billion lire, but I don’t want to
make things tough for you. I’ll
take Rocko. Well ... maybe
.the county of Northants.
You’ll get along with what
you’ll have left.”
It is inconceivable that
neither of these litigations will
succeed, but we legal chaps
like to keep something up our
sleeves. To wit:
In Perth my grandfather was a
sharebroker. Roughly 97 percent of his
business, and, indeed, that of Buzz
Kennedy’s father-in-law and David
Haselhurst’s great-uncle, was done in
the Dive bar of the Palace Hotel. My
father and brother both became
sharebrokers, too, and they both treated
the Palace Dive with the reverence
others gave to St Mary’s or St George’s
Cathedrals.
In my turn I spent long hours in the
Palace Dive, my spirit soaring. The dear
old tabernacle is gone now, but to the
Saws, Kennedys and Haselhursts it is a
sacred place. I need only think of it and
my paternal grandmother turns in her
grave.
What remains of the Palace Hotel
must be given to us: and don’t start
whining, Bob or Gareth or whatever
your name is, for cases of precedent.
The darkies have put us on a motzer. □


Manners make life easier
KATHARINE WHITEHORN
SPORT, as we know, transcends petty
national boundaries; and the sort of
rudeness that got McEnroe kicked off
the courts for a fortnight, and thus out
of the Benson and Hedges tournament
at Wembley, needs no translation into
any language. Whether good manners
are equally universal is another matter.
This is a question that America is
squirmingly asking itself. According to
Time magazine, at least, there’s a wide
revival of manners, signalled by such
things as a return of debutante co-
tillions, the success of a Miss Manners
column answering questions about who
pays for the third wedding and how do
you introduce a pair of homosexuals,
plus an outbreak, for which no cure has
yet been found, of a particularly
resilient strain of little white gloves.
Some of it seems pretty odd by
European standards: black-tie dinners
with no servants, card invitations for
“informal” barbecues; posh dinners
with crystal and polished silver that end
with everyone kicking off their shoes
and playing Trivial Pursuit on the floor.
Some of the yearning for “nice” man-
ners is a reaction against the 60s genera-
tion, who thought that Sincerity, how-
ever revolting, was enough. Part is
the nostalgia kick that goes with
Reaganomania. The success of advice
columns, though, oughtn’t to surprise
anyone who knows that the greater the
social confusion, the greater the search
for guidance: I don’t imagine people in
the Middle Ages went around asking
themselves if you served the boar’s head
before the peacock or how you should
address a serf.
The idea that “real” good manners is
just a matter of being a good guy and
never mind who eats how and with what
and at whom, is a touching illusion
and lets you have a lot of fun with
personal codes of rudeness and polite-
ness. My private no-nos include people
who keep invitation cards, however
crested, on the mantelpiece (to make
other people feel rotten for not being
invited) and the men who can’t tell a
genuine, friendly hug from a Business
Kiss; or the woman who thinks she can
swank frankly about her job, because
she’s a woman not to mention the
man who thinks he can bore you to bye-
byes with his baby snaps, just because
he’s a man.
As one who is almost always
underdressed or overdressed and con-
stantly gets people’s names wrong, I
would love to think all manners were
private, negotiable and unimportant.
But such is not, alas, the case. There are
rules not of my making; and the reason
1 don’t think you can divorce the idea of
manners from the idea of social group-
ing whether by class, country or West
Ham v Rangers is that they are a
code, in the quite accurate sense of
being a covert way of saying things.
Mr Grimble caused offence to some
of his Gilbert and Ellis islanders by
walking between them and the light,
because he came from a culture where
you have to stand between someone and
the light for five minutes while they’re
trying to thread a needle, before it really
counts as bad manners. Even in Britain
there are parts where it’s rude to be late,
and others where, if you turn up on
time, you practically get made to set the
table. And whose, one wonders, were
the greater ill-manners the girl who lit
a cigarette between courses at a formal
dinner, or her hostess who said glaci-
ally, “We seem to have finished dinner,”
and marched all her guests out without
their main course?
Even the most chaotic habits can
hide a quite rigid social code. My young
spend every Saturday evening between
six and eight in conversations which go
like this: “Is John in?” “No, he’s gone
to Wembley.” “D’you know if he’s gone
to Trish or is he coming back before he
goes? Well, if he calls, tell him Josh is at
Sandy’s house.” But underneath even
this there is a code. They are all in
search of a party. Gate-crashing is OK,
but if they’ve been asked not to bring
anyone, then they have to decide where
loyalty to their binge-seeking cronies
ends and obligation to the hapless host
might begin. Then they have as many
hints and subterfuges to put their
rougher mates off the scent of that
evening’s party as a Bostonian in 1850.
What they don’t realise is that things
are actually easier, when manners are
formal, than when they’re not; for
formal manners can easily be learnt. I
went from an incredibly formal
Finland, where you even drink your
coffee in rounds, like pub drinks, to
free-and-easy America; I didn’t make
many mistakes in Finland, but in Am-
erica I was constantly turning up in a
cotton frock, when everyone else
“just come anyold how” was in jeans.
Awareness of other people’s patterns is
a part of the brotherhood of man: it was
no coincidence, I think, that a man I
know who was good in the French
Resistance because he could adopt with
equal skill the behaviour patterns of
garagiste and chatelain was also excel-
lent in Africa. He knew what would
offend a Luo or please a Kikuyu, while
some brotherhood-of-man type, who
thought everyone was the same, would
tread equally upon all available toes.
The idiot libertarian who goes
around saying he doesn’t care for
formalities thinks he’s saying he doesn’t
care if anyone else offends him; what
he’s actually saying is that he doesn’t
care enough about other people to
notice if he’s offending them. By assum-
ing their forms don’t matter, he’s saying
that what he regards as decent be-
haviour is the universal standard for
everyone which is the most arrogant
assumption of all. □

Edited by c ßim Saw
After 63 years in hotels, Australia’s
oldest woman publican, Ivy McNally, of
Longreach, Queensland, is giving the
game away. The title went to Ivy last
year when old Ma (Margaret Alice)
Ring died, aged 102. She had held the
licence of the New Brighton Hotel,
Billinudgel, northern NSW, for 54
years. Ivy a spring chicken by com-
parison (in her mid 80s) - began pub
work in the bar of the Longreach
Imperial, staying there for 15 years
before switching to the Welcome Home
Hotel in 1936 as licensee. She has been
there ever since. She moved to the
Welcome Home because “Imperial
Hotels were a dime a dozen and there
was only one Welcome Home Hotel in
the world.” Until recent years she still
bees-waxed and polished the floors
herself and regularly worked the bar
until her decision to sell. Ivy was
renowned for shouting, especially after
250 km endurance horse rides when not
only the riders but horses as well were
given one on the house: ale for the
riders and deep draughts of water from
one of her massive silver bowl racing
trophies, set up on the bar, for the nags.
She will continue to live at the pub after
it changes hands and to run her famous
Melbourne Cup sweeps. Her last night
as licensee promises to be a ripper.
From the north-east comes a rumbl-
ing, rising at times to shouts, of indigna-
tion at the University of Queensland’s
decision to award an honorary degree
in Law to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Most
impressive of the objectors has been
trendy Griffith University academic Dr
Ross Fitzgerald. This is not so much
because he insists, as do many of the
state’s thinkers, that the award “given
the politicisation of the police force and
the law that has taken place during the
Bjelke-Petersen premiership” would
be ridiculous, as because to award such
a degree “ would be like granting Dracula
a PhD for plasma conservation." The
quote, as Fitzgerald is at pains to point
out, is that of Queensland poet and
fellow-Johphobe Bruce Dawe.
Dick Smith was at his ebullient best. He
and his pony-tailed wife, Pip, bounced
around the function room at Sydney’s
Regent Hotel like a pair of kids off a
Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening
Post cover of the 40s. They were having
fun the sort that only Dick can
manufacture. He had brought together
from many parts of Australia some of
the people who had helped shape
Australia’s aviation history and laid the
foundations for air transport as we
know it. The purpose was the 50th
anniversary of the loss of the long-
underestimated flier Charles Ulm whose
son John, wife Valda and grandchildren
Scott and Killara were present. Scott
was introduced for the first time to
Captain Scotty Allen, now 83, who was
Ulm’s chief pilot in an airline and
became John’s boss at Qantas. But the
undoubted queen of the evening was the
almost forgotten Lores (short for
Dolores) Bonny, 87, from Miami,
Queensland, who wrote the record
books as a solo woman flier in the 30s.
The evening also uncovered another
little-known fact. Dick’s secretary,
Margaret Hamilton, who says her
teetotal boss’s food tastes do not go past
fish and chips, had asked The Bulletin’s
David McNicoll to pick the food and
wines. By 9 o’clock, the decibel level
was louder than at Mascot in the rush
hour. McNicoll might not be an avi-
ation expert but . . .
Close friends of Robert and Susan
Sangster have been surprised to receive
Christmas cards signed by both.

The P. T. Barnum Memorial Prize for
Feeblest Publicity and the Rupert Mur-
doch Trophy for the Vaguest Excuse for
Journalistic Crumpet this month both
go a Melbourne publicist named Simon
Feely. On a grey Melbourne day, he
posed a strapping model named Anna
Hoban on a banana chair on what
looked like a tarmac-grey roadway out-
side the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Why? “Anna,” he reported, “took the
opportunity to get in some sunbaking
in a most appropriate place”
underneath a poster advertising the
Australian Games. Feely also threw in a
man with a hose, presumably there in
case of passing predators.
The ABC’s Colin Munro will be missing
for a while from Morning Extra and
Australia All Over. Munro, who has just
clocked up 20 years with Auntie, is
shouting himself a week’s leave to go to
Perth for the cricket ... No, not THAT
cricket but ** the Margaret Peden
Memorial Test of the Golden Jubilee
Series of women’s tests. His aunt
Margaret Peden was Australian captain
for the first test series in Perth in 1934.
His mother, Barbara Peden Munro did
not qualify for the first test because of a
broken leg but joined the team later in
the series. The side took a walloping
from the Brits led by gritty, deter-
mined Betty Archdale who became
Munro’s godmother and later head-
mistress of Abbotsleigh Girls’ School on
Sydney’s north shore. Earlier in the
19305, Barbara Peden took 7-9 when
playing for Kuring-gai against Bert
Oldfield’s 11. It is possible that Bert’s
boys had taken drink.
London’s Hooray Henrys are buzzing
with the news of the first engagement of
the 1984 batch of debs. Zara Legge-
Bourke (mummy is lady-in-waiting to
Princess Anne; brother Harry is a page
to the Queen) is as proud of her hyphen
as the rest of the Hooray Henry set.
However, her marriage will not cause
the sacrifice of her hyphen but the gain
of two more: Zara is to marry Richard
Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax.
It is disturbing enough that journalists
become academics (Donald Horne,
Roger Coveil) and prime ministers (John
Curtin) but it is frankly astonishing
when they become men of God. Barry
Long was (circa 1960) editor of the
Sunday Mirror in Sydney. He left
Australia and found, in turn, India, the
United Kingdom and God. He will be
back in Australia in January on a
lecture tour of Sydney, Brisbane and the
Model Anna
Hoban:
“sunbaking in a
most appropriate place”
Gold Coast. He will talk about “the
unacceptable, unbelievable truth .. .
life, death, immortality, making love
and the origin of Man.” His message is
that we should all be still. Perhaps Barry
is coming back to journalism.
One of Australia’s early surfing stars,
80-year-old “Snow” McAlister, still gets
out there in the waves. He and former
world champion Nat Young will open a
surfboard exhibition at the Manly Art
Gallery and History Museum in Sydney
on December 21. It will show that the
first boards were enormous chunks of
solid wood, some weighing 35kg. It took
a sturdy fellow to get one of them across
the beach, let alone into the water.
Young might never have made it. He
was a slight, if wiry, figure in his youth.
By the time he was 19, he was crowned
world champ at Longbeach in Cal-
ifornia. Young recalls the wife of the
mayor of San Diego asking, seriously:
“So you’re from Australia. Now which
state of the Union is that up near
Alaska?” Young and his con-
temporaries shortened their fibreglass
boards in the 1960 s and made them
more manoeuvrable for aggressive wave
riding. McAlister, on the other hand,
started on an old ironing board.

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
John Brown’s 50 innovative vintages
LAST WEEK the four wine-loving sons
of John Brown threw a ripper of a party
at Mietta’s restaurant in Melbourne. It
was to celebrate John Brown’s 50th
vintage. He sat at the head table with his
wife, Pat; a large smile never left his
huge bland face, and rightly so he was
the patriarch of the most extraordinary
wine family.
It was just before Christmas 1959
that I first met John Brown. I spotted
this sign “Brown Bros” at Milawa, just
16km out of Wangaratta. The tempera-
ture was 102 in the shade and heat
waves were rising above the brown
earth. There was just one building, a
lofty, Canadian-style barn. I went inside
and there was John Brown, large, ex-
tremely amiable. “Come and try a
couple,” he said.
Whenever I gave a wine a rave notice
he said: “Mmmm, not a bad drop.” You
could call that the theme song of John
Brown. His modesty about his own
wines is so well developed he never goes
beyond: “Not a bad drop.”
I was there for three hours tasting. I
knew nothing about wine when I went
in, but I became addicted. He changed
my life. I have been a wine junkie ever
since. From then on he sent wine to me
in an old beer barrel. I used to bottle it
off and keep the bottles under my bed.
My favorite was his cabernet shiraz
mondeuse. We called it the Church
Missionary Society Wine. I found a
cache of it the other day, Brown’s CMS
1962 and I gave a bottle to an American
wine lover who was on his way back to
the Napa Valley. He was repelled by the
object, and I was terrified he would
leave it in his hotel waste paper basket.
It was in an old Mildara sherry bottle,
unlabelled. But he carried it across the
Pacific and he wrote back from Cal-
ifornia three weeks ago. “That was very
nearly the best bottle of red wine I ever
tasted.”
It cost me one shilling in 1962.
John Brown left Scotch College in
1933 and went to work with his father
John Francis Brown. One of his first
jobs was to assist in the despatch of 100
casks (6000 gallons) of tawny port to the
London market, price two shillings and
sixpence a gallon.
It was a dreadful time to be in the
wine business, but John remembers
there was a tobacco boom in the north-
east. Italians were pouring into the area.
They started to drop in at Milawa for
five gallons of shiraz or grenache. Soon
the word spread to Melbourne and
Winemaker John Brown: a steady return to reds
Italians down in Carlton were sending
up to Milawa.
“Dad never had a surplus of wine,”
said John.
John Francis died in 1943 leaving
young John to carry on the business.
Of course there were other reasons
for Brown Bros’ survival. John Brown
was always a great innovator. While
many of the vineyards in hot northern
Victoria produced reds which were a
sort of liquid steak and eggs, he
produced lighter varieties; his whites
too were crisp, clean, rich on the palate
and not the sweet clag that sometimes
has come from the area.
In 1962 he made what could have
been Australia’s first botrytis-affected
late-picked riesling, a marvellous wine
which was served at the ceremonial
dinner at the opening of Melbourne’s
Art Centre.
I kept a few precious bottles and I
opened one recently at a dinner for
several of Melbourne’s leading pro-
fessional wine men. One of them took a
sip and said immediately “Chateau
d’Yquem. If it’s not, I’ll bare my bum in
Myer’s window.”
He didn’t actually do that, Myer
doesn’t go a great deal for bare bums,
but a month later we were invited to his
house for dinner. We were enjoying his
wife’s magnificent cooking when
suddenly our friend lan sprinted
through the dining room naked and
leapt into the swimming pool.
Back when first I used to
call there was cabernet, shiraz,
grenache, riesling and not
much else. I mean you could
handle a blind tasting and
have at least a faint hope of
success.
Now you have no chance.
The Browns are such en-
thusiastic innovators they are
handling 35 different grape
varieties. Some of the grapes
are very trendy; chardonnay
is trendy. But John Brown
thinks that might lose a bit of
pace, because so many
chardonnays are coming on
the market which are pretty
low on chardonnay muscle.
Sauvignon blanc is super
trendy and this should do
well. It has tremendous
potential and it has
characteristics which have yet
to be exploited. Then he talks
glowingly of grape varieties
we haven’t even heard of. There’s
tarrango, a red variety bred by Dr Alan
Antcliffe, of CSIRO.
It is a good, hot-climate grape, which
develops late so that you can pick it in
the cool of the autumn. Very economi-
cal yield and it produces a brilliantly
colored, beaujolais style.
However, much of Brown’s new en-
terprise is going into the Upper King
Valley, into the Whitfield area. He has
one vineyard called Whitlands, which is
800 m up and within two years he hopes
to have riesling produced from
Australia’s highest vineyard.
He says seven or eight vineyards are
starting up around Whitfield, and
there’s a nice little turn of history. The
vignerons mostly are Italians who no
longer can make a living out of growing
tobacco.
He says there is a steady return to red
wine. “We have noticed a steady rise
over the past 18 months.”
“What about people who claim it is
not a healthy drink like white wine?”
“Nonsense. We have them come in
to the cellar and they say, ‘Red wine has
histamines or red wine gives me a
headache.’ It is no different to white.
They get a headache because of the two
bottles of white they drank before they
got on to the red.”
At the 50th anniversary we had some
extraordinary wines including a 1958
vintage port. It wasn’t a bad drop. □


Roy Higgins angers George Moore
DAVID M c NICOLL
I UNDERSTAND that the rumblings
and explosions heard round Hong
Kong for the past few weeks were not
caused by typhoons. They followed
immediately after George Moore’s per-
usal of Roy Higgins’ book The Pro-
fessor.
Now Moore and Higgins are two of
the best hoops in the history of racing.
But like all top hoops they are inclined
to take themselves very seriously and to
resent criticism. And there are passages
in Roy’s opus which George considers
close to defamatory.
I can’t agree. The Higgins book
doesn’t pull any punches, and I can
understand George’s fury at the claim
that other jockeys in France referred to
him in highly uncomplimentary terms
which I won’t repeat here. But overall,
the Higgins assessment of George indi-
cates Roy’s admiration of Moore as a
jockey, and liking for him as a man.
Moore, writes Higgins, was better
than Sellwood, Mulley, Cook, Munro,
Lake or Thompson. This made him “the
most thoroughly, happily, and con-
tentedly disliked jockey in Australian
racing and that’s precisely how he
wanted it. In fact he worked at it.”
Higgins describes Moore as “tense,
temperamental, truculent, abusive,
abrasive, abhorrent, highly strung, vol-
atile, unpredictable, and above all, a
loner. He was a master horseman, a
superb tactician, painstakingly meth-
odical, a psychologist, brilliant beyond
comparison, shrewd, ruthless in his will
to win, an enigma, a genius, and unique
as Tommy Smith once said, the best
horseman ever to throw a leg over a
saddle the world has seen.”
George has been a friend of mine
since he was an apprentice. In my view
the praise showered on him by Higgins
more than counterbalances the critical
references. I would hate to see two such
individualistic and interesting ex-
champions locked in ludicrous litiga-
tion.
THERE will be much sorrow among
members of the mining press at the
retirement on December 31 of Geoffrey
Gellie, public relations adviser for
Australian Anglo American Ltd since
1970.
Over the years Geoff has led bands of
Australian mining reporters through the
South African, Angolan, Botswanan,
and Irish activities of De Beers.
Polished, thoughtful, and generally
chuckling, Gellie will be sadly missed.
Roy Higgins: no punches pulled
MARTIN KING/SPORTPIX
SOME post-election thoughts:
■ Andrew Peacock has thrown off
the “Show Pony” tag for ever.
■ A man whose success undoubtedly
surprised the Labor Party more than it
likes to admit was lan Sinclair. He was
up against the nastiest word-of-mouth
campaign in the entire election (and I
do not accuse his Labor opponent).
That campaign was probably one of the
reasons New England rallied behind
him.
■ It will be a long time before the
Melbourne Herald comes out again
trumpeting for Labor. The paper’s ad-
vocacy could have been counter-pro-
ductive in the Victorian seats Peacock
finished up winning.
■ The most off-track last minute
headline was in The Sydney Morning
Herald on polling day “Libs Facing a
Disaster in Victoria.” The headline
closest to being on target was in The
Australian on polling day “Late
Swing to Libs could cut Govt majority.”
■ The Advertiser got the result it
advocated a severe jolt for the federal
government.
■ Many of the election night com-
mentators were very slow to realise that
their moaning and squealing about the
informal vote was merely suggesting
that Labor voters were stupider than
Liberal voters.
■ Election interviews are altogether
too cosy. The Prime Minister (and other
politicians) reply to their questioners
using their Christian names. This de-
tracts from the punch of the interviews,
and it leaves the viewer with the impres-
sion that everyone’s far too friendly for
the interview to be as tough as it should
be. The reporters might be flattered by
the intimacy, but it doesn’t make good
television.
■ The whole question of political
reporting came under discussion after
the election brought on by Richard
Carleton’s transfer to Sydney. Carleton
himself agreed that political journalists
should not be kept too long on the job
in Canberra.
My feeling is that many of these
journos become as remote from the real
world as Canberra politicians, their
horizons limited to the non-members’
bar and the pigeonholes where the press
secretaries leave the handouts.
THAT remarkable man Dick Smith
turned on a stunning dinner to honor
the memory of Charles Ulm. At the
dinner Dick told me some details of the
rustic haven he’s building in the wilds of
French’s Forest.
Never happy unless surrounded by
nature, Dick’s “office” will be concealed
in the bush down a path from his house.
The only indication you’ll get will be the
tent fly at the entrance. All his equip-
ment will be hidden in logs. In the main
log will be his computer set-up. He will
merely have to lift a branch, press a
couple of twigs, and be in touch with
anywhere in the world instantly.
G.U. (Scotty) Allen, the famous aviator,
is in his 85th year. But age hasn’t
affected his skill at fly-fishing.
Scotty is just back from the Monaro
streams where he landed 40 trout
(mostly brown) in four days. Used the
same fly for 30 of them. What fly? Mind
your own business.
I CAN SEE that, provided I am spared,
1985 is going to be a Keep Fit year for
me.
Dick Smith has invited me to join
him in the “Bourke to Burketown Bash”
in June. This is a sort of re-run of the
original Redex Trial, and will be con-
tested by cars more than 20 years old.
Entry will be by invitation.
Having recovered from that off to
Queensland in July. I have been greatly
bucked by being invited to be guest of
honor in the Stockman’s Hall of Fame
Endurance Ride on the 19th and 20th.
The ride is from Winton to Longreach.
The event gets bigger every year and is
an important part in promotion of the
Stockman’s Hall of Fame at Longreach.

COVER STORY
A conspiracy of silence over
the destruction of the Reef
Disturbing new reports about the crown of thorns starfish prompted this
investigation by ROBERT RAYMOND whose film Life and Death on the
Great Barrier Reef in 1969 first alerted television audiences to the nature and
extent of their invasion.
FOR THOSE who believe as
many in Australia still do that
the crown of thorns came and
went in the 60s and 70s, I have
got bad news: the starfish is back
on the Great Barrier Reef, in
greater numbers and over a
wider area than before.
The damage to many of the
most accessible reefs is so serious
that, for those who have yet to
see the Great Barrier Reef, I have
only this advice choose your
area carefully. And do not wait
too long.
That this extraordinary situa-
tion has come about virtually
without comment and especially
without alerting our politicians is
due to a range of factors which
some might describe as a con-
spiracy of silence. It certainly
can not be put down to lack of
warning.
A slow, creeping conflict has
been in progress now along the
coast of Queensland for 30 years.
One part of the struggle has been going
on silently, beneath the ocean. The
other part has been carried on
decorously behind the facades of
scientific institutions, with occasional
strident sallies into the headlines.
But now, I believe, the struggle is
about to erupt into the corridors of
power in Canberra and perhaps on to
the world stage. Before it is resolved it
could affect the viability of the Queens-
land tourist industry, challenge the
credibility of the Australian scientific
establishment and bruise the reputa-
tions of one or.two federal ministers.
The silent war is between the 2500
coral reefs that make up the Great Bar-
rier Reef ecosystem and the millions of
predatory crown of thorns starfish
whose emergence in such vast numbers
across the entire Indo-Pacific region is
one of the strangest biological phenom-
ena of this century.
The verbal battle is between those
Robert Raymond: tough questions to be answered
who see these happenings in terms of a
“plague,” a potential ecological disaster
of enormous scientific and economic
significance, and those who regard the
starfish “outbreaks” as natural cyclical
events which give no cause yet for
undue alarm.
The first group includes a few scien-
tists, led by Dr Robert Endean, associ-
ate professor in the department of Zo-
ology at Queensland University, and a
wide variety of people who make their
living along the Queensland coast.
The second group consists of some
tourist operators and resort publicists,
the majority of Australian marine scien-
tists and the Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park Authority which is responsible to
the nation for management of the reef
area.
For the past 30 years, the well-en-
trenched authorities have tried to keep
the lid on but not, I believe, for much
longer. The threat shows all the signs of
blowing up into the biggest
environmental problem the
federal government has faced
much wider in its implications
than either the Franklin River
dam or the Daintree rainforest
road.
In the past few months, I have
been exploring the ramifications
of this confrontation which all
this year has been quietly ap-
proaching the point of critical
mass. With experienced pro-
fessional divers and an
underwater film crew, I have
examined the impact of the
starfish on reefs stretching from
Lizard Island north of Cooktown
to the Whitsunday Group nearly
as far south as Mackay.
I have talked to boat captains,
dive leaders, tour operators,
resort proprietors and other
people whose livelihood is tied
up with the well-being of the reef.
I have taken Endean back to
the coral cay off Innisfail where
in 1969 I filmed his warning about the
potential consequences of that first
starfish outbreak and listened once
again to his expression of anger and
frustration at what he calls our lost
opportunity to do something about a
national environmental disaster.
I have also questioned scientists at
our leading research facility on tropical
marine life the Australian Institute of
Marine Science, near Townsville and
at James Cook University, Queensland
University and the Lizard Island Re-
search Station. And I have interviewed
the chairman and other officers of the
marine park authority.
Just what the re-appearance of the
starfish means for the long-term exist-
ence of the Barrier Reef is still a matter
for scientific dispute, as we shall see.
But what indisputably lifts the crown of
thorns problem right out of the scientific
arena is that its resurgence has co-
incided with the greatest boom in tour-


ROBERT RAYMOND
Collecting starfish at Beaver Cay: done by a concerned group of volunteers, without pay
ism in Queensland’s history. It is the
threat to this industry which may soon
make all Australians as familiar with the
habits of this marine predator as they
are with rabbits, locusts, mice or any
other plague-prone animal.
The crown of thorns starfish,
Acanthaster planci a large, spiky
member of the phylum of echinoderms
used to be recorded occasionally but
attracted little attention, distributed as it
was in small numbers on coral reefs
across the Indo-Pacific region from the
Red Sea to the Gulf of California.
It was observed that the adult lived
principally on corals and that its pre-
ferred diet seemed to be the polyps of
hard Acropora corals, the colorful
staghorns and plates which are such a
spectacular feature of the Great Barrier
Reef.
When feeding, the starfish spreads it-
self over live coral and extrudes its
stomach through a vent under the centre
of its body. Digestive juices are released
over the coral polyps, which are dis-
solved. The starfish sucks the products
of digestion back into its body, leaving
the calcareous structure of the coral
white and bare like a skeleton.
A large adult starfish, which at five
years of age may be nearly half a metre
in diameter, eats an area of coral about
equal to its own size in a few hours. It
kills a square metre or more of reef in a
day and moves on, inching its way slow-
ROBERT RAYMOND
Dumping the “crop:” but the situation still worsens


Low tide on the reef and a sight-seeing boat cruises the area ...
ly on hundreds of small tubed feet
beneath its spreading arms. Despite
their lack of speed, crown of thorns star-
fish are quite mobile.
On a healthy, living coral reef the
starfish in their usual numbers per-
haps 10 or 20 to the hectare made
little or no impression. The patches of
dead coral they left behind were re-
colonised by coral larvae from nearby
communities. Although the female star-
fish produced vast numbers of eggs each
season, natural balances of some kind
(which are still not well understood and
have been little studied) kept the adult
population fairly stable. Starfish and
corals co-existed.
Some time in the late 19505, however,
profound changes in the starfish popu-
lations began to occur in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. In widely separated areas —j
including Tahiti, Hawaii, Okinawa and
the Red Sea - waves of starfish number-
ing tens or hundreds of thousands ap-
peared on reefs, destroying up to 90 per-
cent of the coral cover.
The first large outbreak on the Great
Barrier Reef was reported from Green
Island in 1962. The starfish had killed
most of the coral on the surrounding
reef by 1966 and other infestations were
reported from reefs down the Queens-
land coast as far as Townsville.
The Queensland government com-
missioned Endean, an expert on trop-
ical marine animals and toxins, to
investigate. After a two-year study in
conjunction with the Queensland
Fisheries department, he concluded that
the outbreaks were not normal and
presented a serious long-term threat to
the reef. He called for immediate con-
trol measures and a full-scale research
program.
Some action ensued but, about 1972,
the “plague” began to wane as rapidly
as it had appeared. The armies of
predators had disappeared by the mid-
-19705. The momentum of scientific in-
terest died away as did funds and the
incentive for research. The “natural
cycle” adherents appeared to be
vindicated.
In addition, the passage in 1975 of
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act
and the setting up of the authority
seemed to guarantee the future of this
remarkable natural feature (later to be
added to the World Heritage list).
But in 1980, quite suddenly and in-
explicably, the crown of thorns began to
appear again in large numbers.
An army of adult starfish had
advanced up the reef slope at Green
Island by 1982 and overwhelmed the
regenerating coral. Estimates put the
numbers on this one reef as high as two
million.
Reports accumulated from up and
down the coast make clear that most of
the reefs in the middle third of the Great
Barrier Reef from Townsville north
to Lizard Island are undergoing a
second invasion and suffering even
more severe damage than they did first
time around. But, this time, the attacks
are spreading into both northern and
southern thirds of the marine park.
Our recent survey down the reef has
convinced me that the situation is far
more serious than the one I saw in 1969
and that the consequences, while still
largely incalculable, could be drastic.
We began by chartering the Reef Ex-
plorer, one of the modern boats operat-
ing out of Cairns to meet the growing
interest in diving and snorkelling on the
reef.
Our survey started at Lizard Island,
to the north of Cooktown, where the
line of reefs forming the Outer Barrier
runs comparatively close to the coast.
One of Lizard’s chief attractions has al-
ways been its fringing reefs, and par-
ticularly the gardens of richly assorted
corals studded with giant blue and
green clams in the shallow bays right in
front of the resort. Where they are easily
accessible to even the most inexperi-
enced diver or snorkeller.
But we found most of this coral dead
and rotting, crumbling to the sea floor.
The starfish were present in large num-
bers on surrounding reefs, continuing
the destruction.


... the same area after starfish invasion: a dismal prospect for tourists
South from Lizard Island stretches a
remarkable line of reefs, forming an al-
most continuous barrier along the outer
edge of the continental shelf, broken
only by a few narrow passages. Here the
warm surface waters are constantly en-
riched by upwelling currents from the
abyssal depths. As a result, the coral
plateaus and canyons of the Ribbon
Reefs shelter perhaps the greatest diver-
sity of corals and marine life to be
found in the entire Great Barrier Reef
area.
This is where the Reef Explorer’s
skipper, Kerry Piesch, has been bring-
ing his diving parties for the past 10
years. Overseas divers have found little
anywhere else in the world to equal the
profusion of corals here. But these, like
the shallower platform reefs far to the
south, are under savage attack.
On almost every reef we found popu-
lations of feeding starfish. A few reefs
were still virtually intact but others were
a wasteland of brown algae.
I asked Piesch why one reef on his
chart, near No 9 Ribbon Reef, had been
inscribed “Atomic Bommie.”
“Well, that’s just aptly named,” he
said. “It used to have beautiful coral,
big plates and staghorn, where we took
people regularly especially from over-
seas. Then we found the crown of
thorns beginning to work on it, so we
decided to leave it for a while. We came
back six months later and it literally
looked as if an atomic bomb had been
dropped there. It was just devastated. It
was actually devoid of any fish life, too.
Just nothing left.
“There’s definitely a big change go-
ing on. I don’t know what it means
scientifically but it’s a pity to see those
brilliant colors and those big areas of
coral just devastated.”
What is happening to the Ribbon
Reefs may have particular significance.
There has been a great deal of evidence,
from other areas as well as the Great
Barrier Reef, of starfish activity on reefs
in comparatively calm shallow waters.
It was not known for sure whether the
starfish would want to face the condi-
tions on the Outer Barrier where
currents and wave conditions are
severe. It was not even known how deep
the starfish could go.
We found many feeding on the
ocean side of the Outer Barrier walls,
despite the surging backwash from the
rollers breaking on the reef crest. Others
were apparently climbing from the
gloomy depths. This behaviour and the
growing areas of dead coral here
suggest that no reefs can be considered
immune from attack.
Green Island has a special place in
the history of the starfish phenomenon,
as it has in the history of the Queens-
land tourist industry. And it may yet
achieve notoriety as well as fame, if
some American tourist sues Qantas for
false advertising.
Because it lies only 20km off the
coast, opposite Cairns, Green Island
was the first true coral island to be de-
veloped as a resort along the reef.
The reef around Green Island was
until the 1960 s a carpet of living corals,
anemones, sponges and molluscs. This
magnificent display was easily access-
ible on foot at low tide or by snorkelling
or drifting in a glass-bottomed boat
over the forests of blue, pink and yellow
staghorns and fish.
The coral around Green Island has
been literally obliterated.
Off the north-western corner of the
island, the glass-bottomed boats still
make trips with people who have paid
to see the famed “wonders of the Great
Barrier Reef.” I took a trip in one boat
and Walt Deas, our underwater camera-
man, filmed the route that we followed.
What he recorded was an unrelieved
landscape of brown, silt-covered, algae-
festooned dead and dying coral. The
boatman gave the passengers bread to
attract a few fish into the field of view.
There are stories of a worried visitor
who inquired why all the coral was
brown and dead-looking, to be told that
what he was looking at was the famous
“sleeping coral” of Green Island which
blossoms into living color only at night.

Inspecting the crown of thorns underwater
(Which is true of some corals but they
do have to be alive to manage this trans-
formation!)
Just beside the jetty, close to the beat
where the boats pick up their
passengers, we found someone who is
trying to do something about replacing
the vanished coral. His name is Peter
Tibbs and he has been diving on the reef
for 12 years. He has a busy dive shop in
Cairns but his consuming interest is in
transplanting living corals.
Tibbs has a contract with the Green
Island management company and a
permit from the State Fisheries depart-
ment to collect clumps of living corals
from an outlying reef and transplant
them around Green Island. We watched
Tibbs perform this relatively simple
operation. Using snorkelling gear, he
dived in about three metres of water and
removed branches of staghorn from the
reef. He placed these in the bottom of
his speedboat and, when he had about a
dozen pieces, headed off to Green
Island. He has found that half-an-hour
or so out of the water seems to do the
coral animals no harm.
At his chosen site, Tibbs planted the
branches of staghorn in the sand half a
metre or so apart. He told me that some
become dislodged by the tides or die but
a surprising number survive and devel-
op a firm base. Staghorn is one of the
fastest growing of corals so Tibbs hopes
that, within a year or two, he will have
produced a small but attractive coral
garden close to the beach where people
will be able to wade or swim and inspect
it.
Despite his enthusiasm, Tibbs is ser-
iously concerned at the spreading im-
pact of the crown of thorns starfish.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that
it's destroying the reef,” he told me.
"Whether it’s going to regenerate I’m
not sure but it certainly is destroying it
and it’s a bigger problem than anyone is
caring to admit.” I asked Tibbs why he
thought that others, such as the marine
park authority, apparently do not see
what he sees.
“I don’t believe they go out there as
often, nor do they go to as many reefs,
nor have they seen it for as long as I
have,” he said.
One ironic and potentially embar-
rassing consequence of the destruction
of the coral around Green Island is the
way in which it could backfire on the
intense drive to step up tourism from
the US to northern Queensland.
The new international terminal at
Cairns financed by the city council
proudly welcomed the first of the new
twice-weekly Qantas jumbo services,
this year flying direct from Los Angeles
and San Francisco, packed with Ameri-
cans.
One of the prime targets for these
eager tourists is Green Island, for the
handsome brochures being handed out
by Qantas in the United States describe
Cairns as “the gateway to the Great Bar-
rier Reef’ and Green Island as “a true
coral cay and part of the Great Barrier
Reef.”
Visitors to Green Island are
promised that from glass-bottomed
boasts they will “view the spectacular
underwater life of the reef,” including
“magnificent coral formations.” On
most of the tours listed, Green Island is
the only opportunity for seeing the
Great Barrier Reef.
I spoke to some of the Americans
who had come trustingly to Green
Island and found them rather less in-
clined to swallow the “sleeping coral”
explanation than are the locals. It seems
only a matter of time before bad public-
ity begins to spread back home.
The Hayles family, which has run
boats to Green Island for generations
and the resort itself, is acquiring bigger
and faster catamarans in order to reach
the more remote reefs where there is still
coral to be seen. But for such craft there
is not much change out of $1 million or
so and the price of a day ticket is high
up to $5O or more. Most visitors to
Cairns seeking the Barrier Reef “ex-
perience” must still make do with what
they find at Green Island.
I asked Blake Hayles, the present
head of the family, whether he thought
it fair that people from all over Austra-
lia and elsewhere should still be led to
believe that they can come to Green
Island “and see the Great Barrier Reef.”
“Yes, the coral is a problem," he
said. “We’ve noticed a certain amount
of deterioration over the years, despite
considerable work in transplanting
coral. Unfortunately, the old crown of
thorns has done a lot of damage. But
there’s absolutely no doubt that people
can still come here and see the Great
Barrier Reef. It has certainly de-
teriorated; there’s no doubt about that.
But we’re still sending away many thou-
sands of very, very happy people
who've come a long way to see it.”
The interesting thing about this ad-
mission of damage by the crown of
thorns is that until quite recently Blake
Hayles was one of a group of tourist
operators in north Queensland who
maintained vehemently that there was
absolutely no problem with the reef and
that the starfish “threat” was wildly
exaggerated.
It is this attitude which has quite ob-
viously contributed to the lack of con-
cern in both state and federal govern-
ment departments compounded, by a
matching policy of reassurance on the
part of many scientists.


We went south from Cairns to Beav-
er Cay, off Innisfail, and found in the
person of a boat operator named Perry
Harvey all the frustrations of an eyewit-
ness to disaster who simply cannot
make anyone listen.
In considering the experience of
Harvey on the reef over the past 30
years against the professional certitudes
of the marine park authority and its
highly qualified scientific staff, we have
the classical confrontation of the un-
trained but involved observer versus the
expert.
Harvey went to Queensland 32 years
ago and began a lifelong love affair with
the reef. He first worked on glass-
bottomed boats at Green Island “when
the coral there was as magnificent as
you could find anywhere in the world,”
he told me and he has dived on reefs
all over the Pacific and the Caribbean.
Some 22 years ago Harvey found
Beaver Cay, a reef with a small white
sand crown, 40km off the coast at
Mission Beach, near Dunk Island. He
devoted himself to the task of introduc-
ing visitors to its richness and variety.
Every day since then, during the
season from about May to November,
Harvey makes a run with his boat from
Mission Beach out to Beaver Cay,
usually picking up people from Dunk
Island on the way.
On the two to three-hour trip out he
gives his passengers a detailed lecture
on what they are going to see. His
brown, wiry, energetic figure is then in
perpetual action all around the anchor-
age, as he runs people to and from the
cay, and takes them over the reef in his
glass-bottomed boat.
Each year, over the Christmas or
New Year period, Harvey takes his boat
and a load of passengers up the Great
Barrier Reef to Cape York, diving,
snorkelling, and inspecting the reefs
with his glass-bottomed boat on the
way.
For 30 years, therefore, Perry Harvey
has been a close and involved observer
of the Great Barrier Reef. He is in a
position where he sees more of the reef
than most people. And, although he has
no formal scientific training, his views
and experience deserve serious con-
sideration.
And Harvey’s view expressed to
me over visits to Beaver Cay this year
together with explicit demonstrations of
what he is talking about is that there is
a severe, widespread and accelerating
deterioration of the Great Barrier Reef
as a whole.
“I can honestly tell you and I’d
like to be able to say differently that
between here and Cape York I don’t
know of any reef that’s not been
damaged by starfish.
“I mean, some reefs are better than
others. But, compared to 20 years ago
ROBERT RAYMOND
Perry Harvey demonstrates how lime can kill starfish ...
when all the coral was alive, now most
of the reefs are at least 50 percent
damaged. And some of the Ribbon
Reefs are far more dead than that. Some
of them are 90 percent dead and it’s no
different once you get north of Lizard
Island. Some reefs are better than others
but they’re all damaged to some extent.”
Here Harvey made a point which
may explain much of the polarisation of
views between him (and others such as
Endean) and the scientific establish-
ment.
“This is probably the problem, where
you hear the experts saying: ‘Oh, these
are normal reefs half live coral, half
dead coral.’ And they say that’s the nor-
mal, balanced reef. But they haven’t
been here really long enough to see
really good coral. And the fact is that, if
they had been diving as long as I have
and had seen the corals before they
died, they would know that these reefs
are not first-rate coral any more only
second-rate. And to see them deterio-
rate over the years is absolutely heart-
breaking, sickening.”
As a matter of interest, no one to
whom I spoke at the authority while
making this survey had known the reef
for even 10 years and I found no marine
scientist except Endean who could
speak of it before the starfish outbreaks.
Beaver Cay provides yet another
case history. A mere handful of starfish
had appeared on the reef, when we
filmed there in 1969, although Green
Island to the north had been devastated
by then.
But the once luxuriant reef is like a
battlefield. Patches of beautiful stag-
horn and other corals remain where
Harvey can still show his visitors what
the reef once looked like. But most of it
has been destroyed by two massive in-
vasions of starfish.
Harvey says that the present infesta-
tion is more punishing.
For Beaver Cay and scores of similar
reefs down the coast, the fate of Green
Island looms perilously close. Harvey
has done all he can to save it, both by
injecting the starfish with a toxic solu-
tion of copper sulphate and by organis-
ing hand collections.
The injector gun, adapted from a de-
vice used on the land for drenching
stock, is supplied by a back-pack. A
snorkeller working over the shallow reef
can dispose of scores of starfish an hour.
This method was developed by the
marine park authority but has never
been widely used mainly because the
copper solution corrodes the equip-
ment, making it difficult to handle.
There is also a question-mark over the
possible consequences of introducing a
toxic heavy metal into the reef environ-
ment.
The most widely used technique of
keeping starfish numbers down in a par-
ticular area, such as Beaver Cay, is by
physically removing them from the
coral. Harvey has been doing this for
years, although it has finally become a
losing battle.
Every couple of weeks, a little group
of volunteers from Mission Beach go


out with Harvey on his boat to clean up
a patch of the best remaining coral.
Most of them are young and out of
work but they do not expect to be paid.
They have a genuine interest in preserv-
ing Beaver Cay and spend all day
diving, with snorkelling gear, to prove
it. With short, hooked sticks they pluck
starfish out of the staghorn coral and tip
them into floating dustbins tethered in
groups.
1 watched them collect more than
100 in about 20 minutes. When the
buckets are full, they tow them to the
beach and dump the starfish. In this
way, Harvey and his helpers have col-
lected more than 18,000 starfish. But the
remaining areas of good coral continue
to shrink between collections.
... dead within three hours
ROBERT RAYMOND
Harvey believes that, with even a
modest amount of help from the author-
ity, not only Beaver Cay but other reefs
might have been saved.
“A team of professional divers could
have cleared the whole of this in four to
six weeks and then our volunteers might
have managed to defend it,” he told me.
“The point is that there are only about
10 reefs along the entire coast that
people visit regularly, in glass-bottomed
boats. They could have been saved. It
would cost a bit of money but now that
tourism is the number two industry in
Queensland, you’d think it would be
worthwhile.”
What frustrates Harvey and others
involved with the reef is persistent lack
of interest by the authority in any form
of local control. A few experiments took
place on Green Island years ago but
nothing practical has come from them.
The kind of possibilities being
ignored were illustrated vividly by an
experiment we filmed at Beaver Cay. It
was based on information that Harvey
obtained from an American tourist who
took the day trip to Beaver Cay last
year. On hearing about the crown of
thorns, the American told Harvey that
commercial oyster beds off the eastern
coast of the United States once had
been threatened by a different kind of
starfish.
The American fisheries authority
eventually discovered that the starfish
could be killed, without harming the
oysters, by “top-dressing” the oyster
beds with granulated slaked lime spread
from an aircraft. The total cost was
something like $250 a hectare.
Harvey got hold of a bag of lime
from a sugar mill near Innisfail and
found that one pea-sized lump placed
on the back of an adult crown of thorns
starfish killed it in a matter of hours.
The lime is just as lethal
under water, as he
demonstrated for us.
We found a small
bommie (coral head) near
Beaver Cay in about three
metres of water, with 30 or
40 starfish feeding on it.
From a boat immediately
over it, Harvey scattered
about four handfuls of
slaked lime on the surface.
The grains sank through
the clear water and settled
on the starfish where they
were trapped by the forest
of spikes. Some grains also
settled on branches of
staghorn coral but most
sank to the sandy bottom.
Next day, we found an
extraordinary scene
around the bommie. Virtu-
ally every starfish was
dead. The grains of lime
had burned angry red cavities into the
mucuous-covered skin. Some starfish
were already disintegrating. The coral
showed small white spots where the
lime had settled but appeared otherwise
unharmed. (On a return visit a month
later, even these blemishes had disap-
peared.)
“I told the marine park authority
about my experiments,” said Harvey,
“but, although they said they would
come out and see me about it, they
never have.”
Not all tourist operators share
Harvey’s conviction that the only way
to tackle the starfish problem is to talk
about it, in the hope of provoking some
official intervention. Doug Tarca, who
runs a highly successful reef-viewing
business out of Townsville, has
maintained for years that the starfish
threat is non-existent.
We could see why Tarca says this
when he invited us to make the trip to
the outer reef in his big, luxurious, 30-
knot catamaran Sea Link.
In the aircraft-type lounge, being
served by tanned hostesses, the 100 or so
passengers watched videos of under-
water movies as their craft com-
manded by Tarca in immaculate whites,
zoomed out 75km to Brewer Reef, not
far from the Outer Barrier.
There the Sea Link was moored at a
very large pontoon, anchored in the lee
of the reef. The pontoon carried picnic
tables and chairs, colored umbrellas,
shower cubicles and palm trees in tubs.
Soon, according to Tarca, it will be
covered with white sand.
While some passengers donned
scuba gear or snorkels, most awaited the
approach of The Yellow Submarine,
which Tarca had gone to collect from its
anchorage.
Designed and built by Tarca, this
extraordinary craft does not submerge.
From the rows of underwater windows
in its hull snug in the carpeted interior,
its passengers, have a fine view of the
corals and fish life as Tarca navigates
slowly over the reef.
Listening to Tarca’s commentary
over the speaker system, few passengers
would realise that what they are seeing
is a protected remnant of a once-luxur-
diant coral landscape and that just be-
yond their range of vision the scene
changes dramatically.
Brewer Reef is being attacked for the
second time since 1962 by the starfish.
We found the encircling reef slope dead
and hordes of starfish working their way
across the reef top toward the area
around the pontoon.
This is apparently too much even for
Tarca who told me he had “never been
worried about the crown of thorns.”
This year, he has begun collecting
starfish to protect his $2 million invest-
ment in the Sea Link project.
“Certainly we’ve been keeping them
off the area that we show with the sub-
marine but, as for a wholesale slaughter
of the crown of thorns, I wouldn’t do
that,” he said. “I believe that they are a
necessary part of the ecology of the reef
to form the barrier that we’ve got today
and if anyone started a wholesale
slaughter of them I would start a cam-
paign to save the crown of thorns.”
Continuing south from Townsville,
we approached a part of the Great Bar-
rier Reef Marine Park where the whole
controversy may well boil over. This is
the Whitsunday group of islands which
contains the greatest aggregation of hol-
iday resorts in Queensland: Hayman,
Lindeman, Daydream, Brampton,
South Molle, Shute Harbor. One of
their main attractions is the opportunity
of visiting the reefs which lie out toward
the edge of the Continental Shelf.
These are next in line if the starfish
maintain what appears to be their
steady advance down the reef. Reports
are coming in of sightings on reefs in
the southern third of the marine park,


which escaped the first invasion in the
60s. If the reefs off the Whitsundays
begin to suffer the fate of those off
Townsville, the consequences will be
much less easy to ignore.
The prospect is beginning to concern
Keith Williams, the ebullient Queens-
land entrepreneur whose Hamilton
Island resort dominates the Whitsunday
group.
Williams has spent $5O million with
a similar amount to go, to carve out
space on the rocky island for a sprawl-
ing complex of luxurious apartments,
hotel rooms, cabins, bars, shops,
restaurants, pools, tennis courts, a zoo, a
harbor for 100 yachts and a jet airstrip
for Ansett Boeing 7675.
Hamilton Island is to be the largest
holiday resort in Australia, designed to
handle 25,000 guests a week. But
Williams told me that much of its
success depends upon the opportunity it
offers to visit the reef.
Hamilton Island runs a daily heli-
copter shuttle service to a floating
helipad at Hook Reef where glass-bot-
tomed boats float over the brilliant beds
of coral and snorkellers and divers ex-
plore the sunlit underwater grottoes.
The procession of helicopters, sea-
planes, flying boats and yachts in and
out of the lagoon at Hook Reef is an
indication of the surge of popular inter-
est in seeing the reef itself and not only
the amenities of the island resorts.
And this growing demand, worth
hundreds of millions to Queensland and
Australia, makes all the more inexplic-
able the air of complacency about the
starfish problem. (Of 56 research pro-
jects in progress in 1982-83, supported
by the authority to the tune of $250,000
and described in the 1983 annual report,
not one dealt with the current activities
of the crown of thorns starfish.)
Although the authority chairman has
his office in Canberra, his staff work in
Townsville and it was there that I had a
long interview with Richard
Kenchington. He is the chief planning
officer and a marine biologist.
Kenchington provided figures to
support the authority’s position that, of
the reefs for which it has reports
about one in 10 of the total of perhaps
2500 reefs only about 15 percent are
infested with starfish.
“There’s a problem there,” he added.
“We have very few records of areas in
the northern third of the reef because
there’s very little traffic there and we
have relatively few records from the
southern third, so all our records come
from that central section of the reef
from Lizard Island down to Bowen. In
that area we are in a situation very simi-
lar to the one that prevailed in 1969. We
are seeing a second event.”
I asked how many reefs had been
damaged by the starfish over, say, the
past 15 years. “No one has any reliable
figures on that, and this is the biggest
problem in this whole debate,” he said
and went on to speak of an assumption,
built up by showing “very powerful
pictures of starfish destroying coral."
that “all aggregations of starfish cause
damage in the region of 90 to 100
percent.” The authority’s figures do not
reflect this.
Kenchington is clearly not impressed
by the campaigns to control starfish
numbers tried in other Pacific ter-
ritories.
“The sorts of programs that have
been mounted in Micronesia and
Okinawa suggest that it’s a great
palliative exercise and you feel that
you’re doing something,” he said. “It's
an obvious PR management stunt but,
in terms of its actual effect in stopping
the activities of the starfish on a reef, it
appears to achieve very little.”
He said the authority had provided
some people in Queensland with injec- |
tion devices but was “not actually into |
the business of picking up the tab for '
collecting starfish.” Finally Kenching-
ton assured me that, on
the basis of what
happened during the
last “episode” and on
the basis of the data
available to the author-
ity, “we can be fairly
comforted that there
is not an overall
catastrophe on our
hands.”
Graeme Kelleher,
chairman of the author-
ity was even more confi-
dent when I interviewed
him in his office in Can-
berra. I asked first
whether he still believed
the statement he made
this year that “there is
no evidence that convinces the majority
of scientists that the reef is at risk.”
“Yes, I believe it more strongly
because the evidence that we’ve
obtained since I made that statement
has confirmed the data that we had
before” and he went on to quote the
results of a recent survey of reefs in the
northern section, from Lizard Island to
Cape York, which showed “much lower
levels of infestation there than we had
anticipated.”
On the question of assisting people
such as Harvey financially to protect the
area in which they operate, Kelleher
said that it was “government policy, not
just an authority policy, that where
there’s something required purely for a
local enterprise, then it is the enter-
prise’s responsibility to meet the cost,
just as, generally speaking, it’s a farm-
er’s responsibility to keep the dingoes or
the rabbits down on his property.”

ROBERT RAYMOND
New craft head for the outer reefs
Kelleher agreed that Endean was
“sincere” in his views about the serious-
ness of the situation but said that “we
know that his access to sources of
information is much less than ours.”
Kelleher said: “The evidence of our
surveys is that the whole reef is not at
risk in the next year or so,” he said. “If
anything, the infestations appear to be
in a state of equilibrium. On that basis
and recognising that government funds
are limited if we spend a million
dollars, that’s a million dollars not
being spent on hospitals. In the absence
of evidence that the reef as a whole is at
threat, I don’t believe that a major
commitment of enormous amounts of
funds is justified.”
No less surprising than the lack of
urgency at the authority was the general
lack of interest among scientists in the'
reasons for the astonishing population
explosions of the starfish over the past


landscape but all too real
On its back: tubed feet for mobility
ROBERT RAYMOND
25 years. This was even commented
upon by Dr D. C. Potts, an Australian
marine biologist now in the United
States, reviewing the latest scientific
literature: “Perhaps the most regrettable
aspect of the Acanthaster controversy is
the failure of ecologists throughout the
Pacific to use a remarkable demo-
graphic phenomenon (whatever its
causes) to test basic assumptions of
coral reef ecology.”
A host of questions about the starfish
phenomenon have yet to be answered or
even thoroughly investigated but one
seems to demand attention: What is
causing these tremendous fluctuations
in the starfish populations?
Astonishingly, 20 years after the first
large-scale outbreaks were reported
from Green Island, there is still no
scientist in Australia working specific-
ally on this question.
I asked Dr Barry Goldman, director
of the Lizard Island Research Station, if
any direct work had been done there on
the question. “No,” said Goldman.
“The only thing that might be related to
that is some monitoring that is taking
place here under the auspices of the
marine park authorities. But, to my
knowledge, nobody is doing any
specific work on the population dynam-
ics of the crown of thorns.”
The obvious place for such work, it
seemed to me, was the Australian In-
stitute of Marine Science. I asked the
director, John Bunt, if any work had
been done on the population dynamics
of the starfish.
“We haven’t been able to start any
work on that just yet,” he said,
“because, to begin with, there’s a techni-
cal difficulty of tagging the things. They
have what one might call a plasticity
which enables them to discard anything
that you tie on to them and we’re
presently looking at a little device which
we think we can implant into them
which they won’t discard. If we can do
that, then, I think we’ve got some hope.
But, reallv, there is a technical pro-
blem.”
I found one scientist
who had spent a con-
siderable amount of time
on this question. He is
Dr John Lucas, in the
department of Zoology
at James Cook Univers-
ity in Townsville.
Lucas is an eager,
dedicated researcher,
and probably knows
more about the
reproductive activities of
Acanthaster planci than
does anyone else in
Australia but even he is
still not sure why some
years only one or two of
the 20-30 million eggs
produced by each female starfish sur-
vive just enough to maintain the
population but occasionally as many
as 1000 from each female go on to reach
maturity, producing a population ex-
plosion. “I looked at water temperature,
salinity, food, and also predation. The
most important factor I found was food.
The amount of algae cells in the ocean
normally is very low, not enough in
normal circumstances to support the
survival of the starfish larvae drifting
through the water. But there may be
particular circumstances, say, after a
particular wet rainy season washes
nutrients into the sea, where there’s
more food and greater survival of the
larvae.”
The further testing of Lucas’s
hypothesis will have to be done by
someone else for he has switched his
research to giant clams.
Endean, believes that human in-
fluence may be the key factor in the
population explosions of starfish, large-
ly through the release of “predator
pressure.” He sees the virtual removal
from the reef of the giant triton shell by
collectors as an important factor.
Another contributing factor may be
the drastic reduction in the numbers of
large reef fish since the invention of
scuba diving and spearfishing; species
such as coral trout, wrasse and the
various cod are all known to eat juven-
ile starfish.
But Endean’s real concern, as we
walked across Beaver Cay this year to
the spot where he issued his first
warning in 1969, is that this second
outbreak is far worse than the first.
“The first time around, it was mostly
branching corals and plate corals that
were affected,” he said. “This time we
find that the hemispherical corals, the
huge brain corals, that have taken in
many cases hundreds and in some cases
thousands of years to attain their pre-
sent dimension they’re being killed.
This is not a normal phenomenon that
happens regularly. It can’t be the
corals are too old!
“I think there’ll now be a succession
of infestations, each one worse than the
preceding one, and I think that the reef
now will remain impoverished as far as
I can see into the future.”
He added: “We have had the op-
portunity to halt these infestations and
not taken the opportunity. We’ve let a
very conservative scientific establish-
ment dictate to our governments and
say that there’s nothing to worry about.
“It’s obvious now that those people
were wrong. It’s not just a passing
phase; it is something which is really
significant and something which is
causing massive damage which may
well result in permanent impoverish-
ment of the Great Barrier Reef.”
While the starfish steadily move on
through the reefs, the deadlock on land
at last shows signs of breaking. The
Crown of Thorns Starfish Advisory
Committee, re-convened this year by
federal Environment minister Barry
Cohen after a long hiatus in research, is
painfully working its way round to
admitting there is a serious situation.
Of course, it is very difficult now for
many scientists and the Great Barrier
Reef Marine Park Authority, to raise
too much of an alarm after denying for
so long that there was anything to worry
about. It may take high-level political
intervention from Canberra to bring
this long, drawn-out conflict into the
open.
If the responsible ministers do not
soon begin to ask some hard questions
and the starfish refuses to go away as it
did before, the crown of thorns issue
could become extremely uncomfortable
for any government to wear. □




When you buy something
by Pierre Cardin,
you’re not buying his name
Y)u’re buying his eye.
Everything by Pierre Cardin
bears his name.
Either discreetly displayed as
part of the design.
Or even more discreetly tucked
away where no one can see it.
It doesn’t really matter.
Yau’re not paying for the name
of this great designer; you’re paying
for his eye.
(And yes, as you can see, he does
have two of them.)
It’s apparent in everything he
does.
Yet how can one man’s talent
continually renew and refresh itself
over 40 years?
After all, he has won the world’s
major fashion awards in every decade
since 1950.
As recently as 1983, he carried
off the gold Thimble for Paris’ most
creative collection.
(It was his third.)
Perhaps the answer lies in the
immense span of his interests.
He is so much more than a
fashion designer.
He designs cars and planes.
He owns Maxim’s in Paris, argu-
ably the world’s greatest restaurant.
He brought a Russian rock show
from Moscow to Paris.
And so it goes on.
And because he stays in such
close touch with so many aspects
of life, his designs are always
contemporary while always retaining
that classic Cardin simplicity of eye.
The result is that anything at all
that bears the Cardin name is highly
distinctive.
And that should be obvious even
to someone with almost no eye at all.


Sobhraj nears freedom to
pursue his murderous ways
NEIGHBORHOOD
Charles Sobhraj, the predator who has boasted that he will kill again, may be
nearing the end of his battle of wits which has disrupted India's judicial and penal
systems. DENIS REINHARDT reports on the manoeuvres of a criminal genius.
ASIA’S most notorious mass
murderer and robber, Charles
Sobhraj, whose victims on the
overland hippie trail of the
early 70s included young
Australians, plans to produce
an autobiographical account
of his bloody crimes and the
way in which he has wreaked
havoc in the Indian penal and
judicial system following his
arrest eight years ago.
The object of bizarre and
chilling lore among the
millions of Australian, Ameri-
can and European back-
packers attracted annually to
South-east Asia where
travellers continue to be
drugged, robbed and disap-
pear mysteriously Sobhraj
is close to defeating charges
laid against him by Indian
authorities and may go free
soon.
A French national, of
Indian and Vietnamese par-
entage, Sobhraj is fighting his
last criminal indictment in
southern India. He remains
wanted in Thailand, Greece,
Nepal and Malaysia and
possibly other countries for
questioning about killings.
Thai police, from whose custody he
escaped amid allegations of high-level
bribery, continue to gather evidence to
support his extradition from India.
From his Bangkok base, Sobhraj and
accomplices are known to have
murdered at least four Europeans and
lethally drugged at least one Australian
couple (who survived).
A daring master of disguise, Sobhraj
now 40 has indicated that a book
describing his activities to date may be
merely a prelude to a renewed career of
murder and pillage. He has nominated
South America as a fruitful continent in
which to immerse himself.
His deeds up to a spectacular arrest
at Delhi’s Vikram Hotel in July 1976,
when the drugging robbery of 60 French
Charles Sobhraj and his associate Marie Andre Leclerc
engineering students went awry, have
been well chronicled in the best-seller,
The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj,
by Australian authors Richard Neville
and Julie Clarke.
Neville recently declined an invita-
tion from Sobhraj to co-write his narra-
tion of prison life. The self-confessed
mass murderer has run the drug system
of India’s premier prison, Tihar jail, in
Delhi, where he has served sentences for
drugging and for robbery eventually
forcing the arrest and dismissal of its
superintendent and deputy.
“I could escape at any time I want
but, for the time being, it is convenient
to stay,” Sobhraj boasted in an in-
terview given over drinks in the prison
governor’s suite.
He has terrorised officials
of the Supreme Court of India
by alternately pleading cases
before it personally and
privately sending emissaries
with offers of bribes.
Describing to me in Sep-
tember 1980 how he first
blackmailed and then de-
posed senior officers of Tihar
jail, Sobhraj said: “I simply
tape-recorded many of the
deals they made ... and then,
one day, let them know and
even gave them one tape to
confirm it.”
Ensnared, a senior official
received a cut on all of
Sobhraj’s heroin sales within
the prison.
Sobhraj was allowed virtu-
ally unlimited visits from his
French-Canadian mistress
Marie Andre Leclerc.
Sobhraj’s influence ex-
tended well beyond the jail.
One of his Thai girlfriends,
Roongrave Sripai, travelled to
Delhi after his capture and
attracted the amorous atten-
tion of his lawyer Dr
Kharana. Kharana narrowly
missed having an eye gouged
out when knifed on his office
doorstep. He bears a vicious scar on one
cheek.
Kharana continues to represent
Sobhraj.
Sobhraj was found guilty in the
Indian city of Benares two years ago of
the murder of an Israeli national. He
outlined his consequent strategy: “After
my conviction in the Benares case, I was
in such a bad state of mind that I
stopped writing to anyone and just
concentrated on getting my appeal com-
menced after just one year in May
1983.
“I simply wrote to the Chief Justice
of the Allahabad High Court that I was
innocent and was starting a hunger
strike and would stop it only when the
hearing of my appeal would commence.


“Five days later, while lying in my
bed with a needle in my vein feeding me
glucose, I was informed that the appeal
was fixed for the next day.
“Although I had top lawyers there, I
took over the arguments after the
second day and argued it myself. It was
the longest appeal ever in that High
Court: five months, every day except
Sundays. Finally, I won.”
Sobhraj sees himself as the cerebal
equal of any: “I had against me the
Advocate-General, with four senior
lawyers. It was really a very tough
fight.”
After winning the appeal in
November last year, Sobhraj was
transferred to Belguam, in the coastal
highlands south of Bombay, to face his
last charges. They related to smuggling.
While in Indian custody, Sobhraj
was safe from extradition by the Thais.
He was back in the High Court
within weeks, seeking release on a bond
on the grounds that his period in jail
now exceeded the maximum sentence
for the offence. The court agreed but
decided that, since Sobhraj was a
foreign national, he should stay in jail
until someone personally stood surety
for him.
“I think I am succeeding (in finding
a guarantor),” he said recently. If he
does, Sobhraj will be free to move
throughout India while the case is
delayed and finally heard.
After that, if he can elude extradi-
tion, he may well melt into the
travellers’ world again to relive his
boast made to the Indian monthly
Surya in May 1980: “I never kill good
people.” □
Defence lawyer Kharana: attacked
NEW ZEALAND
Big Australians
quick to snap
up bargains
David Lange: to float or not?
By IAN TEMPLETON
EXPLOITING a favorable exchange
rate, Australian conglomerate ACI In-
ternational Ltd is bidding SNZ2OI
million for the 44 percent which it does
not already own of the highly profitable
New Zealand company Alex Harvey
Industries Ltd. AHI is the sixth-largest
listed company in New Zealand, with
assets approaching SNZSOO million.
Already the bid is creating political
waves. Former opposition leader Sir
Robert Muldoon has questioned how
many other Australian giants will buy
up New Zealand industry, describing
the takeover as “the writing on the wall
for the rest of New Zealand industry.”
Chairman of the Wellington Stock
Exchange Bruce Buxton suggested New
Zealand could be at risk of being taken
to the cleaners. Moves to gain full
control of such companies as AHI,
Dunlop New Zealand (by Dunlop
Olympic) and Rheem New Zealand (by
its Australian parent) could be the start,
said Buxton, of a procession as
Australian companies sought to take
advantage of the devalued New
Zealand dollar. “We should not be so
naive as to dismantle all financial con-
trols when our entrepreneurs do not
have a similar opportunity to acquire
equity interests in Australia.”
Drawn into the debate,
Prime Minister David Lange
told reporters the government
would not allow New Zealand
to be “raped by dough from
abroad.” He said the govern-
ment would act quickly to
stop any trans-Tasman raid
on “cheap” New Zealand
companies if such takeovers
were not in the nation’s in-
terests.
Lange said his government
would not be putting the
shutters up on the closer
economic relationship (CER)
with Australia. “We are
talking about New Zealand
having an economic base and
a philosophy where new
venture capital which will
produce exports and jobs will
be welcomed. But if someone
wants to buy four hamburger
bars which are already operat-
ing, then to hell with them.”
The government is sen-
sitive on the trans-Tasman in-
vestment issue because it lifted the
embargo on Australian investment
imposed by the previous government, in
the expectation that the Hawke govern-
ment would ease its investment rules as
they apply to New Zealand companies
investing in Australia. So far there has
been no sign of the investment rules
being harmonised, although “any day
now.”
Since the Labor government de-
valued the NZ dollar by 20 percent,
Australian companies can buy New
Zealand assets relatively cheaply. For
example, the ACI bid for Alex Harvey
Industries will cost it only $ All 6
million. New Zealand’s biggest com-
pany, Fletcher Challenge, has been the
subject of speculation that it will soon
be the target for an Australian bid.
The government has an even more
significant problem on its hands with
the exchange rate at its present level.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have
flooded into the country in recent
weeks, attracted first by the very high
interest rates the government itself is
paying on its own stock, and secondly
by the prospect that the dollar may be
either revalued or floated.
The government is paying interest
rates of 17 percent or more in order to
soak up the flood of money and keep a
tight control on the growth of the
money supply. But the higher interest
rates go, the more hot money pours into
Wellington.
Floating the dollar could be the
textbook economists’ answer. It is
favoured by Treasury and it seemed to
work in Australia’s case. But it could
have serious political and economic
risks in New Zealand. The government


claimed when it devalued by 20 percent
that it was setting a “realistic” new rate.
The old rate seriously overvalued the
New Zealand dollar.
Buxton told the Wellington Stock
Exchange that New Zealand could
jeopardise its economic stability by
floating the dollar.
He said: “When you consider that
New Zealand’s entire cashflow is less
than some of the international trading
conglomerates it becomes obvious that
we must maintain control of our kiwi
dollar against external manipulation.
We don’t want a controlled economy,
but we don’t want to lose control of it
either and become a banana republic.”
He asserted that the “excessive”
devaluation and the delay in adjusting
the dollar’s value had favored in-
ternational speculators.
Monetarists argue that floating the
exchange rate would provide an
automatic adjustment to external
payments balances, and thus would
eliminate the country’s persistent pro-
blem with its balance of payments.
But a June International Monetary
Fund survey of 20 years’ experience of
floating exchange rates noted that they
had not, in fact, provided rapid
automatic elimination of balance of
payments deficits.
Almost certainly a float of the ex-
change rate would introduce another
element of uncertainty for New Zealand
traders fighting to maintain their posi-
tion in world markets.
What may finally deter the govern-
ment from floating the exchange rate is
the criticism it would attract from
within the labor movement itself. Al-
ready the Lange government has been
attacked for its free-wheeling
monetarist policies.
Floating the exchange rate would
signal that the government has been
taken over completely by the
monetarists and would deepen the
frustration of those who feel that Labor
has departed from its traditional
principles. But the government’s finance
troika Messrs Roger Douglas,
Richard Prebble and David Caygill
have shown scant regard for traditional
Labor concepts in their campaign to
return New Zealand to “economic re-
ality.” They would not be deflected
from floating the dollar if they thought
it necessary.
Clearly they would want to see trans-
Tasman investment rules harmonised
and other pre-conditions met before
they “floated.”
Given the hazards of the operation
they might well consider a “managed
float” to gain the benefits without the
penalties.
It could be a test of whether the New
Zealand economy can stand on its own
feet. □
THE PACIFIC
Holidaymakers in Noumea: no need to cancel tours
By STUART INDER
THE AUSTRALIAN Department of
Foreign Affairs and the New Caledonia
Tourist Office in Sydney are being
flooded with inquiries from Australians
asking whether they should cancel their
Christmas holiday tours to New Cal-
edonia.
Tourist apprehension has followed
the widespread publicity in Australia
about violence in New Caledonia.
The unrest reached its peak late last
week when nine Kanak nationalists
including two brothers of the in-
dependence movement leader Jean-
Marie Tjibaou, were shot dead by un-
known assailants.
General advice from both the depart-
ment and the tourist office is “Don’t
cancel your visit to Noumea, but don’t
plan at the moment to tour areas outside
the capital.”
New Caledonia Tourist Office man-
ager Henri Maniquant said last week
that about 250 cancellations for
December-January had been reported
to the office up to that time but most of
these appeared to be related to the
cancellation of the Pacific Arts Festival
which was scheduled for December.
“We certainly wouldn’t send any-
body over there if there was danger, but
there are no problems in Noumea or
between Noumea and the airport at
Tontouta,” Maniquant said. “We are in
constant touch and will know should
there be any changes.”
Sitmar’s Fairstar was unable to dis-
embark passengers in Noumea a week
ago but managing director Thomas
Blarney stressed that this was because of
a one-day general strike in the town
which closed shops and the port, and
not because passengers would have
been in any danger.
Sitmar, P & O, CTC and Royal
Viking are all making visits to Noumea
over the holidays P & O’s Oriana and
Canberra will make a half-dozen cruises
there between them and all manage-
ments say they are “watching” the
situation but don’t expect any difficult-
ies for passengers. All the lines have
contingency plans.
Meanwhile, there have been import-
ant political developments aimed at
resolving New Caledonia’s immediate
problems, with the arrival in Noumea of
President Mitterrand’s special envoy,
Edgard Pisani.
He has taken over full authority in
New Caledonia and has demanded an
end to the campaign of disruption
which broke out following the recent
elections, setting December 15 as the
deadline.
In return he will negotiate separately
with the conservative forces and the
Front de Liberation National Kanak et
Socialiste “provisional government”
about future moves, especially a voting
formula for a referendum on in-
dependence, put forward a plan by
January 5 and pass it to Paris for
approval by February 2.
The decision by Paris to take over the
situation at this level and to continue
dialogue despite the violence of recent
weeks is an indication of how gravely
the New Caledonian troubles are
viewed. At the same time Paris has
issued a clear warning that it won’t
tolerate further assaults on law and
order in the territory. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The man who is following
in Ron Brierley’s footsteps
Bruce Judge and his team took control of a near-insolvent quarrying company
two and a half years ago and transformed it into Ariadne Australia Ltd a
conglomerate that is nudging for a place among the Top 100 listed companies.
DAVID HASELHURST reviews their achievement.
THE EARLY months of 1982 were dark
days for shareholders in South Pine
Quarries Ltd which was close to in-
solvency. The shares had fallen to 16c
and the company’s market capitalisa-
tion had collapsed to less than S 7
million as the management wrestled
with a string of unprofitable quarries,
non-income-earning mining invest-
ments and other disasters.
A one-for-one issue of convertible
preference shares was announced but
the underwriter pulled out in a falling
share market, leaving a shortfall of $4.8
million in the hoped-for raising of $6.3
million. Into the breach stepped Bruce
Judge and associates from New
Zealand who took up the shortfall and
then spent another $BOO,OOO on the
market to gain a 28 percent stake in the
company. They took control of the
board a week later and discovered that
they had bought more than they had
bargained on, for the company was
losing $500,000 a month and an entire
management change was needed.
Shareholders foolhardy enough to
have stayed with the company would be
well pleased today. Anyone with a
parcel of 1000 shares worth $l6O in
early 1982, had all rights to subsequent
issues been exercised for a total of $445,
would hold shares worth $1375.
They would also have an entirely
different company in the reconstructed
Ariadne Australia Ltd which has a
market capitalisation of close to $llO
million. That makes it about one-fifth
the size of Industrial Equity Ltd, the
major conglomerate started 18 years
ago by that other New Zealander Ron
Brierley.
Brierley used his New Zealand com-
pany Brierley Investments Ltd to back
him when he made his step across the
Tasman into Australia and that com-
pany owns 51 percent of lEL Ltd. Judge
was a director of Brierley Investments,
from 1974 to 1979 when he went out to
start a New Zealand operation in the
mergers and acquisitions business. In
Bruce Judge: turned South Pine Quarries from disaster to success
that endeavor he was backed by Christ-
church millionaire Cyril Smith and the
publicly-listed H.W. Smith Ltd and the
New Zealand South British Insurance
Group.
Judge became as well known in New
Zealand as Brierley and was so success-
ful that he sold his private investment
company into a public company he
managed Bunting and Co Ltd and
early this year merged it into Brierley
Investments Ltd. (Judge, with 1.1
million BI shares, is the second biggest
non-institutional holder in that com-
pany after Brierley himself. With 10.2
million shares, Brierley has 6.2 percent
of the capital. Judge also has rejoined
the Brierley Investments board.)
Judge’s first raid across the Tasman
was barely noticed in March 1982 when
he used H.W. Smith Ltd as the vehicle
to pay $2.2 million for the Federal
Broom Co Pty Ltd.
Federal Broom was an old family
company established in 1901 by Daniel
French. It was still on the same site in
the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt 80
years later, in buildings that had ex-
panded willy-nilly with lean-tos, add-
ons and the acquisition of neighboring
houses.
The broom and brush business was


characterised by too many small makers
producing a large range of marginally
profitable lines. Judge thought it ripe for
rationalisation. He had had some ex-
perience in that field.
Bunting and Co Ltd, years earlier,
had taken over leading NZ paintbrush
manufacturer T. Pollock and Son Pty
Ltd which also had a profitable sub-
sidiary in Australia under the manage-
ment of Max Smith. The subsidiary was
sold to a paint roller manufacturer and
Judge, who had a high regard for Smith,
asked his former Australian manager to
look for opportunities.
The Federal Broom Co was it. Smith
moved in within two months of the
takeover and cut 250 slow-selling items
out of a product line which encom-
passed an astonishing range of more
than 1000 brooms and brushes.
In the meantime, Judge took control
of South Pine Quarries and made an-
other foray in David Hartley Computers
Pty Ltd, a once-successful software
company based in Brisbane which had
fallen on bad times when it went into
computer hardware manufacture.
South Pine bought the assets of
Hartley from the receiver, injected $2.5
million to resuscitate it and on-sold it to
NZ South British for $3 million.
Losses and write-offs totalled $6.6
million in South Pine for the year to
June 30, 1982, and late that year the
company’s name was changed to
Ariadne the name of a beauty from
Greek mythology who fell in love with
Theseus, slayer of the Minotaur, but was
abandoned by that hero. Very curious.
Ariadne began its turnaround and by
June 30 last year had reversed the
previous year’s loss into a net of $2.02
million despite some disagreements
with auditors who regarded certain
items included in the result as ex-
traordinary profits.
In one of the more successful moves
of early 1983, Ariadne paid $3.1 million
to buy the Federal Broom Co from
Judge’s NZ associate H.W. Smith Ltd.
Ariadne took over the business of
Mitchell’s, the Brush People, head-
quartered in the Melbourne suburb of
Brunswick, at the same time. Thus, the
dominant New South Wales brush and
broom maker was merged with its
Victorian counterpart.
Ahead of the merger, Mitchells
employed 158 people and Federal
Broom had 130 employees. After the
merger and with some product
rationalisation total staff was halved
to 140.
The Federal’s freehold was sold and
most of the manufacturing was moved to
much smaller and leased premises in the
outer south-western Sydney suburb of
Chipping Norton.
The Melbourne warehouse and a
minor millet broom making business were
confirmed to smaller leased floorspace
again.
Profits of the combined $l2 million-
a-year turnover business have nearly
doubled and its only major rival is the
listed SABCO Ltd of South Australia.
For the remainder of 1983, the
pruner’s knife was busy in Ariadne.
More than $2 million was raised
through the sale of surplus property,
quarries and other real assets. The
directors also found that the old South
Pine group had rights over certain
“high-tech” ventures which ultimately
were capitalised and injected into two
“shell” companies but not before
much soul-searching.
As The Bulletin’s Speculator (June 5)
reported this year, Judge late in 1982
discovered in one of the filing cabinets
in South Pine’s offices curious details
about an interest in a fuel technology
venture involving the gigantic
MlcDonnell Douglas Corporation.
It appears that a wheeler-dealer from
Perth had become involved in a con-
versation at that city’s Parmelia Hotel
concerning an American inventor
named Eric Cottrell. Cottrell held
patents over a concept to mix pulverised
coal with oil and water to produce a
cheap furnace feed.
The Perth connection took the tale to
Brisbane’s Les Ward, then chairman of
South Pine Quarries Ltd. It was the oil
price hike year of 1979. Ward was
convinced and got into talks with the
inventor’s agent, Kentucky patent man-
agers Hilliard Lyons.
Cottrell had sold United States rights
to a small Kentucky company
CoaLiquid Inc, in 1976 so South Pine
paid more than $1 million plus on-going
commitments for rights to much of the
rest of the world.
But the Cottrell process was still very
much an idea which needed three of
four years’ research and development
and many millions of dollars to make it
workable. Thus South Pine’s rights


Ariadne’s brushware factory in the outer Sydney suburb of Chipping Norton: profits have nearly doubled
languished in the tiling cabinet until
Judge discovered it. With his main
priority to stem the bleeding of the
company’s scarce cash resources, Judge
sent Australian scientist Dr Alan
Walker to the US to look at the process
and somehow extricate the group from
further involvement.
McDonnell Douglas in the meantime
had gained control of CoaLiquid Inc
and had brought the idea up to a
realistic process. Instead of pulling out,
Walker and Judge managed to convince
McDonnell Douglas to accept them as
international partners jointly owning
the non-American rights in most of the
rest of the world.
Ariadne then injected its half-share
in CoaLiquid International into the
shell of Impala Securities Ltd which was
spun-off as a new public flotation. Its
market capitalisation now exceeds $34
million, excluding share options.
The first CoaLiquid plant of com-
mercial scale was opened in the US last
January. A month later, CoaLiquid
launched a 40,000 tonnes-a-year plant
in Korea for the Korean Electric Power
Corp.
As the table on page 85 shows,
Ariadne holds 40 percent of Impala and
both companies have holdings in In-
ternational Resources and Technology
Ltd. IR & T is developing a technology
to harness sound waves for commercial
applications such as improving the ex-
Max Smith, general manager of Ariadne’s brushware division
traction of gold from leaching solutions.
To bolster this company with something
a bit more down-to-earth, Ariadne was
able to sell into it four concrete and
quarry plants around Cairns and other
quarries in Albury and Brisbane. More
recently, it on-sold into IR & T a
concern acquired in the group a year
ago, called Windscreen World, with car
windscreen fitting businesses in


Melbourne and Brisbane and a turnover
of more than $5 million a year.
It is now proposed to sell a 14.9
percent equity in IR & T to Winstones
Ltd, a New Zealand quarrying and
concrete company seeking a move
offshore with Australia the logical
first step.
Judge’s takeovers follow an eclectic
pattern. They are rundown and ripe for
an assets realisation and re-launch (the
broom business) or they can be spun off
with enormous capital gains to the
parent (the high-tech companies) or
they offer growth potential.
Into the last category must fall
Mamma Fiorelli’s Foods, started on a
shoestring by a former woolclasser
named Michael Clarke. Out of a
Brisbane delicatessen, he began buying
in bread and reconstituting it as garlic
and herb bread. It is distributed nation-
ally and the first overseas franchise has
been let in South Africa.
Another more recent takeover in the
food area was Biogenic Health Foods
makers of muesli, vegetable chips and
nut products in Brisbane with the
potential to go national.
Apart from major moves into
Queensland property development with
the acquisitions of Myer Realty and
Martin Properties (once again with a
New Zealand partner), the Ariadne
group with its financial expertise has
signalled an obvious intention to ex-
pand its presence in the trendy world of
financial services with the purchase of a
strategic equity in the Bank of
Queensland.
And, not to be discouraged from
stretching the executive talents further,
it has grabbed a 40 percent stake in
Barwon Farmlands Ltd. This un-
fortunate company floated in August
1983 with 5.3 million $1 shares, of which
the public paid $1.7 million cash, to
develop an irrigated cotton plantation
in northern NSW on an 11,034-hectare
property. It was under-capitalised and
inadequately managed and two of the
majore shareholders sold their 40 per-
cent equity to Ariadne for 10c a share.
Ariadne has acquired the successful
property next door and installed that
property’s successful management and
now, with the staff halved, the company
expects the next crop from the
combined properties to be quadrupled.
An offer to other shareholders at 10c
attracted little response.
As an insight into Judge’s modus
operandi, Ariadne will probably end up
with a significantly increased holding in
Barwon through a current one-for-one
non-renounceable rights issue at 20c a
share. The offer is pitched at twice
Araidne’s buy-in price and that com-
pany has sub-underwritten 40 percent
of the issue with Brisbane stockbroker
Paul Morgan and Co. □

INSURANCE
Agreement has
two companies
laughing ...
Tony Greig: pride of the Lion
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
AN ARRANGEMENT between the
international Baillieu Bowring Marsh
and McLennan and fast-growing Sydney
group Lion Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd,
looks set to create a potent force in the
insurance broking industry.
In a co-operation agreement, the
brokers seek to develop and pursue new
market opportunities. The companies
will retain their identities and remain
financially independent.
The agreement brings together
strong corporate and personal insur-
ance expertise. Part of the world’s
largest broking group, Marsh &
McLennan Companies Inc of New York,
Baillieu Bowring Marsh and McLennan
provides comprehensive corporate risk
management services.
The Lion, highly visible in the
marketplace and a subsidiary of Con-
solidated Press Holdings Ltd has expert-
ise in life and personal lines insurance.
Tony Greig, managing director of
Lion, and Terry Paradine who is a
director and general manager (NSW) of
Baillieu Bowring say the companies will
tap specialist opportunities jointly.
They would put insurance packages
together to meet the needs of special
interest or affinity groups such as the
employees of large corporations.
Lion will have access to Baillieu
Bowring’s corporate contacts and
overseas experience while the in-
ternational broker will be able to use the
Lion’s 150-strong field force. □
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Some tips plane sailing
MANY PEOPLE ask where does the
Speculator get his information? Well,
I’ll tell you.
Some of it comes from readers who
write to draw my attention to com-
panies in which they have an interest.
Some comes by way of “hot tips” from
urgers, promoters and brokers all of
which we check if they are to be used.
But most material for this column
comes from the time-consuming chore
of sifting through the many quarterly
and annual reports lodged by small
listed companies and often overlooked
in the daily press.
Thus it was that I had time last week,
flying from Sydney to Perth, to catch up
on the annual report of Delta Gold NL,
sent to shareholders a month ago.
In that time, Delta’s shares have
weakened somewhat in line with other
gold stocks and the company carries a
market capitalisation of less than $3.4
million on its 24.24 million 25c shares
half of which were vendor stock and
should come out of escrow this month
since the company floated in November
1983.
The best thing going for the com-
pany when it floated was its board and
management among the best-
qualified line-ups of talent to be found
in a junior exploration company.
Directors are:
■ Executive chairman Peter
Vanderspuy, a geologist with post-
graduate degrees and 20 years’ ex-
perience in exploration and develop-
ment in Africa, North America, New
Zealand and Australia.
■ Executive director Dr David Gel-
latly, another highly-qualified geologist
and a former Amaz man in Western
Australia from 1971-1982.
■ Gerry Govett, Professor of
Geology, University of NSW.
■ Sydney lawyer Peter Knudsen.
■ Sydney lawyer and engineer
Robert Scriven.
■ Dr Richard De Voto, a professor at
the Colorado School of Mines and
founder of Canyon Resources Corpora-
tion.
De Voto and Vanderspuy formed in
Australia Canyon Resources Pty Ltd
which has 35 percent of a joint venture
with nine North American and
European venture capital investors (65
percent) which constitutes the bulk of
the vendor block in Delta Gold.
The company floated a year ago on
two major hopes:
■ A large collection of prospects in
the Laverton area, 200 kilometres north
of Kalgoorlie and
■ A consolidation of much of the
ground covering the old Kanowna
bonanza, 2km north-east of Kalgoorlie.
The latest annual report (plus the
September quarterly) shows that Delta
and its joint venture partners (primarily
Geopelco) have completed more than
36,000 m of rotary air blast drilling
down to 60 metres in the past 15 months
with many promising intersections on at
least four prospects within the 80 sq km
tenements in both deep lead alluvials
and hard rock.
Delta has around $1.7 million
remaining in net current assets, so is
well able to fund its commitments for
another year or two.
The July 1986 options (exercise price
35c) have fallen away to 4c and, like last
week’s pick of Central Victorian
Goldmines’ options, they have lot of
leverage and a long life.

The best Coonawarra white wines bear
several distinguishing features.
A definitive varietal aroma. A full
flavour, complex, yet with great finesse.
More often than not the best
Coonawarra white wines also bear the
Rouge Homme label.
A fine example is the 1984 vintage
Rhine Riesling.
It has outstanding varietal and
distinctive regional character, typical of
Coonawarra.

WILDCAT
The puzzle of Elders’ cold feet
THE SYDNEY Stock Exchange found
itself in a peculiar position when Elders
IXL Ltd got cold feet about joining the
options boards.
Peter Marshman, managing director
of the exchange, claimed that on the
Friday before Elders’ listing deadline of
Monday, December 3, Elders told the
exchange it did not want listing to
proceed.
Appointment to the options board is
normally considered a privilege and
coming-of-age of a company and Elders
is the first to request non-listing.
The exchange reluctantly went along
with the Elders request but wrote to the
company seeking a written explanation
urgently. Marshman said the ex-
change was also seeking legal advice on
the eventuality of its listing the options
against the will of Elders.
Wildcat should explain that the op-
tions market is provided to allow
traders to hedge positions they hold in
shares, in a type of futures market.
Investors can also punt on a stock
rising, through a “call” option, or
falling, through a “put” option.
Marshman explained that Elders had
plenty of warning of the listing in
advance. There are now 11 stocks
traded on the options boards, including
BHP Ltd, Santos Ltd, MIM Ltd,
Woodside Petroleum Ltd and CSR Ltd.
Stockbroker opinion has it that
Elders is worried that the options
market could give share register pre-
dators such as Robert Holmes a Court
greater access to the company’s stock.
Elders’ share price rose from around $4
to $5.40 (before the 1 for 2 bonus issue)
in September on high turnover, and
Holmes a Court was mooted as a heavy
buyer. He is believed to have ac-
cumulated some 12 million shares (fol-
lowing the bonus issue) in Elders, or
some 5 percent of the ordinary capital.
Elders would also be looking at the
way Holmes a Court has dominated
BHP option trading in recent times. The
positions taken in an option market can
be a heavy influence on how a share
price performs in the future. Elders may
also be concerned at the possible man-
ipulation of its share price with the
introduction of options.
Not impressed
SHAREMARKETS appeared un-
impressed with the BHP Ltd share split
last week. After the “whole” shares had
closed the previous week at $10.55, the
two “halves” finished their first day at
$5.14 effectively 27 cents down when
totalled. At week’s end the price had not
changed much.
A BHP spokesman said: “It’s hard to
know whether it was the market or the
split.” Admittedly the All Ordinaries
was well down over the week. The split
means that there are 910 million issued
BHP shares with a par value of $l,
against half that number of $2 par
shares previously.
Through the split, BHP is hoping to
widen its base of 164,000 individual
shareholders. Shareholders are being
sent letters explaining the split and will
be given a statement of their holdings,
before and after. They will then be
asked to return their share certificates
for re-issue. Replacing them are what
BHP calls “distinctive” new $1 certifi-
cates.
Unwelcome advice
AUSTRALIAN Fixed Trusts’s general
manager, sales and marketing, Dick
Hargraves, is fuming over the antics of
some so-called investment advisers. He
says that one adviser not one of
AFT’s army of full-time consultants
advised an investor with a tidy swag of
units in AFT’s Real Property Growth
Trust No 3, to sell the package.
The No 3 trust which is aimed
solely at capital growth with no income
distribution is not due for its first
revaluation until some time next year.
Valuations are the only way that the
capital growth trust investments can
increase in value. Often the gains come
in the distribution of further units.
Anyone who took the investment
adviser’s word would be selling out their
units for 46 cents (the original 50 cent
unit less the trust manager’s 8 percent
front-end management fee). The only
way the adviser could justify pulling the
investor out would be if he thought that
the revaluation would prove disastrous
enough to cause the unit price to fall
below 46 cents.
The results of the revaluations of
AFT’s first two Real Property Growth
trusts were disappointing but would not
warrant such a desperate move. After
three years the No 1 trust showed a
compound growth rate of 10.6 percent
(after the 8 percent initial fee) while the
No 2 valuation, announced last week,
had an even lower 6.23 percent growth.
While Hargraves says that good in-
vestment advisers are invaluable in the
market place, he says a downturn in the
rate of growth of funds into property
and other trusts over the last few
months is seeing some independent
advisers hemorrhaging.
He says that of new funds of some
$25 million a month now entering all
AFT trusts, 7 to 10 percent comes from
independent advisers and the rest
through its own team of salesmen. A
few months ago, 15 percent came from
independents.
History for sale
WHEN THE NSW property Kanga-
roobie goes under the hammer this
week, the vendors will be hoping the
successful bidder has both a sense of
history and business. The 809-hectare
grazing and farming property near
Orange lends itself to subdivision but
the sellers, the Dalton family, would
like to see it held together.
Michael Dalton, great-grandson of
James Dalton, who arrived in Australia
in 1840 and built Kangaroobie from the
profits of a store on the goldfields, told
Wildcat: “We are hoping to do business
with people who will lock the place into
the way it is for about 20 years.” The
property is being auctioned by Richard-
son and Wrench and W. J. Bridges Real
Estate, both of Sydney. It is also for sale
by private treaty.
The main aesthetic draw of the pro-
perty is the Kangaroobie home a
gracious, two-storeyed, brick mansion
“If I had wanted your opinion, Trousdale, I
would have had it beaten out of you!”


with a wrought iron lace balcony and
spacious grounds. Built around 1870,
the National Estate-listed home is ac-
companied by a “retinue” of cottages,
stables, shearing sheds, workshops and
a separate six-bedroom house. But the
Daltons are not selling aesthetics only,
which can be seen in an economic
feasibility study prepared by consult-
ants Purtle Partners.
The study concluded that land and
buildings (including the main home)
carried a value of $2.5 million; the
sheep and cattle, $328,890; and a
modern piggery complex, $1.5 million.
The piggery with a cash flow of
$lO,OOO a week is one area available
for subdivision.
What kind of return does
Kangaroobie offer? The consultants say
annual pre-tax profit is more than
$495,000 for a return on the total
investment of $4.38 million of 11.3
percent. The property should also have
capital growth of a conservative 13.7
percent a year, according to Purtle.
Any prospective buyer should heed
important assumptions recognised by
Purtle: “Good seasonal conditions and
good management.” □
THE CHARTIST
Gene Link and Hitek - a contrast in trend
by Russell hander
LAST WEEK we looked at Sarich
Technologies Trust which has since
moved up on the market under strong
buying pressure. There is certainly a lot
of interest in high-tech companies at
present but it would be wrong to give
the impression that all such stocks are
currently reaching for new high ground.
The two Bridge Data charts presented
are daily plots on Gene Link Limited
and Hitek Limited.
Gene Link is at its lowest level since
listing earlier this year and is half its
best level. Hitek on the other hand,
having attained listing in October 1984,
is presently sitting at $1.30 which com-
pares with opening levels around 70
cents and a subscription price of 50
cents. As with Sarich Technologies
Trust, neither of these charts lend
themselves to bold price projections but
illustrate the volatile nature of high-tech
stocks as might be expected, consider-
ing the great uncertainties with which
the investor must grapple.
Lor the record Gene Link Ltd.
formerly Gentech Australia Ltd is
working on a variety of products which
include diagnostic kits for genital
herpes and chlamydia (a venereal dis-
ease), fermentation processes, mush-
room blotch disease control, accelerated
tree growth, herpes vaccine and the
export of Australian native plants and
flowers. With 26.2 million shares on
issue Gene Link has a market capitalisa-
tion of $23 million.
Hitek appears far more specialised
being concerned with the commercial
development of cuspation and dilation
(ie point forming and stretching) sys-
tems for processing plastics into a wide
range of products such as margarine
tubs, drains, oyster bed nets, tennis
court and carpet underlays, food and
beverage containers, building panels
and pallets.
These systems should enable low cost
polypropylene to be used in a wide
variety of applications not possible with
traditional thermal forming or injection
moulding methods.
With an issued capital of 23 million
shares Hitek has a market capitalisation
of $3O million.
In the case of each issue some idea of
the upside potential was given by the
promoters.
Gene Link showed a projected re-
venue of $9.0 million for 1984-85 rising
to a towering $115.28 million in 1988-89
giving rise to respective
earnings of a negative $1.96
million in 1984-85 and a very
positive $27.35 million in
1988-89.
Hitek’s prospectus gives no
revenue or earnings pro-
jections but quantifies the
annual combined sales value
in N. America, Western
Europe, Japan and Australia
for the products to which it is
addressing its technology as
follows: margarine, ice cream
and yoghurt containers, $607
million; cans (a market open
to plastic substitutes), $1634
million and drainage pro-
ducts, $965 million.
All very exciting stuff but
as hard to put a value on as a
work of art.

THE MODEST FARMER
Our miserable strike record
by Bert Kelly
MAVIS had just heard of a recent
poll showing that most people were
against any radical alterations to our
industrial relations system, so she sent a
message for me to return home at once.
I thought that something awful must
have happened on the farm, such as a
header breakdown, but when I reached
home I found that Mavis was only
worried about me.
“Don’t go getting yourself embroiled
in another hopeless battle, dear,” she
said with surprising tenderness. “You
spent the best years of your political life
fighting those wretched old tariffs,
pushed from behind by that pigheaded
Mr Eccles.
“Now, if you are not careful, you are
likely to spend your declining years
engaged in another hopeless fight about
arbitration or something, pushed from
behind by Mr Stone. You must learn to
grow old gracefully, dear.”
I suppose Mavis is right, but even she
admitted on my birthday that we were
at last getting somewhere in the tariff
battle. When I first started trudging
after that hare, Mavis and almost
everyone else thought I was wasting my
time, but now most thinking people
agree tariffs must come down and the
only disagreement is how fast this
should be done.
So perhaps if we keep plodding like
tortoises after the arbitration hare, we
might wear him down in the end.
Anyhow, I wouldn’t like to desert my
colleagues, people such as John Stone,
Professors Blandy and Niland, and
other hardy souls. I remember those
verses of Clough’s that go:
Say not, the struggle nought availeth,
The labor and the wounds are vain,
The enemy faints not, nor faileth,
And as things have been, they remain.
If hopes be dupes, fears may be liars;
It may be, in yon smoke concealed,
Your comrades chase e’en now the fliers
And, but for you, possess the field.
I have said before that there must be
something radically wrong with our
economic system; why else do we who
have so much do so badly? Our poor
performance compared with other
countries has been measured time after
time by many people so I will not go
through it all again.
This time I will compare our in-
dustrial relations performance with that
of other countries that are in the big
league with us, the OECD countries.
The table shows quite clearly that in the
20 years to 1981 (the last year common
figures were available) Australia’s strike
record ranked 16th in a field of 20, with
only Ireland, Canada, Italy and Iceland
doing worse than we. I have taken a 20-
year span in order to even out the effect
of particular years, which could be
caused by elections or booms and busts.

Canada 765 18
Italy 1347 19
Iceland 1407 20
I think that this measurement of the
number of working days is as fair a
measure of the effectiveness of an in-
dustrial relations system as could be
devised, yet by it we certainly do not
shine. While there are four countries
which perform even worse than we do,
it is hard to see how the public in
general, and the Industrial Relations
Club in particular, can be satisfied with
a system that performs so badly.
Club members may claim that
though we are on strike more often than
our competitors, we work with great
enthusiasm while we are working.
Believe that if you can. I know that in
industries such as shearing, where there
is payment by performance, our chaps
get on with it but this is certainly not so
in other industries.
The real reason why we back away
from the trauma of trying to change our
present system is that we know that the
industrial unrest that would follow any
radical change would lead to strikes of
immense proportions. So we will con-
tinue to wander down the paths of the
past, too frightened to change.
In other words, we know that old
Bruce, our industrial relations dinosaur,
is not as useful as the tractors that our
competitors are using, but we are used
to him and selling him to get a modern
tractor would make him mad. □

PIERPONT
THIS WILL shock Phillip Adams but
Pierpont has just renounced his
membership of Australian Sceptics. The
reason is that your correspondent has
suddenly begun to believe in Un-
identified Flying Objects.
Specifically, your correspondent
firmly believes that UFOs are hovering
over Australia kidnapping local gold
mines and transporting them to Alpha
Centauri or whichever galaxy aliens use
for their home exchange.
Pierpont first detected this invasion
upon reading the 1984 annual report of
Lightning Ridge Mining NL. In the
flicker of a few pages, it became appar-
ent to Pierpont that the bulk of the
company’s assets had disappeared
during the year to June 30.
At June 30, 1983, the good old
Lightning Ridge group had net assets of
$3.6 million. At the latest balance date,
this figure had shrunk convulsively to
$817,000.
The major item here was a write-off
of $4.3 million of previously capitalised
mineral exploration expenditure. This,
in turn, was due to the closure of the
Clermont gold mine near Blair Athol in
Queensland.
Lightning Ridge commissioned plant
at Clermont late last March, treated
40,000 cubic metres, discovered that
gold returns were “significantly below
the geological grade estimate” and put
the plant on a care and maintenance
basis on May 22.
Counting on his rheumatic fingers,
Pierpont calculates that Clermont must
have been a mine for all of eight weeks.
Offhand, Pierpont can recall few mines
with a shorter life.
The mystery deepened when
Pierpont harked back to Lightning
Ridge’s 1983 report. Then, directors
said they had bought Clermont on the
basis of “highly encouraging reports
from consultants and evaluations of
earlier work and studies on the area.”
The 1983 report gave the volume of
“proven mineable alluvial material” at
960,000 cubic metres at an average
grade of 0.6 grams a cubic metre.
Now, Pierpont knows that proven
ore reserves do not just vanish
overnight. Consider the AASE Listing
Requirements which define proved ore
reserves as “those in which the ore has
been blocked out in three dimensions by
excavation or drilling but include in
addition minor extensions beyond
actual openings and drill holes, where
the geological factors that limit the ore
body are definitely known and where
the chance of failure of the ore to reach
these limits is so remote as not to be a
factor in the practical planning of
mining operations.”
Well, the chance of failure was none
too remote at Clermont. In the 1984
report, the Lightning Ridge directors
say that re-sampling by panning was
undertaken at previous test sites.
“Nowhere did grades exceed 0.2
grams per tonne,” they said. O point
two? What happened to all the 0.6? As
this was not just some casual estimate
but a stated proven grade, Pierpont is
convinced that it must have been stolen
by UFOs doubtless working night
shifts. By now, the gold must have been
transported to the moons of Jupiter
where it is being converted into
wedding rings for cockroach-like aliens
with 98 fingers. Or maybe it has been
melted into bars and used to prop the
note issue of the tottering Central Bank
of Ursa Major.
If Phillip scoffs at this claim,
Pierpont has further evidence. Reading
the prospectus of AUR No Liability the
other night, your correspondent dis-
covered that a whole financial report
was missing.
AUR is floating with an issue to the
public of 20 million 25c fully paid
shares, raising $5 million. Of this, $l.B
million will be spent buying various
gold prospects and another $400,000
will be taken by float expenses. Of the
gold prospects, $925,000 just over
half the $l.B million will be spent
buying some Norseman properties from
a company called Avimit Pty Ltd.
Deep in the fine print on page 45, the
prospectus says: “The company had
recourse to the expert report of Greg
Kater & Associates Pty Ltd to arrive at
the purchase price payable (for Norse-
man). The purchase price has been
confirmed as fair and reasonable by
Terence Willsteed and Associates, in-
dependent mining consultants, whose
valuation was based on this expert
report.”
Pierpont agrees that Kater’s report
is expert, at any rate to your
correspondent’s lay eye. It defines the
Norseman tenements, the regional
geology, the history and previous ex-
ploration, the potential and the pro-
posed exploration program. Nowhere,
however, does it calculate a fair and
reasonable price for the Norseman
areas.
The Willsteed report says that the
valuation of the Norseman areas is
“based on their indicated geological
prospectivity and potential for gold
mineralisation, the large size of the
tenements, their proximity to commun-
ity services, previous expenditure and
proposed expenditure to carry out the
work program recommended by the
independent consulting geologist.”
Willsteed notes that the valuation
“would be subject to confirmation of
resources.” This means presumably
that, if there is nothing viable on the
property, the vendors will give the
money back an event which will rate
a mention in the Guinness Book of
Records.
But there is no arithmetic.
Well, the calculations justifying the


expenditure of nearly one-quarter of the
funds raised by the public issue are so
important that Pierpont can only
assume that the directors meant to put
them in the prospectus but this vital
information also was kidnapped by the
UFOs.
Right now, up in the Andromeda
galaxy, they know how to calculate the
value of indicated geological pro-
spectivity putting aliens another light
year ahead of Pierpont.
And, should Phillip still be wavering,
Pierpont throws in as a clincher the
disappearance of the Stawell River
gold prospect near Hughenden in
Queensland.
This prospect first came to Pierpont’s
attention in the prospectus for Aurex
Alluvials Ltd which floated in Sep-
tember last year. Indeed, the Stawell
River prospect was virtually the only
asset Aurex had when it raised $2.8
million from the public.
The directors considered it a “most
significant” exploration target and said
that they had a reasonable expectation
that reserves would be proven
“sufficient in volume and grade to
justify a mining operation worthy of a
company the size of Aurex.”
But, lo! In Aurex’s 1984 annual
report, the Stawell River gets a mention
of just 17 lines (the first time Pierpont
flipped through the accounts, he missed
it altogether).
After a “feedment” (whatever that is)
of 157 cubic metre samples through a
recovery plant, the Aurex chaps decided
that while there was widespread gold
mineralisation in the gravels there
were not sufficient concentrations to
make a viable alluvial mine. The pro-
spect has been relinquished.
The aliens have struck again. In this
case, Pierpont has no doubts because he
knows three of the directors and has
seen them when in the grip of apparent-
ly outlandish spirits.
Who knows where the aliens will
strike next? Keep reading this column,
Phillip. □
CHESS
The mind of a champion
by Terrey Shaw
A CONSTANT shame for English-
speaking chess enthusiasts has been that
so many of the best books on the game
have been published only in other
languages.
So I was pleased to receive recently a
copy of Alexander Alekhine’s classic
Auf dem Wege zur Weltmeisterschaft
eruditely translated into English by C. J.
Feather under the title On the Road to
the World Championship (Pergamon,
$15.95). The book contains 100 of
Alekhine’s best games from 1923-27. It
concludes with all the games of his 1927
world championship match with
Capablanca in Buenos Aires, where the
author wrested the crown from the
previously invincible Cuban.
Many autobiographical notes are
included and he has annotated all the
games. He was an unstinting annotator
and gives a fascinating glimpse into the
mind of a world champion.
Unfortunately, this mind was also
that of an insufferable egotist. Of the
quality of the games, he characteristic-
ally says that he is happy to have
disappointed neither the expectations of
his chess admirers nor his own. As the
translator points out, Alekhine’s notes
make his victories appear so inevitable
that the occasional mistake “seems like
some appalling rift in the cosmic
fabric.”
I can thoroughly recommend the
book. Cecil Purdy once said that
“Alekhine’s chess is like a god’s. One
can revere but never hope to emulate.”
Perhaps Purdy had in mind a game such
as the following, the 21st of his match
with Capablanca. The notes are ab-
breviated from Alekhine’s book.

SPECIAL REPORT
‘lt Was Like
Breathing
Fire...’
A poison-gas leak in India kills 2,500 and maims up to
100,000 in the worst industrial accident in history.
It was an unseasonably cold night in Cen-
tral India. In the shantytowns of Bhopal,
thousands ofpoor families were asleep. At a
nearby railway station, a scattering of people
waited for early-morning trains. Suddenly,
at the local Union Carbide plant, a mainte-
nance worker spotted a problem. A storage
tank holding methyl isocyanate (MIC), a
chemical used in making pesticides, was

showing a dangerously high pressure read-
ing. The worker summoned his boss. The
supervisor put out an alert. But it was already
too late. A noxious white gas had started
seeping from the tank and spreading with the
northwesterly winds. At the Vijoy Hotel near
the railroad, sociologist Swapan Saha, 33,
woke up with a terrible pain in his chest. “It
was both a burning and a suffocating sensa-
tion, ”he said. “It was like breathing fire. ”
Wrapping a damp towel around his nose
and mouth, Saha went outside to investigate.
Scores of victims lay dead on the train-station
platform. “I thought at first there must have
been a gigantic railway accident, ” he re-
called. Then he noticed a pall of white smoke
on the ground, and an acrid smell in the air.
People were running helter-skelter, retching,
vomiting and defecating uncontrollably.
Many collapsed and died. Dogs,
cows and buffaloes were also on
the ground, shuddering in death
throes. Saha made his way to the
railway office, only to find the
stationmaster slumped over his
desk. For a moment, he thought
that an atom bomb had hit Bho-
pal. Staggering back to the ho-
tel, halfblind himself by now, he
sat down to write a farewell let-
ter to his wife.
Saha lived, but thousands of
others did not escape. For
days the body count ticked up-
ward —from 300 to 1,000 to
more than 2,500 —in the worst
industrial accident in history.
Across Bhopal, hospitals and
mortuaries filled to overflow-
ing. Muslims were buried four
and five to a grave, and Hindu
funeral pyres burned round
the clock. As many as 100,000 survivors
may be left with permanent disabilities:
blindness, sterility, kidney and liver infec-
tions, tuberculosis and brain damage.
There were fears that a cholera epidemic
could strike. Breaking off a campaign
swing through southern India, Prime Min-
ister Rajiv Gandhi rushed to Bhopal. Lo-
cal officials ordered a full-scale judicial
inquiry—and demanded that Union Car-

As a precaution, Union Carbide stopped
production and distribution of methyl iso-
cyanate at a plant similar to the Bhopal
factory in Institute, W.Va. But it deflected
questions about what caused the mishap
until it could complete an internal investi-
gation. The prospects of staggering lawsuits
helped drive down the company’s stock and
forced officials to deny rumors that Union
Carbide might have to declare bankruptcy.
When Warren Anderson, the chairman of
the firm, flew to Bhopal to talk about relief,
local authorities arrested him on charges of
criminal negligence. Later they released
him. Union Carbide offered emergency re-
lief, but refused to discuss outright
compensation.
The Bhopal catastrophe raised frighten-
ing questions. Could it happen again?
Could it happen in other countries? The
worst industrial accidents have occurred in
the Third World, where population densi-
ty is higher and safety measures often fail
to keep up with the spread of technology.
By contrast, the United States and many
other industrialized nations can boast of a
strong safety record. But with millions of
chemicals produced and stored in nations
around the world, regulatory and watch-
dog groups cannot even tell where poten-
tial time bombs are —let alone guarantee
that they will not go off. “It’s like a giant
roulette game, says Anthony Mazzocchi,
an expert on worker safety in New York.
“This time the marble came to a stop in
India, but the next time it could be in the
United States.”
Most of Bhopal was asleep when disaster
struck. After the leak started, as many as
200,000 people ran through the city streets,
coughing, screaming and calling out to each
other. At about 2 a.m., the pesticide fac-
tory’s siren went off. Thinking a fire had
broken out, hundreds rushed toward the
plant—straight into the path of the deadly
gas. The train station was littered with the
bodies of railroad employees and red-uni-
formed porters. The junction was paralyzed
for 20 hours, making it impossible for survi-
vors to flee by train. Those wealthy enough
to own cars gathered their families and tried
to escape. But many drivers were blinded by
the gas, and there were scores of accidents.
City of Corpses: The next morning it
looked like a neutron bomb had struck.
Buildings were undamaged. But humans
and animals littered the low ground, turn-
ing hilly Bhopal into a city of corpses. Out-
side the mortuaries, bodies lay in piles.

other in hurriedly dug graves. At night the

so many that the local cremation grounds
ran out of wood. A fresh supply had to be
shipped in overnight before as many as 70
pyres could proceed with Hindu rituals.
Three days after the catastrophe, rescue
workers still hadn’t uncovered all the dead.
Teams broke into the tin, clay and wood
shacks of the shantytowns, searching for
victims trapped by the gas. One group of
volunteers came upon an entire family
snuffed out in the night. A small 10-year-old
boy named Zahir guided Newsweek’s Su-
dip Mazumdar to the gates of the Union
Carbide factory. Zahir wiped his swollen
red eyes with a dirty rag, then pointed to the
faulty gas tank. “That’s the one,” he said.
Zahir had escaped from the shantytown on
Sunday night, wandered through the
countryside until daybreak, then returned
to find his neighborhood deserted and his
parents missing. Hundreds of other kids
roamed through the streets. Eventually, the
government set up a missing-persons bu-
reau to help all the lost survivors.
The city’s hospitals came under siege.
Hordes of sufferers, many still vomiting,
crowded the emergency rooms. The worst
off were old people, children and the poor-
est shantytown inhabitants. Many of them
were chronically ill from malnutrition even
before suffering the effects of the methyl
isocyanate. Many doctors had also been
exposed to the gas and were unable to work.
Medical students and policemen had to be
brought in from neighboring towns to help
out. What the victims needed most, said one
harried doctor, were massive doses of anti-
biotics and vitamins. But some of the more
inexperienced volunteers treated them with
anything at hand—glucose, painkillers,
even stomach pills. One house painter
named Salim arrived at a hospital with ul-
cerated eyes and burning pains in his stom-
ach. A medical worker gave him a handful
of high-potency antacid tablets.
‘Keep Calm’: Rumors spread like brush-
fire. One day after the disaster, a blanket of
early-morning fog caused people to specu-
late that another gas leak had taken place.
Policemen had to take to the streets in cars
to stop everyone from panicking. “Keep
calm,” they called out through their loud-
speakers. “There has been no new leak.”
There was another report that all the milk
and vegetables in the food shops had been
contaminated. In the end, that also turned
out to be false. However, a local official
rekindled fear when he told townspeople to
wash their vegetables carefully.
The response of Indian officials was most-
ly slow and self-interested. Local authorities
never set up a crisis-management office.
There were even rumors that Arjun Singh,
the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, had
fled Bhopal during the gas leak. When Singh
finally did talk to reporters, he angrily de-
nied the charge. “If this can be proved,” he
said, “I will resign from public life forth-
with.” Later, Rajiv Gandhi showed up brief-
ly, touring two hospitals and talking to relief
workers. Then he left Bhopal for a campaign
tour of the rest of Madhya Pradesh. For
most of a day, Singh dropped his other duties
to join the prime minister.
In retrospect, the arrest of Anderson also
looked like a clumsy political stunt. Earlier
in the week, Bhopal police had arrested five
senior Indian executives at the Union Car-
bide factory, including the works manager.
When Anderson made plans to visit Bhopal
with two other company officials —Kesha v
Mahindra, the chairman of Union Carbide
India, Ltd., and V. S. Gokhale, the manag-
ing director —he was evidently promised
safe passage. But as soon as the businessmen
got off their plane, they were arrested and
rushed to Union Carbide’s guesthouse on a
hill overlooking the Narmada River. The
arrest order came straight from Arjun
Singh. In a written statement, Singh
charged Anderson with “corporate and
criminal liability,” and accused the Union

Carbide management of “cruel and wanton
negligence.”
It quickly became apparent that Singh
had overstepped his authority. James
Becker, a Bombay-based U.S. diplomat
who was in Bhopal to help with relief, ar-
rived at the guesthouse to lodge a protest.
“I’m amazed at the arrest,” he said. For the
next 6Vi hours, Anderson and his col-
leagues were detained while a stream of
police jeeps carried local Indian officials in
and out of the guesthouse gates. Just before
4 p.m., Anderson was released on a 25,000-
rupee ($2,100) bail. He was taken directly to
the local airport, where he boarded an Indi-
an government twin-engine turboprop
plane for New Delhi. Later, a U.S. Embassy
source hinted strongly that Gandhi himself
had intervened to get the Union Carbide
chairman released. The source suggested
that Gandhi saw the entire incident as an
embarrassment to himself and to his
government.
After Anderson flew back to New Delhi,
authorities in Bhopal finally let a team of
Union Carbide scientists into the plant to
conduct an investigation. In the United
States, two Florida attorneys, Michael To-
bin and Jack Thompson, working in associ-
ation with San Francisco lawyer Melvin
Belli, prepared a negligence suit against
Union Carbide on behalf of all the victims of
the gas leak. The suit, filed in U.S. District
Court in Charleston, W.Va., asked for $5
billion in compensatory damages and $lO
billion in punitive damages. When Belli
made plans to fly to India, a man identifying
himself as a former Indian police official
called the lawyer’s office and warned that
Belli might be in danger if he went ahead
with the visit. The caller pointed out that
numerous Indian businessmen and officials
were angry about the negligence suit.
The roots of the Bhopal disaster traced
back almost 20 years. In the mid-19605,
India was in the midst of its “Green Revolu-
tion”—the central government’s plan to
eliminate chronic food shortages. Increased
production of pesticides and fertilizers was
a vital element of this project. So when
Union Carbide approached New Delhi
about building a pesticide plant, the au-
thorities were receptive. A feasibility plan
for the Bhopal factory was finished in 1969.
Three years later both parties signed a letter
of intent. In 1975 the Indian government
granted Union Carbide a license to manu-
facture pesticides. The company was set up
with 51 percent majority ownership by
Union Carbide, with the other 49 percent in
the hands of private Indian companies and
individuals.
Cronyism: In those days the surrounding
area was not densely populated. Bhopal is
the capital of Madhya Pradesh state;
900,000 people live there now. But Union
Carbide built its factory on the outskirts of
the city. Even in 1975, M. N. Buch, a local
official in charge of public services, foresaw
that the railroad and the plant would attract
more people. He tried to get the plant
moved beyond city limits, citing a law re-
quiring that factories manufacturing dan-
gerous substances be built at least 15 miles
from population centers. But nothing hap-
pened. Buch was removed to another post;
soon afterward Union Carbide donated
$2,500 to the city for a park. In the following
years, more than 100,000 people moved into
northeast Bhopal, most of them settling in
the shantytowns of Jayaprakash Nagar and
Kali Parade.
As time passed, strong ties grew between
Union Carbide and the local political estab-
lishment. The pattern of apparent cronyism
developed in part because Union Carbide
was obligated to hire local management and
employees. A well-known local official in
the Congress (I) Party, Indira Gandhi’s po-
litical vehicle, became the plant’s lawyer.
The former police chief of Madhya Pradesh

got a contract to protect the plant. A nephew
of the state’s former education minister was
hired to handle public relations. And the
brother-in-law of the deputy chief secretary
of the state of Madhya Pradesh took a high-
level job at the factory. Lavish parties for lo-
cal dignitaries were often thrown at Union
Carbide’s luxurious guesthouse in the Shya-
mala Hills. In 1983, when the Congress (I)
Party held a regional conference in Bhopal,
VlP’s were put up at the guesthouse.
Because of these cozy ties, some labor
leaders and environmental groups charged
last week, numerous early-warning signals
at the plant went unheeded. On Dec. 24,
1978, a huge fire started in the plant’s naph-
tha-storage area, sending a cloud of billow-
ing black smoke over the city. “Nobody in
Bhopal slept that night,” one local resident
recalled. Then on Dec. 26, 1981, a worker
named Ashraf died from a leak of phosgene
gas inside the factory. A supervisor said
Ashraf had collapsed after he “removed his
gas mask.” But the company gave no expla-
nation for the seepage itself. Fifteen days
later, another phosgene leak left as many as
24 people severely ill, including a number of
local residents.
Mini-Riot: On Oct. 5, 1982, in the middle
of the night, a flange joining two pipes broke
and gas seeped into the shantytowns. The
incident caused a mini-riot which, in retro-
spect, looked like a preview of last week’s
stampede. In 1983 there were two minor
leaks. And in January 1984, a factory work-
er named Arun Mathur died of a chemical
allergy after working at the plant. Accord-
ing to local union sources, Union Carbide
persuaded Mathur’s family to move to Ra-
jasthan. Last June, Raj Kumar Keswani, a
columnist for the Hindi-language paper
Jansatta, wrote a lengthy article detailing
the record of the Bhopal plant. “It’s not that
the government knew nothing of these inci-
dents,” he concluded. “After every accident
the [Madhya Pradesh] administration
talked of getting up an inquiry. But no one
knows what steps were taken after the in-
quiries were completed or even if they were
held at all.”
Over the years, one local official did draw
attention to the potential dangers of the
pesticide plant. He was Mahendra Karma, a
Communist Party representative in the
state legislature. In 1981 and 1982, Karma
waged a one-man campaign on the safety
issue, but he was consistently ignored by his
fellow politicians. During one state-assem-
bly debate, he had a heated exchange with
the state’s labor minister, Tarasingh Viyogi,
a member of the Congress (I) Party. “A sum
of 250 million rupees has been invested in
this unit,” Viyogi argued. “The factory is
not a small stone which can be shifted else-
where. There is no danger to Bhopal, nor
will there be.”
Until 1980, the Union Carbide plant
imported methyl isocyanate. Then, in ac-
cordance with India’s industrial self-suffi-
A family mourns its loved ones: No compensation could make up for those who were lost
MAHENDRA SINH—SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
ciency policy, it started manufacturing the
chemical on the premises. The process was
highly dangerous. Carbon monoxide, itself
highly toxic, was mixed with chlorine to
form deadly phosgene gas. Phosgene was
then combined with methylamine to pro-
duce methyl isocyanate. It was in turn used
to make Sevin Carbaryl, a pesticide effec-
tive on as many as 100 different crops and
some 180 types of insects. At Union Car-
bide plants in America, Sevin is made with
U.S. technology. But the process used in
Bhopal was researched and developed by
an Indian research team. The Indian prod-
uct was also known for its extra strength: it
could kill insects, mites and nematodes at
the same time, and required only 24 hours
of spraying.
Experts were still unsure what caused
the massive gas leak. It happened in one of
three storage tanks, each holding some 40
tons of MIC, which were lodged partially
underground in the Union Carbide com-
plex. A sharp change in temperature, im-
purities inside the tank or even a minuscule
crack could have caused a rapid buildup in
pressure. But the real problem came as the
gas began to seep into the air. The MIC
should have passed through a “vent scrub-
ber,” a small chimneylike protuberance
filled with caustic-soda solution, which
renders the gas harmless. But this time the
vent scrubber failed to work. Nor did the
Bhopal plant have other safety devices,
common in many U.S. plants, that would
have alerted workers to the pressure build-
up sooner.
As it was, the needle on the tank’s pres-
sure gauge had inched up well beyond the
danger level before the night-shift worker
noticed it and notified his supervisor. The
chemical has a very low boiling point. So by


the time it started leaking out, it had turned
from liquid to gas. MIC is so powerful that it
must be let into the atmosphere in less than
2 parts per 100 million in order not to cause
harm. During the accident, it escaped much
faster than that. According to union offi-
cials, at least five tons of MIC seeped out in
30 minutes before the tank was sealed. The
effects of the chemical on human beings
resemble those of nerve gas. When inhaled,
it reacts with water in the lungs, often chok-
ing the victim to death instantaneously. It
can be just as lethal when absorbed through
the skin.
After the accident, local authorities im-
mediately shut down the Union Carbide
plant. No one expected it to reopen. Given
the angry mood of the Indian government,
the pressure of public opinion and litigation
over compensation, it was also unlikely that
India would allow Union Carbide to start
up any new operations in the country.
Gandhi’s chief concern will be to keep the
incident from becoming a major issue in the
Dec. 24 elections. Opposition parties in
Bhopal were already calling on the Con-
gress (I) administration in Madhya Pradesh
to resign. But most political analysts didn’t
think the disaster would hurt Gandhi’s
chances. Except for the communists, most
other politicians in the country have similar
records on industrial safety and relations
with foreign companies.
Shrouds: For the people of Bhopal, no
amount of compensation from New Delhi
or Union Carbide could ever make up for
what had happened. By the weekend the
streets were bustling again with cars, cattle
and crowds of people. But reminders of the
disaster were everywhere. People were still
falling sick from eating fish contaminated
by the poison. Hundreds wore dark glasses
and covered their faces with shrouds to
protect their injured eyes from the sunlight.
At the city’s main police station, women
and children lined up to demand some-
thing—anything—to help piece together
their shattered lives. And in homes, shops
and offices across the city, people brooded
over the same questions: How many more of
the sick would die? How long would the
discomfort of the less severely injured last?
How serious and how lasting would side
effects be? No one could give them answers.
The residents of Bhopal had become the
victims of an age when the rush to produce
dangerous chemicals has often overstepped
concern for human safety.

An Unstoppered Killer
Methyl isocyanate is so unstable and so dangerous that even
professional toxicologists are reluctant to study it in the lab.
“As soon as you open the bottle, it escapes,” says Yves Alarie
of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public
Health. “We’ve done very little on this substance because it is
so difficult to control.”
MIC belongs to a family of toxins for which there is no
antidote and no treatment. It is
used in the manufacture of in-
secticides that kill by attacking
the nervous system. But the
first effect of exposure is water-
ing of the eyes and damage to
the cornea. The substance is
quickly absorbed into the cor-
neal cells and renders them
opaque. When inhaled, MIC
immediately constricts the na-
sal and bronchial passages and
the larynx; “You can compare
it to a very dramatic asthma
attack,” he says. In one of the
few human experiments ever
done with MIC, a German re-
searcher several years ago took
a whiff to see what would hap-
pen; the effect was immediate
and frightening. The spasms,
Alarie suspects, result from the
effect of MIC on nerve endings
in the respiratory tract and, if
the victim has inhaled enough
MIC, can cause sudden death.
MIC can also irritate and inflame the lungs, leading to the
accumulation of fluid, or pulmonary edema. Breathing is both
difficult and painful, and if the victim has inhaled enough MIC,
he will literally drown in the secretions. In the immediate
aftermath of exposure, victims are probably more susceptible to
lung infections. About the only way doctors can deal with
anyone who survives significant exposure is to apply air rich in
oxygen and administer sedatives and painkillers.
Just what the long-term effects of exposure will be for the
Bhopal survivors is uncertain, since MIC hasn’t been studied

much in humans. Alarie recalls that, in 1967, firefighters battling
ablaze in Britain were exposed to a chemical cousin of MIC called
toluene di-isocyanate (TDI). As have many victims of the Indian
disaster, some firemen experienced vomiting, possibly because of
effects on the nervous system. Some suffered clearly neurological
symptoms, including impaired coordination and memory loss.
“There was recovery, but not complete recovery in all cases,”
says Alarie. Some of the Indian victims may have suffered
kidney and liver damage. According to William E. Brown, a
biologist at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie-Mellon University, this can
occur because MIC destroys
proteins in the bloodstream;
the kidneys and liver become
overworked trying to rid the
body of these aberrant wastes.
Survivors: For most of the
victims, especially those whose
exposure was relatively slight,
the physical effects will prob-
ably disappear in time, Brown
expects. Many should recover
their eyesight, since the cornea
is capable of some degree of
self-repair. For many, the res-
piratory problems should also
clear up in a matter of weeks or
months. Some will have devel-
oped antibodies to isocyanates
and, therefore, could suffer al-
lergic attacks if exposed again
to such compounds—with any
luck, an unlikely prospect. But
the survivors of heavier expo-
sure will suffer permanent res-
piratory impairment. “It will
appear to be something like em-
physema,” says Brown, “and there’s nothing to do about it.”
Lethal as it is, at least one good thing can be said about MIC. It
probably won’t linger in the environment the way dioxin, PCB’s
and other noxious substances do. Moisture in the air breaks MIC
down, or “hydrolizes” it, forming carbon dioxide and a largely
inert amine. “In a couple of weeks, the detectable level will be
negligible,” Brown predicts. Already, the survivors of Bhopal
are moving back into their homes, and investigators say the
city’s water is safe to drink.

A Company in Shock
Distant disaster puts an end to business as usual.
At 9:30 a.m. last Friday, an Avro com-
muter plane carrying Union Carbide
chairman Warren Anderson landed in Bho-
pal, India. Anderson had flown to Bhopal to
investigate the catastrophe firsthand and
aid in the relief effort. “We stand ready to do
our part,” he had vowed before leaving the
United States. But as Anderson’s plane tax-
ied to a stop, a green official car from India’s
Madhya Pradesh state wheeled up. When
the chairman stepped from the plane, a
Madhya Pradesh magistrate arrested him
and two other company officials on charges
of criminal and corporate negligence, in-
cluding “culpable homicide.”
Anderson was later released, and his ar-
rest was only a minor chord: as the death toll
in Bhopal mounted, the tragedy had a shat-
tering impact on Union Carbide, one of the
world’s largest chemical companies. Even
those intimately familiar with hazards of the
chemical industry were stunned. “The reac-
tion went from horror to shock as the infor-
mation started to come in,” said Union
Carbide spokesman Fred Phillis. Beyond
the human toll, the disaster brought a halt to
business as usual at the $9 billion company.
Within hours, Union Carbide shut down
production and distribution of methyl iso-
cyanate at a similar plant in Institute, W. Va.
Rumors: On Wall Street, panicky inves-
tors sold off Union Carbide stock and
prices plunged 12 points. Company spokes-
men vehemently denied rumors that the
conglomerate—which makes a wide range
of products, from basic plastics to
Eveready batteries —faced bankruptcy.
“While the Bhopal tragedy is without
precedent,” said spokesman
Jackson Browning, “con-
sidering both the insurance
and other resources avail-
able, the financial structure
of Union Carbide Corp. is
not threatened in any way.”
First word of the gas
leak apparently reached
Union Carbide officials in
the United States early
Monday. William Lutz,
chairman of Union Carbide
Eastern, got a call from In-
dia alerting him, and some-
time after midnight a telex
clattered to life and printed
out a terse message in the
deserted quarter-mile-long
headquarters building in
Danbury, Conn.: there had
been a “ruptured valve” at
the Bhopal pesticide plant
and “an unknown number
Anderson: ‘Homicide’?
DEAN CAYLE—DANBURY NEWS-TIMES
of injuries and fatalities,” said
Phillis. By 4:30 a.m. Monday, offi-
cials had alerted a team of key
personnel, and the company be-
gan a public-relations counter-
offensive much like the one John-
son & Johnson used in the wake of
the Tylenol murders. All 106,455
company employees were asked to
observe a minute of silence last
Thursday to honor the victims
of Bhopal, and president Alec
Flamm ordered the American flag
to be flown at half-mast at all com-
pany sites between Dec. 6 and 12.
Details: Though it held daily
press conferences at its Danbury
headquarters, the company stead-
fastly refused to provide details of
what might have gone wrong at
Bhopal. “You can badger me all
you like, but you’re not going to
have me guess that it was this
brand of pump and that brand of
valve,” Browning told reporters.
“We’ll find that out, and when we
have it in due time it will be made
known.” Shortly after the tragedy, Union
Carbide had sent a team of engineers and
medical and safety experts from the United
States to Bhopal to investigate what had
gone wrong, but Browning insisted that it
would be several weeks before the investiga-
tors produced solid answers.
Before last week, Union Carbide had
had one of the better safety records in the
chemical industry, which routinely handles
huge quantities of explosive and deadly
chemicals. Union Carbide
built the Bhopal plant in
the early 1970s, pattern-
ing it after its 1,435-
acre West Virginia com-
plex. Company officials in-
sisted that the safety stand-
ards in Bhopal were the
same as in the United States
and other facilities around
the world. Even so, the trag-
edy raised troubling ques-
tions about health and safe-
ty procedures. Last week
Union Carbide officials con-
firmed that there were no
evacuation plans for resi-
dents of either Bhopal or In-
stitute. “The safety of the
material as we had used it
and handled it over 20 years
just did not lead us to believe
that this was an incident
which required [emergen-
Closed plant in Bhopal: Staggering legal claims
cy] planning,” said Browning. In the wake
of the accident, the company faced building
pressure to change its ways.
But that may be the least of its worries.
Last Friday, San Francisco attorney Melvin
Belli filed a $ 15 billion class-action lawsuit
in Charleston, W.Va., on behalf of “all
injured and deceased residents” in the disas-
ter area. An avalanche of similar lawsuits
is likely. “You have a bunch of vul-
turous lawyers looking to make a killing
on the case,” says Dean Witter analyst Wil-
liam Young. The threat of large liabilities
prompted Moody’s Investors Service and
others to consider downgrading Union Car-
bide’s debt ratings.
Fate: Indian authorities held chairman
Anderson under heavy security for six hours
at Union Carbide’s palatial guesthouse
overlooking the city of Bhopal. They then
released him on a 25,000-rupee bail and
whisked him off to New Delhi. (“Our under-
standing,” said Sudip Banerjee, a local offi-
cial, “is that he will be asked to leave the
country at the earliest opportunity.”) An-
derson never did get to inspect the site of the
disaster. “I don’t know whether I was under
arrest, under house arrest or not under ar-
rest at all,” he said. “I do know they told me
I’m free to go,” he added —-and a Union
Carbide corporate jet was standing by to
take him home.

Could It Happen in America?
The Union Carbide plant in Institute, W.Va.: ‘We have nothing to be comforted by just because we’re living in an advanced industrial society’
A similar disaster is unlikely—but the potential for danger is enormous.
Residents of Institute, W. Va., were used
to something funny in the air that
caused hacking coughs and sometimes
stripped the paint off cars. Old-timers affec-
tionately called Union Carbide’s big Insti-
tute plant “Uncle John’s,” and its foul odor,
“the smell of jobs.” The news that more
than 2,500 people in India had been killed
by methyl isocyanate (MIC) —a chemical
made at the plant as well —came as a shock.
Union Carbide halted MIC production
there last week. But at a town meeting Tues-
day night, one man demanded that resi-
dents be issued gas masks; another said the
poison was so deadly that masks wouldn’t
help. “I dreamed about it all night long,”
said Sylvia Parker, a retired social worker.
“My immediate concern is that what hap-
pened in India doesn’t happen here.”
That same cloud of concern wafted
through communities all across the nation
in the wake of the Bhopal tragedy. Chemi-
cal-industry experts hastened to say that a
similar calamity was unlikely here, since
most U.S. facilities are not so dependent on
unskilled labor and have far more sophisti-
cated emergency-warning systems. Last
month, when a small amount of MIC spilled
at a plant run by FMC Corp. in Middleport,
N.Y., 500 schoolchildren and staffers were
evacuated in 35 minutes with no serious
injuries. In fact, the chemical industry has
the best safety record of any U.S. industry.
But the potential for danger is enormous.
“We have nothing to be comforted by just
because we’re living in an advanced indus-
trial society,” said safety expert Anthony
Mazzocchi of the Workers’ Policy Project.
“On the contrary, we are at greater risk
because we have more toxic plants here.”
Tests: The dimensions of the potential
risk are staggering. An estimated 6,000
U.S. facilities make possibly hazard-
ous chemicals. There are approximately
180,000 shipments by truck or rail every
day in the United States of everything from
nail-polish remover to nuclear weapons.
More than 60,000 chemical substances
are in use —and federal regulators don’t
even know how many pose health dangers.
The 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act—
TOSCA—requires that new chemicals
be reviewed before they go on the market.
But only 20 percent of those already in
use have been tested even to minimal
standards, according to the National Re-
search Council. Federal disposal regula-
tions do not even classify carbamates —the
group of pesticides that use MIC during
manufacture —as hazardous waste. That
means, says Richard Fortuna of the Haz-
ardous Waste Treatment Council, that
“they can be discarded like orange peels.”
What’s more, responsibility for prevent-
ing a Bhopal-like disaster falls between the
cracks in the federal bureaucracy. The La-
bor Department’s Office of Safety and
Health Administration (OSH A) periodical-
ly inspects facilities to ensure that accidents
don’t harm workers. The Environmental
Protection Agency coordinates cleanups of
some types of accidents. But EPA was only
last month given the authority to regulate
underground storage tanks such as the one
that leaked in Bhopal. It has not begun to
count such tanks, let alone determine what
is in them. It will be three years before EPA
proposes safety regulations—longer if its
budget is cut further. In the meantime,
“we’ve got no regulations and no enforce-
ment,” says EPA hazardous-waste expert
Hugh Kaufman. “The only reason we
haven’t had a release with the same disas-
trous effect is that we’ve been lucky.”
Chemical-industry officials insist it is far
more than luck—that they police them-
selves far more thoroughly than federal reg-
ulations ever could. The industry is “ob-
sessed with safety, because of the nature of
the product,” says Geraldine Cox of the
Chemical Manufacturers Association. Be-
cause accidents do happen, chemical han-
dlers go to great lengths to minimize the


dangers, and many are reviewing their safe-
guards in the wake of the Bhopal tragedy.
“Never say never,” says Pat Goggin of Dow
Chemical in Midland, Mich., which staged a
mock “release” of chlorine gas two weeks
ago to test its leak-detection and communi-
ty-warning procedures.
Some chemical firms use elaborate com-
puter models to gauge the likely paths of
accidental releases. One such model, made
by SAFER Emergency Systems in Califor-
nia, not only senses that a leak has occurred,
but monitors its rate, concentration and
toxicity, evaluates weather conditions and
displays the anticipated cloud on a comput-
er screen along with the degree of danger for
anything in its path. The system can even
dial phone numbers and play a recorded
warning message—all within five minutes
after the leak is detected.
Whistles: But emergency precautions
vary widely from plant to plant. In Institute,
Union Carbide officials had discussed evac-
uation plans with a nearby college and a
local center for the handicapped. But many
residents said they had no idea what to do
in case of an accident —nor had many seen a
letter that plant spokesmen claimed was
sent to residents every year since 1975
outlining the plant’s emergency programs.
If they had, they might still be confused.
According to the letter, two three-second
blasts of the plant’s whistle means a fire or
medical emergency; three three-second
blasts means a gas release; two-second blasts
every three seconds for two minutes means a
major disaster, with two-second blasts every
30 seconds until the danger has passed.
(Last year, when a valve broke on a chemical
barge moored at the plant and a neighbor-
hood had to be evacuated at 3 a.m., most
people were sleeping with the windows
closed and never heard the whistle.) Instruc-
tions for what to do next are equally confus-
ing: if the wind is blowing favorably, stay
put. If the wind is blowing toward you from
A Worldwide Problem
In Mexico City, no one asks: “Can it happen here?” In a sense,
it already has. The massive explosion at a liquefied-petroleum-
gas storage facility in the crowded San Juanico neighborhood
last month killed 452 people, injured 4,248, damaged or de-
stroyed 1,400 homes and dislocated 1,600 families. The blast
also pointed up the precarious nature of a city where many of the
17 million inhabitants live cheek by jowl with a variety of
potentially dangerous installations —from a 41-year-old oil re-
finery to a network of aging gas pipelines beneath barrio streets,
a network for which the government
does not even have a complete map.
An arguable litmus test of any soci-
ety’s concern with such matters is the
attention paid to last week’s disaster in
Bhopal, and by that standard Mexico
also ranks low. While front pages from
Rome to Hong Kong featured the story
prominently, Mexican newspapers of
all ideological persuasions generally
buried wire-service accounts of the in-
cident —although several opposition
leaders have recently begun to call for
safety zones around new energy facili-
ties and other potentially dangerous
industrial sites. Some experts complain
of poor safety standards at Mexico’s
petrochemical facilities —most of them
government-owned since nationaliza-
tion of the energy industry in 1938.
Nine workers died in one of two major
pipeline explosions this year.
Impact: Elsewhere, however, sensi-
tivity to the threat of killer chemicals
runs dramatically higher—particular-
ly in West Germany, the world’s lead-
ing chemical exporter, where the
Green Party has a strong environmental concern. Following a
catastrophic 1921 accident at the BASF chemical factory in
Oppau (561 dead), and a 1979 BASF fire in which 400 tons of
deadly phosgene were released, Bonn has developed some of the
most stringent standards for chemical plants anywhere. Gov-
ernment officials and industry leaders agree that a Bhopal-type
disaster is unlikely. Indeed, the only company that produces
methyl isocyanate—Bayer A.G. —avoids the high pressure and
large storage tanks used by Union Carbide. Before any chemical
can be produced, Bonn requires an environmental-impact state-
ment showing the effect of possible accidents.
Consciousness-raising on the issue came to Italy in 1976 after
Mexico City victims: A call for safety zones
AP
the failure of a valve released a poisonous cloud of dioxin from a
plant in Seveso. Nobody died at the time, but 4,500 surrounding
acres were declared potentially contaminated, thousands of
animals were killed and numerous cases of chloracne, a skin
disease, developed among local children. The next year, the
European Economic Community issued a directive to all mem-
ber nations requiring risk-evaluation studies and more safety
information for the public. But results have been meager; the
directive became effective only this year and only for new
companies. Only in June of last year did Italian courts finally
impose jail sentences on five former managers of the Seveso
plant—suspended pending appeal.
The Bhopal disaster came as a shock
to many Frenchmen, although work-
ers at a Union Carbide pesticide fac-
tory in Beziers were exposed to the
same substance in a 1977 mishap.
“Now the public is discovering that the
risk is more real and more serious than
it imagined,” said Michel Joli, chief of a
new government agency for the pre-
vention of major disasters. A stringent
1976 law covering 500 chemical instal-
lations requires that dangerous sub-
stances be stored in smaller quantities
and regularly inspected, but does not
require the shutdown of operations in
plants already situated near heavy pop-
ulation centers. “Getting industrialists
to cooperate is always a problem. It
costs money,” says Franqois Demarcq
of the Environmental Ministry.
Drilling: In tight-packed Hong
Kong, an industrial fire that burned for
days recently and an explosion of fire-
works in the harbor have added to con-
cerns about safety precautions at two
major projects: the projected Daya Bay
nuclear plant just across the Chinese
border and the Mobil Oil depot on Tsing Yi Island off Kowloon.
In Japan, many firms have already taken a lesson from the
tragedy at Minamata more than two decades ago—after which
one company was forced to pay more than 1,800 deformed and
brain-damaged victims of mercury pollution. The result: in-
creasingly strict pollution and plant safety standards, especially
for a specified list of 300 dangerous chemicals —not to mention
preparation for the ever-present threat of earthquake. Says
Masayoshi Nakagawa of the Society of the Agricultural Chemi-
cal Industry: “Every chemical company is constantly drilling its
workers to shut down plants instantly should a big shock come.”
DAVID M. ALPERN
with bureau reports


the plant, evacuate “by going crosswind.”
“In some cases, you can see the fumes as a
white cloud,” the letter added. “However,
this is not always the case so don’t depend on
your eyes.”
The very fact that anything so lethal was
made nearby stunned many Institute resi-
dents. People in Woodbine, Ga., were also
surprised to learn that MIC is used at a
Union Carbide plant there. Institute plant
spokesman Dick Henderson said the com-
pany did inform residents —via a newspaper
story in 1952. “Do you want an update every
six months that we’re still making it?” he
asked. “For years, we used to tour people
around the plant, then interest died down.”
Communities elsewhere are pressing for
more information about the chemicals next
door. Manufacturers are resisting, on the
Fire at a New Jersey chemical warehouse! 1980): Evacuating cities is the stuff of nightmares
ground that disclosing specific names and
quantities will reveal trade secrets —and the
Reagan administration sympathizes. One of
its first acts was to withdraw a Carter ad-
ministration proposal that all toxic chemi-
cals in the workplace be identified. In defi-
ance, 21 states have passed their own
right-to-know laws, but OSHA has moved
to pre-empt those with a new rule requiring
that substances be labeled only generally as
“hazardous.” A district court in Newark is
set to rule this week on New Jersey’s effort to
keep its law, which also forces firms to file
lists of their chemicals with local safety
authorities. “I don’t want an orange sign
that says ‘Danger’,” says Rick Engler of the
Philadelphia Area Project on Occupational
Safety and Health. “I want to know what the
real hazards are.”
Areas like New Jersey pose particular
hazards because of the dense concentration
of chemical facilities. And though few U.S.
plants abut crowded shantytowns like Bho-
pal, some are upwind of large population
centers. “All of Niagara County is a trouble
spot,” says Peter Slocum of the New York
state Department of Health. “Those who
live in Staten Island live in constant peril of
New Jersey.” Last October, a derivative of
the insecticide malathion escaped from an
American Cyanamid tank in Linden, N.J.,
blanketing a 20-mile area with noxious
fumes that drove 100 people to hospitals.
Last month there were two more minor
chemical releases in the direction of New
York City from plants located in Linden.
The prospect of evacuating large sections
of any major city is the stuff of nightmares —
and most are alarmingly unprepared. The
area around the Houston Ship Channel has
the nation’s highest concentration of petro-
chemical installations, yet the city has no
plan for coping with an accident like the
natural-gas explosion that killed 452 in
Mexico City last month. Given Houston’s
chronic traffic congestion and lack of indus-
trial zoning, “evacuation isn’t the answer,”
says city public-health director James
Haughton. “It isn’t a possibility. It doesn’t
even seem like a hope . . . There would be
total chaos.” A major chemical disaster
would also quickly overwhelm available
medical facilities. As it is, most physicians
aren’t trained to deal with toxicological
problems. “I don’t know of any hospital in
the Houston area that specializes in chemi-
cal injuries,” Haughton says. “We don’t
even know how many burn units there are.”
The potential hazards are also mobile.
Given the vast amount of hazardous cargo
crisscrossing the nation, accidents could
happen anywhere—in rural areas far from
the nearest hospital or in congested urban
areas. Every day, some 4,000 trucks barrel
along Houston’s freeways from one petro-
chemical plant to another. In 1976, a tank
truck went off an elevated freeway, ex-
ploded and released 19 tons of anhydrous
ammo,nia, killing seven people. In 1947, a
French ship loaded with ammonium nitrate
exploded at a dock in Texas City, near
Galveston, destroying a Monsanto plant
and everything else within blocks. A second
ship loaded with the same material exploded
16 hours later. In all, 565 people were killed
and more than 2,000 injured.
The Texas City disaster prompted
vast improvements in transportation-safety
measures. Last year there were only eight
deaths and 191 injuries in 5,761 reported
“incidents” involving shipments of hazard-
ous material —a remarkable record, consid-
ering traffic-accident rates over all. The
Department of Transportation requires
that the contents of every load be identified
with a numerical code —MIC’s is 2480—
visibly posted on the truck or rail car, and
every police and fire vehicle supposedly car-
ries the DOT’S Emergency Response
Guidebook which identifies the substance
and accident procedures. But there are few
federal rules governing shipment routes,
and DOT has overruled some local restric-
tions —on the ground that they simply ex-
ported the hazards to neighboring areas.
Big Fear: The transport trucks and rail
cars that carried MIC from Institute to
Woodbine stopped rolling last week. Com-
pany officials said they might close the
Georgia plant, which uses MIC to manufac-
ture the pesticide Temik, until the cause of
the Bhopal disaster is found. In Institute,
though the plant was no longer making
MIC, it was using up 600,000 pounds of the
substance on hand, turning it into the pesti-
cide Sevin at a rate of 11,000 pounds per
hour. Gov. Jay Rockefeller ordered the state
Air Pollution Control Commission to moni-
tor the plant 24 hours a day until the MIC
was gone. Ten state agencies were investi-
gating plant safety along with OSHA offi-
cials. Some plant workers, meanwhile, were
ambivalent. Said one: “I make $620 a week
and I don’t want to talk about it.”
Other Institute residents did give voice to
their other big fear: that repercussions from
the Bhopal tragedy might put Uncle John’s
out of work, along with the 1,400 people he
employs. The 150 products made at the
Institute plant, some pointed out, find their
way into everything from shampoo to floor
wax; Sevin was airlifted into Egypt one year
to save the cotton crop. Experts elsewhere
said that many of the victims in India would
not have been alive at all if not for chemicals
that increased food supplies, reduced the
incidence of malaria and improved sanita-
tion. Judged against such benefits, the risks
of chemical accidents seem more accept-
able. But there is clearly room for improve-
ment in reducing them.

In its infancy, the success of
a business is usually due to the
entrepreneurial, or specialist skills
of the principals involved.
But as the business starts to
grow, many other factors in running
it successfully come into play.
Like raising finance, juggling
with cash flows, debtors, stocks,
taxation, government regulations
and so on.
Too few businesses manage
to keep their act together in all
these areas.
Which is a pity, because if the
ball is dropped in any one of them,
the rest can come tumbling down.
And this is where Price
Waterhouse and over 110 years
experience can come in handy.
Experience in business and
financial planning, including how
to obtain finance.
Experience in tax planning -
income tax, sales tax, customs duty
and most forms of government levies.
Experience in government
grants, especially for manufacturing,
and local purchasing preferences.
Experience in micro and mini
computers.
And experience in assisting
companies going public, or remain-
ing independent.
If you’re just starting out

the business you’ve started isn’t
getting the sort of advice it needs,

Peking: An Honest Broker?
The Chinese play a key role as a mediator between North and South Korea.
Chinese and South Korean officials meeting in 1983 to deal with a crisis over a hijacked jetliner: The aim is to ease tension
It looked like there was going to be yet
another potentially explosive confronta-
tion in the making on the Korean peninsula.
Just a few days after a bloody shoot-out
between North and South Korean border
guards near Panmunjom late last month,
North Korean leader Kim II Sung slipped
away on a secret mission to Peking. Given
the Pyongyang government’s penchant for
belligerence, speculation abounded that
Kim might be seeking approval from his
Chinese backers for reprisals against the
south. That was probably never his inten-
tion. In any case, the Chinese advised him to
talk peace rather than war.
China’s call for restraint during the latest
crisis on the peninsula underscored what
has become a new aim of the Peking govern-
ment: to serve as a kind of honest broker
between Kim and South Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan. Despite their close ties
with North Korea, Chinese leaders have
long been concerned about Kim’s appe-
tite for provocative diplomatic and mili-
tary ventures; they believe that such
stratagems have only helped destabilize
an area that because of its geographic
proximity is of key strategic importance
to Peking. During Kim’s visit last
month, which had probably been
planned in advance, the Chinese made it
clear that they expected him to take a
more tolerant attitude toward the south.
Top Chinese leaders even suggested that
Kim adopt a “one country-two systems”
approach in any reunification talks with
the south, a formula much like the one
Peking favored in its negotiations with
Great Britain over the future of Hong Kong.
“The Chinese want to reduce tensions,”
says one Japanese official in Tokyo, “and
they are striving to take the lead.”
Even so, the Chinese have been forced to
wage their diplomatic campaign by indirect
means. Publicly, China has heartily en-
dorsed Kim’s call for talks with the United
States and South Korea on the question of
reunification. But up to this point Chinese
leaders have refused to commit themselves
to join any negotiations. Peking has man-
aged to achieve dramatic improvements in
its relations with both the United States and
Japan. The government evidently does not
want to jeopardize that process by becoming
too closely identified with a country that is
still regarded as an international outlaw. “If
talks were held, the United States would
insist that the Chinese sit on the same side of
the table as the North Koreans,” says one
Western diplomat in Peking. “The Chinese

Chun, Kim: A long tradition of enmity
argument is that they can be more of a help
by working behind the scenes.”
In making their pitch to Pyongyang for
reduced hostility toward South Korea and
its Western allies, Peking’s leaders have
appealed to North Korea’s economic self-
interest. They have tried to stress the poten-
tial benefits to the north’s woebegone econo-
my of receiving Western technology and
investment. In recent months a number of
North Korean officials have made pilgrim-
ages to China’s Special Economic Zone in
Shenzhen and other industrial sites to mar-
vel at such wonders of capitalist-style eco-
nomic development as a washing-machine
factory and a brewery. “Almost everybody
who is anybody in [Pyongyang’s] ruling
hierarchy has been to Shenzhen in the last
year or so,” says one Japanese government
official in Tokyo. The message seems to be
getting through. Last September North Ko-
rea’s rubber-stamp Parliament approved a
new law designed to ease restrictions on
foreign investment.
Military Fears: The Chinese clearly
attach great importance to their recon-
ciliation efforts. Peking’s main concern
is that a military conflict between North
and South Korea could spill over into the
vital Chinese industrial center of Man-
churia that borders the peninsula. But
the Chinese have other powerful incen-
tives for trying to foster better relations
between the two bitter enemies. If noth-
ing else, Peking would like to increase its
unofficial, and secretive, economic ties
with Seoul, trading basic commodities
for some South Korean technology.


There are noneconomic dividends to be
reaped as well. China’s success in last sum-
mer’s Olympic Games triggered a massive
outpouring of national pride. Since Seoul
will be the host for the 1988 Summer Games,
the Chinese are eager to avoid any diplomat-
ic tangles that might prevent them from
taking part in the those Olympics.
Persuading North Korea to take a softer
line will not be easy. Whatever the tempta-
tions offered by increased economic con-
tacts with the West, neither Kim nor his son
and heir apparent Kim Jong II seem likely to
abandon the country’s philosophy of
Juche —or self-reliance. The elder Kim also
holds the so-called Russian card that he can
play anytime Peking tries to apply addition-
al pressure on him. As if to reinforce that
point, earlier this year Kim made his first
visit to Moscow in 17 years.
Still, there are clear signs that Peking’s
mediation is paying off. In the wake of last
month’s border incident, North Korea can-
celed a new round of economic and trade
talks that were scheduled to begin last week.
But the tone of the message, which was read
over the Pyongyang-Seoul “hot line,” was
decidedly mild. The statement expressed
the hope that the “talks will be resumed at an
early date” and that “an atmosphere of
dialogue” could be created. Given the long-
standing enmity between the two sides, that
nod to civility might just be considered a
sign of progress.

A Long Way to Peace
The meeting between North Korea and South Korea held at
Panmunjom in November was an important event in inter-
Korean relations. For the first time since the division of the
country in 1945, high-ranking representatives of the Pyongyang
and Seoul governments met to explore means of achieving
economic interactions between the two Koreas. But it is prema-
ture to be too hopeful about the future of the relationship
between North and South Korea. Even if the talks result in
limited economic exchanges, they are unlikely to produce a
major breakthrough in inter-Korean relations.
Hopes of North-South reconciliation arose when North Ko-
rea made, and South Korea accepted, an offer of relief supplies to
aid victims of the flood last September that destroyed 200,000
homes and left nearly 200 people dead. That opened the way for
the economic talks as well as meetings to discuss issues related to
family reunion and possible North Korean participation in the
1988 Seoul Olympics. South Korea has long maintained that it is
willing to have official talks on any matter, but the key decisions
still have to be made in Pyongyang if the talks are to achieve
anything of substance.
Pyongyang’s seemingly conciliatory gestures are seen as an
attempt to refurbish its international image. North Korea may
have concluded that talks with Seoul would be a necessary step
in establishing ties with the West-
ern powers. There may also be
something of an ulterior motive
here. Officials in Pyongyang may
be hoping that as its economic ties
with the United States and Japan
expand, those nations —allies of
South Korea —could change their
long-held view that North Korea
is not only a threat to South Korea
but to the stability and security of
the entire region.
However, several obstacles will
keep Pyongyang from seriously
pursuing accommodation with
South Korea. North Korea is and
will continue to be the captive of
its own rigid ideology and the per-
sonality cult that President Kim II
Sung has created for himself and
for his son, Jong 11. The Pyong-
yang regime must be aware of the
adverse political consequences of
opening up its society to the out-
side world, even to a limited ex-
tent, after almost four decades of
insulation. It is simply unrealistic
to expect that North Korea might
undergo a quick transformation.

UPI
In addition, there are no signs that Pyongyang is about to
reduce its military pressure on the South. It not only maintains
but continues to build up its already formidable armed forces. It
also seems to be repositioning them to be more threatening
against the South. For Pyongyang, dealing directly and officially
with South Korean “authorities” is tantamount to accepting the
“two Koreas” formula, which it has opposed all along. At the
present time, it will not give up its longstanding priority objec-
tive of “liberating” the South, which remains a primary source of
justification for the sacrifices it imposes upon its people. In
addition, Pyongyang does not wish to make it easy for Seoul to
successfully stage the 1988 Olympic Games, where the potential
participation of North Korea’s allies would enhance the prestige
of the South Korean government.
Leverage: Another element that may affect North Korean
policy toward the South is the Soviet Union. Pyongyang now
seems to be warming up its relations with Moscow, and the
Kremlin can certainly be expected to use its leverage to discour-
age North Korea from establishing or expanding ties with the
Western powers, especially the United States. If Chinese influ-
ence was partly responsible for North Korea’s new gestures, the
improvement of the Pyongyang-Moscow relationship is likely to
have the reverse effect of dampening its conciliatory spirit.
It was perhaps because of these political considerations that
North Korea has decided to use the shooting incident at Pan-
munjom over a defecting Russian as an excuse to put off the
economic talks with South Korea.
Pyongyang may want to establish
a relationship of economic cooper-
ation with South Korea; but it may
feel that the political and diplo-
matic cost of such an undertaking
is too high at the moment. It may
need time to think through its
priorities and strategies.
The economic talks may yet be
resumed, and an agreement may
yet be reached on limited ex-
changes of goods and services be-
tween the two sides. But the po-
litical, ideological and diplomatic
constraints within which Pyong-
yang has to operate will continue
to limit the extent to which prog-
ress can be made for North-South
Korean cooperation. Any real ad-
vancement of peace in Korea will
remain a long and arduous
process.

EUROPE
Paving the Way to Geneva
The superpowers battle for leverage before the Shultz-Gromyko arms talks.
Warsaw Pact defense ministers meeting in Budapest: Moscow and Washington were busy lining up the support of their allies
The flurry of righteous rhetoric could
mean only one thing: the negotiating
season is once again at hand. At the end of
the semiannual meeting of NATO defense
ministers in Brussels, Caspar Weinberger
hailed the group’s decision to beef up con-
ventional forces in Europe as a clear sign of
the Western Alliance’s “unity, strength and
resolution.” The U.S. secretary of defense
was not the only one praising the virtues of
solidarity last week. Half a continent —and
one whole political world —away, Warsaw
Pact foreign ministers met in East Berlin
and vowed that Moscow’s allies “will not
allow themselves to fall into a situation of
inferiority.”
There is still a month to go before
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko are scheduled to meet in
Geneva to discuss the resumption of
arms-control talks. Even so, each side
is already working hard to gain lever-
age by rounding up as much support
from its allies as possible. But both
also want to win the hearts and minds
of Western Europeans. And so the
two superpowers took turns sounding
conciliatory last week. Ronald Rea-
gan appointed a relative moderate,
veteran negotiator Paul Nitze, as
Shultz’s chief adviser for the Geneva
talks —a move calculated in part to
try to reassure the European allies of
Washington’s desire for an agree-
ment. In Moscow, Konstantin Cher-
nenko told visiting U.S. industrialist
Armand Hammer that both sides should
“roll up their sleeves and get down to busi-
ness”; the Soviet leader also suggested that a
summit meeting with Reagan might be pos-
sible if Washington renounced the first use
of nuclear weapons.
On the whole the signals from the East
Bloc conformed to that moderate line. In
their final communique, the foreign minis-
ters in East Berlin issued words of praise for
the upcoming meeting between Shultz and
Gromyko, saying that “the chance of a
change for the better in the international
situation now exists.” Their defense-minis-
try counterparts, who were meeting in Bu-
dapest, endorsed the summit in somewhat

more grudging terms. In a closing speech to
the delegates, Hungarian Defense Minister
Lajos Czinege chose to stress the impor-
tance of “preparedness” to counter any
NATO aggression. In reporting on the
meetings, however, the Soviet news agency
Tass printed the foreign ministers’ state-
ment in full —and virtually ignored the
harder line coming from Budapest.
Worried: At the NATO meeting, the dele-
gates tackled the potentially divisive issue of
military spending. Last June Georgia’s in-
fluential Sen. Sam Nunn proposed legisla-
tion that would require the United States to
pull out 30,000 of its 350,000 troops sta-
tioned in Europe each year in which Ameri-
ca’s allies failed to meet their pledge to
increase military spending by 3 per-
cent in real terms. The legislation was
narrowly defeated. Since then Euro-
pean leaders have become increas-
ingly worried about Washington’s
commitment to maintain a conven-
tional deterrent to Warsaw Pact
forces. In an effort to head off further
congressional criticism, the ministers
approved a six-year package that
would provide $7.8 billion to pay for
upgrading military facilities. The re-
spective countries also agreed to in-
crease ammunition stocks.
Despite the spirit of solidarity in
Brussels, Washington still faces a se-
vere test in alliance management in
the coming months. Many European
leaders are anxious about Reagan’s
plan for a multibillion dollar “Star


Wars” strategic-defense system. The wide-
spread fear is that such a shield would de-
tatch the United States from the defense of
Europe, whose security has long been based
on the premise that a Soviet nuclear attack
on any NATO country would immediately
result in an American retaliatory strike.
Moratorium: The Soviets may try to ex-
ploit those suspicions as part of a larger
propaganda campaign against the United
States. From the the Soviets’ seat at the
bargaining table, says one U.S. official in
Washington, “they will be more capable
than ever of manipulating public opinion.”
It is conceivable that the Kremlin will offer
to negotiate reductions in its offensive mis-
siles in exchange for a U.S. moratorium on
testing antisatellite devices and a promise
not to develop space-based weapons. So far
the Reagan administration has shown reluc-
tance to abandon the “Star Wars” plan. But
pressure from European allies fearful of
widespread demonstrations could force
Washington to reconsider its options.
In fact, the prospects for a reprise of last
year’s massive protests in Europe against
the installation of U.S.-made NATO Per-
shing II and cruise missiles are probably
slight. Washington’s major problems may
well come from the governments of Ameri-
ca’s NATO allies. It is by no means clear, for
example, that Belgium and the Netherlands
will honor their commitment to accept
cruise missiles. Both countries have indicat-
ed that they will await the outcome of super-
power negotiations before deciding whether
Weinberger and Lord Carrington: A demonstration of‘unity, strength and resolution ’
to take their alloted share of the weapons.
Up to a point, the United States would
like to be able to achieve some quick results
in its talks with the Soviets. Aside from
reassuring the allies, even a modest agree-
ment could help build momentum for the
harder negotiations that lie ahead. In all
likelihood, when NATO foreign ministers
gather in Brussels this week, they will gently
press for the United States to be flexible. To
be sure, there is a realistic understanding
that a genuine breakthrough is still in the
distant future. “It is going to be a long road,
and we must not raise false expectations,”
said NATO Secretary-General Lord Car-
rington at last week’s meeting for defense
ministers. “If it had been easy, it would have
been solved a long time ago.” True enough.
But there is at least reason to hope that the
superpowers are now willing to give arms
control a serious chance.

Reagan Taps an Old Pro
After the second world war, Paul Nitze had a job charting
U.S. bomb damage to Germany and Japan—and he has served
as a strategic point man ever since. Over the years he ha§ helped
run the Navy and the Pentagon, and he has guided presidents to
meet the Russians halfway on missile defenses and strategic
weapons. In 1974 the political right applauded when he quit
Richard Nixon’s arms-control team rather than leave
the country exposed to a “window of vulnerability” opened
by the Soviets. Yet in 1982 many conservatives condemned
his efforts to win a U.S.-Soviet deal to limit their nuclear
missiles in Europe. Nitze had kept a low profile for nearly
a year. But last week, at age 77, he was back in the spotlight.
This time Ronald Reagan named the old pro as a
special adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz
for the round of arms talks scheduled for next
month with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gro-
myko—a thicket as tangled as any a point man has
ever probed. Nitze’s strong points are patience,
craftsmanship and hard work. The problem is that
his mandate remains fuzzy. As an adviser ranking
beneath Shultz, he will lack the explicit authority of
an arms-control “czar” powerful enough to unite
the Pentagon and State Department behind one
strategy. All the same, his new job positions Nitze to
become Reagan’s chief negotiator, to coordinate
U.S. policy and—with regular presidential access —
to serve as something of a czar after all.
Nitze’s opponents cannot get away with tagging
Nitze: Point man
JOHN FICARA— NEWSWEEK
him as a dove. He forcefully denounced the SALT treaty com-
pleted by Jimmy Carter. But his fault in the eyes of some fellow
conservatives is to have shown excessive flexibility elsewhere.
The spark was Nitze’s “walk in the woods” near Geneva with
Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky during their Euromissile talks
in 1982. The two men arrived at an informal compromise
formula for a balanced reduction in missiles on the Continent.
Both Moscow and Washington rejected the formula —and in
late 1983 the Soviets broke off the talks altogether.
Umbrella: The negotiations facing Nitze now are much more
complicated. In Geneva, Shultz and Gromyko will be charting a
course for talks on Euromissiles, on long-range strategic missiles
and on the dawning generation of space weapons. When the hard
bargaining begins, Nitze might well end up coordinating U.S.
strategy in several sets of talks —and perhaps in a preliminary set
of “umbrella talks.” For the superpowers, positive
gestures all remain theoretical. For instance, East-
bloc officials in Washington claim that the Kremlin
is debating Reagan’s offer to exchange experts to
witness underground nuclear tests. If such inspec-
tions were permitted, they suggest, Reagan in turn
should seek Senate ratification of the 1974 Thresh-
old Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty. Any such feint may hide a seri-
ous offer. If Reagan’s arms-control quest is to
succeed, the administration must blend flexibility
with dogged determination. In Paul Nitze, at least,
the president has picked a negotiator who knows
the course.

WORLD AFFAIRS
Debating Race and Politics
Bishop Tutu and President Reagan disagree on the best way to fight apartheid.
Picketing outside the embassy in Washington: A South African slip helped turn an obscure protest into a popular, bipartisan cause
PHOTOS BY WALLY McNAMEE— NEWSWEEK
In my view, the Reagan administration's
support and collaboration with [the South
African government ] is immoral, evil and
totally unchristian. You are either for or
against apartheid, and not by rhetoric. You
areeitheron the side of the oppressed or on the
side of the oppressor. You can ’t be neutral.
—Bishop Desmond Tutu
I have always believed that it is counter-
productive for one country to splash itself
over the headlines demanding another coun-
try to do something. It puts the other country
in an impossible political situation. You can't
appear to be rolling over to the demands of an
outsider.
—President Ronald Reagan
At the White House last week, the bish-
op and the president sat down for a talk
on the relative powers of moral witness and
quiet diplomacy. Tutu, who will receive the
Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this week, argued
that the administration’s friendly relations
with Pretoria have “worsened the situation
of blacks in South Africa.” He urged the
president to consider sanctions to bring the
release of political prisoners and an end to
police violence in South Africa’s black
townships. In reply, the president defended
his policy of “constructive engagement.”
He contended that little had been achieved
in the past by threatening South Africa’s
Witness: The Kennedy arrest
notoriously recalcitrant government, but
that diplomacy had produced tangible re-
sults. “I disagree with the bishop,” he said.
An impasse was inevitable, but it left the
administration on the spot. Around the
country, demonstrators were picketing
South African embassies and consulates.
Prominent politicians, labor leaders and
civil-rights activists pressed in
on the South African Embassy
in Washington to be arrested
for civil disobedience. Last
week it was the turn of Douglas
and Rory Kennedy, the teen-
age children of the late Sen.
Robert Kennedy, who present-
ed protest organizers with a
note from their mother allow-
ing them to demonstrate. Both
Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward
Kennedy announced plans to
travel to South Africa. Thirty-
five conservative Republicans


threatened to support diplomatic and eco-
nomic sanctions unless Pretoria moved im-
mediately to end its racist system. When
Tutu made a tough attack on apartheid
before a congressional committee—and
called on the administration to stand up and
be counted against racism—the lawmakers
responded with a standing ovation.
Pretoria contributed mightily to the
surge in demonstrations. They began in late
November when three black leaders went to
the embassy in Washington to urge the re-
lease of 21 South African labor leaders im-
prisoned after a work stoppage. When the
protesters refused to leave, the embassy had
them carted off to jail. “The protest would
not have gotten off the ground if the South
African ambassador had simply let them
stay at the embassy,” says AFL-CIO
spokesman Murray Seeger. “But the idiot
called the police.” Suddenly an obscure pro-
test became a popular, bipartisan cause—
and Washington’s relations with South Af-
rica may never be quite so easy again.
Stubborn: The president has expressed
“repugnance” at South African racism, but
the gulf between him and his critics is likely
to remain wide. The administration’s top
priority is to link independence for South
African-controlled Namibia with a with-
drawal of Moscow’s Cuban surrogates in
Angola. Internal reform has generally taken
second place in Washington’s diplomatic
efforts. The White House argues that Jimmy
Carter’s posturing about human-rights vio-
lations accomplished very little for South
Africa’s 24 million blacks. To put greater
pressure on Pretoria, the administration in-
sists, would only encourage the stubborn
Afrikaners to thumb their noses at the rest of
the world. The administration’s object is to
prod Pretoria into slow, but tangible, prog-
ress. But the question remains whether it is
doing all it can to bring that progress about.
The government in South Africa was
viewing the American developments with
increasing concern. The country had been
drifting in diplomatic isolation, but under
constructive engagement things seemed to
improve. The United States offered to help
South Africa come to terms with neighbor-
ing states in southern Africa and relieve
international pressures and economic sanc-
tions. Recently, for example, Washington
helped guide Mozambique into detente with
South Africa. In return, Pretoria would
have to maintain a steady and discernible
movement away from apartheid. It was only
last week, however, that South Africa began
to suspect that Washington might seriously
insist that it live up to its end of the bargain.
In what appeared to be a gesture of appease-
ment, South Africa freed 11 black leaders
who had been jailed without charge. Preto-
ria quickly denied, however, that the release
had anything to do with American pressure.
South Africa’s progress toward racial
justice has clearly fallen short of Washing-
ton’s hopes. Last August the government
did adopt a new Constitution that gave
partial political representation to mixed-
race Coloreds and South Africans of Indian
extraction, but the country’s 73 percent
black majority remains disenfranchised.
Meanwhile, the main pillars of apartheid
remain intact, and new examples of racism
emerge almost daily. Last week, for exam-
ple, the seaside municipality of Kleinmond
ruled that all of its beaches were reserved for
whites alone.
Racism is too deeply entrenched to yield
quickly to American pressure. But Preto-
ria’s new discomfort may hasten a settle-
The president and the bishop get together: A disagreement over morals and diplomacy
ment of the Angolan and Namibian ques-
tion. Critics have long charged that South
African intransigence is a major barrier to a
diplomatic settlement. But Washington
will need concrete results to withstand the
attacks on constructive engagement. For
that reason, says Prof. John Barratt, direc-
tor general of the South African Institute of
Foreign Affairs, “a great deal depends on
clear progress in the negotiations on the
Namibia and Angolan issues and on dis-
cernible political progress here at home.”
What particularly concerns Pretoria is
the possibility of new economic sanctions —
a course that the administration has specif-
ically rejected. But growing numbers of
colleges, unions and state and local govern-
ments are considering plans to eliminate
their investments in companies doing busi-
ness in South Africa at a time when the
nation is already in its worst recession since
the 19305. Even more ominous was the
threat by the 35 conservative Republicans.
Absent a “demonstrated sense of urgency
about ending apartheid,” they warned, the
group will recommend the curtailment of
new American investment in South Africa
together with other economic sanctions
against the country. This week in his speech
in Oslo, Bishop Tutu will almost certainly
support such measures. As he fans the
flames of indignation, the pressure on Pre-
toria will only continue to grow.

IRNA VIA UPI
Kuwait Airways Flight 221 had just
taken off from Dubai for Karachi.
Suddenly passengers heard a scream in the
first-class section, then a shot. Four armed
men, speaking Arabic and English, sepa-
rated American and Kuwaiti passengers
from the others. After beating their vic-
tims they led them to the front compart-
ment. The hijackers forced the pilot to
land in Teheran. The terrorists acknowl-
edged killing two Americans and two Ku-
waitis, threatened to kill oth-
ers and announced that they
were putting another Ameri-
can on trial. “Please meet their
demands, because they are se-
rious,” said Charles Kipper,
an American hostage. “Please
prevent further killing.”
In Kuwait, top government
ministers organized a round-
the-clock crisis team, as did the
U.S. Embassy. Some believed
the hijackers might belong to
Hizbullah—Party of God —a
fundamentalist Islamic group
that has attacked Americans in the Middle
East before. There was no mystery about
their objective. The hijackers demanded the
release of 17 Arab terrorists now in prison in
Kuwait for crimes that included a bomb
attack against the U.S. Embassy and other
targets in Kuwait a year ago.
Once on the ground in Teheran, the
hijackers released small groups of hos-
tages—mostly women and children at
first—until only about 20 of the original
161 passengers and crew were left aboard.
After the Kuwaiti government refused to
Hegna: First victim
AP
give in to the hijackers’ demands, the ter-
rorists announced that they had wired the
airliner with explosives. They then set a
final deadline, said their prayers and
broadcast a last will and testament to the
Teheran control tower. Moments before
the deadline was to expire, Iranian security
men disguised as airport maintenance
workers stormed the plane and over-
whelmed the terrorists. The last of the
hostages were freed. The terrorists were
led away with their hands in
the air.
The hijackers apparently
boarded the plane at Dubai
where security had been lax
enough to allow them to smug-
gle aboard pistols, grenades
and an ax. That same day, the
gunmen shot their first Ameri-
can victim —Charles F. Hegna,
50, a Pakistan-based official
employed by the Agency for
International Development.
They beat other American
male passengers severely, ac-
cording to hostages who were later set free
in Teheran. An amateur radio operator in
Israel picked up screams. According to un-
substantiated reports, the killers had cut off
a Kuwaiti passenger’s thumb. As it hap-
pened, a thumb found in the rubble of the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait had helped lead
lawmen to the terrorists behind that assault.
Two days after shooting Hegna, the hi-
jackers killed William L. Stanford, 52,
another AID official. The terrorists led
Stanford to the top of the exit stairway
near the front of the plane and forced him
to plead for his life. An Iranian negotiator,
gesticulating with his arms, climbed the
stairs and apparently tried to persuade the
gunmen to spare the American. There was
a brief struggle, during which Stanford
may have tried to break free and escape.
Then his captors shot him six times at
point-blank range.
One passenger, a Pakistani, did manage
to make a break for it. When the hijackers
pushed him out onto the exit steps and
threatened to kill him, he leapt to the
ground and dashed for safety as bullets
whistled around him. Later, more shooting
was heard inside the plane, and the British
pilot told the Teheran control tower that the
situation was critical. The killers, he said,
were “very nervous.” The hijackers allowed
a medical team and an airport sanitation
crew to come aboard. Afterward, members
of the sanitation crew reported finding the
remaining hostages—most of them men —
tied to their seats with ropes. The cleaners
said they saw the bodies of two men on the
floor behind the cockpit, but could not tell
whether they were dead or alive.
Pressure: For days, Teheran seemed to
drag its feet in dealing with the hijackers.
Iran had supported various terrorist groups
in the past, including those that carried out
bomb attacks against Americans in Leba-
non. In any case, the Iranians seemed in no
hurry to bring about the release of the Ku-
waiti airline hostages. Instead of seizing the
airliner promptly in a commando raid —as
they did when a Saudi Arabian jet was
hijacked to Iran recently—the Iranians
gave the terrorists free access to the
media. They even allowed photographers
to record the horror —a move U.S. offi-
cials believed was calculated to increase
psychological pressure on the Kuwaiti
government.
With no diplomatic ties of its own to
Teheran, Washington has been obliged to
ask key Arab states, including Syria and
Algeria, to impress Iran with the need for
more forceful action against the hijackers.
There was “no evidence” of Iranian col-
laboration with the hijackers, Ronald Rea-
gan told a White House press briefing. But,
he added, the Iranians “have not been as
helpful as they could be in this situation or
as I think they should have been.” There
had been virtually nothing the Reagan ad-
ministration could do to help the hostages.
An Entebbe-style rescue effort could have
caused heavy loss of life among hostages
and rescuers alike. The State Department
has crusaded for a tougher response to ter-
ror, and Secretary of State George Shultz
believes that using deadly force in a just
cause was morally acceptable. But U.S.
military men feared that a retaliatory strike
perhaps in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley might
only have further jeopardized the hostages’
lives. In the end the Iranians came around
with a belated rescue.

SCIENCE
A Second Look at Super grains
For centuries quinua and amaranth were
integral to Andean and Central Ameri-
can cultures. The two grains were not only
staples of the Indian diet. Amaranth was
mixed with honey or human blood to fash-
ion icons, while Inca legends say quinua was
the remains of a heavenly banquet. Then
came the 16th-century Spanish conquest.
Catholic priests discouraged amaranth
plantings to deter the idolatrous practices,
while colonizers cleared away quinua to
make room for corn and potatoes. Today
both grains are in short supply in their native
habitats, dismissed by the upper classes as
“Indian food.” In Latin America and
elsewhere, however, scientists are ex-
ploring their potential to help feed the
world’s burgeoning population.
Both supergrains are now being
studied, and even sold commercially,
in the United States. China is looking
into some of the 2,000 strains of
quinua. Thailand, Kenya and various
South American countries have es-
tablished amaranth research stations.
Such interest is understandable. Har-
dier than corn or wheat, the grains can
flourish at high altitudes, withstand
drought and resist extremes of weath-
er. Their nutritional value is equal to
that of milk and is superior to all other
cereals because of their high protein
content and unusual combination of
amino acids. “These grains have very
good promise in areas where irriga-
tion is a problem,” says Noel Viet-
meyer of the National Academy of
Sciences in Washington.
‘A Dangerous Situation’: Vietmeyer
estimates that while there are at least
20,000 species of edible plants world-
wide, fewer than 150 are cultivated
widely. Of those, a mere 22 species
provide the bulk of protein for the
world’s population. “This creates
great vulnerability,” he says. “It’s a
dangerous situation.” Researchers believe
that amaranth and quinua could play a vital
role, particularly in developing countries
that are dependent on imported wheat. The
seeds of both plants can be ground for use in
breads and cereals or can be boiled like rice.
They also hold tremendous promise as feed
grain for livestock.
But those who want to make broader use
of amaranth and quinua face a battle. Mod-
ern agribusiness is grounded in the capital-
intensive cultivation of a few highly special-
ized crops. Both grains are now expensive to
produce; they must be harvested by hand
since the seeds mature at an uneven pace.
Andean scientists say that even under opti-
mum conditions, quinua would sell for up to
20 percent more than wheat because of high
input costs. Also, universities and research
institutes tend to shy away from investing
limited funds in minor crops. “Wheat and
corn are getting all the world’s research
attention,” says Vietmeyer.
Still, some institutions are bucking the
trend. The Rodale Research Center in
Kutztown, Pa., has devoted $3 million and
seven years of research to amaranth. After
collecting 1,200 strains of amaranth, Ro-
dale set about developing early maturing,
high-yield varieties that can be harvested
mechanically. The results are impressive.
Today, Rodale scientists have several varie-
ties that yield up to one ton of grain per acre,
Amaranth plants in Thailand: High protein
C. S. KAUFFMAN
a yield more than twice that of millet.
Scientists caution, however, that quinua
and amaranth are not “miracle crops” that
will yield quick fortunes. They recall the
hopes that attended jojoba, an exotic crop
that first attracted attention in the 1970s.
U.S. farmers invested more than $200 mil-
lion in this desert shrub that produces seeds
rich in oils used in shampoos, face creams
and industrial lubricants. Recently, supply
has outstripped demand —and some farm-
ers could suffer huge losses. Still, scientists
on almost every continent believe the two
grains have enormous potential. The ques-
tion is whether governments and research
institutes will invest in crops whose profits
may not be harvested for quite some time.

WORLD BUSINESS
Taiwan: A New Economic Era
After years of self-imposed isolation, the island is opening its doors to trade.
MARTINE VOYEUX
Taiwanese worker finishing a robot, Sun: The nation’s industries may have to sink or swim in a sea of foreign competition
In his lOth-floor office on Taipei’s Min
Sheng Road, David Sun looks every inch
the successful entrepreneur. Earlier this
year, the former computer technician from
California opened the first McDonald’s
fast-food franchise in Taiwan. The outlet
made more than $lOO,OOO in its second
week —setting a new sales record for the
U.S.-based chain and making Sun the un-
disputed “Hamburger King” of the island.
Last week, Sun raised his fourth pair of
trademark golden arches, and he plans six
more by the end of next year. “I just hit the
right place at the right time,” he says.
In fact, it was no coincidence. For dec-
ades, Taiwan has followed a rigid policy of
boosting exports while restricting imports,
and its tariffs and trade barriers have long
been among the stiffest in the world. Now,
however, that economic xenophobia seems
to be easing. President Chiang Ching-kuo
and his cabinet have ordered up a series of
potentially sweeping trade and investment
reforms to “liberalize and internationalize”
the country’s economy—and the arrival of
McDonald’s is but one sign of the change.
Reforms: Under Taiwan’s new policy, tar-
iffs will be reduced on more than a thousand
commodities next year, ranging from
chocolate and tobacco to footwear and bicy-
cle parts. Last week the government an-
nounced plans to lift a 10-year-old ban on
imported Japanese cars. When under way,
the reforms will open Taiwan’s market to
foreigners and could affect everything from
the local stock market to products placed on
supermarket shelves. Ultimately, they may
signal a new era in Taiwan’s go-it-alone
political relations with its Pacific neighbors.
Taiwan has changed course for a number
of reasons. For one thing, the country’s
protectionist policies have pushed up the
cost of living. Automobiles made in Taiwan
sell for roughly twice as much as a higher
quality Japanese model, and until recently
the same was true for made-in-Taiwan tele-
visions and other household appliances.
When foreign-made goods are allowed into
the country, they often carry import duties
that can boost their prices by 100 percent or
more. A Lacoste sport shirt that retails for
about $3O in New York, for example, might
cost more than $lOO in Taipei. With
Taiwan’s increasingly affluent consumers
demanding a wider range of goods at more
reasonable prices, the Taipei government
has come under unprecedented pressure to
modify its closed-door policies.
Taipei’s changing role in world trade has
also been a factor in the new reforms. From
its beginning stage as a struggling economy,
Taiwan has grown during the last two dec-
ades to become the world’s 13th largest
exporter. The island’s trade surplus with
the United States, its most important trad-
ing partner, is expected to approach $ll
billion this year, a 64 percent increase over
198 3. Not surprisingly, Washington has be-
gun to pressure Taiwan for a more equitable
relationship. To avoid a nasty trade spat,
Taipei has begun to buckle under a bit.
At the same time, competitive changes in
the Pacific market have propelled Taiwan
to be more outward-looking. As one of the
“four tigers” of Asian commerce —along
with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Ko-
rea—Taiwan is trying to move into high-
technology industries. Doing so, however,
requires the foreign know-how and invest-
ment capital that its trade barriers have
partially cut off. In fact, many Taiwanese
believe that the island’s outdated policies
have helped its competitors. U.S. compa-
nies, for instance, have invested less than
$5OO million in Taiwan. The comparable
figure for American investments in Hong
Kong was $3.3 billion and almost $5 billion
in Singapore.
Unnerved: Inevitably, some of Taiwan’s
long-protected industries will now have to
sink or swim in a potential sea of foreign
competition. It is impossible to predict
which segments of the economy will be most
affected by the new reforms, or how serious-
ly. But Taiwan’s electronics manufacturers
can be expected to face a stiff challenge from
their Asian rivals, at home as well as in their
overseas markets. The prospect of reduced
protection has already forced some local
electronics firms to slash prices on such
items as televisions and video cassette re-
corders. And the government’s recent deci-
sion to lift its import ban on Japanese autos,
and to reduce duties on U.S. and European
cars, has genuinely unnerved Taiwan’s au-
tomakers. “They’ll destroy the whole in-
dustry,” says Michael Chen, vice president
of the Taipei-based China Motor Co. “Ev-
eryone is afraid of Japanese cars. We
shouldn’t be ashamed to ban them.”
That prediction may be a bit alarmist, but
it underscores the doubts that many Taiwan
businessmen have over the proposed re-
forms. Government officials have tried to


calm industrial worries by emphasizing that
changes will come gradually. The goal, they
say, is to strengthen the country’s industries
through increased competition, not to
weaken domestic firms.
In fact, however, many foreign compa-
nies fear that the reforms will come too
gradually, if at all. Taipei has long promised
to revamp its cumbersome restrictions on
foreign banks, for instance, but little has
happened. And despite the government’s
new “open door” policy, Procter & Gam-
ble, the American consumer products giant,
gained a toehold in the Taiwanese market
only after nine months of near-agonizing
negotiations. For Japan’s Toyota Motors,
the trade talks proved so grueling that the
company recently dropped its plans to build
a $530 million automobile plant on the is-
land. At bottom, Taiwan’s business and
government bureaucracy has proved to be
slow and unwieldy. “A lot of people cannot
change with the times,” says Chao Yao-
tung, chairman of Taiwan’s Council for
Economic Planning and Development.
“We face severe difficulties.”
Wildly Popular: Despite such setbacks,
Taipei continues to hail its liberalization
program as the beginning of a new era, a first
step that cannot be reversed. “Once the door
is open, how can you close it?” asks Chao
Yao-tung. The arrival of chains like
McDonald’s is one sign the government’s
policies are succeeding. There are other
signs as well. Two Western advertising
agencies, Ogilvy & Mather and Gray Ad-
vertising, will soon open offices in Taipei in
hopes of penetrating Taiwan’s thriving local
market. Last year, the fledgling Taiwan
stock exchange permitted foreign investors
to indirectly buy local shares for the first
time. The vehicle was a British-run mutual
fund called International Investment Trust,
which attracted more than $4O million in
foreign investment. Last week the fund’s
managers announced a second $4O million
offering, which was snapped up in a matter
of days. The wildly popular subscription
was a significant vote of confidence in
Taiwan’s ability to weather the transition
from a closed to an open economy.
The times are clearly changing for
Taiwan. Many of its business leaders —as
well as some senior government officials —
expect the process to affect more than the
economy. The liberalization, they say, is
beginning to force the government to loosen
its longstanding controls on the movement
of funds, people and information into and
out of the island. A diverse group of opposi-
tion magazines is beginning to flourish. As
Taiwan builds new trade bridges with its
neighbors, the island’s traditional preoccu-
pation with security and uncompromising
anticommunism could begin to moderate.
If so, the country may enter more fully into
the emerging, and economically powerful,
Pacific community.
PATRICK SMITH and DIRK BENNETT in Taipei
Optimus Prime, leader of the benevo-
lent Autobots, has stumbled into a
trap. He thought the object before him was
just an ordinary cassette recorder. But sud-
denly, the recorder changed into Sound-
wave, minion of the evil Decepticons. Now
the two robots prepare to do battle. Who
will emerge victorious?
Whatever the outcome, the real winner
is Hasbro Bradley, Inc., the Rhode Island-
based company that sells both the Auto-
bots and the Decepticons as part of its
hugely popular line of toy robots called
Transformers. With a few Rubik’s Cube-
like twists, each Transformer converts
from a robot into a car, truck, airplane,
gun or (in the case of Soundwave) tape
recorder. Over the past nine months,
American boys have been grabbing the $3

$BO million worth of Transformers by the
end of the year. The idea has also worked
for Hasbro’s rival Tonka Corp. of Spring
Park, Minn., which has racked up stun-
ning sales with its $3 to $lO Goßot line of
mechanical men. “As fast as we fill our
display windows with the toys,” says Leon
Session, manager of Intellitoys, a Califor-
nia toy store, “they are gone.”
Hasbro gets its Transformers from Ja-
pan through an arrangement with Takara
Co., the Tokyo toymaker that invented the
henshin robo (transforming robot) several
years ago. Takara had been selling the toys
under other names throughout Japan, Eu-
rope, Britain and Australia with good—if
not spectacular—results. But when the
Japanese firm tried to launch the robots
in the United States two years ago, sales
fizzled. A year ago, Hasbro licensed
from Takara the rights to sell the toys
anywhere except in Japan. Now Takara
officials are somewhat bemused by Has-
bro’s record-breaking success. “Japanese
toys have sold a little here and there in the
United States,” says Takara spokesman
Shusuke Kubota. “But this is absolutely
unprecedented.”
Hasbro’s secret is American-style mar-
keting. Before introducing the Transform-
ers at the New York Toy Fair last February,
Hasbro concocted a fantasy world in which
good Autobots battled sinister Decepticons
on the planet Cybertron. Each Transformer
was given a name, a few character traits and
a motto. (The evil Megatron, for example,
advocates “Peace Through Tyranny.”) The
plot line was disseminated through adver-
tisements, comic books and even a weekly
animated TV program. Sales took off. “We
created a whole environment, a whole
world,” says Dan Owen, vice president for
marketing at Hasbro.
Tonka played the marketing game as in-
tensely as Hasbro, with the Goßot toys it
licensed from Bandai Co. in Tokyo. Tonka
had Bandai design Goßot models specifi-
cally for the American market, such as the
mighty Leader-1. And Tonka hired a suc-
cessful TV writer to come up with the story
of Cy-Kill, the leader of a band of convicts
from the planet Goßotron who escape and
stage a raid on Earth.
With orders backed up well into next
year, Hasbro and Tonka are riding high.
But the toymakers had better stay on their
guard. Taiwan-made knockoffs of the toy
robots are already pouring into the United
States. If the market becomes too saturated,
demand may drop off. Kids, as toy manu-
facturers often learn the hard way, are apt to
change their minds faster than Optimus
Prime can change into a truck.

A World of Nautical Luxury
Thackwray’s luxury motor sailer Chardonay: Push-button piloting for the privileged
JOHN EVANS
The cockpits are finished in Burmese
teak, and the sails furl and unfurl at
the touch of a button. Below decks, satel-
lite-aided navigation equipment glows
with reassuring lights, while the galley
hums with a dozen different high-tech ap-
pliances, including a vegetable cooler, an
ice maker and a microwave oven. One of
the oldest laws of the sea states that anyone
who has to ask the price of a yacht prob-
ably can’t afford it. But as a pair of New
Zealand boatbuilding firms are finding,
even multimillionaire mariners will travel
a long way to get the ultimate in nautical
luxury at a discount price.
Neither Thackwray Yachts nor its cross-
town Auckland rival, Export Yachts, could
be accused of trying to create a mass market.
Their custom-built motor sailers start at 75
feet—and the price tags start at a cool
$900,000. (A totally fitted-out 100-footer
can run to several times that amount.) In-
evitably in luxury-yacht building, one of the
principal costs is labor —as many as 30,000
to 40,000 man-hours for a “typical”
Thackwray model, much of it devoted to
the sort of painstaking interior woodwork-
ing that forest-rich New Zealand has long
been known for. But even before the 20
percent devaluation of the New Zealand
dollar last July, its foremost boatbuilders
enjoyed labor and overhead costs that were
two-thirds lower than those paid by their
European and U.S. counterparts. The re-
sult: even though their mostly American
clientele is at least 5,600 miles away, the two
Auckland firms can deliver comparable—
some say superior—luxury at significantly
lower prices. “The main question,” says
Thackwray principal Philip Thackwray, “is
not how much is the boat, but how quickly
can you build it.”
Though neither company discloses its
profits, one Export Yachts official said his
company had an annual turnover of “sever-
al million [dollars]. ’ ’ Thackwray has sold 16
yachts during its nine years in business —
several of them to American movie moguls.
The firm currently gets an average of two
inquiries a week. And it recently began
getting new orders from happy former cli-
ents who now want to move up to higher
levels of luxury. The order books of both
firms are full. Says one Export Yachts
executive, “We’ve got as much as we
can handle.”
‘Boat Float 5 : A limited market and the
longtime lag in construction are only two of
the factors that have traditionally kept
high-priced boatbuilding in an economic
backwater. As one Thackwray official says:
“Most boatbuilders have been craftsmen
first and businessmen second.” A particular
problem is persuading banks to provide fi-
Gavigan , Laird: A floating syndication
FILM IMAGES
nancing without a preconfirmed sale. In
November, however, the Auckland mer-
chant bank Fay, Richwhite launched what
was dubbed the “the boat float”—a public
syndication accepting investments of as lit-
tle as $2,500 to underwrite construction of a
100-foot, aluminum-hulled, luxury “maxi”
cruising yacht. Bankers Tony Gavigan and
John Laird expect the “float” shares to sell
out quickly; the hope now is that the boat
itself will find a buyer before its scheduled
launch in the summer of 1986. Says Gavi-
gan, “Though the market is a small one, it’s
in short supply. The yards in America are
full with contract-built yachts.”
Automated: But most customers will un-
doubtedly continue to want to have every-
thing expressly their own way—as well they
might, given the extravagant cost. Though
sailing proficiency is still a must, one
Thackwray customer and a woman friend,
an inexperienced sailor, recently sailed a
100-footer from New Zealand to Hawaii —
using little more than the occasional touch
of a fingertip to the yacht’s automated con-
trols. Old salts may cringe at the thought of
push-button seafarers cruising blithely
across the oceans. But at least the new breed
of sailors will be as secure —and comforta-
ble —as money can make them.
MARILYN ACHIRON with SELWYN PARKER
in Auckland
British Telecom’s
Transatlantic Splash
Imports often beguile Americans, but
last week’s public offering of British Tele-
communications shares seemed to take that
maxim to an extreme. Long before the
stock’s opening, U.S. investment houses
were inundated with orders for shares in
BT—Britain’s main provider of telephone
service and the largest state-owned com-
pany to be partially divested by Margaret
Thatcher’s Tory government. When BT
shares began trading Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange, demand proved ex-
plosive. Opening at $5.96 apiece, they near-
ly doubled to $ll in an instant, and volume
soared in the most frenzied trading since the
divestiture of AT&T last January.
The action in the United States mirrored
the issue’s popularity in Britain, where in-
vestors gobbled up the bulk of the 50.2
percent of the shares offered for sale. Oppo-
nents of the Conservative government
quickly criticized the sale, claiming that the
stock’s initial price had been set far too low.
Both retail and institutional investors clear-
ly believed they had found a bargain. But
one of its most compelling features for
Americans may have been BT’s unique for-
eign flavor. Unlike the Bell operating com-
panies in the U.S., BT will be able to enter
potentially lucrative unregulated business-
es. And since BT’s return on equity isn’t
regulated, says Morgan Stanley managing
director Thomas Saunders, the upside po-
tential for earnings seems unlimited.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
A Great Leap Forward for TV Technology
The television set, once considered an extraordinary inven-
tion, has become a relatively crude device in this age of
personal computers and pocket-size stereos. Its picture is
fuzzier than a 3 5-mm photograph; its small speaker is no match
for most FM receivers. But that is changing. Recent break-
throughs in television technology are beginning to filter down
into the marketplace, and it may not be long before most TV sets
offer sound and pictures comparable to a first-rate cinema.
Audio technology is advancing more rapidly than video.
Last March the U.S. Federal Communications Commission
officially approved stereo broadcasting for television. One
such system, Zenith/dbx, has emerged as the standard. The
system was named after the
two firms that developed it, Ze-
nith Electronics Corp. of Chi-
cago, 111., and dbx Inc. of New-
ton, Mass.
A New Standard
With the Zenith/dbx for-
mat, a television station is able
to broadcast the combined left
and right audio channels of a
stereo program using standard
TV frequencies. The station
can also transmit a signal be-
yond the range of the human
ear. This “subcarrier,” as the
signal is called, contains infor-
mation that is needed to sep-
arate the stereo channels.
When the combined signals
reach a properly equipped TV
set, special circuitry processes
them and produces high-fidel-
ity stereo sound.
About 100 television sta-
tions throughout the United
States are expected to begin
full-time stereo broadcasting by 1986. Most major TV manu-
facturers are already producing sets capable of processing
stereo. The Panasonic CTF 2077 R (price: $2,000), which is
built by Matsushita Corp. of Osaka, is a typical example. In
addition to the circuitry needed to decode stereo signals, the
Panasonic has a 20-inch screen and two 4-inch loudspeakers.
The back of the set is studded with input and output jacks that
allow the set to be hooked up to IBM or Apple personal
computers, video-cassette recorders, stereo headphones and
additional TV monitors. Sony Corp. of Tokyo is also produc-
ing a full line of stereo TV’s, ranging in price from $9OO to
$1,300. In addition, Sony offers a pair of wireless stereo
headphones at a price of $220 that receive the audio signal via
an infrared transmitter placed atop the TV set.
Stereo television may not catch on as rapidly as American
TV manufacturers seem to think. In Japan, stereo TV based on
a similar system has been available for six years. But only about
12 percent of shows are currently broadcast in stereo, and only
30 percent of Japanese households have stereo television sets.
In West Germany, where TV station ZDF broadcasts stereo
Toshiba digital TV with ‘window’showing second channel
shows using still another method, only about 10 percent of
viewers own stereo sets.
Many American electronics firms seem to be hesitant about
new video technology. Earlier this year, ITT Corp. of New
York began offering TV manufacturers a package of 7 digital
chips that can replace as many as 400 conventional TV compo-
nents. The chips convert the analog TV video signal into digital
pulses. This improves picture quality and lets the television
watcher perform computerlike tricks with the set, including
freezing an image at will or displaying a second program in one
corner of the screen (a feature known as “windowing”). De-
spite the apparent potential, no American TV makers have as
yet announced a line of digital
televisions for the consumer
market. “We’re finding out just
how expensive [digital technol-
ogy] is,” says Frank McCann
of RCA Corp. of Indianapolis,
Ind. “There’s no doubt that
digital will come, but the indus-
try is not being as aggressive as
it had planned to be.”
The Push for Digital
Two Japanese electronics
firms are displaying quite a bit
of aggression, however. To-
shiba Corp. of Tokyo has intro-
duced a digital TV that has
freeze-frame, windowing and
zoom capabilities. The CZ2094
is now available in Japan for
$l,lOO, and the firm expects to
launch sales in the United
States and Canada next spring.
Sony Corp. recently intro-
duced a digital TV system
called the Digital Canvas
(price: $1,375) in the Japanese
market. The system incorporates not only digital, but “high-
density,” technology. Using the ordinary broadcast signal, the
Digital Canvas doubles the number of scanning lines found on
an ordinary TV screen, producing an image as sharp as a color
photograph.
If, or (more likely) when, digital television does catch on,
Siemens AG of Munich, West Germany, may be ready to offer
a flat screen that can take full advantage of the technology.
Technicians at Siemens are working on a 14-inch color display
screen that is only 2.5 inches deep. The screen uses a fluores-
cent coating similar to that found in conventional TV tubes. An
ordinary TV uses a magnetic “gun” to shoot a stream of
electrons at the coating in order to create an image. In the
Siemens screen, the gun is replaced by thousands of tiny
electrodes. These can work closer to the screen. The Siemens
screen, coupled with stereo sound and a digital picture, may
one day result in a slim TV that can hang on a wall and offer
startlingly realistic sound and a crystal-clear picture.

FACT: TOYOTA SUPER RESP
TECHNOLOGY GIVES MOU
More power. Less fuel. These are the objectives Toyota set and met in
our Super Responsive engine program. Now, virtually every Toyota vehicle in
Australia features this impressive technology. Super Responsive engines weigh
less. They use advanced metals to improve heat transfer and reduce friction. And
many incorporate such innovations as hollow crankshafts and camshafts.
The new Corona Avante is a powerful example, with its 2.4 litre Super J
Responsive engine. It's lighter than most other four cylinder engines, yet it I
performs more like a six. Avante also features advanced EFI (Electronic Fuel,
Injection) and combustion chamber technology to assure complete and more %
efficient burning, for maximum power. In fact, Avante 2.4 is clearly the most
powerful car in its class in the country.
And you'll find Super Responsive engine technology in virtually every
new Toyota, from the 2.0 litre HiLux, with its wedge-shaped combustion
chambers, to the awesome power of the 2.8 litre Supra. Toyota has created the
era of Super Responsive power. And that's a powerful advantage for you.

A chance for the
Australian XI?
WE’RE indebted to our
generous colleagues at the
Pacific Islands Monthly for the
news of a recent historic
pilgrimage by descendants of
the Bounty mutineers on
Pitcairn Island to visit their
cousins on Norfolk Island.
The Pitcairners first had to
go to Tahiti, then on to the
French island of Mangareva
where they chartered a ship
to take them to Norfolk
(some 1500 km north-east
of Sydney).
Highlight of the visit was a
cricket match in which, appar-
ently, everyone took part.
The scores: first innings
Norfolk 41 runs for 26
wickets, Pitcairn 49 runs for
21 wickets. Second innings:
Norfolk 31 for 14 (dec),
Pitcairn 22 for 18. Victory to
Norfolk by one run.

JAPAN’S recent trade mis-
sion to Australia has already
come up with one idea.
Marketing magnate Shigeyuki
Tanishima, whose corporate
interests include a chain of
department stores, was fascin-
ated by cherries he bought
from a stall in Sydney.
The quality was good but it
was the timing that he liked;
he told agricultural officials in
NSW they’d be a sensation in
Japan in the New Year hol-
iday period. Apparently the
cherry season in Japan is
short and imports from Cal-
ifornia arrive during the
northern summer.
Already the quarantine im-
plications and marketing as-
pects of Australian cherry
sales to Japan are now under
study.
Interestingly, while the
mission was in Australia,
former MP and goad to many
governments, W. C. Went-
worth, wrote a letter to the
press saying it was obvious
Australian fruit would sell
well in Japan.
Once more Billy seems to
have scored!
Rupert’s French
connection
HAVING all but conquered
the English-speaking world,
Rupert Murdoch is moving
on to new journalistic
pastures. He has suddenly
turned up in France as a
director of the French pub-
lishing house, Publications
Filipacchi, a privately-owned
group that puts out 14
publications including the
prestigious Paris Match, Lui
and has an interest in
the very successful women’s
weekly Elle.
The firm, which has an
estimated $156 million turn-
over (up 45 percent since
1981), plans to go public this
month to finance extra ex-
pansion, particularly in the
US, where Murdoch’s expert-
ise is considered essential.
ONE of the regular features in the Sunday Telegraph is the publication of two cartoons, seemingly similar, but
with minute differences. The reader is asked to spot the differences. The day following the federal election,
the Sunday Telegraph - believing there would be a Hawke landslide ran the top cartoon for two editions.
Here we run our own competition. Can you spot the difference?

ably with his own.

The trade newsletter Inside
Tourism quotes a Diamond
Tours study showing the huge
surplus of hotel rooms in
Singapore has made holi-
daying in Singapore much
cheaper.
The rates for Hong Kong
in Australian dollars and for
Singapore (in brackets): 1983,
$44.50 ($64.30); 1984, $49
($59); 1985, $72 ($54). All
figures are for shared twin
accommodation in a medium-
quality hotel.
Diamond Tours’ pricing to
the wholesalers for a night’s
accommodation as part of a
one-week tour package is
$28.42 in Singapore and
$48.14 in Hong Kong.
In local currency terms, the
increase in Hong Kong prices
for 1985 over 1984 will be 46
percent while Singapore will
have declined 20 percent from
1983 to 1985.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
TOURNAMENT play calls for
strategies other than those
adopted for ordinary games.
The score is seven points each
in a keenly fought match to nine
points. The game is nearing the
final stages with White to throw.
Neither player has gained
sufficient advantage to double, so
the cube is still in the middle on 1
point. White rolls a 6-4; what is
the play?
This roll virtually sews up
the game. In one fell swoop,
White can move the outermost
man from Black’s 4 point as
shown by the dotted lines past
all the opponent’s on-coming
pieces, right to the safety of
White’s 1 1 point. For “bearing-
off" purposes, White’s home
board is superior to Black’s. Why,
then, is it a second-class move?
Moving that way will give
White the game and 1 point,
making the score 8-7 in White’s
favor. Given such a score, Black
will automatically double at the
start of the next game with
nothing to lose and everything to
gain: a win means the match
whereas a loss gives it to White
irrespective of the margin!
At a score of 7-7, therefore,
one point is virtually useless!
Suppose, though, that White made
the solid-line play to “fill" the
home board while leaving the blot
still exposed on Black’s 4 point.
This risk could lose White the
game but, as seen before, this is a
one-point game Whoever wins
the next game will be the match-
winner! The difference is that
should Black throw any of a
multitude of rolls such as 6-1, 6-3,
6-5, 5-4, 5-3, etc, Black will be
forced to leave a blot. By hitting
this blot, White would stand a
good chance of winning a double
game and the match.

Opening lead king of
spades.
ONLY rarely does declarer
choose a game or slam contract
based on a 4-3 trump fit. This is as
it should be, since a contract with
only seven trumps to the op-
ponents’ six is not the type of
trump superiority one yearns for.
Such contracts normally are
avoided by finding a longer trump
suit or by playing in no-trump.
However, sometimes there is no
better alternative than to choose
the 4-3 trump contract as in the
present case.
Contracts based on a 4-3 fit
often require careful handling to
compensate for the trump
deficiency and this was where
South fell from grace.
West started with the K-A of
spades and continued with the
queen. South ruffed, played three
rounds of trumps and began to
play diamonds. When the suit
proved to be divided 4-2 instead
of 3-3 West ruffed the third dia-
mond with his remaining trump
and cashed the 10-2 of spades to
defeat the contract two tricks.
In effect, declarer miscued
when he trumped the third round
of spades. By doing so, he put
himself in a position where any-
thing but a 3-3 heart division
would endanger the contract. In-
stead, South should have dis-
carded a club on the third spade
thus retaining full command if the
trumps were divided either 3-3 or
4-2.
No return by West then could
have hurt declarer. Another spade
