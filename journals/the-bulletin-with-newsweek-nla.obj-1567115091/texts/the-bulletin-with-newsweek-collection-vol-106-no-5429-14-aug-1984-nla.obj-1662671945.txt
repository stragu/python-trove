THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Corporate state
Katharine West (B, June 26-July 3)
talked about the rise of the corporate
state, the emergence of unbargainable
issues and the growing irrelevance of
traditional political parties. There is no
doubt that we are experiencing political
shifts which threaten to concentrate
power in the hands of the few.
The sobering conclusion to be drawn
from the present government’s record is
that Bob Hawke has been able to engin-
eer some sort of fragile consensus be-
tween the power hierarchies of our so-
ciety. He has neither sought nor ob-
tained the personal commitment or par-
ticipation of men and women con-
cerned for their future and the future of
their children.
The 1984 ALP conference has
reinforced and accelerated this trend
and the formation of the Hawke corpor-
ate state. Skilful balancing of powerful
forces, some solid arm-twisting behind
closed doors and a dash of public
theatre have produced a recipe which
will reinforce the power of organised
labor, big business and the Hawke Gov-
ernment.
But clearly the corporate state does
not care for people. Principles and the
heartfelt concerns of men and women
who want peace, jobs and a future for
their children have been sacrificed. Aus-
tralian uranium will be mined, exported
and used for nuclear power and nuclear
weapons. Foreign bases will continue to
make us nuclear targets and part of the
nuclear weapons race. Timorese and
people subjected to human rights viol-
ations in other countries have been
judged less important than international
power trade-offs.
In the budget the government will
offer politically useful tax cuts but is
likely to ignore families with dependent
children, the need of pensioners to be
secure in their old age and what should
be the top priority: useful employment
for people affected by technological
change and young people starting life.
Women will continue to be fobbed
off with inadequate legislation when
they need genuine freedom of choice to
enter the workforce or to rear their chil-
dren at home or to do both consecutive-
ly-
If Hawke’s corporate state does little
for people, we can expect nothing from
the Liberal/National Party coalition.
Malcolm Fraser’s hapless heirs con-
tinue to see it as their function to look
after the interests of the corporate sector
long after they have lost their customers
to Hawke, who is able to deliver. The
posture and thinking of a party dedi-
cated to an obsolete status quo is no
counterweight to the juggernaut of the
corporate state.
In some of the most important areas,
the Opposition has forsaken both prin-
ciples and any concern for the future of
our country it might once have had. In
one of their most cynical and short-
sighted stances the Liberal and National
Parties continue to applaud Hawke for
selling Australian uranium for nuclear
power and nuclear weapons. Yet this is
one of today’s unbargainable issues
about which West is talking.
More than half the people of Austra-
lia are concerned deeply about uranium
and the danger of nuclear war. As well
they might be. We are told that the desti-
nation of uranium is controlled by
pieces of paper called non-proliferation

The car above is the latest
Jaguar.
In our opinion, this Jaguar is
the best Jaguar ever made.
And also represents the best
value ever offered in luxury cars.
With due regard to the
memorable Jaguars of the past,
these are not statements we make
lightly.
Life with a new Jaguar begins
at around $48,450*.
To put this price into
perspective, try to think of any
other automobile which offers
Jaguar’s level of luxury,
refinement and equipment and
doesn’t cost at least ten thousand
dollars more.
You can delete the Mercedes
280 SE which, in our opinion, is
the nearest comparable
Mercedes.
That comes in at around
$61,525**.
You can also disregard the
BMW 735 i at around $59,500**.
In fact, whatever you look at,
you’ll still find the Jaguar XJ6 is
streets ahead.
The question is, how is it
possible for the best to be made
for less?
Involvement builds better cars,
more efficiently.
Three years ago, when John
Egan took over as Chairman and
Chief Executive of Jaguar cars,
the automobile industry thought
that technology was the sole
solution to all its problems.
John Egan disagreed.
“The best, most sophisticated
machines in the world will not
make memorable cars,” he argued,
“ if the men who operate them do
not have pride in what they do.”
Then, while Jaguar invested
millions in re-tooling, John Egan
began asking the people who
actually build the cars for their
thoughts on ways of making
better Jaguars.
His office was flooded with
ideas and proposals, many of
which were acted upon
immediately.
Ever since then, once a month
the staff meet with management
and continue to find better ways
of doing things.
The result, again, is best
summed up by John Egan himself.
“Productivity has doubled with
no increase - in fact a decrease -
in workforce.”
“Naturally, the
unit cost is less.”
The best Jaguar ever
made gives you the best
of everything.
While the Jaguar
XJ6 embodies
excellence of con-
struction and superb
value, its traditional
virtues should not
be overlooked
It gives you a
unique combination
of looks, perform-
ance, comfort and
peace-of-mind that
is not equalled by
other cars.
It is the only
current model to be included
among the ten most beautiful cars
of all time in a survey conducted
by “Car and Driver” magazine.
It is also considered to have
the best ride in the world.
And, in Mastercare, the best
warranty and maintenance
programme.
The Jaguar XJ6 carries a
warranty valid for two years or
40,000 km, whichever comes first.
Furthermore, Jaguar
undertakes to pay the labour and
genuine Jaguar replacement part
costs of regular maintenance as
set out in the owner’s handbook
for three years or 40,000 km.
whichever comes first.
Whether you buy a Jaguar at
$48,450,* or opt for the more luxu-
rious Jaguar Sovereign,Vanden
Plas, or XJS-HE, the value for
money is no less apparent.
Call your nearest Jaguar
Rover dealer and arrange to test
drive the best Jaguar ever made.
It could be the best decision
you ever made.

agreements. At last count some 18
nations were using nuclear power reac-
tors capable of producing weapon-
grade plutonium. These include Argen-
tina, South Africa, India, South Korea
and Pakistan and many of them either
have or will soon have nuclear bombs.
Last Palm Sunday 250,000 people
around Australia marched to express
their deeply-felt concern. They came
from all walks of life, all occupations,
dressed in jeans and in their Sunday
best hardly a rag-tag collection of the
“lunatic left.”
The Democrats are the only political
force left to provide a positive counter-
weight to the lethargy of a tired and ir-
relevant Opposition and a government
directed by the vested interests of pow-
erful unions and big business.
The Democrats are serving the na-
tion well in making the Senate an effec-
tive house of review. The work done in
our watch-dog capacity has spanned the
whole range of community concerns:
no sales tax on necessities of life;
amendments to Medicare to protect the
chronically ill, many of them elderly;
private members’ bills to assist small
business and people in remote areas; in-
dustrial democracy legislation; the long
fight to save the Franklin; economic
policies to create work; a stronger
Crimes Authority Bill and many more
more than 80 private members’ bills and
notices of motion; more than 40 suc-
cessful amendments to government
legislation.
We will continue and extend our
work as Australia’s only party not en-
cumbered by hierarchical structures or
vested interests and the only party able
and willing to make a stand on issues
which affect people.
It is more important than ever to do
so in view of the major parties’ inability
to cope with change in terms other than
self-interest and their lack of political
will to meet the needs of men, women
and children caught up in the shifting
jig-saw puzzle of the future.

At The Dynasty Singapore,
we’ve discovered that
the illustrious company we keep
also writes the nicest letters.
Perhaps it’s the unusually attentive service we extend
to every guest at The Dynasty Singapore. Or it could be the
hospitality that seems to come straight from the heart.
Again it could be because of what we have to offer.
Rooms and suites, luxuriously appointed and comfortably larger
than average. Our Le Vendome Restaurant that boasts the very
finest French cuisine. The Tang Court Chinese Restaurant with its
superb Cantonese specialities. Bill Bailey’s Bar. Our 24-hour
Golden Dew Coffee House. Stroller’s Sidewalk Cafe. And the
office away from the office our Executive Services Centre,
complete with Health Club and full-sized swimming pool.

Equal opportunity
I suppose it was inevitable that the Aus-
tralia Council’s recent publication set-
ting out a strategy for action to bring
about equitable conditions for women
in the arts would provoke criticisms of
bureaucratic heavy-handedness. I am
pleased, however, to point out to Brian
Hoad (B, July 24) that, unlike him,
many other people, including state and
federal ministries as well as members of
the arts community, have received the
publication positively and recognised
its timeliness.
Hoad’s article, which contrives to
stitch together remarks about the coun-


...LITTCESELF-INCEVIIVE
PLOY WE PICKED UP
FROM THE FALKLANDS...
cil’s equal opportunity strategy with a
review of Alison Lyssa’s The Boiling
Frog is disappointing in a number of
ways.
First, it is a piece of 1984
doublespeak, in our view, to call an
equal opportunity policy “sexist.”
Second, Hoad refers to shortcomings
in the Nimrod’s Women and Theatre
project of 1981 and the current Lyssa
play. If, as Hoad asserts, there have
been shortcomings they would tend to
support the council’s case rather than
deny it. The publication Women in the
Arts: A Strategy for Action indicates that
women have been prevented, for
reasons ranging from male-dominated
managements to male-oriented reper-
toires, from gaining crucial experience
in writing, direction and other pro-
fessional work.
Third, Hoad refers to “required
quotas” of women and men in arts ac-
tivity. As in the federal government’s
affirmative action policy, which the
council’s booklet reflects, quotas are not
required. What is sought is equal oppor-
tunity to work, by the removal of institu-
tional barriers which disadvantage
women.
Finally, Hoad uses certain statistics
seemingly drawn from another Austra-
lia Council publication, The Artist in
Australia Today. While this report does
state that women form 46 percent of all
actors, their ability to find work in com-
parable proportions is constrained
severely by other circumstances which
Hoad does not mention for example,
the paucity of female roles in Australian
plays.
Hoad chooses not to quote the statis-
tic in our recent publication that
showed that, over 10 years, one of the
more progressive major theatre com-
panies provided roles for 214 female ac-
tors as against 544 male actors and that
in that time it produced the work of
only four women writers.
TIMOTHY PASCOE
Chair

(Brian Hoad writes: 1. How else do you
describe a policy in which gender takes
precedence over individual merit? 2. The
shortcomings need to be overcome; but
why expose them on major stages and
frighten off audiences with bad theatre?

Home office.
At long last, there is a personal computer that
is both truly portable and truly powerful.
It’s the new Apple® lie.
It weighs just a bit less than eight pounds.
Its power and many applications can only improve
the way you go about your business. And its tremendous
portability means your office isn’t the only place you can
go about your work.
The fact that the Apple lie is twice as powerful as
personal computers twice its size doesn’t mean that it’s
any more complicated. The opposite, in fact.
After plugging your Apple into a normal television
or optional monitor, you’re ready to insert the first of six
self-explanatory start-up programs into the Apple’s built-
in disk drive.
Taking into account the entertaining games and the
enjoyable banter the Apple indulges in as it teaches you
to learn, you’ll leave the world of computer illiteracy
behind you in just a few hours.
And be left wondering what all the' fuss is about.
But what can your Apple do for you?
Although the number grows daily, there are cur-
rently over 10,000 different programs that can be used
with the Apple, many written to make the business of
doing business faster, easier and more productive. The
Apple’s ability to keep records, manage finances and
prepare, file and retrieve documents, will soon make
you wonder how others are managing without one.
And should you ever feel the need to work late
into the night or over the weekend, it won’t be a com-
puter that keeps you at the office. After all, computers
should be the slave of the people, and not vice versa.
For the address of your nearest Apple lie dealer,

The Apple you’ve been waiting for.

Phone problems
Telecom is about to raise the charges for
local calls and reduce the cost of STD
calls. In the Hughenden district we, of
course, do not have access to STD un-
less we live in the town and therefore we
will not get any tit for tat on local calls.
Anyone with a dial on their phone can
ring me on STD but I cannot recipro-
cate because our phone has only a
handle for bell ringing.
The system we were lumbered with
in 1982 is called an interface at the ex-
change. We were promised that we
would get a better system in a year or
two. Last week I was told officially that
there would be no improvement until
1988 and two days later a senior offi-
cial told me that 1990 was the more
probable date, unless we could work a
miracle.
The interface system involves a five
to 10 second ring-on and ring-off and
whenever the interface is faulty and
does not receive a full and proper ring-
off we are then incommunicado until we
try to ring-on again. The system we had
from 1907 until 1982 was infinitely more
reliable.
Despite the fact that we erect and
maintain our own phone lines for the 36
km into Hughenden, Telecom main-
tains that they show a loss on our rural
services. When one takes into account
that I pay more than $4OOO annually for
our phone calls as well as providing and
maintaining our phone line it is little
wonder that Telecom will not let us in-
spect their costings.
In what can seem only to be an act of
spite Telecom is going to eliminate our
untimed local calls and we are going to
be charged an inflated price for every
part of three minutes that we talk to our
neighbors. The nearest is 15km away
but he is on another exchange which in-
curs a trunk call. Telecom has told us
that it would not be wise politically to
institute timed local calls in towns and
cities. This is somewhat of an under-
statement but they have no cause to fear
a political row from our small western
communities.
I have great empathy with The Mod-
est Farmer and his views on the inhabi-
tants of Melbourne (B, July 24). The fu-
ture of our phone communications lies
with a bureaucrat in Melbourne who
continually described himself as an
Automising Expert when he came up to
visit us. He was very ignorant of all
things rural.
He claimed responsibility for invent-
ing a system called Country Calling. His
pamphlet had many false statements.
He admitted that only a few hectares of
Victoria, in the far west, would be sub-
ject to Country Calling doubtless be-
cause the rest of Victoria is within gun-
shot of his office.

More discrimination
I would like to inform you that I am
being heavily discriminated against and
that I have become the target of many
aspects of racism. I will list how I am
discriminated against:
1: I am white.
2: I am Anglo-Saxon.
3: I am not Asian.
4: I am Catholic.
5: I speak English.
6: I am heterosexual.
7: I am not an immigrant (my family
has been in Australia since 1832).
8: Finally, the worst of all, I am
male!
Due to these faults and deficiencies I
am now calling to all true Australians to
help form the Totally Typical Austra-
lian Party (TTAP) and help to stamp out
these discriminatory practices to which
our current government is subjecting us.

Finding fault
If you didn’t live dangerously from time
to time life would be so dull. I am there-
fore glad to see that you may continue
to expose the errors made by other pub-
lications. It’s also pleasing to see you
happily acknowledge those you make
yourselves (B, July 31). Keep up the
good work.
Incidentally, the photo on page 125
of the July 31 edition is upside-down. I
guess your “less numerate sub-editor” is
still having trouble with that old light-
box.

Sign background
The Australia Defence Association is
grateful for the small snippet of publi-
city (B, July 24) albeit it was a castiga-
tion of our syntax.
We could say that we used the singu-
lar verb to emphasise the unanimity of
the collective noun “people.” We could
say that we purposely made the gaffe to
ensure the signs’ newsworthiness
which it did. However, we must admit
that it was a “sign-o-graphic” error.
You omitted to mention the back-
ground to the erection of the signs. A
group of professional protesters had
arranged an anti-United States demon-
stration at the joint US/RAN com-
munications base at NW Cape. The
ADA decided to organise a counter
move, of which the signs were a minor
part, in conjunction with adjacent RSL
branches and most of the locals, who
understand the purpose of the facility
and support it unanimously.
Some radio, TV and press time was
to be hired and had we firmed on our
planning the group would have been de-
nied food and fuel from Carnarvon in

the event, the demonstration was called
off.
The ADA emphasises that it
vigorously supports multilateral dis-
armament but anti-United States
demonstrations are counter-productive.
They give heart to the Soviets.
Why should they return to the nego-
tiating table if the United States can be
unilaterally disarmed by Western bloc
public opinion?
Referring specifically to the Harold
E. Holt Base, protesters seem to ignore
the fact that it is a dual USN/RAN in-
stallation and is the only medium
through which the Royal Australian
Navy can communicate with its sub-
marines while submerged.

Congratulations to “Batman’s Mel-
bourne” (B, July 31) regarding The Aus-
tralian Pocket Oxford Dictionary.
You are quite correct regarding the
origin of Ocker (originally okker). In
the 1920 s and 30s the two most common
boy’s names were Oscar (Okker) and
Horace, which was either Horrie or
“Unfortunately, our country’s just gone over to Fundamental Islam.”
’Orrie, according to one’s social stand-
ing.
Can one ever forget Bancks’ original

vens as Ginger’s cobber?
But how could Batman have omitted
our most famous expression, Dinky di?

Historical perspective
In response to R. C. Slessor’s letter (B,
July 17) on the lack of metre and rhyme
in the poems published in The Bulletin’s
Literary Supplement, I would like to put
his comments in historical perspective.
The use of regular rhythm in poetry
was an ancient aid to memorising hu-
man history. With the invention of
writing and, more recently, electronic
recording of human knowledge, the aid
became irrelevant. Poets were freed to
use language in ways other than aiding
the minstrel’s memory. The restless
pacing of a tigress, the soft flutter of a
petal’s fall can all be echoed in the
words the poet uses.
If Slessor could overcome his condi-
tioning to a military metre perhaps he
too could hear the magic that moves the
English of these new poets.
With reference to rhyme, that is a
very recent invention one that raised
the ire of the Slessors of the time. John
Milton (1608-1674) was one of them. He
called it “The troublesome and modern
bondage of Rhyming.” (Preface to
Paradise Lost) John Dry den (1631-1700)
wasn’t too happy about it either. “Till
barbarous nations, and more barbarous
times, Debased the majesty of verse to
rhymes.” (To the Earl of Roscommon).
I feel for Slessor in that his in-
sensitivity deprives him of much enjoy-
ment. But, then, he is in good company
Geoffrey Dutton, I salute you! Thank
you for a great Literary Supplement.

Political pigeonholes
All the definitions being used to classify
persons political such as extreme left-
wing, right-wing, socialist left, centre
left are becoming übiquitous in the
press. Obviously, Liberal and Labor are
not definitive enough.
The plethora of definitions leaves
many of us languishing in a state of con-
fusion. Are we being swayed subtly by
an over-simplistic mode of thinking?
Do these definitions limit lateral think-
ing processes?

Rival 4 cylinder two litre engine at 2500 rpm.
A martini may be improved by being
shaken. But drivers and passengers
seldom are.
BMW insists on using six cylinders in
engines of 2 litres and over. But most
other luxury car makers still persist with
four or five cylinders, despite the laws of
physics which decree that engines of
less than six cylinders can never be
perfectly balanced.
A four cylinder engine will have up to
10 times more vibration than a six
cylinder engine. And a four cylinder car
engine can transmit three times more
vibrations to the passenger compartment.
In a BMW however, you will feel
fewer vibrations than if you were sitting
in an eight cylinder car.
To improve this smoothness even
further, each cylinder has its own
counterweight. Some other cars only
have one counterweight to balance
several cylinders.
When you drive the BMW 323 i for
example, you will be surprised at the
uncanny quiet but effortless acceler-
ation of its electronically fuel injected six.
And when you fill up with petrol you
will be pleasantly surprised at how
economical six cylinders can be, when
combined with energy-saving computer
electronics like a fuel cut-off system.
BMW believes that, if you are to
build the most sophisticated and refined
car in the world, the last place for
compromise is the engine. And if other
manufacturers are prepared to com-
promise on this the most important part
of the car, where will they stop 7

has been called a centralist and revered
jokingly as a good Liberal. If Opposi-
tion.leader Peacock is a small-L liberal
then should Bob be called a small-S so-
cialist?
Should we have included up-wing
and down-wing? This would have
facilitated a more definitive categorisa-
tion of most species who are theistic or
atheistic. For example, the theocratic
leader Ayatollah Khomeini could be de-
fined as up-wing fundamentalist centre
left. Fidel Castro and Konstantin
Chernenko would be down-wing ex-
treme left.
Seriously, this left/right categorising
in journalism has been growing steadily
in usage. If you plotted the number of
times that these adjectives have ap-
peared since, say, 1975 you would find
that the growth has been exponential.
The fact that the terminology has
gained in popularity indicates the need
for a definitive absolute. But this does
not give it credence. A left-wing/right-
wing categorisation does not preclude
inaccuracy and the lack of dialectical
depth.

Poor return
The Bulletin (July, 24), when talking
about fears of escalating health costs,
should look at the bureaucratic side of
the expenses. What business enterprise
would accept an $8 million investment
for a lousy $200,000 return and a few
convictions? This is the pitiful return
from the money spent in detecting fraud
and over-servicing.

Important message
In his article on how Indonesians see
Australia Professor Mackie (B, July 24)
says: “It must be stressed that what (In-
donesian) government officials say
about Australia and what the ordinary
people think may diverge consider-
ably.”
Swap Indonesian and Australia
around, add intellectuals and radicals to
government officials and you have an
important message for Indonesia.
BILL O’HALLO RAN
Kojonup WA
Congratulations
Professor Mackie’s article (B, July 24) is
the first objective article The Bulletin has
published in the 15 to 20 years I have
been a regular reader, taking it instead
of The Economist. Congratulations!
• Hope that publication of Mackie’s
studious paper represents a new depart-
ure in the presentation of events perti-
nent to Indonesia by The Bulletin.

If you'd like to know more about the way we make Jack Daniel's, drop us a line.
AGING JACK DANIEL’S WHISKEY calls for
hot summers, cold winters and a few men like
Lawrence Bums.
Summer’s heat causes our whiskey to
seep inside the barrel’s char. (Here’s
where it gains body and color.) Our cold
winter air brings it back out. And
barrelmen like Bums keep track of this
gende activity year after year after
year. For a whiskey, there’s no
better resting place than a Jack
Daniel’s warehouse. And from the
looks of Mr. Bums, there’s nothing
wrong with it for a man.

without having to break
your journey with an en
route stopover which other
airlines demand.
On Sundays, a flight
will depart Melbourne, then
fly direct from Sydney to
Beijing (Peking).
On Thursdays, there
will be a direct flight going
from Sydney to Guangzhou
(Canton), which will then fly
on to Beijing.

Hawke to PNG
PRIME MINISTER Bob
Hawke left for the three-day
Commonwealth Heads of
Government Regional Meet-
ing in Port Moresby. Eighteen
countries including the host,
Papua New Guinea, and Aus-
tralia, India, Bangladesh,
New Zealand, Malaysia and
Singapore attended.
Jobs decision
THE Australian Conciliation
and Arbitration Commission
decided that wage and salary
earners who lost their jobs
would be entitled to more
favorable severence settle-
ments: up to eight weeks’ pay
after four years of service; one
week plus one week for each
year of service as notice of ter-
mination; early notification of
industry changes; and paid
time off to look for another
job.

Anti-nuke party
NOBEL PRIZE winner
Patrick White announced in a
lecture at Latrobe University
that he was helping to estab-
lish a new anti-uranium Nu-
clear Disarmament Party. He
attacked Prime Minister Bob
Hawke for supporting pro-
uranium policies.
New commissioner
NSW got a new police com-
missioner: John Avery, 57, the
former assistant commission-
er, personnel. He holds an
MA degree and is author of
the book Police Force or
Service?
Taking credit
THE ALP’s Centre Left fac-
tion issued a report claiming it
had played a decisive role at
the ALP National Confer-
ence. The faction, said the re-
port, had taken a middle
course between “sterile ideo-
logical posturing” and “shal-
low opportunism.” This had
led to important, realistic de-
cisions such as placing greater
emphasis on redistribution of
incomes and the rehabilita-
tion of David Combe.
Population boost
THE Bureau of Statistics re-
ported that Australia’s popu-
lation had reached 15.45 mil-
lion. During 1983 the popula-
tion grew by 175,000 (1.1 per-
cent), including 42,000 immi-
grants. Last year 110,200
people died and 242,700
babies were born. Life expect-
ancy for women rose to 78.72
years compared with 70.63
years in 1947 and for men to
72.13 years from 66.07 years.
Petrov man dies
MICHAEL BIAGOLUSKI,
67, a medical practitioner who
had a major role in the Petrov
Affair 30 years ago, died in
England from cancer. In
1954, as an agent of the Aus-
tralian intelligence service,
Biagoluski played an import-
ant part in the defection of
two members of the Soviet
embassy staff in Canberra:
Third Secretary and Consul
Vladimir Petrov and his wife,
Evdokia. They were promi-
nent figures in the ensuing
royal commission.
‘Killer’ freed
EDWARD SPLATT, 60, serv-
ing a life sentence for the mur-
der of Rosa Amelie Simper,
77, in Adelaide in 1977, was
released from Adelaide Jail
after a royal commission rec-
ommended he should be freed
“forthwith.” Splatt had main-
tained his innocence after be-
ing convicted on scientific evi-
dence.

UPI
THE WORLD
Richard Burton with his fifth wife, Sally Hayes
Peres PM-designate
ISRAEL’S President Herzog
has nominated the Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres as
the country’s prime minister
designate. Peres said he would
try to form “a coalition of
wide shoulders that can carry
a heavy burden.” He in-
dicated that such a coalition
could include the outgoing
government party, Likud,
“because if you go for unity,
go for unity and don’t take it
halfway.”
Burton dead
BRITISH stage and screen
star Richard Burton died of a
cerebral haemorrhage at his
home near Geneva, Switzer-
land. The five-times married
actor (twice to Liz Taylor) was
58.
Red Sea mines
AT LEAST nine merchant
ships have touched off explo-
sions in the Gulf of Suez and
the Red Sea since July 27,
Lloyds of London reported.
The Liberian-registered tank-
er Oceanic Energy (87,200
tonnes) was the latest victim.
She was sinking after striking
a mine between Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, and Hodeida, North
Yemen, during the weekend.
A group calling itself the
Jihad Organisation claimed it
had planted 190 mines in the
Gulf of Suez and the Bab el-
Mandeb Strait linking the
Red Sea and the Indian
Ocean to “punish imperial-
ism.”
Diplomatic cut
SOUTH AFRICA severed
diplomatic relations with
New Zealand after its new
Prime Minister, David Lange,
said in a television interview
that the South African consul


ate-general in Wellington
would be closed and that the
closure was not negotiable.
Pretoria ordered its five diplo-
mats from the mission to re-
turn home. Lange said the clo-
sure would open up the larger
trade of the African continent
to New Zealand and would
not affect current trade with
South Africa adversely.

IN A further deregulatory
step the Reserve Bank an-
nounced that trading banks
would be permitted full own-

Pretenders to Job’s
throne in open warfare
Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, 73, appears determined to stay in office until 1988
but two contenders for his job already are jockeying for position. A leaked report on
the State’s economy has, says DENNIS REINHARDT, highlighted their rivalry.
THE LEAKING of a departmental re-
port adversely assessing the Queensland
economy has highlighted the heated ri-
valry between the two leading contend-
ers for the premier’s office, should Sir
Johannes Bjelke-Petersen depart.
Queensland’s Deputy Premier, Bill
Gunn, who is effectively State treasurer
(although Bjelke-Petersen formally
holds the post), has used the leaking of
the report, prepared by a small econ-
omics cell in the Department of Com-
mercial and Industrial Development to
lambast the responsible minister, Mike
Ahern in front of his cabinet peers.
During two regular Monday cabinet
sessions last month Gunn attempted to
force acknowledgements of political in-
discretion from Ahern, and agreement
that Ahern’s economic advisers would
submit to Gunn’s departmental auth-
ority. Ahern and his party-room con-
fidantes maintain that no ground has
been given to Gunn. The cabinet
struggle clearly indicates that both men
are closely monitoring Bjelke-Petersen’s
health and his stated determination to
stay in office until the bicentenary, when
he will be 77. He would also be celebrat-
ing a record 20 years as premier.
In remarkably frank interviews with
The Bulletin, both men have revealed
their glaring differences in style, their
determination to win power and the
brittle nature of their cabinet co-oper-
ation.
Gunn, 64, a Lockyer Valley farmer in
the mould of Bjelke-Petersen, likes to
regard Ahern as lacking fire in the belly.
“It’s not the dog in the fight, but the
fight in the dog,” he remarked after the
scrap on Monday of last week, which,
he says, saw an apology to the Queens-
land cabinet from Ahern.
“That’s crazy,” Ahern told The Bul-
letin. “To say that I was in trouble in
cabinet is a nonsense. It doesn’t re-
quire a report from my department to
say that something is wrong with the
economy and besides there’s no way I
apologised.”
Gunn’s cabinet supporters maintain
he forced Ahern to withdraw the report.
Queensland’s deputy premier, Bill Gunn: he’s no Joh clone, he says
TOOWOOMBA CHRONICLE


Gunn said: “I did bring it up again last
Monday. I said, ‘This is no good. They
haven’t been to us.’ I attacked it again
and the cabinet backed me. The point
that I won was that before any reports
can ever get out they must go through
here and we will have a look at them
and we can give the latest figures on all
occasions, so I was given that assurance
for the future (by Ahern).”
Ahern vigorously disputes this.
The leaked report covers the ills of
Queensland’s metal manufacturing sec-
tor. Any internal criticism of Queens-
land’s economic growth does not re-
ceive a popular reception in govern-
ment circles because it goes against the
image of the state as a fast-growing
economic paradise.
Ahern, 42, an agricultural scientist,
defending the report, said: “It’s similar
throughout Australia but we have fur-
ther problems because of the slow-down
in coal mine construction. There’s no
secret about it.”
A further problem for the Queens-
land economy, argued Ahern, was the
plight of the sugar industry and its 30
mills. “You can’t go up the coast and
tell them everything is rosy. They’ll run
any cabinet minister out of town who
tries to tell them that.”
Ahern’s officials deny vehemently
that they were responsible for the leak,
which led to niggling opposition ques-
tions on the eve of last Saturday’s
Stafford by-election. The first draft of
the report came to cabinet a fortnight
ago. Gunn had it thrown out.
Ahern says: “There was just a dis-
cussion that these prophecies might
be self-fulfilling. I stand by the state-
ments I made.” Ahern’s position is bol-
stered by the confidential quarterly
treasury report to the Queensland cabi-
net dated June 4 for the March quarter.
While suggesting that the traditional re-
source and agricultural economic sec-
tors were in good shape (apart from
sugar) the report, under the premier’s
name, noted that for heavy engineering,
“long run prospects remain unfavor-
able.” The report continued: “Foun-
dries continued their poor performance
with most companies working below 50
percent capacity. Retrenchments are
continuing.”
To The Bulletin , Gunn acknowl-
edged the difficulties of Queensland’s
engineering sector: “That’s why we’ve
just brought forward the $6OO million
central Queensland rail electrification.”
The essence of the wrangle is two
competing styles. ‘Some people see me
as a Joh clone ... I’m not,” says Gunn,
who beat Ahern narrowly for the deputy
leadership. He adds: “I’m here to sup-
port the Premier. We work very well
together and I think being very close to
him would have to be a plus. He’s very
happy with my work there’s no hie-

Paddington Bear
Affair wounds
govt - slightly
THE PADDINGTON Bear Affair has
cost the Hawke Government an appar-
ent 2 percent in support, according to
the latest Morgan Gallup Poll. The poll
showed that on the weekend of July
28/29, the week after Special Minister
of State Mick Young stood aside as a
minister, support for the government
was 50 percent. In contrast, support on
the previous weekend was 52 percent.
However, had federal elections been
held at the end of July, the government
would have been returned with the same
majority. In the Senate it would have
received 48 percent of the vote which
would have left the Democrats holding
the balance of power.
The poll also showed that the ap-
proval rating of Prime Minister Bob
Hawke fell by 3 percent to 68 percent.
The approval rating of Opposition
Leader Andrew Peacock rose 1 percent
to 37 percent.

Ahern won’t be drawn on whether, if
the departure of the Queensland Prem-

have the numbers. Gunn maintains he

“They don’t want anything like that

THE BUDGET
How big a tax
cut - and
for whom?
By RICHARD FARMER
A STORY told often by Prime Minister
Bob Hawke’s principal political adviser,
Peter Barron, well illustrates the budget
and election strategy being followed by
the federal government.
Barron, when political correspon-
dent for the afternoon Sydney tabloid
the Daily Mirror, was rung by an agi-
tated editor complaining that the oppo-
sition Sun had a poster proclaiming that
tax cuts were on the way. Barron was
told to write a similar story for
his paper’s next edition. When
he demurred on the grounds
that he didn’t know whether it
was going to happen, Barron
was reminded sharply that
posters about tax cuts sold
papers.
He has not had to be told
again. Both as a journalist and
subsequently as a tactician for
NSW Premier Neville Wran
and Hawke, Barron regularly
has trotted out the attraction
of a tax cut. It was so during
Hawke’s election campaign
last year. It is so again this
month as the federal cabinet
puts the finishing touches to
the second Hawke budget.
The tax cuts to be offered
are not simply a way of buy-
ing trade union support to
keep the prices and incomes
accord in place. They are an-
other example of the tried and
true formula which buys votes
as well as sells newspapers.
Within the Labor Party
ranks there has been much
muttering about tax cuts being
extended into the ranks of
middle to upper income earn-
ers. The argument from the
left is that the Labor govern-
ment should be concentrating
the relief on those who need it
most. The ACTU with a mind
to its expanding white-collar
membership, wants the ben-
efits taken well up the tax scale. So does
Barron for the sound political reason
that Labor must keep the support of the
middle classes to retain office.
If that means there is less scope for
Finance Minister Dawkins: a million here, $100,000 there chopped
Treasurer Keating: did not have to say no
increased welfare benefits for the needy,
then so be it. A pre-election budget is
not the one for a Labor government to
be true to its redistributive principles.
Not that this year’s budget will be
too blatant an attempt to secure a sec-
ond term in office. The importance at-
tached to tax cuts has created consider-
able difficulties on the expenditure side.
Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating
believe it is important psychologically
for the business community that the
deficit for this financial year be as pre-
dicted less than $7 billion. Anything
above that figure would create the possi-
bility of the government being painted
as fiscally irresponsible. Such a charge
might lose as many votes from fright-
ened people as the tax cuts attract.
Containing spending to this level has
not proved easy. The simple expendi-
ture cuts were made last May and
August. With no new taxes possible,
again for electoral reasons, cabinet in
the past few weeks has had to make
some difficult choices. The result in
many ways is that the budget unfolded
on Tuesday, August 21, will be as much
Finance Minister John Dawkins’ work
as Keating’s.
Cutting spending this year, with no

more large Liberal schemes to axe or tax
avoidance loopholes to close, has had to
be on a line-by-line basis. Dawkins has
examined every item on departmental
estimates. Numerous ministers have
complained about the treatment they
have received as $1 million got lopped
here and $lOO,OOO or so there.
The hope within the government is
that most people will see themselves as
winners from the budget because of the
tax cuts that the government will say
were possible only because there were
losers on the expenditure side. The art
of this budget is to create more winners
than losers.
In a more limited sense, Dawkins
will be hoping for something similar in
the response of his parliamentary col-
leagues to the budget outcome. Dawkins
is ambitious and it is one of the ironies
of political life that his main rival in the
ALP is Keating.
With Mick Young out of contention
because of the shadow of Paddington
Bear, Dawkins is likely to be the Centre
Left’s candidate for deputy leader when
a ballot is held. Keating covets the job
as well and will be the Right’s choice to
replace Trade Minister Lionel Bowen as
the government’s number two man.
The Treasurer and his Finance Min-
ister have, from all reports, worked well
enough together on the expenditure-cut-
ting exercise. But it is a bonus for
Keating’s future ambitions that he has
not had to be the person to say no to
spending plans. Dawkins has carried
most of that task in the round of minis-
terial meetings. The hope for Dawkins
is that a good overall reception of the
budget will see his caucus colleagues
give him grudging approval for a thank-
less job.
Sitting in the wings during much of
the budget cabinet meetings has been
Employment and Industrial Relations
Minister Ralph Willis, who some caucus
members are suggesting might make a
better deputy than Keating or Dawkins.
Willis has been a consistent advocate of
greater government spending. This cer-
tainly makes him more acceptable to the
Left than the other two and his quiet,
somewhat unassuming manner earns
friends in politics, not enemies.
Because of Willis’s modesty, it is also
easy to overlook the vital role he has
played in making a success of the ac-
cord with the trade union movement. It
was his quiet but firm negotiation, for
example, that resulted in a wage rise
granted to glaziers earlier this year be-
ing withdrawn. That was surely a first in
Australian industrial relations and, if it
has escaped the attention of most of the
public, it has been noticed by many in
the Labor Party.
When the feuding between the Right
and the Centre Left reaches its peak
after the election, Willis could well be
an acceptable compromise. He is not
aligned clearly with any faction, al-
though Hawke normally can rely on his
support on most matters.
Underlying all the manoeuvring in
the Labor Party at the moment is an at-
tempt by the Centre Left faction to en-
sure that after the election it does not
lose representation in the cabinet. It is
the smallest factional bloc with 24 mem-
bers out of 105, compared with the
Right’s 40 and the Left’s 35. But it and
the Independent group from Victoria
hold six of the 14 cabinet posts and 10
of the 27 in the ministry as a whole.
The Right is unhappy with the way
the Centre Left has been trying to take
all the credit for decisions made at the
federal conference which saw the Left
Ralph Willis: a quiet candidate for the deputy leadership
defeated so soundly. It is possible that
the caucus meeting after an early elec-
tion would see some of the Centre Left
ministers deposed because those minis-
ters were elected originally with the
Right’s support.
Next time, an alliance between Right
and Left is just as likely as one between
Right and Centre Left or Centre Left
and the Left. □
ABORIGINES
New delays for
Federal land
rights legislation
By ANTHONY HILL
AMENDMENTS to the Northern Ter-
ritory Land Rights Act now are unlikely
to go before parliament this year. With
Canberra under pressure from states,
industry and Aboriginal groups, the
proposed uniform land rights law will
not be introduced until at least April
after the next general election.
Aboriginal Affairs Minister Clyde
Holding is under further attack in one
case from the Labor state of Western
Australia with the first declarations
sought under the interim Heritage Act
covering sacred sites. The Act, which
has a “sunset clause” of two years, is to
be taken up by the uniform law.
Holding faces problems, too, in try-
ing to mesh the uniform legislation with
state laws which in some cases even
conflict. Premier Brian Burke has hinted
strongly that any Bill which emerges
from WA’s Seaman inquiry won’t go as
far as the Northern Territory Act does.
The land rights report by Paul Sea-
man, QC, is not due until mid-Sep-
tember and it is seen as crucial to the
direction the uniform law takes. One of
the key issues is expected to be the ex-
tent to which it proposes qualifications
on powers by traditional owners to veto
exploration and mining.
Despite attempts to picture him as
inflexible on the issue, Holding has
shown a willingness to compromise. He
has acknowledged weaknesses in the
NT Act. A further chance for a little
political horse-trading will come on
August 20 when he meets NT Chief
Minister Paul Everingham on the ques-
tion of pastoral leases.
At stake are a parcel of claims to
stock routes and reserves in the Terri-
tory and attempts by the Common-
wealth to have Everingham legislate to
allow excision of living areas for Abor-
iginals on pastoral leases.
The deal is straight forward enough.


Holding believes that pastoralists have
been reasonable and has told the North-
ern Territory land councils to lift stock
route claims otherwise, he would do it
for them either by legislation or minis-
terial fiat. In return, he wants
Everingham to have the Living Areas
bill passed and to discuss a related
Vesting of Lands bill as a separate issue.
The second Bill declares a large
number of areas, including stock routes
and water conservation reserves, to be
public purpose lands not subject to land
rights claims. It is an important issue for
the territory where up to 50 percent of
the land could be subject to claim.
“I must admit to having a certain affinity
with No 36 Acacia Avenue.”
Everingham has made one Bill de-
pendent on the other. Whether the quid
pro quo will come off is anybody’s guess
but at least the manoeuvrings over pas-
toral excisions highlight some of the
realities behind the land rights debate.
Shrill appeals to fear, prejudice and
guilt still grab headlines but the resol-
ution will depend upon compromise
and the political balance of one interest
against another.
Aboriginals, too, have learned to ma-
nipulate the levers of power hence
claims over stock routes and, one sus-
pects, the more hysterical reactions of
white opponents.
Holding has been receiving reports
from a steering committee outlining
proposals from Aboriginal interest
groups. He has started discussions with
the mining and pastoral industries and
representatives of miners and Aborigi-
nals met in Melbourne last month and
agreed to establish a working group to
look at the Northern Territory Act. This
has been one of the few attempts to get
the two sides talking in an organised
political sense and, surprisingly, they es-
tablished a good deal of common
ground.
The chairman of the Northern Land
Council, Galarrwui Yunupingu, took
the opportunity to castigate the ALP
ban on uranium mining at Jabiluka and
Koongarra. He argued that royalty
equivalent payments have been lost for
housing, education and other welfare
spending on Northern Territory Abor-
iginals.
A document prepared by the North-
ern Territory government
blamed administrative com-
plexities and problems of
identifying traditional owners
as the main reasons for delays
and uncertainties in mining. It
quoted a survey which
showed that 14 exploration
companies were planning to
cut back activities or with-
draw altogether.
Land councils reject at-
tempts to lay the blame for the
delays entirely on their
shoulders. They cite a nine-
year “freeze” imposed by the
Whitlam and Fraser govern-
ments and falling commodity
prices. But they do admit to a
lack of staff and resources to
handle the estimated 180 ex-
ploration licence applications
offered when the “freeze” was
lifted in 1981. This will have
to be among the problems ad-
dressed in the amendments.
Holding, meanwhile, is plan-
ning to reduce delays in pro-
cessing land claims by ap-
pointing a second land com-
missioner for the territory.
In Perth, Opposition Leader Andrew
Peacock committed Liberal-National
Party government in Canberra to repeal
any uniform land rights legislation. He
hinted strongly that the policy platform,
to be released this year, would curtail
Aboriginal powers of veto over access
for exploration and mining.
Powers of veto are central to the land
rights debate. But federally, the tra-
ditional land owners have never
exercised their veto. They say this shows
that they do not oppose mining, even
though the industry says the mere exist-
ence of such powers leads to uncertainty
and delay.
Holding’s problem is to balance
pressure to qualify the veto against the
argument that to remove it would make
the concept of land rights virtually
meaningless. In any case, it is written
into the ALP platform and the right can
only be overruled in the “national inter-
est” by legislation. □
TOURISM
Club Med out
to shed its
Ocker image
By SHELLEY NELLER
CLUB Mediterranee wants to bury its
Australian image as a swinging singles
holiday destination and is preparing to
launch a new upmarket advertising
campaign. Managing director of Club
Med in Australia, Alan Bahuet, says
the group will spend around $1.3 mil-
lion “to revamp our image and to im-
prove the distribution of our product.”
One of the main reasons the organ-
isation decided to change its marketing
approach was that the advertising for
Club Med, Noumea (which emphasised
the budget price of the holiday) at-
tracted an “Ocker-type” of clientele.
Future marketing will emphasise the
clubs in Europe, the Caribbean and
Mexico, as well as the nearer ones in
Tahiti, Malaysia and Noumea.
In 1982-83 the parent company’s net
income rose by 22.3 percent and operat-
ing profit by 11.6 percent, a perform-
ance which the annual report describes
as “satisfactory ... albeit less outstand-
ing than in the past.” But bookings in
Australia for the Asian, Indian Ocean
and Pacific area fell 13.6 percent.
Bahuet believes that, given Austra-
lians’ well-established penchant for for-
eign travel, there is no reason why every
Club Meb could not be “a perfect port
of call.” But he admits that the club
wants to attract a particular type of Aus-
tralian. “We would like to attract the
experienced travellers because the more
their experience, the more benefits they
will find in our concept,” he says.
Simultaneously, Bahuet announced
that the Australian advertising agency
Monahan, Dayman Adams had been
appointed to handle the Club Med ac-
count. Previously held by J. Walter
Thompson, the account is said to be a
difficult one to handle.
Although Bahuet prefers to forget
about it, he concedes that a Mike
Willesee television program on Club
Med, Noumea, a year ago, which por-
trayed the club as a vulgar, Ockerish
scene for working class singles did
nothing to improve the image of any of
the clubs. He says: “We are now begin-
ning work to improve materially and
spiritually Chateau Royale in Noumea
so that the image of this village will be
in accordance with our image elsewhere
in the world.
“In Europe, our clientele is middle to
upper-middle class and we are over-rep-
resented in the professions doctors,

academics and so on because Club
Med is, after all, a sophisticated con-
cept for educated people.”
The Club Med concept, says Bahuet,
takes for granted that its members
(guests) are adult-minded and know
“how to use liberty and permissivity
(sic) and not to go too far.”
“Sometimes we have guests who are
not used to liberty and it’s a shock for
them and they don’t know how to be-
have. But we are reluctant to set rules.
So, unfortunately, permissivity can turn
to licence.”
In an effort to gear their new adver-
tising campaign to attract the right cli-
entele, Club Med has spent a year on
international research. “We want to
project a different image, particularly
on TV,” says Bahuet. “We are not a
supermarket. We will not talk about
prices. We are selling more a concept.
Quality and happiness cannot be dis-
counted.”
During the next 20 years, the organ-
isation plans to open between four and
five new clubs a year. Two clubs are be-
ing built reasonably close to Australia
one in Phuket, Thailand, and one in
Nusa Dua, Bali. These are expected to
open in early 1986. The club at Moorea,
closed for reconstruction in the style of
a Gauguin village, will reopen next
March. □
CENSORSHIP
Probe likely
into effects of
‘video nasties’
By ANTHONY HILL
FEDERAL parliament is likely to set up
an inquiry during the budget session
into the effects on children of violent or
pornographic video tapes.
Moves for a joint select committee
have been held in abeyance over the
winter recess but Attorney-General
Gareth Evans will take the proposal to
cabinet soon. Evans accepts the need to
monitor the impact of X-rated videos
on children although he is sceptical that
parliament is the best place to do it.
Even if cabinet decides against a
joint committee, a select committee will
probably be established in the Senate.
The issue has been gathering politi-
cal momentum with the visit to Austra-
lia over the past fortnight of British
morals campaigner Mary Whitehouse
and claims of growing evidence that
sadistic videos are having a disturbing
effect on young children.
With Britain closed to the so-called
“video nasties” following the Video Re-
cordings Act, there are fears that US
distributors will turn increasingly to the
lucrative Australian market with its
much easier conditions of entry and
classification.
Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock
has taken up the point in a standard
letter sent to people who write into his
office about pornography. It says:
“There is now a considerable amount of
research which suggests that such ma-
terial may have harmful effects on some
viewers and that it encourages people to
take a degraded view of others. There is
mounting evidence from law authorities
that the pornography industry is used as
an outlet for the activities of organised
crime.”
The campaign, which will intensify
during the run-up to the election, is in
contrast to the government’s view that
adults should be able to see and read
what they choose, free of most censor-
ship constraints.
British barrister John Smyth, QC,
who helped to draft the key clause of the
UK Act, says Australian law is now the
reverse of Britain’s. There, no video can
get a classification certificate unless it is
suitable “for viewing in the home.”
Fines range up to $30,000.
But under the Australian draft uni-
form system, the strongest X-rated

Elasta frames by Safilo,
arguably the most com-
fortable and safest

Visiting British campaigner Mary Whitehouse: says videos can disturb children
videos can be shown only in the home.
Despite the best intentions of parents,
Smyth says, children cannot be pre-
vented from seeing the material.
Smyth, who describes himself as a
“committed Christian,” came to Austra-
lia with Whitehouse. He failed to see
Evans but spent some time discussing
the issues with the Attorney-General’s
Department in Canberra. He says it has
received “piles of letters from the pub-
lic” expressing concern about obscene
videos available in Australia.
Smyth said: “It’s no longer a ques-
tion of imposing taste. I believe it is a
different ball game because of the real
evidence of harm to children.”
Smyth is not alone in his concerns.
State and federal ministers meeting
earlier this year expressed alarm at the
extreme violence appearing in videos
and called on the Film Censorship
Board to give greater emphasis to the
distinction between R and X-rated ma-
terial.
While all states have agreed to the
uniform compulsory classification sys-
tem, it has been introduced only in the
ACT and South Australia. Interim legis-
lation is in force in Victoria and West-
ern Australia and it is pending in Tas-
mania, the Northern Territory and
Queensland. So far, little has happened
in New South Wales.
The uniform legislation refuses
classification for child pornography,
bestiality, explicit or gratuitous cruelty,
terrorist “manuals” and the abuse of
hard drugs.
But with advances in video technol-
ogy, the opposition is calling for a re-
view of the whole classification system.
This is likely to be one of the main ques-
tions facing the parliamentary commit-
tee. □
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
Everingham
moves in
on casinos
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
IF A POSITIVE commitment to private
enterprise is a prerequisite to lead Aus-
tralia’s conservative parties after the
next federal election, the aspiring Paul
Everingham seems set to do himself
considerable damage.
The Northern Territory Chief Min-
ister and Tourism Minister is pursuing
an ambitious plan to buy out the Terri-
tory casino interests of Federal Hotels
Ltd which owns and runs the Darwin
and Alice Springs casinos. At a news
conference in April, Everingham had
Federal executives on the platform with
him to give the impression that the Aus-
tralian-owned company was prepared
to sell out. But what most of the nation-
al financial media assumed to be a fait
accompli is far from decided. Federal
said last week it doesn’t want to sell.
The deal which Everingham pre-
sented in April was that Federal would
sell out to a consortium organised by a
local company, Henry and Walker Ltd,
which would put the casinos with
neighboring properties with condo-
minimum potential into a local trust.
Also participating is the government-
owned and ambitious Northern Terri-
tory Development Corporation.
Together they plan a trust in which the
government would hold 51 percent and
the public (with preference to NT resi-
dents) 49.
Federal, Australia’s pioneer casino
operator with Hobart’s Wrest Point and
Launceston’s Country Club, would be
retained as a consultant for 12 months.
While the casinos were being built,
Everingham and his ministers laid em-
phasis on the South-East Asian gam-
blers who would flock to Darwin to hit
the tables.
The NT government even tried to in-
vite foreign airlines to bring them: a
move outside its powers.
Although Qantas and two Asian Air-
lines have expanded services through
Darwin, the three or four flights a week
to overseas destinations hardly open the
floodgates to the predicted demand
among Asians who can exercise their
gambling passions elsewhere in the re-
gion.
A spokesman for Everingham said
last week that the move to acquire the
Federal interests, which originally were
allotted on a 15-year exclusive fran-
chise, was an “essential” part of
Everingham’s $2OO million tourist de-
velopment plan.
Press secretary Peter Murphy said
Everingham was in Queensland.
Consequently he could not comment
on whether the takeover might be inter-
preted as showing the NT as not a good
government with which’to do business.
Federal’s managing director John
Haddad said: “The whole scheme is ab-
solutely crazy. It is exposing the govern-
ment to finding about $5O or 60 million
where at the moment its risk is zilch.
“You can’t, however, argue against a
government that wants to do this sort of
thing. But I do know we are not willing
sellers until we get a price that’s accept-
able. And we want to be properly com-
pensated for the time and effort we’ve
put into pioneering these operations.”
At the beginning of this year, the
financial community believed that
Everingham had Haddad and his chair-
man Greg Farrell over a financial bar-
rel. Federal’s previous year’s loss, at-
tributed largely to the interest it had
been paying in its ambitious expansion
program, was $3.4 million.
In the 1983-84 year to March 31 (and
only days before the Everingham
swoop), the loss had come down to
$19,000.
Since then, Haddad says, the group
has been trading profitably with a cash
flow of about $1 million a day.
Tasmania’s Liberal Premier Robin
Gray, made clear in Hobart last week
that he proposed spending $6 million of
“Bob Hawke’s dam compensation
money” to extend Hobart airport to
take bigger aircraft to step up tourism.
Tourism industry figures meeting in
Hobart suggested that Everingham look
at Gray’s policy and put his money into
improving facilities rather than trying to
grab the golden goose. □

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Bosses shocked
by decision
on job security
By DEBORAH HOPE
A FUNDAMENTAL change in em-
ployer thinking will be necessary fol-
lowing last week’s decision by the Arbi-
tration Commission on the ACTU’s
claim for greater job security for
workers. The new rules laid down could
be costly to employers forced to sack
workers because of financial troubles or
technological change.
The decision, by a full bench of the
commission chaired by president Sir
John Moore, sets new minimum redun-
dancy conditions for the more than
2 million Australians employed under
federal awards and breaks new ground
nationally on the amount of notice em-
ployees are to be given.
For the first time it puts an obligation
on employers to consult employees
about changes in the workplace that are
likely to lead to retrenchments and to
provide written material for all em-
ployees to explain the changes.
The severance pay provisions for
employees under federal awards are
certain to flow on to workers under state
awards. The new redundancy deal will
apply to all retrenchments, whether they
are due to company financial problems
or technological change. The commis-
sion’s decision in the termination,
change and redundancy case is its most
significant recently on work conditions.
While the ACTU is jubilant at its vic-
tory, which comes after nearly three
years of deliberations, employers are
shocked at the prospect of increased
labor costs and the loss of the mana-
gerial prerogative to hire and fire.
The decision for the first time pro-
hibits employers from dismissing em-
ployees under federal awards for any
reason that can be deemed by the com-
mission to be “harsh, unjust or un-
reasonable.” Only South Australia pro-
vides such a prohibition in its state
awards.
Employers will be obliged to assist
workers who are to be retrenched by al-
lowing them paid time off work to look
for new jobs. In addition, new pro-
visions of notice will apply to em-
ployees who are being moved to lower-
paid jobs because their original pos-
itions have become redundant.
The outcome of the case has been
condemned universally by employers
around Australia. According to Brian
Noakes, director-general of the Confed-
eration of Australian Industry, it is a

severe blow for industry at
a time when it is attempt-
ing to take advantage of
the economic recovery.
The new obligations on
employers, Noakes says,
will inhibit changes aimed
at improving efficiency and
will discourage employers
from taking on workers.
“The decision will dim-
inish the ability of em-
ployers to remain competi-
tive and will inhibit the
creation of new employ-
ment opportunities,”
Noakes said.
Bert Evans, the executive director of
the Metal Trades Industry Association,
described the decision as a “job de-
stroyer.” According to Evans, the re-
sponsibility for employees made redun-
dant especially through company
financial hardship should be should-
ered by the government.
Other employers went further, saying
that the costs as a result of the decision
would force more manufacturers to turn
to relocation in South-East Asia rather
than staying in Australia and watching
their competitiveness diminish.
The outcry about the costs is despite
the full bench’s finding that the new re-
quirements would mean “a very small
Sir John Moore
addition to overall labor
costs.”
According to ACTU
reckoning, accepted in evi-
dence by the commission,
the only new cost to em-
ployers will be the stan-
dard of eight weeks sever-
ance pay for employees
with more than four years
service. This cost, accord-
ing to ACTU estimates,
will be about $lOO million
a year on top of existing
labor costs about 0.12
percent more.
This figure, says ACTU legal officer
Alan Boulton, is based on retrenchment
figures for 1982, when unemployment
was at its highest since the 1930 s and the
economy deep in recession. Boulton ex-
cludes payment in lieu of notice arguing
that employers can expect productive
service before a job terminates.
He also argues that the figure is
based on those made redundant being
eligible for maximum severance pay. He
says this would not necessarily be the
case, given the golden rule of “last on,
first off.”
Employers dispute both these points,
saying that in most cases where an em-
ployee has been notified that his job is
to be terminated productivity plummets
and on-the-job tension rises, making a
payment in lieu of notice the more at-
tractive alternative.
Since the new standard provides for
a maximum of six weeks notice, com-
pared to the present standard set in the
1920 s of one week, employers argue that
they will have to prepare for this con-
siderable extra cost in addition to any
other payments due.
On the basis of Bureau of Statistics
figures showing that nearly 50 percent
of people terminating employment have
been employed for four years or more,
employers say the “last on, first off’ rule
offers little hope for relief.
While the real costs to employers are
almost impossible to ascertain, the Em-
ployers Federation of NSW and the
MTIA have provided examples of how
hard the costs could hit.
Federation spokesman Gary Brack
said that an employer retrenching 100
men on the basis of average age distri-
bution and length of service could face
an additional $205,000.
The MTIA’s Roger Boland used the
example of a small metal employer with
10 workers who had to close his shop
due to financial hardship. Presuming
that all employees averaged five years
service and earned $320 a week, Boland
estimated the additional cost to the em-
ployer would be $25,000. □

HISTORY
The search for our Pandora’s Box
By DENIS REINHARDT
UNDERWATER recovery work will
begin soon on one of Australia’s great
archaeological treasures: the wreck of
HMS Pandora, on reefs at the eastern
mouth of Torres Strait.
Pandora, its coppered hull torn by
Barrier Reef coral in 1791, is not only a
record of 18th century naval life but
also a critical link in one of the great
phases of European Pacific exploration.
The fate of Pandora entwines with
the lives of Captain James Cook, the
great French explorer Jean La Perouse
(himself to vanish mysteriously in the
Pacific) and Captain William Bligh and
the Bounty mutineers. It also has a
tragic connection with convict escapees
from Arthur Philip’s Sydney, settled
only three years before.
Almost every Australian knows at
least a little of Bligh’s epic journey from
Polynesia to Timor after being cast
adrift by Fletcher Christian in a 7m
open boat with 18 loyal sailors. Few re-
alise that Bligh’s epic was one of several
equally courageous adventures sur-
rounding the fate of Pandora.
The wreck of Pandora was located
less than seven years ago by divers Ben
Cropp and Steven Domm aided by
magnetometer readings taken by an
RAAF Neptune.
In 1979 a Commonwealth Govern-
ment diving mission of marine archae-
ologists from the West Australian Mu-
seum was able to identify the wreck
one of an estimated 2000 off
the Queensland coast as
HMS Pandora, of 24 guns.
However, it was not until
last year that the Queensland
Museum was able to mount
an expedition to peg a survey
grid over the hull, one-third of
which remains intact below
the sand.
Laying down the grid re-
vealed treasures that con-
vinced Queensland Museum
maritime archaeology curator,
Ron Coleman, that Pandora
ranks with the recently-raised
Tudor man-o-war, Mary Rose,
and the Scandinavian treasure
ship Vasa.
Coleman admits to being
obsessed with raising Pandora
from the seabed. He has sup-
port from Margaret Rule, a
driving force behind the Mary
Rose recovery, who describes
the Pandora project as “one of
Marine archaeologists excavating an earthenware jar from the wreck of Pandora
Photographs QUEENSLAND MUSEUM
the most important underwater excava-
tions proposed anywhere in the world.”
Coleman, a Kansas fine arts graduate
who took up marine archaeology after
service as a US Navy submariner, is
planning a 51-day expedition to Pan-
dora starting on October 31. Working
from a pigeonhole space in a demount-
able shed set on the museum’s meagre
rear lawn, Coleman is gathering federal
and corporate support for the $lBO,OOO
expedition.
A sketch of Pandora sinking, by a Bounty midshipman
“We can do it on $BO,OOO if we have
to,” he says hopefully.
Last year’s expedition located seven
of the ship’s cannons and divers
stumbled across the kit of ship’s surgeon
George Hamilton, who had been forced
to leap over the side of Pandora on
August 29, 1791, and swim for his life.
Intact bottles of mercury and cyanide-
derived solutions were discovered, as
well as officers’ lice-combs, spice bottles
and a primitive syringe.
When Pandora hit the reef
she was carrying two sets of
stores the second for Bounty
which, unknown to Pandora’s
captain, Edward Edwards,
Christian had burnt at Pit-
cairn Island 18 months be-
fore. On the deck of Pandora
was a cage containing 14 of
the Bounty mutineers
shackled in irons who had
been captured in Tahiti.
Both Edwards and Hamil-
ton kept remarkable logs
which have survived to tell the
story of Pandora’s despatch
from England in 1790 with or-
ders to apprehend the Bounty
mutineers.
Aboard Pandora was Mid-
shipman Heyward, one of
Bligh’s loyal 18, who was
making the journey to identify
the mutineers.
Heyward was to survive a
second cross-ocean journey,


again to Timor but this time from Pan-
dora Cay.
Although the search for the remain-
ing mutineers proved fruitless, Hamil-
ton did recover from the island of An-
amooka an axe which had been “left by
Captain Cook.” The logs record that
Pandora also found “some of the
French navigators’ clothing” in the
Friendly Islands where a boatload of
crew, including La Perouse’s deputy, M.
De Lange, had been massacred in 1787
shortly before La Perouse chanced on
Captain Philip laying the foundations
of European settlement in Australia.
Coleman believes these items may
still be in Pandora’s hull and recover-
able.
Edwards also captured the mutin-
eers’ locally-built sloop which he named
Resource. The two boats became sep-
arated, Resource being presumed lost.
But the two crews were to meet in Timor
in extraordinary circumstances.
Just as Cook had come to grief on
the Barrier Reef, so did the cautious Ed-
wards. Edwards’ orders were to return
to England through Endeavor Strait,
which Cook had pioneered 13 years
earlier.
Edwards chose instead to look for an
entrance further north. He missed a nar-
row entrance near Murray Island and
then, in uncharted and reef-dotted
waters, he was forced to work his way
south along the longest impenetrable
stretch of the outer reef.
On the day that a longboat found a
passage, Pandora was carried on to a
submerged reef. Despite pumping all
night and an attempt to protect the hull
with a sail as Cook had done Pan-
dora took more water.
Cannons were thrown overboard
and the mutineers broke their leg-irons
in panic. Edwards ordered their irons
back on and told his marines to shoot
them if escape were attempted.
Suddenly Pandora heeled over and
the sea rushed through the gunports. A
crewman threw the scuttle off the top of
the cage known by then to the crew as
Pandora’s Box and another flung the
leg-iron keys to the mutineers.
Thirty-one of the crew and four of
the mutineers were lost. All 99 of the
survivors made it to Timor in open
boats after resting for 19 days on a near-
by island, a haven for the shipwrecked
through the following century.
But still the Pandora story continued.
In Timor, Edwards found his crew on
Resource under detention by Dutch au-
thorities. Because of the boat’s rough
construction and the lack of a commis-
sioned officer among its complement
they were suspected of being escapees
from Port Jackson.
Also in the isolated settlement of
Kupang was Mary Bryant, a First Fleet
convict. She, her husband, William, and

With the aid of sketchy charts
gleaned from a sympathetic Dutch navi-
gator, William Bryant, the governor’s
fisherman, and his family had navigated
their tiny stolen boat thousands of kilo-
metres up Australia’s east coast and
across the Arafura Sea.
Coleman said: “It was only after the
survivors of Pandora arrived in Timor
that the Bryants acciden-
tally gave themselves away.
Edwards, when he took his
surviving Bounty mutin-
eers to England, took the
Bryants as well.”

two children, Emanuel
also perished in Batavia
while Charlotte died on
board HMS Gordon in
May 1792 in transit with
her mother and other
escaped convicts to Lon-
don.
Of the 10 surviving
Bounty mutineers, six were convicted
and three of them eventually were
hanged. Their cage, Pandora’s Box, may
still lie under the sand of the Barrier
Reef and Coleman hopes that it may be
recovered.
The Pandora project has one major
private supporter, Castlemaine
Tooheys, and it is struggling to gain rec-
ognition as a bicentenary project.
Coleman said: “We didn’t fit into the
normal categories for funding so since
then we’ve been trying to get
bicentenary authority endorsement.
We’re having a little trouble with that
because they feel we have to demon-
strate more private industry support.
And I’m a curator, not a fundraiser.’’ □

LIFESTYLE
Women and marriage:
are they compatible?
Sue Cameron, left-rear in black; Carol Hungerford, in white beret; Rachel Haggert, in pink shawl: fun with off-spring
Many women today feel that marriage and motherhood have been devalued; that
doubts, stress and isolation are adding to the pressures of today's society.
BERWYN LEWIS spoke to Australian mothers to get their frank opinions.
MARRIAGE and motherhood are
under more pressure today than ever be-
fore. How are modern women coping
with the economic and social demands
of society?
Over cake and coffee, above the
clamor of crawling infants, in snatched
moments of freedom, women spoke
about themselves, their husbands, their
children; their hopes, worries and fears.
HUSBANDS
Henrietta Brewster, 20, mother of two:
“My husband doesn’t want me to go to
work. He believes that a woman should
be in the house and look after it; go to
bingo five days a week.”
Alison Smith, 34, former schoolteacher
and fashion designer, mother of two:
“He’s aloof with his thoughts and his
feelings and I don’t think he’s used to
communicating within the family. Al-
though I know he cares, he just doesn’t
show it. But just when I think he doesn’t
care at all he’ll give me a pat or a hug or
turn up with a bunch of flowers.”
Judy Bernstein, 31, economics graduate
and former industrial relations officer,
mother of three-year-old triplets and
pregnant again: “I rely on my husband
for emotional support. The children
take everything out of me. I’m continu-
ally asking for a cuddle. I feel as though
I get strength from him. I need contin-
ual reassurance. I want to grab any time
we have to ourselves.”
Carol Hungerford, 38, a doctor and
mother of two: “When he’s not away on
business we co-operate and play an
equal role. He changes, burps and feeds
the baby but my main worry is finding
time to remember who we each are.”
Sue Cameron, 36, an occupational
therapist and mother of two: “He’s the
sort of person who will have a heart at-
tack. He drives to work and doesn’t play
much sport. We often have conversa-

Bernadette Bennett, rear, Mara Safe, fore-
ground in stripes: time for aerobics
tions about the tennis matches we don’t
have.”
Kath Jewel, 70, mother of two: “We
have a fantastic understanding. He used
to get up early in the morning, get my
breakfast and get himself off to work.
That was when I had the new baby but
he went on doing that for the next 30
years.”
EXPECTATIONS
Smith: “I was looking for a person I
liked who would let me remain me. I
wanted him to make more money than
me. I wanted to be comfortable.”
Dessie Richards, 33, a teacher and
mother of three: “I found the husband I
want. He was a gentleman from the be-
ginning. He still makes me feel like a
real woman. I wanted a good father. My
father didn’t do anything. My mother
brought us all up.”
Cameron: “When I was a teenager my
ideal person had to be very physically
active and spunky. When I decided to
marry I actually chose the man I
thought would be interesting for the rest
of my life.”
Bernadette Bennett, 38, a former model
and mother of two: “I wanted to learn. I
expected my husband to be at least as
well educated, if not better, than my-
self.”
June Richards, 50, mother of four and
grandmother of seven: “I wanted some-
one cleverer than myself. It’s nice to
have someone to look up to.”
Lena Ryan, 66, mother of five, grand-
mother of six and great-grandmother of
two: “My husband is like an undersized
jockey so I missed out on the tall, dark
and handsome. I dreamed of riches. I
would have married a rich man but my
second husband is my ideal man.”
MOTHERHOOD
Bernstein: “It’s very hard to see the suc-
cess of your input on a continuing basis.
Everyone likes that. It’s a boost to your
ego. Before I had children people would
say ‘What do you do?’ and that would
be the start of a long conversation. Now
I say ‘l’m a mother’ and that’s the end of
the conversation.”
Hungerford: “A friend of mine said re-
cently that her only aim in life is to fin-
ish her sentences. I look forward to the
time when I can finish mine.”
Mara Safe, 32, a former schoolteacher
and mother of one: “Motherhood
makes me feel like a second-class citi-
zen. From a full career to this little scrap
of humanity is a big shock. I thought I
was well prepared but I wasn’t. The
biggest hurt that goes with motherhood
is the lack of status or identity. This is


the hardest job I’ve done in my life. It’s
worth it but I find I’m instantly in the
cabbage category. The days seem ter-
ribly long. When it gets to about 3
o’clock I think if I have to go to the park
for another walk or play ‘whizzies’
again I’m going to scream. That makes
me feel guilty.”
Rachel Haggert, 38, psychologist and
mother of three: “Half of me kept think-
ing: ‘How boring and awful.’ The other
half of me really wanted to get into it. If
motherhood were more highly thought
of and supported by society you would
get into it quicker and do it better.”
Smith: “There was no pressure to have a
family. My husband let me be an indi-
vidual. We waited seven years. I was
putting on make-up one morning and I
burst into tears. I realised I wanted a
baby.”
CHILDREN
Smith: “What we are doing now can
have a detrimental effect on them when
they grow up. Will I be responsible for
that? How much can you bend them? I
have moments when I could quite easily
leave them all to themselves. Because
the children are young there’s a lot of
stress at particular times of the day. I
can’t take a shower without everyone
coming in.”
Bernstein: “The triplets have placed a
tremendous strain on our marriage. If
we hadn’t been best friends before they
were born it wouldn’t be working. I find
I can’t even take a shower. They’re just
so dependent on me. I have to have
them in the bathroom when I go to the
toilet. I can’t stand the continual crying,
screaming and banging on the door.”
Barbara Cohen, 34, a former private sec-
retary, mother of one and pregnant
again: “Every now and again I get very
upset and impatient with my daughter. I
wonder am I doing the right thing as far
as guiding her in the right direction is
concerned. I find the shower is the best
place to be alone.”
GIRLFRIENDS
Bennett: “I value my soul-to-soul talks
with my girlfriends. You have different
ideas and views which you can talk
about with your girlfriends. My hus-
band wants to talk about the
stockmarket. I want to talk about
fashion.”
Jewel: “I had a girlfriend for 50-odd
years. We used to confide in each other
a lot. I could talk to her a lot more. I
could explain things to her which I
couldn’t to my husband. She could do
the same for me.”
SECURITY
Richards: “Emotional security is very
important. Just to go to bed and cuddle;
that is emotionally secure. To have my
husband tell me I’ve done a good job
today. That sort of support is very im-
portant.”
Hungerford: “Having a medical degree
is an enormous insurance against being
bored, lonely or broke.”
ECONOMICS
Brewster: “We can live off one wage
now but as our children grow up they
will want to learn things such as piano
and ballet and have swimming lessons.
We won’t be able to do anything if I
don’t go out and make money. He wants
them to go to private schools and yet he
believes we’ll all get by on one salary.”
Bernstein: “I hate relying on my hus-
band for finances. Before we had the
children I earned more than him. I had
access to my money. I could spend it on
anything I liked. Now my husband ex-
pects me to stay within a certain limit.
He’ll say: ‘You majored in economics;

An equity trust is a pooling of
investments which enables the investor
or unit holder to become part owner of a
range of equities. These generally
comprise shares or securities, but may
also include debentures or money

and insights of the people who manage
them. That’s why Elders Equity Trust is

why can’t you detail how you spent your
money?’ ”
Hungerford: “We have always had a
joint bank account, although my defini-
tion of a joint account is he puts money
in and I take it out. We have never
been threatened by money matters. In
fact we are thinking of swapping roles.
I would work full-time and my husband
could play computers and work on the
farm.”
HOUSEWORK
Ryan: “My second husband is always
promising to cook a fantastic dinner for
me but I never get it. He’s good if I’m
sick. He’ll do the cleaning and washing
then but if I’m all right he won’t.”
Hungerford: “My husband walks the
dog. He writes the cheques. He fixes the
car and takes over the children when
he’s not busy. I do the cooking. He
baths the children as I clean up the
debris from the children’s evening meal.
He gets them all processed for sleep,
then I go up and kiss them goodnight.
Then we sit down and have our meal
together. It works like clockwork. It’s
the only thing that keeps the house run-
ning.”
Cameron: “My husband can’t cook and
breast-feed but he does everything else.
I don’t think he particularly likes wash-
ing and ironing his shirts but he likes
them clean and ironed so he does it.”
PROBLEMS
Smith: “The biggest problem is the TV
set. It’s on almost all the time my hus-
band is in the house.”
Cohen: “I find TV the worst problem in
our marriage. I’m concerned about nu-
clear warfare. And in the long term
drugs worry me. How does one keep
children away from drugs?”
Hungerford: “My husband is a com-
puter freak. But then I’m an opera
freak. In the US, home computers are
now cited as the number one cause of
divorce. They’ve replaced the other
woman.”
ISOLATION
Smith: “I channel all my energy into my
children but I find myself watching
widows and divorced women.”
Ryan: “I missed people to a certain ex-
tent. At times I would think: ‘I would
love to go out. What am I doing sitting
around?’ But there was nothing I could
do.”
Safe: “I have this sense of being in the
world but no longer part of it. World
War 111 could be starting and I wouldn’t
even know about it.” □
Parents are important international survey shows
MOST Australians (74 percent) say a
child needs a home with both a father
and a mother to grow up happily, ac-
cording to a new survey.
Fewer people in Britain (67 percent),
the United States (61 percent) and Den-
mark (55 percent) have this view ac-
cording to the Australian Values Study
conducted by the Roy Morgan Re-
search Centre in Melbourne. But in
Japan 80 percent believe two parents
are important to a child.
Australian men (77 percent) are
more likely than women (70 percent) to
believe that children need both parents
in order to grow up happily. Ninety per-
cent of men over 70 believe in two
parents while women in their 20s are
least likely to hold this opinion.
The opinion that children are highly
important for a successful marriage is
held by the majority in most countries
surveyed, with the exception of Den-
mark (36 percent).
In Australia, 59 percent say they
hold this belief. It is higher (61 percent)

among women under 50 than men of the
same age (52 percent) but for older
people the reverse is true: 68 percent of
men over 50 compared with only 62 per-
cent of older women think children are
very important to a successful marriage.
Australians in professional and man-
agerial occupations are less likely (43
percent) than average to see children as
very important for a successful husband
and wife team. Small business owners
are significantly more likely (77 percent)
than other groups to share this view.
Highly-educated Australians are less
likely than those with less formal educa-
tion to see children as very important
for a successful marriage. Only 47 per-
cent of those with tertiary education
agree, compared with 77 percent of
those with only a primary school educa-
tion.
Though children are considered im-
portant for a happy relationship be-
tween marriage partners, the inability to
have children is rated very low on the
list of reasons for divorce. There is no
significant difference on this point in
Australia, Britain, the United States,
Japan and Denmark.
People surveyed were asked to rate a
given list of reasons for divorce and 90
percent of Australians indicated “when
partner consistently unfaithful” as
sufficient reason. Japan (73 percent) and
Denmark (75 percent) were less em-
phatic.
Second on Australia’s list was “when
partner violent.” Eighty-eight percent
thought this grounds for divorce but
only 68 percent of Japanese agreed.
Cultural differences between West-
ern countries and Japan showed up in
this part of the survey. Sixty-six percent
of Japanese said “when personalities
don’t match” was a reason for a mar-
riage split whereas only 32 percent of
Australians and 22 percent of Ameri-
cans agreed.
“When one partner has ceased to
love the other” was reason enough for
divorce for 71 percent of Australians
but only 45 percent of Japanese. “Sex-
ual relationships not satisfactory” could
end 25 percent of Australian marriages
but only 14 percent of those in Japan.
Men in Australia see a greater need
for children. Twenty-nine percent of
men compared with 24 percent of
women believe a woman must have chil-
dren to be fulfilled. Twenty-seven per-
cent of men, compared with only 19
percent of women, also said that a man
needed children for fulfilment.
Australia as a whole (27 percent)
rates with Britain (20 percent) and the
US (15 percent) in thinking that chil-
dren are necessary for a woman’s fulfil-
ment. The figures are much higher in
Japan (54 percent) and Denmark (61
percent).
The statistics for this Australian
Values Study were collected across the
nation in August, September and
October last year from 1200 people aged
14 and over. They were contrasted with
preliminary results of the European
Value Study carried out in 24 countries.

ABC-FM radio faces
a classical problem
Supporters of the classical music service on ABC-FM
believe their programs are under threat from the tentacles
of pop. GLENDA THOMPSON got the arguments from
both sides of the record and outlines the dilemma.
THE ABC-FM radio furore has shown
one thing: the classical music service
has devoted fans. They are not a ma-
jority an estimated 600,000 Austra-
lians listen for an hour or more a week
but they are articulate and deter-
mined.
Their concerted outcry stage-
managed, it has been suggested, by FM
staffers in Adelaide and a newspaper
looking for a cause to champion has
ruffled the feathers of the high-fliers who
head the Australian Broadcasting Cor-
poration. Chairman Ken Myer and
managing director Geoffrey Whitehead
have ducked for cover.
Keith Mackriell, assistant general
manager (radio), told The Bulletin he
did not support a plan to replace classi-
cal music with a young person’s service
on the FM network. “The motivation
for the proposal that our existing FM
service ought to be turned over to a
young-style station is based upon the
very legitimate element of concern of
younger program-makers that there
ought to be some sustained effort to at-
tract young people to ABC radio,” he
said. “The figures show no ABC station
consistently appeals to people under 24,
excluding 2JJJ (the ABC’s other FM
outlet, the experimental Sydney station
aimed at the 18-to-24-year-old market).
We would be unique in broadcasting in
the western world if we were to throw
off our FM service. FM is the ideal
mode to transmit classical music pre-
cisely because it is the most inter-
ference-free. Young people’s broadcast-
ing would not be all music pre-
sumably,” Mackriell said.
“I’m in both camps but I certainly
don’t want us to overturn the FM ser-
vice. My thinking goes towards expan-
sion of ABC radio rather than what I
see as expedience. We ought to develop
a network of stations for young people.
Radio is a relatively cheap medium and
it would be possible progressively to
have Triple J-type stations in the major
centres in this country. That’s not pie-
in-the-sky even in this time of contract-
ing resources. The government can find

Whether Mackriell’s comments can
be taken as an indicator of how the
ABC will jump is doubtful. He is being
replaced next month by Briton Robin
Hicks whose views are likely to be a fac-
tor when the board considers the plan
this month. Hicks made clear where his

belief lies though he did not wish to pre-
empt talks with his staff, he said by tele-
phone from Bristol. “The ABC will sur-
vive only if the mass of the Australian
people want it to. It is its job to provide
a service as widely as possible.
“It would be elitist to discriminate
against the young, the old or any
group.”
Hicks said the ABC’s role was not
merely to fill in the gaps left by commer-
cial stations. “You’ve got to be good
across the board, then pick up where
you can do better,” he said. But simple
replacement of the FM classical music
format with a service for younger
people across more than 30 centres in
Australia is unlikely mainly because it
probably would not work.
Successful youth broadcasting is
based on local identity, according to
Marius Webb, co-ordinator of Triple J.
“It’s incredibly important. A lot of What
we do is oriented to the Sydney commu-
nity ... local news, a what’s on service
about gigs that night. None of the com-
mercials network. They relate very
closely to the local market. What works
here could flop somewhere else. For
example, 2GB has an almost identical
format to 3AW yet the Melbourne
station rates much better than 2GB does
in Sydney. We broadcast from midnight
to dawn in Newcastle, Canberra and
Wollongong when we’re not carrying
any local stuff.”
The April-June 1984 McNair Ander-
son survey showed Triple J had 3.7 per-
cent of the Sydney audience. But in its
target age group of 18 to 24 it came sec-
ond with 15 percent to 2MMM’s 30 per-
cent. The same survey gave ABC-FM,
2MBS-FM, 2SER-FM, 2CBA and other
small community stations a combined
share of 1.6 percent (it does not separate
them) and the ABC’s 2FC 1.8 percent.
Webb says no amount of program im-
provement is going to enhance ABC-
FM’s rating greatly. There are only so
many serious music lovers in the
country. He denies that young people
are well catered for. He says only four
Sydney stations serve the under-25s
compared with eight for older people.
“Outside Sydney it’s even worse. In the
country you often have the ABC and
one commercial station. Youth pro-
gramming is as subtle and sensitive as
classical programming. The average
commercial station has 40 or 50 tracks it
repeats and a reserve format of 200
‘golds’ it thrashes to death. We have 80
current tracks which we augment daily
with 150 others.”
Triple J has a staff of 40 and costs
about $1 million a year to run. The FM
2JJJ co-ordinator Marius Webb: youth programming is as sensitive as classical


classical service is similar in those two
respects but little else. It is based in
Adelaide and, in the view of one of its
producer-presenters, Gillian Waite,
suffers from isolation. “We were set up
as a radio station nine years ago and
that we’ve remained. Meanwhile, the
ABC has gone on its own juggernaut
way, largely ignoring FM because most
of the decisions are made in Sydney and
not enough people in Sydney know
what we do.”
Waite was at the fateful conference
in Sydney from July 2 to 6 which gave
rise to the classical-FM-for-the-chop
paranoia. Called by management to dis-
cuss the future of radio, the 84 delegates
came up with some provocative ideas.
“I was prepared for close scrutiny,” said
Waite who was one of the two-person
FM delegation with FM’s
controller, Dennis Har-
rison. “I was not prepared
for totally dropping FM as
it exists. I felt a steamroller
had run over me.”
The conference identi-
fied the four most import-
ant functions: local radio
connected with the local
community; a national
network to reflect national
and international issues; a
network of stations to pro-
ABC chairman Ken Myer
vide for youth; a classical
music network. Waite said
that, as only three net-
works existed, the mood
was “four into three won’t
go, so drop the classical
stream as the least import-
ant.”
Back in Adelaide, Har-
rison had to stop an-
nouncers saying on air:
“There’s a proposal to
abolish us.” He admits to
being pessimistic about the
future of FM as we know it. Of the two
main options the conference produced,
he says even the second that the FM
output be combined with that of the
Radio 2 network would cut across the
homogeneity that FM has enjoyed.
Waite goes further: “Cut
hours would be disastrous.
We serve people who need
us people who are ill, in-
somaniacs. For them,
classical music at night is a
lifeline.”
Harrison is taking
Myer’s press release at its
word that “a full analysis
of all data will take place
before any decision to
change or not to change is
made.” Harrison is com-
Geoffrey Whitehead
piling a document on
classical FM’s achieve-
ments for submission.
An idealistic supporter
of the youth cause is
Arthur Wyndham, head of
the main ABC network,
Radio 1. “Even if the com-
mercials did cater ad-
equately for the young, I
would find it a hard moral
position to justify that the
ABC can operate in the
capital cities three net-
works all directed at the 30 plus but
predominantly the 40 plus and dis-
enfranchise the under 30-year-olds.”
He says a new youth network would
be the ideal choice; failing that, a com-
bination of FM and Radio 2 on either
network. “Radio 1 is the main news and
information network; it carries pro-
grams such as AM which is the highest
rater the ABC has. If we were to at-
tempt to self-destruct by changing the
nature of its programming from the 30
pluses to the under 30s, the net result
would be the whole of the Radio 1 audi-
ence would disappear in confusion
wondering where to find their pro-
grams, many of which would then be
transferred to Radio 2. That sort of ex-
ercise is a very dangerous one to under-
take with your most effective network.”

FILMS
A mountain
out of
an anthill
By SANDRA HALL
IT IS SIX years since German director
Werner Herzog swept up to a group of
Australians at the Berlin Film Festival
with news of his intention to make a
film here. It would be about Aborigines,
he said, and would feature a
particular variety of green ant
which had appeared to him in
a dream. Did Australia have
such ants?
Well, no, it doesn’t but that
has not stopped him.
Where The Green Ants
Dream, Herzog’s highly ec-
centric view of the clash be-
tween Aboriginal culture and
white law, opens this week in
Sydney and the ants are pre-
sent if not quite correct
having been fitted out with
habits lurid enough to keep a
battalion of entomologists
happily absorbed for several
lifetimes. Herzog has been
only slightly more circum-
spect with Aboriginal customs
and anthropologists, too,
should find plenty to marvel
at along with lawyers, poli-
ticians and anyone who has lent half an
ear to the land rights debate lately.
(Hence the hope, already expressed by
an outraged Phillip Adams, that
Herzog’s green ants bite him on the
bum.)
But Herzog never has been con-
cerned with practicalities. He likes
exotica South American jungles,
Transylvanian horrors, desperate tales
of haunted characters none of whom
ever seems quite as haunted as Herzog
himself. For example, his previous film
Fitzcarraldo was quite pallid in
comparison with Burden Of Dreams,
Les Blank’s documentary about the tor-
tures through which Herzog put himself
in making it. To him, the most in-
triguing element in the enterprise
seemed to be not the result but the de-
gree of difficulty and the most signifi-
cant word in his vocabulary not “truth”
but “dream,” which was exchanged for
“nightmare” in moments of extreme
stress during the making of Fitzcarraldo.
So central Australia has become part
of Herzog’s Dreamland in a story about
uranium miners versus an Aboriginal
tribe which has chosen as its totem the
green ant a truly wondrous creature
with the toughness of a cockroach, the
mating habits of a bee (with a few in-
ventive elaborations) and a sensory or-
gan for magnetic fields which means
that it is only happy facing east.
Bruce Spence does his best to cope
with all of this as a liberally inclined
geologist working for the mining com-
pany, Ray Barrett is his fulminating
foreman with bulldozer at the ready and
Norman Kaye is their pusillanimous
boss with a sustaining belief in the
power of the Deal. There is also an as-
sortment of film-makers and academics
Bob Ellis, Paul Cox, James Ricketson
and Michael Edols among them
walking on and off, as well as inside
Werner Herzog (right) with cast member Roy Marika: high-mindedness and simple-mindedness
joke-making of the kind usually as-
sociated with scripts on which Ellis has
worked (he is credited as script consult-
ant).
The dignified presence of artist
Wandjuk Marika and other members of
Aboriginal communities is curiously at
odds with this, especially when the
script has Marika and another tribes-
man catch sight of a Caribou transport
and decide that they want it to decorate
the sacred site (presumably because of a
resemblance to a large, winged manifes-
tation of the green ant).
At the behest of the mining com-
pany, the air force naturally obliges but
this generous gift is not enough to stop
the case going to court where, in a neat
reversal of reality, the commonwealth
argues against the case for Aboriginal
land rights.
Herzog gets in a lot of high-
mindedness along with the simple-
mindedness.
Supermarkets, Coca-Cola and tran-
sistor radios are all symptoms of hu-
manity’s rush to destruction, along with
lifts and digital watches, but by the end
when Spence is dropping out in the
desert, declaring that the 20th century
should be called off for lack of interest
cultural tragedy has taken on unnerv-
ing hints of Ealing comedy.
THE ITALIAN cinema is celebrated
not for its mystics but for humanists
great directors such as the Taviani
brothers, Francesco Rosi and Ermanno
Olmi who know how to achieve power
with simplicity and directness.
Cammina, Cammina is Olmi’s first
film since his magnificent pastorale The
Tree Of Wooden Clogs, released four
years ago, and the religious nature of its
subject does not affect Olmi’s human-
ism.
Cammina, Cammina (translated dis-
piritingly in the credits as Keep Walk-
ing, Keep Walking) is a sceptic’s re-tell-
ing of the story of the Three Wise Men
a film which manages to celebrate
Christianity while questioning the
teachings of the Church.
It’s rather like the Taviani brothers’
The Night Of The Shooting Stars, in that
both are stories about quests. In the
Tavianis’ film, the villagers set off to find
the allied liberation forces. A similar
group in Cammina, Cammina is guided
east by the shooting star in the hope that
the messiah of whom its members have
heard will mean the beginnings of a just
rule.
Unlike The Night Of The Shooting
Stars, it doesn’t have a happy ending
it’s principally about betrayal nor is it
as exhilarating but the richness is there
and the eloquence. Herzog could learn a
thing or two. □

ney at the Roma. Soon for other states.

THEATRE
Sidetrack
goes off
the rails
By BRIAN HOAD
MAJOR theatre companies will be hor-
rified to learn that the sinister forces of
community artists have found a flag-
bearer in the community theatre group
Sidetrack, a personal favorite of federal
Arts Minister Barry Cohen. With the
blessing of the minister (who would like
to take the group to Canberra
for the entertainment of par-
liamentarians) they have ter-
minated temporarily their
travels around factories,
schools, town halls and can-
teens and their headquar-
ters at Hut 9, the Addison
Road Community Centre,
Marrickville to visit central
Sydney for the first time. The
revolutionary pennant will be
fluttering over The Sailors’
Home until August 25. Mem-
bers of the arts establishment
are advised to pay a visit with-
out delay. It is an enlightening
experience.
Founded in 1979 to help in
the teaching of English among
migrants in Sydney’s western
suburbs and becoming a full-
time professional theatre company in
1981, Sidetrack has evolved as a multi-
cultural theatre group which attempts to
devise from grassroots experience three
or four works each year which drama-
tise such social issues as alienation, in-
dustrial health and safety, prejudice, ex-
ploitation and sexism. If this sounds a
little heavy going, the group also tries to
be entertaining and non-polemical.
During performances by Sidetrack at
the Chullora locomotive workshops last
year, an enthusiastic shop steward ex-
plained how workers in New South
Wales rail workshops were allowed one
hour a month for “art” and suggested
that the time was ripe for the Australian
Council of Trade Unions to push for
similar benefactions throughout Austra-
lian industry.
The potential area for theatrical en-
deavor being opened in the new era of
democratic socialisation is obviously
enormous and promises to be an
enormous drain on limited arts funding,
most of which is cornered currently by
establishment companies where out-
breaks of hysterical despair have been
more frequent than ever this year.
Full of the beans of popular success
“one of the most valid theatre groups
in this country” Sidetrack and its
young turks (of both genders) have
devised a new work for their assault on
Byzantium: Day to Day, a “macabre,
bizarre, comic and finally disturbingly
realistic” dramatisation of life in the
public service.
Shiny-bums, being by definition
boring people, are notoriously difficult
to dramatise. Sidetrack notes as much
with quotes from its grassroots research
among members of public service
unions: “Many public servants have a
suspicion that what they’re doing is use-
less ... Don’t ask your way to get out of
here because no one will know.”
The previous brave attempt to come
to grips theatrically with this Kafka-
June Salter (l) and Jill Perryman in ’night Mother.
esque subject was made some five or six
years ago in Roger Hall’s Flexitime. Hall
was diligent in trying to squeeze a little
life out of a lifeless situation arrival at
the office and preparation for morning
teabreak; the doldrums between morn-
ing teabreak and lunch; the aftermath
of lunch leading to afternoon teabreak;
the decline from afternoon teabreak to
premature departure.
To spice things up a bit he threw in a
bit of hanky-panky behind the filing
cabinet, an office party and a tantrum or
two. The occasional glimmer of private
unhappiness was revealed. Boredom
was the prevailing mood, buck-passing
the major activity and the telephones
kept ringing but were seldom answered.
Day to Day is a far less diligent, less
skilful variation on the same theme for
three bad actors and two stuffed dum-
mies. It is dim-witted, simple-minded
and gormless. It is a revealing reflection
of the tastes of Cohen. It is a macabre,
bizarre and finally disturbingly realistic
picture of the shape of things to come in
Australian theatre.
Yet, should it make an appearance at
the Chullora locomotive workshops,
Day to Day in all probability would be
hailed as yet another revolutionary mas-
terpiece. Teabreaks, artbreaks call
them what you will are all welcome
relief from the workshop floor. But if
you are going to force-feed the workers
theatre, let them see good theatre.
Idealists from the community theatre
movement (200 of them rallied for their
first national conference in Adelaide
last November) will argue that their
theatre must be for and about Austra-
lians, must arise out of and exist in the
community, must display and promote
a respect for ordinary people.
And so it should. “A respect for ordi-
nary people” has been the key to success
for most of the best examples of Austra-
lian theatre since Ray Lawler set a new
ball rolling with The Summer of the Sev-
enteenth Doll some 30 years
ago.
As such, good theatre can
be very popular indeed. A
current example is Marsha
Norman’s ’night Mother, an
excellent piece for touring,
demanding only two actors
and a kitchen sink. The play
started its national tour in
Perth last March, took in
Geraldton, moved across to
Adelaide, toured around Tas-
mania, is currently in Sydney
at the Footbridge Theatre and
will tackle Melbourne and
Brisbane in due course.
The subject of this popular
play is suicide in the spiritual
wasteland of the age of ma-
terialism. More simply, Jessie
(Jill Perryman) casually tells
mum (June Salter) that she will shoot
herself in an hour or so. And for an
hour or so, as Jessie busies herself
around the house to leave mum ship-
shape, mum argues every-which-way to
dissuade her daughter; while Jessie,
cool as a cucumber, explains why her
life isn’t worth living.
Sensitively directed by Edgar
Metcalfe, in this drab, sad woman
trapped in a mechanical and loveless
life, comfortably off yet comfortless,
Perryman finds an inner strength which
strikes deep sympathetic chords; while
in the monstrous mum, soured with life
yet scared of loneliness and the very
thought of death, Salter finally reveals
pathos.
Finely written and performed, this
play about a heartless society touches
the heart. Its respect for ordinary people
is enormous. Its widespread popularity
is entirely understandable and no-
body seems to mind that Norman is an
American.
Why should they? Here is theatre for
the community at its very best. □


BOOKS
Well-chosen
words from
the doctor
By MARY ROSE LIVERANI
Lady Bones: pieces dissected
from The Body Program of the
ABC, by Earle Hackett.
Collins/ABC, $7.95.
EARLE HACKETT, the ABC broad-
caster on subjects nominally medical,
does not tie himself down to “conven-
tional grammar, beginnings, endings
and high seriousness.” His 15-minute
weekly talks on The Body Program are
“wild excursions of the muse” that have
entertained, informed and inspired
wide audiences since 1965.
Hackett belongs to that eccentric
group of artist-medicos including
Rabelais, Axel Munthe and Carlo Levi
for whom medicine is a metaphor
more than an applied science, a way to
celebrate the unity of life. In Hackett’s
purposeful world, very much an evol-
utionary rather than a cre-
ationist vision, everything
connects, has a place and a
function; even cancer. The El-
ephant Man, for instance, in
evolutionary terms was not
abnormal, according to
Hackett. He was a variation,
an experiment every species
needs to survive its long jour-
ney through time and “We
who benefit from such exper-
iments should express our
gratitude in care, kindness
and civility to the deformed
and disabled.”
The physical manifesta-
tions of old age, he asserts
“made senior members of the
group instantly distinguish-
able from juniors ... they (the
signals) must have been ad-
vantageous not disadvan-
tageous or we would not have
had them.”
And death itself, in
Hackett’s view, is a biological
invention giving room for
chance variations in a species
to be tried out, to be selected
naturally for and against.
Such happy expositions
bespeak a robust and san-
guine temperament, one that
has little patience with the pu-
nitive aspects of religion. In a discourse
on the history of anaesthetics Hackett
refers ironically to the clergy’s view of
chloroform as “a decoy of Satan.” “It
will rob God,” he says, “of those deep
earnest cries which arise in times of
trouble,” such as childbirth
Good-tempered as he is, however,
two subjects make him spit: smoking
and “ageism,” his neologism for medi-
cine’s dismissal of the aged as irrepar-
able, medically uninteresting and not
worth rehabilitating. The Expectoration
of Life calls the aged to arms, dismisses
Shakespeare’s “sans eyes, sans teeth
...” as Elizabethan rubbish and prom-
ises that a 70-year-old has more than
enough resources to cope with an indus-
trial technical society. “Go on, old,”
cries Hackett; “change society, spit in
its eye ... already you have the num-
bers.” In Cancer it is the villains, the
smokers, who are doing the spitting at
the non-smokers. Hackett hopes that the
ashtray one day will become obsolete
like the spittoon; that smoking, like
spitting, no longer will be the done
thing. Spitting spreads tuberculosis,
smoking spreads cancer and is even
worse than spitting because the smoke
in an aeroplane, taxi or restaurant can-
not be dodged.
Hackett may be serious at times but
he is never solemn. He is a Southern
Irishman bred on Sterne, Sheridan and
Joyce and, like them, word mad, associ-
Earle Hackett: serious at times but never solemn
PETER FISHER
ation crazy, pazzo about parody and
pun, ear-wigged by echoes. The meta-
phor is the medium to him of both dis-
covery and enlightenment.
He discusses this in the talk entitled
Perpetuum mobile, saying “great dis-
coveries are made inside the mind. They
are shifts in mental analogy.” Before
Harvey’s time, for instance, men knew
about pumps and pipes but they thought
the heart was a fiery furnace. Harvey
imagined heart, arteries and veins to be
much more like a pump and pipes and
then decided that was what they were.
His private imaginative leap was borne
out by public checking.
Lady Bones is one of those rare
books that leave the reader improved:
more knowledgeable, wiser, even hap-
pier. A gift from a good doctor. □
The significance
of Strawberry
Hill reassessed
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
The Strawberry Hill Set, by Brian
Fothergill. Faber and Faber,
$39.95.
Three Extraordinary Ambassadors,
by Harold Acton. Thames &
Hudson, $13.50.
THE STRAWBERRY Hill Set, sub-
titled Horace Walpole and His Circle, in-
cludes four-and-a-half pages of bibli-
ography which raises the question of
what need exists for another volume
about these people. The answer is to be
found in reassessment and in a change
of attitude by which readers like to take
sidelong glances at history. Walpole
died, aged 80, three years before the
18th century came to an end. The new
century, Fothergill says, reacted against
the Walpole “frolic.” In the next 25
years, there came to be quite a flourish-
ing little industry engaged in vilifying
Walpole and Strawberry Hill and all it
stood for appeared to have no place in
the new age of muscular Christianity
and “manliness.”
What did it stand for? Virginia
Woolf wrote, more than 100 years later
when recognition finally came that
Walpole was before all else an artist and
that his works must be judged by artistic
standards that he “was not only the
wittiest of men but the most observant
and not the least kindly and, among the
writers of English prose, he wears for-
ever and with a peculiar grace a coronet
of his own earning.” The works by
which he must be judged are various
editions of his correspondence and a
five-volume collection of essays, verse,


novels and historical inquiries. The let-
ters continue to give the most pleasure.
Horace Walpole was the son of Sir
Robert Walpole, a British prime minis-
ter. They were a Norfolk family with
houses in London. Horace bought a
coachmen’s cottage at Twickenham
when he was 27 and did it up or, to use
his words, “gothicised” it. He bought it
for the marvellous location. “The house
is so small I can send it to you in a
letter,” he wrote to Horace Mann who is
one of the extraordinary ambassadors
in Acton’s book.
An affectionate friend and com-
panion, Walpole mixed the aristocracy,
painters, writers, architects, horticultur-
ists and his many women friends into
the Strawberry Hill set.
Walpole especially liked old women
who had led full and adventurously am-
orous lives. But he was not prepared for
commitment (a word he would not have
used) and wrote to a young man who
had quoted to him Madame du
Deffand’s axiom “One might as well be
dead as not love somebody” that his
heart was “doubtful, suspicious and
cooled. It is worn with baseness and
treachery. I think one had better be
dead than love anybody. I consider
everything around me but in the light of
amusement for, if I looked at it serious-
ly, I should detest it. I laugh that I may
not weep.”
People puzzled then, as they would
puzzle now over somebody of similar
temperament, as to whether he was
heterosexual or homosexual. He never
married and Fothergill calls him a nat-
ural celibate.
He left us some other good quotes,
apart from “I laugh that I may not
weep.”
He referred to “our supreme
governors, the mob” and said “The
world is a comedy to those that think
and a tragedy to those that feel” and,
referring to one of the old ladies,
“Thank God the Thames is between me
and the Duchess of Queensberry.”
HORACE MANN is also good for a
quote. After 45 years of exchanging let-
ters with Walpole, Mann’s last one con-
cluded: “Alas, my dear sir, I am quite
exhausted.” Mann died two months
later. He is by far the most interesting of
Acton’s ambassadors.
Appointed to the legation at Flor-
ence by Sir Robert Walpole, he stayed
there for 48 years collecting and dealing
in art.
Acton’s other choices, both with in-
terest in fine art and dedication to col-
lecting it for their own gratification, are
Sir Henry Wotton, who served 19 years
in Venice, and Sir William Hamilton
Emma’s husband who was ambassa-
dor at Naples for more than 30 years.
He climbed Mount Vesuvius 68 times. □

THIS YEAR looks like being a good
one for Australian poetry, with several
volumes of good quality, ancient and
modern, published already and more
promised. And more and more readers
are beginning to find that reality, im-
agination and a fresh use of accessible
language meet in poetry where they go
looking hungrily for each other in the
more public arenas of the media.
Mrs Noah and the Minoan Queen
(great title) is an anthology of poems by
six women born between 1932 and 1942.
It comes from Sisters Publishing Ltd,
which published an excellent earlier an-
thology from women born around 1920.
It is a pity that the first page of print in
this book is not a poem but the minatory
phalanx of the complete Sisters Editor-
ial Board, some 40 strong.
Then follows Judith Rod-
riguez’ introduction, which
begins rather self-justifyingly
politically. But all is well
when one reaches the poems,
chosen with flair by
Rodriguez.
There are some of the most
notable poems of the past 15
years here: Jennifer Rankin’s
elegant welding of art and in-
tellect in The Line; J. S.
Harry’s The baby, with the
bath-water, thrown out, which
interprets that familiar text
with terrible literal truth;
Jennifer Strauss’ tragic ac-
count of the effect of a
bushfire on her farmer father;
Fay Zwicky’s majestic but
also comic words from Mrs
Noah. A verse from this en-
capsulates something import-
ant about male and female
vision: “Noah looks into
space./ He sees the small as
small/ The great as great./ He
sees, goes fearless at the sight./ I see the
small as too little/ the great as too
much./ Does this diminish me?”
Men as well as women can write
about children but mothers are not the
same as fathers. Two especially memor-
able poems here are Rankin’s tender
Jessica’s Poem and Rodriguez’ rum-
bustious Eskimo Occasion.
Five handsome and distinctive vol-
umes from Adelaide’s Friendly Street
provide a mixed bag. In one of her
poems Jenny Boult writes: “We adjust
to fit the available space.” This is a valid
point about life but not about art.
Some of the Friendly Street poems
demonstrate what a dangerous, inad-
equate prop for a poet the ego is. “I
wandered lonely as a cloud” is an ego-
tistical poem but at the end of the cloud,
the daffodils and the inward eye matter
more than the pensive Wordsworth.
Such a balance is destroyed when the
ego takes over.
Boult, for instance, like Rob Johnson
(and Evan Jones in his new collection)
is inclined to chat on about talks or days
with friends that just aren’t significant
enough (or funny enough) to be isolated
as a poem, “i know i drank too much
mineral water/ & probably talked too
much & said too little.” Who cares? But
Boult, when she becomes more objec-
tive, can write exceptional poems such
as honeyeaters in a poinsettia tree or the
gift of gold paper and the same is true of
Johnson with Models in Vogue.
Mike Ladd has some sharp images
for instance, from Cathy with the Crew
Cut: “Your sense of humour like a
scissor of the sun,/ your happiness a
rabbit hidden/ in a greengrocer’s after
closing.” He also has a fine control of
Judith Rodriguez: poems chosen with flair
LINDSAY HOWE
cadence and rhythm, (for example, The
Drum Poem) as befits one who has
worked in rock ’n’ roll bands and “trav-
elled Europe and West Africa, assemb-
ling information about drums and
drumming.”
Many of Jeff Guess’s poems, with
their strong character portraits, belong
in a condensed form with narrative po-
etry, a form that is definitely not prose
but has good prose’s virtue of making
you want to know what is going to hap-
pen next. Guess is a school-teacher and
several of his poems have a particular
and rewarding sympathy for young
people in difficulties or for the relation
between parents and children.
It is good to see a collection from
Kevin Pearson, whose verse has
qualities of music and precision that are
part of the essential heritage of poetry
but often threatened with demolition in
the name of development. In an elegy
for David Campbell he writes “song is
utter voice.” There are two resonant
poems about oranges that also state that
proposition, while Pearson tackles its
implications head on in The Problem of
Beauty. One of my favorites is A Small
Ode to Soap, which has the same
shining observation of aspects of the ac-
customed every day as in Les Murray’s
poem about a hot shower.
Evan Jones has imposed severe limi-
tations on himself in Left at the Post,
ruefully asking “who will/ remember
my patient efforts to mimic/ in words
the smaller rhythms/ of private life with
its rewards and frustrations?” He is
good when sending himself up in a neat
inversion of an old saw, Ars longa, vita
brevis est: “Sometimes my life seems
rather long,/ my verses very short —/ I
hear the green world’s swift laconic
song:/ O turn it up, old sport.” He is at
his best in a longer poem which reaches
towards a kind of serenity, Insomnia.
Like Pearson, Philip Mead has writ-
ten an elegy for David Campbell. How
good it is that the older poet left such
messages for the younger ones to pick
up. In the finest poem in his collection,
Leaves as Words of the World, Mead ex-
plores the need for the poem to become
something else. (It is again like
Wordsworth; the daffodils are the
poem, the poem the daffodils.) Mead
faces up to the fact that “all things
should be ours/ and should serve us”
but “it is so difficult/ to say what im-
portantly/ we feel and see are often in a
different/ world from language.”
But the effort of expressing “what we
feel and see” in language must never re-
sult in a lecture, with relevant quotes or
slides (Rimbaud, Boyd.) “The creek will
teach us./ The little creek will teach us.”
“All right,” one feels like saying,
“well let it. Stop interrupting.” Poetry
readers are least of all a captive audi-
ence. □

AND YOU CAN DRIVE THE CAR THAT
JUST SET 36 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
SPEED AND ENDURANCE RECORDS.
Y&R Coudrey V 798


Take away the racing roll bar and
extra driving lamps, and you have
virtually the same Volvo 360 GLT you
can test drive at your Volvo Dealer today
A speedster that ran flat out for 24
hours recently at the Surfers Paradise
International Raceway.
To its credit the car established no
less than 36 best-in-its-class records.
These being 23 for Australia and 11
for the world.
While you might have been look-
ing at other makes of cars on April 24th
and 23th, the 360 GLT was blistering
the track with very quick V 4 mile and 'A
km times.
It coaxed records of endurance
out of distances of 300,1000 and 2000
kilometres.
The 360 GLT also returned 2646.6
kilometres for the 24-hour run.
So it’s a car not just with speed, but
heart.
Of course, this isn’t just a cleverly
engineered Volvo ploy to impress you.
The judges of Australia’s motor
sport controlling body, CAMS, super-
vised this trial.
They clicked the stopwatches and
remained impartial.
Thank you CAMS.
Thank you Hewlett Packard for
the “million-dollar array” of computer
controlled timing equipment.
Thank you 8.8. J. for creating the
software package.
Thank you, TAA, for your generous
support in Air Travel.
Thank you, Castrol for the quality

BOOK BULLETIN
No cash; only talent
by Patricia Ralfe
WHEN Elsie Webster received the non-
fiction National Book Award in 1980
the presenter, taking things for granted,
thanked the Australia Council for finan-
cial help. Webster not only did not get
help for that book, Whirlwinds in the
Plain, a biography of explorer Ludwig
Leichhardt also highly commended in
the NSW Premier’s awards but also
failed to get a grant for her next one.
This is The Moon Man, due from
Melbourne University Press in October,
a biography of Nicolai Miklouho-
Maclay, the 19th century traveller, nat-
uralist and all-round man. Landed by a
Czarist warship in New Guinea, he
lived peaceably enough among the in-
habitants who thought he came from the
moon.
Miklouho-Maclay was suggested to
Webster by her publisher, Peter Ryan,
who is more than pleased with the re-
sult. She did not cover Maclay’s ground,
which took in parts of South-East Asia
as well. “I was interested in Maclay’s
world, not mine,” she said.
She did, however, read Russian
works on him in the original. In Russia,
she explained, he is a cult figure still,
presented as a revolutionary hero.
Whereas she found Leichhardt “so pro-
saic he was shocking,” Maclay proved
elusive.
Webster is that rare and valuable
writer, the non-academic historian.
“Life,” she says, “is not a PhD thesis”
and she is free in her disparagement of
academics.
“They are such fragile beings,” she
says, “I suppose they could not exist in
the outside world. I get tired of trying to
argue against their set ideas. Everything
they write is aimed at suitability for
teaching.”
The irony is that Webster, at the end
of four years’ solitary hard work, has to
handle the queries of academics who
want to lean on her book. “Kinship, I
had to write to one today,” she said.
“Maclay had never even heard of kin-
ship.”
WORD GOT OUT where white spaces
yawned in newspapers, where silence
threatened the airwaves, that English
marriage adviser Claire Rayner was
good value. So the remarkable Alan
Davidson, promotions manager for
Macmillan, had no trouble arranging
no fewer than 70 interviews. Mike
Walsh had her although she was going
on Bert Newton’s show; that doesn’t
happen often.
Rayner and Davidson took to the
road for a 10-day, five-State tour,
spending more waking hours together
than most married couples would want
to do.
Rayner, who writes for the London
Sunday Mirror, was appointed Cuddles
Ambassador for her paper while the
Mirror had readers write in to say why
she should deliver a cuddle to their rela-
tions in Australia. Cuddles were de-
livered willy-nilly (with pot-pourri from
her rose garden). Triplets, dressed
identically, received theirs on The Bert
Newton Show.
Rayner was of such ferocious energy
that she managed a Captain Cook
cruise, Joan Sutherland in Tales of
Hoffmann and the Centrepoint tower in
Sydney; the Impressionists at the Na-
tional Gallery and lunch at the High
Court in Canberra; and the 70 inter-
views.
She has written 70 books, of which
only one was remaindered when the
publisher went bust. Macmillan have
only one title, her Marriage Guide. It
was a tremendously successful publicity
tour, but whether it sold any books
Macmillan do not yet know.
GEOFFREY DUTTON’S Snow on the
Saltbush: The Australian Literary Ex-
perience, coming from Viking next
month, is only the second of five books
Dutton is producing within a year or so.
The Heritage of Australian Poetry came
from Currey O’Neil Ross a couple of
months ago and City Life in Old Austra-
lia will be published by them later in the
year. Australians at the Beach will come
from Oxford early next year and Angus
and Robertson will then publish
Dutton’s selection of 100 classic Austra-
lian books. Dutton has done a piece on
each book with biographical material
about the author.
BOOK PUBLISHERS tend to swoon at
a defamation settlement which would
make a newspaper reach for its petty
cash box. Penguin Books are still pick-
ing up the pieces after Inside BOSS, the
book about South Africa’s Bureau of
State Security, by South African spy
Gordon Winter.
The company has paid substantial
damages to three people, has apologised
to three and there is still a small queue.
Secretary of the parent company, Nigel
Williams, admits that Inside BOSS legal
suits have been a big financial strain on
the company. □


COVER STORY
How our Star Trek doctors
can see inside your body
Radiologist Dr Bill Sorby prepares a patient for the CAT scanner at Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney
New techniques and machines are taking medical science towards an
exciting and promising future. GLENNYS BELL investigates
the diagnostic and treatment procedures which could save many lives.
“I CAN walk! I can dance!” Jonas
Jancy jumps with glee, matching words
and action.
Jancy delights in demonstrating
skills most people take for granted. For
a while, he could neither walk nor run,
talk nor even hope. He lived with a
timebomb in his body ticking off his life.
Jancy had in his neck an inoperable glo-
mus tumor, a benign but parasitic
growth like an engorged ball of blood.
It was feeding off blood from the
arteries that normally served the brain,
starving it of oxygen, but it was also
growing and spreading, gradually in-
vading his brain.
Jancy is alive today talking, walk-
ing, jumping and hopping because
doctors were able to defuse the blood
bomb, using interventional radiology
and imaging technology that are quietly
revolutionising medicine.
With new techniques and technol-
ogy, doctors are seeing inside the body
as never before, scanning its secrets, un-
locking its mysteries. They are pushing
medicine into unexplored ter-
ritory; the space age medicine
of Star Trek.
Summing up succinctly the
rapid changes that have taken
place in radiology, Dr John
Hunt, Director of Radiology
at the Royal North Shore
Hospital in Sydney, said: “It’s
all because of the microchip
computer.”
His colleague, Dr Bill
Sorby, compared the develop-
ment of equipment over the past decade
with the jump from propeller-driven
planes to jumbo jets. “The problem is
most people, including the health bu-
reaucrats, still think of radiology as
chest X-rays.”
And at St Vincent’s Hospital, in
Darlinghurst, the Director of Radiol-
ogy, Dr Bruce Doust, said: “I’m run-
ning as fast as I can. But I’m pushing
my knowledge as far as it will go.”
For all of them, imaging is no longer
science fiction imagining.

The techniques and the
probes that are used are still
being explored. The equip-
ment is usually steamlined,
pushbutton, silent and ex-
pensive. The various methods
all have their proponents, all
competing for public money,
for apart from the cost a
lot of the techniques can be
performed only in major hos-
pitals.
AT THE Royal North Shore Hospital,
in a tiny, dark room cramped with ma-
chines, a man who has suffered a stroke
is lying on his side on a trolley, watch-
ing the most engrossing television show
of his life.
He is seeing inside his body. On the
small screen that shows images from an
ultrasound machine, called a Duplex
Scanner, he can see under his skin to the
tissues and blood vessels.
It is like watching a black and white
movie of a stormy sea, with waves

rolling and surging across the screen. In
the centre are two circles, rather like the
tubes formed when waves curl on them-
selves to provide spectacular rides for
surfers.
One of them is his right carotid ar-
tery, the other is the jugular vein. These
are the vessels which carry blood to and
from the brain. Just below the chin, the
carotid artery divides into two, with one
artery going to the face and the other to
the brain. It is at this point, where the
artery forks, that trouble occurs. It can
plug up with plaque, the fatty deposit
that causes hardening of the artery.
Clots can break off and lodge in the
brain. A stroke, often sudden death, is
the result.
The Duplex Scanner, which costs
about $BO,OOO and combines Doppler
effect with computer science, acts like
arterial sonar. It picks up the turbulence
or “bruits” caused by the obstruction in
the artery by bouncing ultrasound off it.
Variations in the sound caused by the
speed of the blood surging through the
narrowed artery are then captured in
images and sound.
AT THE Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC) at Lucas Heights on the southern
outskirts of Sydney, a technician stands
absorbed in front of a glass screen in a
long, enclosed room. He is engaged in
the simplest of operations: screwing the
lid on a tiny bottle of fluid. Through
protective gloves, the technician is man-
ipulating two long levers, with flippers
on the ends which grasp the bottle and
its lid.
It is one of the familiar images of a
nuclear reactor: action by remote con-
trol. The fluid is radioactive, an isotope
produced by the AEC for use in nuclear
medicine. The screen and gloves are
part of the elaborate safety precautions
designed to protect workers at the plant
from the hazards of radioactivity.
The radio-isotopes are made from el-
ements which are bombarded with neu-
trons in the reactor. They are created for
medicine, designed to cluster in the
bones, tissues and organs of the body so
they can be filmed and studied. Like
deadly flowers, they begin to wilt short-
ly after they are plucked so only those
which take a while to decay a half life
of a week or so, as scientists measure it
are made.
The scientists are limited by the type
of reactor and the distances involved in
distributing the radio-isotopes around
Australia. At Lucas Heights, they make
technetium, gallium and iodine iso-
topes. They do not make krypton or
very short-lived isotopes but they would
if they had a cyclotron.
The tiny bottles containing the radio-
isotopes are packed in lead containers
and plastic kits for delivery to about 80
hospitals and clinics around Australia.


Some end up at the nuclear medicine
department at Sydney’s Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital. It is a small, nonde-
script brick building separated from the
main hospital. There are few windows,
few amenities for the anxious patients
waiting for diagnostic tests. Among
them is a patient who is to have a lung
scan.
Dr George Bautevich is filling in for
the head of the department, Dr John
Morris. He explains that lung scans are
one of the most frequently ordered tests.
Blood clots can form in a vein and if
they break off and travel in the
bloodstream they often lodge in the
lungs, which has lots of small blood ves-
sels that act like a sieve.
The patient sits in a chair
in front of a gamma camera
which is to film his heart and
lungs from the front, side and
back. He, too, has his own
television screen but this time
the movie is in color.
Technetium containing
particles are the agents being
used. They are designed to
concentrate in the lungs.
Within seconds of being in-
jected, the radioactive par-
ticles show up on the screen
like a school of silvery green fish, fan-
ning out into both lobes of the lungs. If
there is an embolism a blockage
caused by a clot it will show up as a
dark patch of seaweed among the fish.
On one side of the screen a normal
heart is projected for comparison. It is
not the conventional image of a heart
recognised from by-pass and transplant
stories. It is a pulsating mass of fire-
works, with color sparking in and out
with every beat.
On the other side of the screen is the
heart being investigated. It is working
inefficiently, particularly its left ven-
tricle, the bottom chamber which pumps
oxygenated blood into the aorta, the
main artery which distributes blood
around the body. The chamber expands
slowly like a balloon, then squashes flat.
It looks slothful.
With the aid of a computer, the
heart’s function, the amount of blood
remaining after each beat and the extent
of the damage can be measured.
Lung scans are not the only ones
done in the department. Whole body
scans and scans of particular parts of
the body, from abdomen to liver to kid-
neys, also are done.
Not all patients, however, can see
their own scans. In many cases they lie
on tables which slide over a gamma
camera as it films parts of the body.
Cameras cost $lOO,OOO to $150,000.
There are five of them at Royal Prince
Alfred.
The results usually are put on film
much the same as conventional chest X-

rays but heart scans are computerised
into images that allow the pumping ac-
tion to be shown. In these cases, the
heart can be seen on color television.
IN THE radiology department at Royal
North Shore, Dr Jim Roche is super-
vising the morning’s angiography. This
procedure takes pictures of the blood
vessels at work. In one room, Dr David
Brazier is preparing an elderly woman
who has suffered a series of mini
strokes.
Everyone wears blue scrub gowns
and the rooms, with overhead lights and
tables, look similar to operating
theatres, except for the large signs on
the door warning of radiation. The
doors and walls are lead-lined
and the staff wear lead aprons.
Brazier can clear the floor
with one word: “Shooting”
not bullets but radiation.
Angiography is a delicate
but simple procedure. Brazier
has inserted a needle into the
femoral artery on the right
side of the woman’s groin and
passed a catheter along the ar-
tery toward the heart. Brazier
is able to direct the catheter
through the aorta and then
into the carotid artery.
He explains: “Her doctors are wor-
ried about narrowing of the arteries to
her brain, whether the flow of blood is
being impeded or whether there is clot-
ting on the side of the artery with the
danger of pieces breaking off and going
to the brain.”
The woman has been sedated so she
is relaxed and drowsy but not uncon-
scious. She has to be able to follow in-
structions; to lie still when photographs
are taken or to move her head when
required.
She feels nothing as the catheter
snakes along her arteries but when
Brazier injects a contrast dye, which al-
lows the blood vessels to be seen for
filming, she may feel hot or uncomfort-
able momentarily. Next door, a man
whose angiography has been completed
remarks that he felt only a slight flush
on his face and no discomfort.
Brazier is not only making a conven-
tional film of the woman’s head and
neck but also doing a second run for the
digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
equipment, which the radiology depart-
ment is testing over a six-month period.
When the moment for filming ar-
rives, Brazier clears the floor, gets be-
hind a portable lead shield to protect
himself, then presses the button which
injects the dye. At that moment the radi-
ographer, sitting in front of her control
panel, starts to record.
DSA is based on much the same idea
as television transmission. The photo-
graphs are made up of dots and a com-
puter can unscramble them and project
them on to a screen.
Digital subtraction angiography
means that radiographer Fiona Parks
can add or subtract from the picture ac-
cording to the features she wants to
highlight. On conventional film, items
such as ribs or spine can spoil the clarity
of the blood vessels. Parks can be an
artist in imaging, brightening or darken-
ing, contrasting or wiping out the pic-
ture. The clearest and most acceptable
films are then selected and stored.
With more advanced attachments,
digital subtraction angiography is being
used like a tracking camera, following
dye in the blood vessels like a plane fly-
ing low over a flooded river.
It is not only the radiologists who are
being confronted by new technology
trauma. Parks finished her training only
seven years ago yet much of what she
learned is already obsolete. “I’ve had to
learn all this on the job because a lot of
the training I did is out of date.”
Radiographer Mary Louise Parsons prepares a patient for angiography
Nearby, in the CAT scan control
room, radiographer Charles Smuts is
poised over the übiquitous screen,
scrutinising images from a head scan.
CAT stands for computerised axial tom-
ography. It, too, is part of the microchip
revolution in radiology.
The CAT scanner has been around
since 1970. Essentially, it is a revolving
X-ray machine. It travels in a full circle
around the body and the electronic sig-
nals are unscrambled by a computer,
which assembles them into black and
white images thrown up on the control
room screen.
The CAT scan requires no injection
but it does mean exposure to radiation.
For the patient, the risk has to be
balanced against the benefits of accu-
rate and quick diagnosis.

Radio-isotopes define the beating heart: normal (left), abnormal (right)
ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED HOSPITAL SYDNEY
Tomography comes from the Greek
word, tomos, to slice, and that is what
the CAT scan does.
It films slices of the body at intervals
as small as I.smm. Fans of Shogun
might imagine the effect if a blood-
thirsty samurai used his sword to chop a
human being into slices with the same
deftness as a Japanese chef prepares
radish fans or sukiyaki.
For radiologists Sorby and Roche,
the CAT scan provides far more ana-
tomical detail than X-rays. It has
changed the nature of their work. Once,
most doctors could read an X-ray and
pick up abnormalities. CAT scans re-
quire far more expertise and experience
but they also provide far more informa-
tion.
Sometimes that information can be
deadly. Lesions, cancer or tumors can
be identified because they have a differ-
ent density from surrounding tissues
and bone. CAT scans pick them up
much earlier and far better than con-
ventional X-rays. As Roche says: “Oc-
casionally, we pass death sentences but
because we catch some cancer so early,
we can commute them.”
THE CAT scan and angiography are
paving the way towards a new kind of
medicine, a non-surgical procedure
called interventional radiology. Jonas
Jancy is a survivor who has proved the
efficacy of the combination.
His trouble began three years ago.
He was having lunch with colleagues
when suddenly he felt ill. He collapsed
and was taken to Sydney Hospital.
When he recovered consciousness, he
was told he had a severe viral infection
and was sent home.
It was the beginning of a journey
through pain and despair. Instead of re-
covering, he found himself growing
worse. He couldn’t talk, he couldn’t
walk without support. He went from
doctor to doctor and hospital to hospi-
tal.
He ended up in the radiology depart-
ment at Royal North Shore. Earlier, in
November 1980, he had had a CAT scan
which had indicated a stroke. “I was
told I would never walk again,” Jancy
said, “so I thought: ‘That’s it.’ For eight
months I sat in a corner.”
The CAT scan had been done on
an early-model machine. Jancy’s
neurologist wanted to know more, so
she sent him to Roche. Roche did his
own scans on the latest equipment
available and discovered the glomus
tumor.
It was a satisfying moment for
Roche. At least there was no brain dam-
age due to a stroke. But for Jancy the
new diagnosis held foreboding.
He said: “They told me I had a
tumor the size of my fist inside my head,
right on the artery. I knew it was
dangerous and they couldn’t operate. I
accepted I would die so I went home
and made my will. And I prayed. Two
weeks later my neurologist rang to say I
was being admitted to North Shore.”
Jancy was a candidate for in-
terventional radiology to be performed
by Sorby. Jancy said: “He told me,
‘Maybe you won’t wake up. Maybe
you’ll die on the table.’ I knew it was his
first time for the operation. But I
thought, better dead than a vegetable, so
I told him to go ahead.”
Though a life was at stake Sorby
used a procedure not much different
from that performed on the stroke vic-
tim undergoing angiography. He in-
serted a catheter into the carotid artery
but instead of shooting dye into the
blood vessels he sent tiny balloons, a
few millimetres in diameter, into the
vessels supplying blood to the embol-
ism. The object was to block these ves-
sels and divert the blood to follow its
normal course up the carotid to the
brain.
The operation worked. The embol-
ism was starved of blood and shrivelled
away. And as Jancy now exclaims: “I
can walk! I can dance!”
Embolisms are a Sorby speciality.
Another patient sent to him was a
woman of 21 who was facing a hyster-
ectomy because she was close to bleed-
ing to death. Some time earlier she had
had a gynaecological operation, a dila-
tion and curettage, and something had
gone wrong on the wall of her uterus.
An artery and vein had been pushed
together accidentally, resulting in a
traumatic arteriovenous fistula, another
massive ball of blood.
Sorby again used his catheter proce-
dure to block off the artery and vein but
this time he used a superglue to seal the
blood vessels. Six months later the
young woman was checked and was
told she could still look forward to
having children.
Roche also specialises in fishing for
gallstones. Sometimes when surgery is
performed to remove gallstones one or
two are left behind. Ten years ago, a
second operation would have been per-
formed. Today Roche retrieves them,
using the tube left in after the operation
to drain off bile fluid. Roche sends his
catheter down the tube and then uses a
wire with a flexible hook at the end to
fish out the stones.
Compared with the trauma of sur-
gery, the procedure is simple, as is all
interventional radiology. It just requires
skill, dexterity and nerve.
Interventional radiology is still at the


pioneer stage as medicine pushes into
the space age. As Roche says: “I’m still
standing in the slips, catching the odd
ball. I’m not the batsman or bowler.”
At the moment, there are fewer than
10 radiologists performing these proce-
dures in Australia. For all of them there
is the thrill of discovery as they record
new “firsts.”
At St Vincent’s recently, Bruce Doust
for the first time put a new tube down
the track left behind by a drainage tube.
The first tube had been removed too
early and had to be replaced. Rather
than subject the patient to another oper-
ation, Doust went to work with his col-
lection of catheters.
At first, interventional radiology
often was a last resort. “We’ve gone past
that now,” says Doust. “In a lot of cases
it’s regarded as the best way of doing
some procedures.”
Catheters are being used to drain ab-
dominal abscesses as well as to cut off
the blood supply to tumors. Overseas,
balloon catheters are being inserted into
constricted renal arteries to dilate them
in people suffering hypertension. Cath-
eters are used to crush kidney stones,
clear obstructions in the bile duct or re-
place damaged ureters, which carry
urine to the bladder from the kidneys.
Radiologists are just beginning to
discover the possibilities opened to
them. Certainly, many of the proce-
dures are changing if not supplanting
traditional surgical methods. It caused a
frisson among the surgeons when first
introduced but Sorby said: “I don’t
think surgeons feel they are under
threat. Once they saw the various proce-
dures they recognised interventional ra-
diology was complementary.”
But interventional radiology may
eliminate some surgery performed
routinely today. There are suggestions
that balloon catheters and laser beams
may be used eventually to dilate coron-
ary arteries or blast them free of de-
posits, thus eliminating today’s com-
mon coronary by-pass surgery.
CAT scans and angiography have
played a large part in reducing much
exploratory surgery but they have had a
dramatic effect on brain surgery. Dr
Robin Rushworth, a neurosurgeon and
clinical lecturer at the University of
New South Wales, said: “Once, if we
wanted to film the brain, we had to in-
ject something air, for example into
the cavities. It was uncomfortable for
the patient and time-consuming for
everyone concerned. It used to take
hours. With the CAT scanner, it takes
minutes.”
More accurate, more specific and
less traumatic diagnosis has made a tre-
mendous difference to the treatment of
head injuries, strokes, brain tumors and
haemorrhages.
Rushworth can tick off the advan-
tages and benefits from the new technol-
ogy one after another. More precise di-
agnosis means more precise markers to
pinpoint trouble spots before surgery is
undertaken. Neurosurgeons can see the
growths, the lesions, the clots and em-
bolisms before they go into the brain.
They can analyse and plan, measure
and mark off their procedure before the
scalpel touches brain tissue. As the joke
in neurosurgery goes: “One slip and
there goes 15 years of piano lessons.”
Dr Michael Appleberg, a vascular
surgeon who runs the vascular ultra-
sound unit at Royal North Shore, uses
ultrasonic waves as an aid in surgery.
Last year, he performed more than 100
operations on the carotid artery in
stroke victims. Ultrasound was used for
before and after pictures of the blood
vessel and even in the operating theatre
to check that the artery was clear. He
uses ultrasound to pick up aortic aneur-
isms and aneurisms and abnormalities
in the blood vessels behind the knees;
all conditions associated with heart dis-
ease.
ULTRASOUND, digital subtraction
angiography and CAT scanners will be
joined next year by a further advance in
medical technology: MRI, or magnetic
resonance imaging. Some radiologists
claim it is as much a revolution as the
introduction of the X-ray. There are
sceptics, however, who question
whether it is simply a more sophisti-
cated form of high-cost technology; an
expensive substitute for the already ex-
pensive CAT scanner.
CAT scanners, too, were a controver-
sial innovation because they were seen
as adding to the health-cost bill without
necessarily adding to the health of the
nation. In the United States it is es-
timated that diagnostic tests many es-
sential but many ordered to protect doc-
tors from malpractice suits account
for 25 percent of all hospital bills, 10
percent of the national health care bill
and 1 percent of the US Gross National
Product.
In Australia, the Royal Australasian
College of Radiologists, responding to
criticism of radiology costs, estimated
that payments for private radiology ser-
vices between 1979-81 and 1981-82 rose
by 57 percent while the volume rose by
nearly 28 percent. The cost in 1981-82
was $156.6 million.
CAT scanners cost around $300,000
to $1 million, depending on type, and
medical benefits payments for a scan
range from $7B to $275. There are four
CAT scanners for each million of popu-
lation in Australia, compared with 1.3
in Britain, 2.4 in Denmark, 6.7 in Am-
erica and 14.3 in Japan. In 1983, Austra-
lia had at least 70 CAT scanners, the
majority in private practice.
In 1983, only eight of the 27 major
referral hospitals in Australia had a
modern CAT scanner. St Vincent’s Hos-
pital has none while until recently
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital had only
a head scanner. The rest of the CAT
scanners are in private clinics as a result
of federal and state government reluc-
tance to instal them in public hospitals.
The federal government is taking a
different approach with MRI. The De-
partment of Health has announced that
three hospitals will carry out an evalu-
ation program on the scanners. They are
the Royal North Shore in Sydney, the
Princess Alexandra in Brisbane and the
Sir Charles Gairdner in Perth.
Overall cost will be around $9.2 mil-
lion. Special rooms will be built to
house the equipment because of the
strong magnetic field the scanners cre-
ate.

MRI uses no radiation. It
works with computer-con-
trolled radio waves and mag-
netic fields. It acts as a giant
magnet on the hydrogen nu-
clei in the body.
It operates much like a
sergeant-major whose soldiers
are parading on a hot day.
One bellow and the hydrogen
nuclei about face, forming a
straight line, but soon they
start to wilt, lose energy and
the line falls apart. The computer re-
cords the differences and converts the
information into two-dimensional im-
ages of body tissues.
While CAT scans can show the ana-
tomical structure of the body, MRI goes
further and shows whether the organs
are healthy, because it can show chemi-
cal reactions in the body. Its possi-
bilities have yet to be explored in Aus-
tralia but radiologists overseas see it as a
way of diagnosing heart disease and
spinal problems, brain tumors and mul-
tiple sclerosis, earlier and more accu-
rately.
MRI is not the only scanner which
can provide analysis of body functions.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is
a combination of nuclear physics and
computer science. It uses radio-isotopes
as tracers in the body and the signals are
translated by the computer to show
chemical processes and reactions in
various organs.
PET is being used for research work
into mental disorders such as schizo-
phrenia; it is opening new avenues of
knowledge in epilepsy; providing infor-
mation on Alzheimers’s disease; in-
vestigating Huntington’s disease; and
being used to detect brain tumors.
Dr Robert Smith:
plans for AEC
KEVIN BROWN
Australia does not have
PET nor does it have a cyclo-
tron to make the short-lived
radio-isotopes used by it. This
year, the Atomic Energy
Commission has put forward
a proposal for not only a
cyclotron which it has
coveted for the past 15 years
but also a national institute
of nuclear medicine. It has the
support of both Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital in Sydney,
which would like to provide the site,
and the Austen Hospital in Melbourne,
which would also like a cyclotron.
The cost, including cyclotron at $2
million and special concrete buildings,
is estimated at around $2O million.
It is the second proposal for a re-
search institute put up by RPA. It also
has drawn up a feasibility study for a
cancer research foundation, at a cost of
more than $3O million, which would
compare with centres of excellence such
as the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in
Melbourne.
For the AEC, which currently mar-
kets radio-isotopes valued around $1
million a year, the cyclotron would pro-
vide a badly-needed product. Private
companies distributing imported radio-
isotopes have encroached on the AEC’s
domain in the past year or so. But the
radio-isotopes manufactured in a cyclo-
tron have such a short half-life some
only a couple of hours that they can-
not be imported and have to be used on
site.
The deputy director of the AEC, Dr
Robert Smith, estimates the new market
would be worth $1 million or more a
year to the AEC. A cyclotron and as-
sociated research institute also would
revitalise the organisation.
Though experimental work is
carried out at the nuclear re-
actor research into irradiat-
ing food to prolong life, for
example its primary func-
tion is the manufacture of
radio-isotopes.
Despite intense lobbying
on the part of the AEC and
RPA, the Department of
Health has reacted coolly
toward the proposed cyclo-
tron and research institute.
Though PET is seen by
many radiologists as a comp-
lementary and important part
of imaging, nuclear medicine
is regarded by many as a dy-
ing branch of medicine. It is
being overtaken rapidly by
new developments in imaging
and genetic engineering.
Doust is one radiologist
enthusiastic about the future,
though after a period working
in America he also sees
danger. “Physicians there have become
traffic cops,” he said. “Pathology to the
left and radiology to the right. To a
large extent, it’s because they’re worried
by malpractice suits and use diagnostic
tests to back up their own diagnosis.”
In Australia, the physician and gen-
eral practitioner still play important
roles. Radiologists warn against using
expensive diagnostic tests for screening;
symptom-free screening as it is called. It
is poor and expensive medicine.
Rather, radiologists believe all
imaging from ultrasound to MRI
will become an established part of the
diagnostic process. As Doust said: “All
have their strengths, all have their
weaknesses.” Their value is not only in
detecting disease but also in pinpointing
where it is, what it is, how it is progress-
ing, spreading or contracting. It is infor-
mation which can be used in treatment,
though radiologists do not guarantee
more cures or greater life expectancy.
As Sorby said: “We may be able to
measure the cost benefit ratio of CAT
scans but how can you measure cost in
relation to the quality of care, when
earlier and better diagnosis means
earlier treatment, maybe less surgery
and less time in hospital? Or maybe just
peace of mind because results are
quicker.”
If the past decade has been exciting
then the next promises even more.
While the growth in new computerised
technology probably has peaked, the
main development will be in its applica-
tion, in interventional radiology.
A visionary may well see the day
when doctors are all like Star Trek’s Dr
McCoy, passing a sensor probe over the
body, detecting disease and treating it
without the trauma of surgery. □


TELEVISION
It won’t be
all Greek
after this
Elizabeth Alexander and Barry Otto in Singles: tight and witty
By GERALDINE WALSH
FOR THOSE suffering from acute
Olympic dyspepsia Channel 0/28 is
offering some mental exercise for brains
that, over the past two weeks, have be-
come Norm-atrophied.
On Monday, August 13, at 6.30 pm
0/28 will premiere a 10-part BBC series,
Greek Language and People. Each
weekly program runs for only 25 min-
utes and all would-be tourists to Greece
and the Greek islands should tune in.
The series doesn’t attempt to turn the
viewer into an advanced student of
Greek. It aims to assist the sybaritic
tourist to achieve the creature comforts
of life with greater ease during his visit.
A highly-photogenic Greek actress
and television personality, Katia
Dandoulaki, acts as tourist guide and
elementary language instructor to a
lanky English journalist, Chris Serle.
Serle is very much an Englishman
abroad. He admits to previous Greek
vacations which, considering his ignor-
ance of the language, suggest that on
prior occasions he must simply have
shouted very loudly in English to ac-
quire his basic needs.
Serle is not your dedicated tourist in-
tent on absorbing the culture of the
country. After short efforts on foot or
donkey his main interest is in ordering
retsina, ouzo and/or coffee at cafes
whose chairs and tables don’t want to
accommodate his crane-like legs.
The series raises doubts about the
productivity of Greece. The women
work but the men seem to spend all their
time in the kafeneios (from which
women are barred) drinking alcoholic
beverages and Greek coffee in its many
forms. All the while they worry their
worry beads and discuss the important
things of life such as politics.
Although the series deals with the
simple and essential tourist vocabulary
needed for ordering meals and drinks,
asking the way, greeting and addressing
people, buying things and getting
around it becomes clear that for a for-
eigner. Greek is a difficult language.
Surprisingly, the BBC series which
will follow Greek Language and
People on 0/28, Russian Language
and People, is far more instructive and
far easier to follow. The format of this
weekly 20-part series, due to start on
Monday, October 22, at 6.30 pm, is more
structured and uses television more
effectively. It is not as laid back and
touristy, perhaps because Russia is not a
laid back tourist resort. The program is
a little like an adult Sesame Street using
repetition and graphics in a lively, pain-
lessly didactic way.
The presenters in Russian Lan-
guage and People are far more attrac-
tive. Tatyana Vedeneeva takes the
viewers into the streets to meet the
Russian people, few of whom have suet
pudding faces. Tanya, George Feifer and
George Ochagazia do the studio work.
Both series will have a book ($19.95)
and audio cassettes (Greek, two for
$19.95, and Russian, three for $29.95) to
complement them available through
SBS Marketing, GPO Box 21 Sydney.
Channel 0/28 has scheduled for Sat-
urday, August 18, at 7.30 pm an hour of
sheer joy: Showcase Bill Irwin in Per-
formance, from the American Public
Broadcasting Service. The riotously
funny review takes the mickey out of
every aspect of pretentious new theatre
and its equally pretentious critics and
audiences.
Irwin is a multi-talented performer
dancer, mime, clown, juggler and com-
edian. His piano player, Eddy (Doug
Skinner), tries to keep the madness
under control, delivers with a sombre
face polemics on the new theatre and,
for his trouble, gets shot.
Michael Connor, as the persistent
and obnoxious critic, epitomises the
commentator who would leave a
reincarnated Shakespeare slack-jawed
as to what the good Will really meant.
At the level of pure loony entertain-
ment, children will love it. But some
precious adult theatregoers may squirm
a little as they feel the air going out of
their inflated views. Regardless of the
level of enjoyment it is a welcome
change from cloying Americana.
The ABC had a good idea in prin-
ciple with Singles, starting on Tuesday,
August 14, at 9pm. It’s a series of five
self-contained plays, each of 50 min-
utes. Allison Kirk plays Elizabeth, a 33-
year-old GP who has just broken up
with her live-in lover of seven years. To
add to her distress (which is incompre-
hensible because he is a creep) he is
underfoot for the first two episodes as
he is a partner in her practice.
Through a singles agency Elizabeth
meets five men. Her relationship with
each in turn is the subject of an episode.
Through them she is meant to discover
herself as an independent woman.
Producer Martin Williams uses the
latest craze a different scriptwriter
and director for each episode. This cer-
tainly shares work experience but
doesn’t do much for continuity and
characterisation and dialogue.
For most of episode one Elizabeth is
so hysterically neurotic that her medical
licence should have been revoked tem-
porarily in the public interest. The ac-
tors can do little to overcome the script.
Things pick up in the second episode
with writer Michael Atkins, director
Riccardo Pellizzeri and the sexy Robert
Coleby as Jack. Here the script is tight
and witty. Only the boiler-suited among
the Australian female population could
fail to enjoy it. After all, what woman
can resist a fun-sharing, good-time
Charlie who is a genuine 95 percent
cad? □


And now... Chariots of Bodyline Marbles
PHILLIP ADAMS
A FEW years ago, I had breakfast at the
Dorchester in London with David
Chariots of Fire Puttnam to discuss an
Australian-British co-production based
on the Bodyline Test series.
As I knew absolutely nothing about
Test cricket Puttnam had to give me a
crash course, explaining how British-
Australian relations had almost come
unstuck when, all of a sudden, the crick-
et ball had been used like a
hand grenade.
“It was the end of amateur-
ism in sport and the beginning
of sport-as-war.” Puttnam
said. “Just as Chariots of Fire
was more than a film about
running, Bodyline will be
much more than a film about
cricket.”
Such was Puttnam’s inten-
sity of conviction that I got
quite excited and started re-
searching things at the Austra-
lian end. Then along came
Kennedy Miller with plans
for their mini-series.
However, I refuse to be
petty and small-minded about
this unwarranted intrusion.
Instead I’m about to make a
mini-series of my own called
Marbles. Mind you, it won’t
be just about marbles. It will
be a political and metaphys-
ical statement based on the so-
ciology and politics of a game
that has been played for
millenia.
I see the opening sequence quite
clearly. A grubby finger traces a circle in
the dirt of a primary school playground.
There’s a surge of Vangelis-style elec-
tronic music and we cut to close-ups of
two boys. One is Australian and the
blue antipodean skies are reflected in
his clear, clean eyes. The other is a hiss-
boo Pom, his bastardry etched in the
narrow, squinting eyes of the colonial
bully.
As the game progresses, we see that
the Australian fires his agates and reels
in a crisp, classical fashion whereas the
English kid, his soul corrupted by class
hatreds, is a fnudger.
Fnudging. A word that fills the heart
of every decent marbles player with
loathing and detestation. Fnudging.
That corrupt firing style that no decent
marbles player could tolerate.
I see the series running over a month,
with dozens of three-hour episodes. By
turning up the Vangelis very loudly and
by having back-lit, wide-angle shots
we’ll give the game of marbles the cos-
mic significance that it has, perhaps,
lacked. We will show that marbles is
really a microcosm of the universe; that
the colliding glass balls are a metaphor
for the intergalactic conflicts of asteroid
and planet.
Einstein once said that God does not
play dice with the universe. However,
I’m convinced that in the Creation, in
the Big Bang, God was playing marbles
with the universe. And that the Milky
Way is God’s bulging alley-bag.
THE Melbourne and Sydney film festi-
vals are, sad to say, running into deficit
problems. The question arises: have fes-
tivals done their dash? At least in their
present form? Established when Austra-
lia was afflicted sorely by both the tyran-
ny of distance and cinematic censorship
worthy of Northern Ireland, the festi-
vals now have to compete with every-
thing from video to Channel 0-28.
It’s also my belief, my fear, that 20-
odd years of television have caused, if
not irreversible brain damage, at least
abbreviated attention spans. As a result
of looking at television, where feature
films are blown apart by the shrapnel of
commercials, viewers now become rest-
less and agitated every few minutes.
People under 30 are no longer
capable of comprehending characterisa-
tion or perceiving plot. They spend their
time looking at rock-clips, the smorgas-
bord of surrealism on shows such as
Night Moves and Countdown. So the
answer is quite clear. Feature films must
be shortened significantly until they are
appproximately the length of TV com-
mercials.
This would not be entirely without
precedent. The movie-goers of yester-
day will recall the trailer, in
which all the best bits from
next week’s movies at the
Rialto or the Vogue were
spliced together in rapid suc-
cession with hyperbolic
graphics such as SEARING
PASSION and UNTAMED
EMOTION, just in case you
missed the point.
You may suspect that our
film directors would be aghast
at such a thought; that they
simply wouldn’t consider
making commercial-length
films. Not so. Most of them
already have or do. Most of
England’s top directors have
been making TV commercials
for years.
Take the notorious Ken
Russell, who made The Devils
and that preposterous biogra-
phy of Tchaikovsky. Russell
used to practise by making
Black Magic commercials for
Rowntree.
More recently, producer
David Puttnam snaffled Hugh Hudson,
Ridley Scott and the rest of his New
Wave directors from the London ad
agency where they had worked together.
And long before Fred Schepisi made
The Devil’s Playground, The Chant of
Jimmie Blacksmith, Barbarossa and Ice-
man, he was churning out ads for just
about every brand name in the country.
Come to think of it, Fred and I made
commercials together for almost 10
years. And I remember commissioning
Bruce Beresford to make a Tatts com-
mercial between Don’s Party and The
Getting of Wisdom. Even the sainted
Peter Weir turned out misty, wistful
commercials for the giant George Pat-
terson’s agency. From memory they
were for Cadbury confectionery.
And here’s a message that’s just been
handed to me: “The internationally ac-
claimed feature film directors,
Frederico Fellini and Franco Zeffirelli,
have been persuaded to make their first
commercials.” □

Edited by c ßsn Saw
Long before Larry Hagman became a
Texas tycoon, as in Dallas, he was an
astronaut named Tony Nelson. He
crash-landed on an island in the south
Pacific in 1965 and found a bottle con-
taining a stirring, 2000-year-old genie
named Barbara Eden. For five years in
the US, and ever since in other parts of
the world, including Australia, she
made his every wish come true. He must
have wished he could see her navel be-
cause she undoubtedly had one. But if
he saw no more than TV viewers saw, he
saw nothing, despite her bare-midriff
costumes. The 49-year-old Eden turn
will be anatomically correct when the
TV movie I Dream of Jeannie; 15 Years
Later goes into production. When or if,
that is: all NBC has of the series so far is
its title. And plans for the lost belly-
button.
Some years ago John Burls was Big in
Sydney radio. Then, perhaps with a care
for his sanity, he fled north to relax at
Gosford. But the blood was there: Burls
is now described, officially, as the Or-
ganiser of the annual Gosford Dunny
Derby, in which dunnies on wheels
“40 this year, in eight races,” said the
Organiser gleefully are raced around
a bush track. The racing teams, of three
to five jockeys, or jockettes, spend up to
six months building and decorating
their thunderboxes and in the main
race, in September, they start Le Mans-
style: a 10m dash to the dunny, trousers
around the ankles (“Tastefully,
though,” says the Organiser. “They
must wear shorts.”) It seems to be legit-
imate Australiana, but so is official
pecksniffery: the TAB has declined to
allow betting on the fixture.

On her way back to Australia for the
traditional “farewell” tour in Sep-
tember: distinguished bagpipe-fancier
Anna Russell. With performances such
as How to Write Your Own Gilbert and
Sullivan Operetta and her analysis of
The Ring of the Nibelungen, Russell has
been described by the London Times as
“the world’s funniest woman” and, for
quite a while, almost certainly was. For
eight years Russell, now 72, not only
called Australia home but, unlike other
claimants, actually lived here full-time:
from 1966 in Sylvania Waters, NSW,
and later in Kirribilli.
As W. S. Gilbert pointed out, kings and
queens may be able to handle “small
titles and orders for mayors and record-
ers,” but ... According to the London
Sunday Telegraph : Some years ago the
Queen was holding an audience at
which two distinguished people were to
be presented. The first was Cecil Day-
Lewis, the newly-appointed poet laur-
eate. The second was the ex-Governor
General of Australia, Lord De L’lsle,
who was to receive his insignia as Chan-
cellor of the Order of St Michael and St
George. Day-Lewis was introduced first.
HM said she would present him with his
insignia of office. The poet said he did
not realise there was such a furbelow.
Yes, insisted HM, and draped an elab-
orate gold chain around his bowed
neck. A few days later Day-Lewis got a
frantic call from the Palace. There had
been a terrible mistake and would he
please return Lord De L’lsle’s chain and
order.
Planning their annual cocktail-mixing
spectacular in Sydney, the Cinzano
people offered Lady Fairfax $5OOO for
any charity she cared to nominate, if she
saluted the judge. She served up a tipple
she called Cinzano Coquette: Cinzano

ange juice and a drop of cassis, in a
crystal and silver wedding goblet that
she and Sir Wokker Fairfax had used at
their 25th wedding anniversary.
In the Mathematics Olympiad which,
no matter how unlikely it sounds, actu-
ally took place in Prague last month,
Australia ran well, figured 15th in a

South Australian Michael Peake (Prince
Alfred College) and bronzes by New
South Welshboys Alan Blair (Sydney

(Knox).
Political/Literary Notes: In 1959 Ameri-
can author Gore Vidal was helping to
cast his play about a presidential con-
vention: The Best Man. An agent sug-
gested Ronald Reagan for the role of the
president, and: “We all had a good
laugh,” recalls Vidal, who is not what
the President might call The Right Stuff:
“Reagan was by no means a bad actor,
but he would hardly be convincing, I
said, as a presidential candidate. So I
cast Melvyn Douglas, who could have
made a splendid president in real life,
had his career not been rejuvenated by
the play’s success. Had I cast Reagan in
the role it would have sated his appetite
for the presidency, and we’d be much
better off.”

Book launches tend to be small and se-

tions: notably that of the Stockman’s

The Stockman, in association with
Lansdowne Press last week. The Hall’s
Dame Mary Durack, R.M. Williams and
Hugh Sawrey donated their writing and
art to the book, which will earn the HoF
$15,000 from Lansdowne. NSW col-
leagues felt the launch was worthy of a

people stormed the old Commonwealth

bought nearly 200 books at $35 a pop.

and fellow writers, Olaf Ruhen, Ron
Iddoh and Marie Mahood signing books
dumped over their shoulders, on their
laps, under their armpits and between
their feet. After the launch, people went
mad waving cheques and notes. The
night raised a chaff bag of finance for
the Ha 11... well, $12,500.
There was champagne, there were
strawberry pastries, a string quartet
played French airs and there were read-
ings from Beaudelaire ... and all of this
among the headstones at the Melbourne
General Cemetery; which is probably as
good a way as any in which to celebrate
if you must do it with the dead. Mem-
bers of the Melbourne Alliance Franca-
ise were celebrating well, observing
the passing of the city’s first French
Consul, Comte Lionel de Chabrillan,
there interred. He, the comte, was the
husband of the distinguished actress
and courtesan Celeste de Chabrillan,
better-known to her friends (among
them Lola Montez) as Mogador. The
fact that director Tim Burstall and
writer Alison Waters, who are working
on a TV series about Mogador, were at
hand may, of course, have had some-
thing to do with it all. Otherwise the
1984 observance of an 1858 demise was
something that could be explained only
in French.


Not a good impression in Canberra
DAVID M c NICOLL
CANBERRA on a wet winter’s day can
be a depressing place. I would like to be
able to say that The Impressionists, the
exhibition at the National Gallery,
made one forget the Canberra gloom.
Sadly, this wasn’t the case.
The Impressionists is a moderately
interesting collection which would be
improved greatly for the viewer if it
were possible to see the paintings as
they should be seen. But the lighting is a
disaster dim, too high, casting frame
shadow. The gallery must have made
thousands out of the queueing hordes
and surely some of this loot could have
been spent on proper preparation and
hanging.
The gloss covers on the paintings
have resulted in the darker works mere-
ly giving back reflections of the viewers,
like mirrors.
It is sad to have to be critical but a
fine concept such as the Australian Na-
tional Gallery deserved something bet-
ter and so did the public. But even the
poor lighting couldn’t destroy the magic
of many of the offerings and the gallery
has given people an opportunity to taste
the joys of great art works.
After The Impressionists I browsed
round the Australian section of the gal-
lery for a while. There is no doubt this
collection is magnificent. But after look-
ing at the French masterpieces I had the
feeling that (with the exception of
Drysdale, Rees, Dobell and a few
others) first-class Australian painting
seemed to peter out after 1930.
ONE of the critics discussing the tele-
vision show Bodyline pointed out that it
was hardly likely that Bill Woodfull, a
headmaster with top degrees and
specialising in English, would refer to
“Bertie laying in hospital.”
This “laying” gaffe is one of the com-
monest mistakes in the community
today. You will hear it from radio and
television commentators and also, sad-
ly, you will read it often in the papers.
Watch out for the next time you hear a
TV commentator saying “They spent
the day laying on the beach” or “There
were bodies laying about everywhere.”
TASMANIANS are inclined to be
touchy and one of the things which
makes them especially touchy is maps
of Australia which exclude the Apple
Isle. Apparently, and no doubt inadver-
tently, the acclaimed Sheraton Hotel
chain has been leaving Tassie off its ad-
vertisements.
Michael Hodgman presents the Royal Order of St Michael of Tasmania
A group of Tasmanians in Thailand,
or TITs, took up this matter with
Sheraton and the hoteliers were de-
lighted to restore Tasmania to its right-
ful place.
On his recent visit to Thailand, that
overpowering Tasmanian shadow im-
migration minister Michael Hodgman
took time out to congratulate two TIT
members at the Australian Embassy on
the success of their campaign. At a cer-
emony in Bangkok, Hodgman pre-
sented the Royal Order of St Michael of
Tasmania to two embassy TITs, John
Milne and Tim Oxley.
From the photograph I find it hard to
work out the intricacies of the ceremony
but it looks as though St Michael is
either begging for alms or expecting the
recipient to be ill.
THE IRISH jokes are never-ending. Sir
John Pagan, just back from London,
tells of the Irishman who walked into a
shop and said: “I want a Union Jack,
please. A green one.”
“We have no green Union Jacks,”
said the attendant. “Then what colors
do you have?” asked the Irishman.
“Red, white and blue,” said the attend-
ant.
“Then I’ll have a white one,” said the
Irishman.
I WAS surprised to read in some of the
papers criticism of the Los Angeles
opening ceremony compared with the
opening in Moscow of the previous
Olympics. One paper went so far as to
give Moscow a gold and Los Angeles a
silver.
In my view, the Los Angeles opening
won clearly because it was a fun open-
ing. What do a few fluffed lines matter?
There was a sensation of goodwill and
real enjoyment in the whole affair.
The Moscow opening was mag-
nificently staged and superbly drilled
but pretty solemn overall. Los Angeles
had an air of joie de vivre which was
missing from Moscow.
SYDNEY artist Sue Nagel has had con-
siderable success with her one-woman
show at the Maddern Gallery in Lon-
don.
Eighteen of the paintings were sold
and the gallery is delighted with the
continuing interest.
MORE ABOUT agents-general. West
Australian barrister Hal Colebatch
writes to say that although Australia
House helped him considerably on a re-
cent trip to London “nothing Australia
House could do compared with the de-
gree of support, help and co-operation I
received from the West Australian state'
office and the present WA Agent-Gener-
al and his staff.
“Apart from their detailed and per-
sonally committed interest in my work
they provided a back-up which would, I
believe, in the nature of things have
been impossible in a large bureaucratic
organisation and a degree of close per-
sonal contact that was quite invalu-
able.” □


OLYMPICS
Aussie battlers’ golden weekend
Australia’s Olympic gold medal drought finally broke with surprise
medals coming from the cycling, the track and field and the swimming.
LENORE NICKLIN reports on the great moments in Los Angeles.
WHAT HUNG around the Albatross’s
neck after the 200 m butterfly final at the
Olympic swimming pool was only a sil-
ver medal. The mighty 2m (6ft 7’/ 2 in)
West German swimmer Michael Gross,
nicknamed Albatross because of his
wing-span, had been beaten by an un-
known 17-year-old Australian called
Jon Sieben. In a day that had been
dubbed in advance Black Friday be-
cause of smog and traffic forecasts the
smog arrived but the traffic stayed clear
Australia won its first two gold
medals. Both were unexpected. The
Australian cyclists, with a little luck but
no expensive technology on their side,
rode to victory in the 4000 m teams pur-
suit and Sieben pulled off the biggest
upset in the swimming by taking four
seconds off his time in one day and es-
tablishing a new world record of 1 min-
ute 57.04 seconds. “It just went through
my mind that I was feeling good,” said
Sieben after the race. The little Aussie
Gross-buster Gross-buster being the
term the Americans use for anyone who
can beat the big German schwimmstar
comes up to Gross’s adam’s apple. His
last few surging strokes through the
water to touch first are still being
spoken of in awe.
While Sieben was swimming to vic-
tory another Queenslander was run-
ning, jumping and shot putting there.
Twenty-four-year-old Glynis Nunn was
competing in day one of the two-day
seven-event heptathlon competition be-
ing contested for the first time in an
Olympic Games. At the end of six of the
seven events, with only the 800 m to go,
it was anyone’s gold medal. Nunn knew
she had to run a fast 800 and she did
but at the race’s end you needed not a
stop watch but a calculator. An exhaus-
ted Nunn was on all fours on the track
and the judges took 10 minutes to an-
nounce the results Nunn with 6390
points the winner from Jackie Joyner of
the United States with 6385. The only
time Nunn took her time was in the
doping control room. Thoroughly
dehydrated after the race she took two
hours to produce the necessary urine
sample. “Before I was told I had won, I
thought Jackie had beaten me by three
points,” said Nunn, hugging her toy
koala and, moisture restored, crying
happily.
In the first five days of the Olympics,
Australia had managed only a fistful of
silver and bronze. In this hype-capital
of the world, nobody even pretends that
the important thing is not to win but to
take part. Winning is coming first.
Everything else is losing.
When the US women’s gymnastics
team could manage only a silver medal,
instead of a gold like the men, the Los
Angeles Times wrote: “If there was
magic in the air, it was leftover, gone
stale, polluted by defeat ... the US
women, although they flew high, did not
fly quite high enough to escape the
ozone-layer of disappointment.”
The following day, Mary Lou
Retton did manage to fly high enough
to escape the ozone-layer of disappoint-
ment and beat Romania’s Ecaterina
Szabo by five one hundredths of a point
to win the women’s all-round title.
However, she has fewer admirers
than Gabriela Andersen-Scheiss of
Switzerland who literally staggered to
37th place in the women’s marathon
and whose final lap of the Olympic
Stadium was the slowest, most painful
and most heroic yet witnessed.
The Olympics has become such a
one-sided affair that even Americans are
wearying of the Star Spangled Banner.
The American television coverage of
the Games has been so one-sided that
the International Olympic Committee

Australia’s 4000 m pursuit cycling team - the Awesome Foursome take gold


has complained. What they most object
to is that medals won by countries other
than the United States often do not rate
even a mention. Coaches and athletes
are angry.
Perhaps in an effort to balance the
coverage the Sunday edition of the Los
Angeles Times in its daily score of gold
medals gave Australia six, causing great
consternation in the press corps who
had only counted three to that date. It
turned out they had confused us with
the Japanese.
However both jingoism and gold fe-
ver are catching. When the Australian
swimmers managed only second instead
of the hoped-for first in the men’s 4 x
100 m freestyle relay, one Australian
journalist protested: “I’m sick of
writing about these wackers ... even the
Huns have managed a couple of gold
medals.” The Australian relay team
swam magnificently three out of four
swimming their best times ever but
the Mean Machine was not quite mean
enough. Anchormen Rowdy Gaines
(US) and Mark Stockwell (Australia)
turned together but Gaines had saved
his legs for the final 50m and touched
0.65 of a second ahead.
The Australian hockey team won all
its early matches. In Saturday’s game
against India, which Australia won 4-2,
an official asked for the journalists in
the press box to stop barracking. The
crowd was for India, the press box for
Australia. After the game Ric
Charlesworth, the team captain who is
also a doctor, a member of parliament
and a not very lovable smartypants had
Jon Seiben, Australia’s Gross-busting 200m butterfly gold medallist
All-round woman athlete of the Games, Glynls Nunn shows off her heptathlon gold medal
his right knee packed in ice. He is also
treating himself for torn rib muscles.
Asked about the knee, Charlesworth re-
plied, “Sometimes a stick comes up and
hits you in the leg it seems to happen
particularly in matches against India.”
The start on Friday of the track and
field events meant for many spectators
the beginning of “the real Olympics.”
One American sportswriter complained
that “the bad thing about the Olympics
is that it legitimises trash sports every
four years.” On day one of the track and
field Australia’s Gael Martin shot
putted her way to a bronze medal with a
throw of 19.19 m. It was Australia’s first
throwing medal in an Olympics. Martin
said her legs usually went to jelly before
a big event but she had done some
weightlifting in the morning and that
had calmed her down. Asked if her hus-
band had watched from the stands, she
said: “No, he’s on the slopes at Fall’s
Creek with a girlfriend. I hope she’s
still a girlfriend.”
There has been no let-up in security
at the Games. Journalists’ word-pro-
cessors are searched daily. There are so
many security helicopters flying over-
head along with blimps and sky-
writing planes that television pictures
are constantly being broken up. At
Fairbanks Ranch, Del Mar, 200 km
south of Los Angeles, where 50,000
spectators including Prince Philip
watched equestrian events on a newly-
built golf course, sharpshooters from
SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics)
took up their positions on the surround-
ing hills and watched the crowd through
binoculars. Near the entrance to the
golf course was a truck with a large load
of sand “to put on any bombs” ex-
plained SWAT. The Australian eques-
trian team failed to live up to expecta-
tions. Wayne Roycroft was eliminated
when he took a wrong jump.
Not everyone is going to sporting
arenas. Five cinemas are showing the X-
rated Carnal Olympics. And the South
Korean team has denied barbecuing
snakes. The team has been barbecuing
snacks. This is official information from
the new rumor-handling section of the
Los Angeles Police Department. □

The areas of Turin, Milan and Modena, in Northern
Italy, have long been leading centres of high
performance automotive innovation. The home of such
legendary names as Ferrari, Maserati, Lancia, Alfa
Romeo, Bertone and Pininfarina.
New Toyota Supra is about to challenge such Euro-
pean exclusivity.
It has been described as the most exciting Toyota
ever, the flagship of Toyota technology, and with very
good reason.
Supra will be as impressive on our highways as it is on
an autostrada.
A welcome development from the Spartan style of
road warriors, to a luxury sports car that still has the iron
will of a Samurai without denying the driver or passengers
theircreature comforts.
SUPERLATIVE STYLING.
You simply have to look at Supra to see that it is a
supercar.
The wedge-shaped styling literally slips through the
air. With wind resistance cut to a mere 0.35 drag co-
efficient (the same as a Porsche 944).
The retractable headlights, built-in driving lights,
bumper and air-scoop combine to present a picture of
aerodynamic efficiency and elegant design.
A LUXURY INTERIOR THAT IS ANYTHING
BUT SUPERFICIAL.
Sit inside and you enter a world like that of Luke
Skywalker, ready to win the 'carwars'.
The instruments are completely digital. Concise and
easy to read. They feature a speed sensor, zone display
tachometer and fuel gauge, and a segmented water
temperature gauge.
Another impressive element is something the driver
will rarely look at, but always use. The sports driver's seat
is adjustable 8 separate ways, including something no
other car has in Australia, a pneumatic lumbar support.
And there are so many standard luxury features on
this anything but standard car, the only major options to
consider are electric sun roof, genuine Toyota air con-
ditioning and cruise control.
Supra is really in a class of its own!
ATRUESUPERPOWER.
If the engine is the heart of a true performance
sports car, Supra is in excellent shape indeed.
It is powered by Toyota's re-
markable new, low inertia Super
Responsiveengine.
A 2.8 litre, OHC 6 cylinder,
electronically fuel injected power plant that turns the
accelerator into an exhilarator. With engineering that
refines this raw ability into sheer driving enjoyment.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SUPERMAN.
Unlike some sports cars you don’t have to work like
Fangio to handle the excellent performance.
Supra's road manners are impeccable.
The flared guards house low profile 60 series tyres on
7" alloy wheels that hug the road.
The rack and pinion power steering, combined with
all-independant Toyota Suspension Tuning, and a limited
slip differential let you hug corners and straighten out
sharp curves.
You also have a choice of a snappy 5-speed manual
transmission, or responsive 4-speed overdrive automatic.
Not only does Supra go quickly, it also stops quickly
and surely with 4-wheel ventilated disc brakes.
The other thing that sets Supra apart from other high
performance sports cars is that you don't have to be a
Howard Hughes to buy it.
SUPRA. THE SUPERTOYOTA.
It is a car designed for people who take their driving
seriously, and place demands on their machinery.
So you get true European performance with the
solid, reliablecharacterthatdistinguishesToyota.
The new Supra proves that Toyota is well on the way
to becoming the new super power in affordable per-
formance.

What a silly little bogger
RON SAW
STIFFCAT and Bounser were no more
than a neck away from uniformity. Both
worked for West Australian Ingots or
something. Each wore a suit of grey
worsted and had receding, pale hair,
blow-dried within an inch of its life, and
a moustache of Carefully Trimmed
Toothbrush. But one’s tie was Mel-
bourne Grammar, the other’s the Royal
Prince Alfred Yacht Club.
Over pale scotches we had discussed
bulls, bears, cons and prefs and now, to
everybody’s relief, we had reached into
stopes and drills, sands and slimes.
Stiffcat, or possibly Boun-
ser, raised his eyebrows.
“You’re familiar with mining,
then? Have you ever, er ... ?”
“An old bogger from way
back.” I managed a manly,
knowing chuckle.
“Bogger? Heh-heh .. .
Er?”
“Bogger. Shoveller.” Had 1
any experience! How dare
these lounge-lizards, these
carpetbaggers, no closer to the
raw metal than a share-
broker’s counting-house, con-
descend to those of us who
had swung a shovel.
THE PERTH Daily News was
planning to send an edition
by air, daily, to Kalgoorlie
and I, newly but with no
special evidence of editorial
optimism appointed from
the ranks of the copyboys had
been sent as the office cadet reporter.
The office was controlled by an im-
mensely personable and immensely in-
experienced non-journalist named Max
Lambert; and our combined knowledge
of the mining industry and market
meant that for some months we could
find nothing to occupy our minds but
the fleshpots of Kalgoorlie, with par-
ticular reference to Hannan’s Ale.
I was prepared to grit my teeth and
carry on, ruinously expensive though it
was to a teenager whose salary and liv-
ing-away-from-home allowance totalled
only seven pounds a week. But Max felt
that our experience would be broad-
ened and a few of our debts paid if
we took on a little more paying work.
And after we had joined the union, reg-
istered as miners and submitted to tests
to prove that our lungs were free from
silicosis, we were taken on the morning
shift (midnight to Bam) of the Lake
View and Star mine at Boulder.
“We should be okay for dough now,”
said Max. “Some of those machine
miners are making 40 quid a week, you
know.”
“Whacko! Maybe they’ll want to
wait a while before they put us on to the
machines, though.”
I was right: They’d have been pre-
pared to wait almost indefinitely.
The Chaffers shaft of the Lake View
and Star didn’t fit my ideas of a gold
mine. I had in mind operating a sort of
stretched jackhammer at the end of a
long tunnel, my body shining in the
lights from the hard hats, a more or less
constant stream of little trucks, loaded
with glinting ore, running down a nar-
row-gauge railway.
But after the first sickening drop of
the elevator cage about two seconds
after, it seemed we pulled up at what
an apparently disembodied voice an-
nounced was “Six”: not the sixth floor
but the 600 ft level.
They had, it seemed to me, started
bravely but given up quickly at 600.
From a room or cave roughly oval
about 5m wide and 20m long, there was
a short tunnel or drive going nowhere
for maybe 3m. The shape was rather
that of a skinny, bob-tailed tadpole. It
was brilliantly lit. In the wall at one side
was a sort of hole and a huge pile of
rock and beside the pile, on a wooden
box, sat an aged, greyish man who
looked like nobody so much as the Hol-
lywood actor, Slim Summerville.
He climbed wearily to his feet. “So
there yers are,” he said. “Did yers bring
a drink o’ tea? No? Aw, well. Now,
where we’ve blasted out, here” he
meant the hole “they’re gonna throw
up a shed. But you gotta bog all this
muck” the rock “into this here
pram” a littlish metal cart on rubber
wheels “an’ get it down to the shaft.
We’ll get it away later. Okay?”
It was by no means okay. I wanted to
tell him that the glaring light was hurt-
ing my eyes and I was ready for a long
talk with him on the subject of shining
bodies and glinting ore but perhaps two
seconds after “Okay?” he had
vanished.
For the rest of the day I
hefted boulders, each weigh-
ing roughly five tonnes and
way beyond the power of my
shovel. Max made a mum-
mery of shovelling little
stones about the size of golf-
balls, puffing and blowing
and, every few minutes,
resting on the box formerly
occupied by Summerville.
The work was dismaying.
About five times I dropped
boulders on my foot. Once I
walked into the metal gate to
the shaft and a couple of times
I lurched into the hole in the
wall and fell over.
Old Slim came to get us
about Bam. I got back to my
hotel about 9am and slept for
12 hours.
Next morning the rockpile
seemed no smaller, Max used the box
no less and again I fell over a couple of
times in the little drive. But at knockoff,
instead of hurrying home to bed, we
hurried to the Boulder Block Hotel.
In fact, that became the drill for the
rest of the week. I can’t remember
whether I still got home tired. But at the
end of the week the rockpile was gone
and I came away with 17 pounds. It was
El Dorado.
It was Max’s custom to write, every
week, to the Daily News managing edi-
tor, Jim Macartney, and, in a postscript,
he said casually, “The weather is very
hot. My liver is playing up a bit. Ron
and I are on the morning shift at the
Lake View and Star. Is this all right?”
I don’t know why the boss bothered
with the telephone: I could have heard
him from Chaffers shaft: “NO! It’s
bloody well NOT! You and that young
bogger should have more sense!”
Well, I think it was bogger. □

The Gold Rush
In Los Angeles
To the surprise of many, the Hollywood Games were
actually dominated by the sporting events. But in a
blaze of world records and dazzling performances, it
was the United States’ dream team that stood out.
Things like this don’t happen in real
life —only at the Olympics. An unher-
alded swimmer from Australia, Jon Sieben,
took it, as they say in L. A., to the max —and
scored a stunning upset over West German
wunderkind Michael Gross in the 200-me-
ter butterfly. With no less flair for the dra-
matic, a piston-driven pixie named Mary
Lou Retton, who stands just 4 feet 9,
towered over the traditionally strong Ro-
manian women gymnasts by getting—
twice—the perfect 10 she so desperately
needed in the final exercise of her competi-
tion’s final round. And on the men’s side, as
Japan’s Koji Gushiken finally won the all-
around title that he had sought for so long,
little puffs of white chalk rose into the air,
A ‘V’ sign from Gross: An awesome display of versatility

making it look, from certain angles, as if the
übiquitous L.A. Police Department had
been dusting for dreams.
Many people never thought they would
see a Hollywood Olympics actually domi-
nated by sporting events. But to the almost
certain dismay of the boycotting Soviet
Union, that was the case at the halfway point
of the XXIII. The biggest shock of the week
was the tour de force perpetrated by Ameri-
ca’s athletes. By Saturday evening, they had
all but lapped the field in the gold-medal
race, with China —after a 32-year absence
from the Summer Games —running a sur-
prising second.
The United States was going strong from
the water-polo pool at Pepperdine to Coto
de Caza’s modern pentathlon
venue, all over Westwood and
down Doheny way. American
women cyclists captured their
first-ever medals, gold and
silver. U.S. wrestlers scored
a similar breakthrough in
the Greco-Roman competi-
tion, and boxer Mark Breland
lived up to his advance billing
by beating Canada’s Wayne
Gordon in an opening bout.
But it was The Miracle on the
Mats that nailed the world’s
attention. In women’s gymnas-
tics, Retton, 16, led the United
States to its first medal since
1948: a silver, in the team com-
petition. Then she roared back
and won the gold for herself in
the all-round. The U.S. on-
slaught reached such propor-
tions, in fact, that Juan Anto-
nio Samaranch, the president
of the International Olympic
Committee, formally protested
what he said was the overem-
phasis on American athletes by
ABC-TV. Network officials in-
sisted that the success of the
American team warranted the
extensive coverage, but other
critics charged that ABC’s

commentary and camera coverage were
sometimes jingoistic to the point of
diminishing the international flavor of
the Games.
Still, the exploits of the best foreign ath-
letes could not be overshadowed —not even
by Retton’s terminal spunkiness and the
unexpected victory by the U.S. men’s gym-
nastics team. In addition to the heroics of
Sieben and Gross, New Zealand’s Mark
Todd managed to beat the favored Lucinda
Green of Great Britain and a host of other
competitors in the three-day equestrian.
And even in defeat, Romania’s Ecaterina
Szabo provided unforgettable moments of
power and grace.
Ultimately, though, it was the swim team
that best demonstrated America’s new-
found athletic prowess; men, women and
assorted relay teams combined to win 21 of


in the men’s gymnastics team finals (from left, Dagget, Johnson, Gaylord, Hartung, Vidmar, Conner): Miracle on the Mats
29 available gold medals, and set 4 world
and 13 Olympic records. “It was worth all
the hell,” declared Rowdy Gaines, 25, a
veteran of the 1980 team that never went to
Moscow. Olympic Village bunkmates Car-
rie Steinseifer, 16, and Nancy Hogshead,
22, echoed that sentiment after they
finished in the first dead heat in Olympic
history—for first in the 100-meter freestyle.
“Tying,” said Hogshead, “made it twice as
good.” Even so, it was likely that the out-
come of many of the women’s events would
have been different if the Soviet bloc, par-
ticularly the East Germans, had been pres-
ent. That was less true in the case of the
men, where Gross, despite his defeat by the
17-year-old Sieben, put on an awesome dis-
play of versatility by winning two individual
golds and two silvers.
While the swimmers toweled off, track
star Carl Lewis began his quest for a quartet
of golds. He cruised home in the 100-meter
dash in 9.99 seconds, with teammate Sam
Graddy taking the silver. Then, to a full-
throated roar from 90,000 spectators, Lewis
ran a victory lap carrying an American flag.
Electrifying stuff: but as Lewis and team-
mates like hurdler Edwin Moses and Joan
Benoit —trying for a win in the first ever
women’s Olympic marathon —moved to
center stage in the Coliseum, they clearly
had a tough act to follow.
So did the Olympic city, which survived
in fine style even Aug. 3—a.k.a. Black Fri-
day, because of a combination of events that
was supposed to produce the ultimate
smoglock. On most days the freeways were
clear, the sky relatively clean, the chic eater-
ies and shops surprisingly empty. “People
don’t want to spend two hours eating dinner
in a restaurant when Mary Lou Retton is on
the balance beam,” noted a chef at one
gourmet take-out place. “They are enter-
taining at home in front of the television.”
And the games were Hollywood gold: a
hot ticket. It seemed that any event, no
matter how obscure or mystifying, would
do. When the L.A. Olympic Organizing
Committee conducted a “Faire” to dispose
of leftover tickets, one woman was injured
in the crush —and over at Murray’s Tickets,
co-owner David Andleman said, “It’s unbe-
lieveable —people are waiting hours for
anything. They’ll take team handball,
judo.” But the crowds, always orderly,
seemed to disappear into the mercifully thin
air as soon as each event was done. Oddly, it
was one of the few poorly attended events
that experienced something akin to an inter-
national incident: the Indian delegation


The Americans on their way to a 0-1 loss to Italy: In some sports the United States clung tenaciously to its losing ways
JOHN McDERMOT
complained to the LAOOC that pro-Sikh
demonstrators had seized and trampled the
Indian national flag during a protest march
outside the field hockey stadium.
Chasingßumors: With no serious security
problems to contend with, the LAPD con-
centrated on “rumor control. ” Onereport—
that a man with explosives in his car was
trailing an athletes’ bus —proved all too
true. But when another officer heard that
some Korean athletes were barbecuing
snakes, he checked and found not snakes,
“just snacks.” Nor were there any wholesale
harvests of prostitutes, as had been predict-
ed. “The word on the street,” said a confi-
dent Lt. Les Coil, “is that L.A. is not the
place for them to be.” Indeed, the only kind
of solicitors operating openly in the busy
Coliseum area were Moonies and other reli-
gious zealots seeking contributions in spite
of the posted rules. Things were so peaceful,
in fact, that police were insisting that crime
in certain sections had somehow dropped
250 percent —even though anything over
100 seems to imply that some lawbreakers
had switched to performing good deeds.
But the good vibrations were not being
felt everywhere. From Moscow, the Soviets
declared that the Games had lost their
“glamour and importance,” and hammered
away at what they called the “ruthlessness
and violence” prevailing in Los Angeles.
“Every day the Los Angeles Olympics more
and more reminds one of a minefield,” the
correspondent for Sovietskaya Rossiya
breathlessly reported. “Nobody knows . . .
where tragedy will occur, where some-
body’s life will finish.” Some Soviet TV
viewers were reportedly eavesdropping on
Finland’s coverage, but the Kremlin kept its
own radio and television coverage of the
Games to the bare minimum of simply read-
ing Tass reports over the air. No Soviet
newspaper—including the usually compre-
hensive Sovetskii Sport—even bothered to
print a complete list of results.
Elsewhere in the Boycott Bloc, the re-
strictions on coverage seemed to be a bit less
severe: In sports-mad East
Germany, for instance, the
Games were getting surpris-
ingly objective and extensive
play. The official Socialist
Unity Party paper, Neues
Deutschland, devoted a front-
page story to the opening cere-
monies. In any case, more than
75 percent of East German
households are able to pick up
Western telecasts of the events.
Meanwhile the French team
in Los Angeles was enduring
criticism of quite a different
sort. Before the Games, the
French Olympic Committee
decided to abandon the tradi-
tional costumes for its athletes
and switch to what it hoped
would be more contemporary
uniforms —a vest and shirt for
the men and a skirt, blouse
and hat in the same blue-and-
khaki color scheme for wom-
en. Unfortunately, the sup-
posedly snazzy new togs
opened to less than enthusias-
tic reviews in the homeland
of haute couture. The maga-
zine Paris-Match gibed that
the women resembled “meter
maids,” and one spokeswo-
man from the House of
Chanel dismissed the outfits as a “horror.”
But such concerns quickly paled in the
light of athletic excellence that shone in Los
Angeles. Take the Gaylord 11. When the
gymnasts marched into the pavilion for the
team finals, Mitch Gaylord was wondering
if he’d ever get a chance to display his patent-
Szabo: Even in defeat, she was graceful and powerful

ed high-bar maneuver—a supremely risky
flyaway somersault with a half twist. At that
point the Americans, who had a comfortable
1.05-point lead over the favored Chinese
after the compulsory round—and an even
bigger advantage over the once-powerful
Japanese—figured to coast through the
competition without taking too many
chances. But instead of exuding confidence
from the outset, the U.S. men seemed over-
wound: with the partisan crowd cheering
every practice maneuver, Tim Daggett, 22,
nearly injured himself by tumbling com-
pletely off the mat during the warm-ups.
Breaking Out: The Chinese, though, also
appeared to be feeling the strain, especially
when Li Xiaoping, one of their best pom-
mel-horse performers, inexplicably fell off
the apparatus and, instead of adding an-
other 10 to his collection, wound up with a
meager 9.35. But then the People’s Repub-
lic began, as their slogan goes, “to break out
and advance on the world.” Switching into
an obviously more conservative gear—and
forgetting the chants of “USA! USA!”
which they would later blame for “impair-
ing” their overall performance—the Chi-
nese turned in one 9.95 and two perfect 10s
on the still rings. Suddenly, they had pulled
to within. 6of a point of the Americans, who
thus faced a gut-wrenching choice: to low-
key it in hopes of protecting what was left of
their lead —or go for broke.
But with his adrenaline flowing and the
Chinese picking up further 9.95, Gaylord
would not be denied. His final self-instruc-
tion: “You’vejust got to catch that bar.” He
did, barely, and earned a 9.5 —but a magic
9.5 that somehow overshadowed the 10 that
Daggett scored immediately afterward.
After that, said Vidmar, “We knew we
couldn’t lose” —and in fact the Chinese
could get no closer than .6 of a point. Two
nights later, when Vidmar finished second
to Japanese legend Gushiken by a minus-
cule .025 of a point in the all-round
competition, a new era in men’s gymnastics
was at hand.
For Gushiken himself, however, the vic-
tory marked the end of a quest that has
spanned the last three Games. At the age of
27, he would ordinarily be considered all
but decrepit by the standards of his sport.
The 1976 Games should have been his
prime showcase. But in the two years prior
to Montreal he suffered two serious inju-
ries—a ruptured Achilles’ tendon and a
broken ankle —that cost him even a berth on
the Japanese team. The 1980 boycott
seemed to spell the end of his competitive
career. But he kept training and, he says,
“left Japan this time with determination to
win a sort of double gold, making up for the
one I missed in Moscow.” That grit was
certainly evident as Gushiken swept
through his routine on the final night, post-
ing a dazzling 10 on the vault, a 9.95 on the
horizontal bar and rings and 9.9 on the
other three events to capture the gold.
Japan breezing past China in the opening round of volleyball: Impressive
The American women are not far behind.
After years of serving purely decorative
purposes at major meets, they wound up .45
of a point behind the always-powerful Ro-
manians—and there were many who
claimed that if the scoring had been fair, the
two teams would have been dead even. The
grumbling centered around a Romanian
judge with a penchant for grading Ameri-
cans harshly. Bela Karolyi, a Romanian
defector who coached Nadia Comaneci and
now coaches Mary Lou Retton, was so an-
gered by the consistently low scores that he
suggested that the offending woman official
be “made to do agriculture.” Then he went
on to spill the beans about how the LAOOC,
after the Soviets announced their boycott,
had quietly agreed to pay a portion of Team
Romania’s Olympic expenses. U.S. coach
Don Peters was equally enraged. “I filed so
many protests today,” he said, “my fingers
are sore.”
Their objections, however, turned out to
be moot; an American official, it seemed,
had compensated for her Romanian coun-
terpart by marking the U.S. women dispro-
portionately high. But two nights later
there was another scoring squabble that
may have cost the Americans any chance
they had for a team gold. While the bal-
ance-beam judges argued over a disparity
in the marks awarded Kathy Johnson,
teammate Julianne McNamara was forced
to wait about eight agonizing minutes
before taking her turn. When it finally
came, her concentration was lost, and she
tumbled off the beam as she began her
routine, earning a miserable 9.2. “You
can’t keep your momentum when you’re
stopped for that long,” complained Peters.
Olympic Pressure: Even before that inci-
dent, though, the American women had
looked surprisingly ragged. One reason
may have been simple fatigue. After the
men’s victory, Peters noted wryly, the wom-
en “stayed up waiting for the guys to come
in from their celebration —but the guys
didn’t come in.” In the end, however, the


Olympic pressure seemed to be
weighing heavily even on the gold-
medal-winning Romanians. “No-
body was perfect tonight,” said
Johnson, at 24 the team’s senior
citizen, after the United States had
won the silver. “But the mistakes
that were made were mistakes of
excitement.”
Of course, that doesn’t explain
how Mary Lou Retton can look so
excited and manage to make al-
most no mistakes at all. Gifted
with a low center of gravity, and
powered by stocky legs that re-
mind sportswriters of fullbacks
and tree trunks, she is the sport’s
first industrial-strength perform-
er. The comparisons to Comaneci
and the Soviet Union’s Olga Kor-
but are inevitable, but neither of
those legends could vault as far or
stick themselves to the floor as
solidly as Retton. Nor has any
gymnast ever flaunted such ener-
gy—waves and smiles seem to be
an integral part of her every dis-
mount. “Mary Lou has opened a
new era in American gymnastics,” said
Karolyi. “Nadia was a great champion, but
Mary Lou is bigger.” The reason:
“She’s got the psychological power to go
through the most difficult moments with-
out falling apart.”
There were indeed several difficult mo-
ments during Retton’s quest for the indi-
vidual all-round gold. The first came early
on. Thanks to a 10 and several 9.9 s she had
earned in the previous rounds, Mary Lou
began the evening with a .15-of-a-point
advantage over Romania’s Szabo, 17, the
world champion and pre-Olympics favor-
ite. But that lead was quickly erased when
Szabo popped a 10 on the balance beam,
while Retton settled for a 9.85 on one of
Breland smashing Gordon: Living up to his reputation
KEN REGAN— CAMERA 5-ABC SPORTS
RED McLENDON-AP
Sieben exulting: Taking it to the max
her less favorite apparatus, the uneven
bars. After that, the competition was nip
and tuck until Szabo twirled around the
bars for a 9.9, and thus put the ultimate
pressure on Retton. “I knew what I need-
ed, a 10,” Mary Lou said later. “And I
knew that I’d get it.”
A Bear Hug: Fortunately, the rotation
had brought her to the vault, by far her
strongest exercise. With the crowd so quiet
you could hear the Nikon motor-drives
whirring, Retton roared down the runway,
hit the springboard—and then became the
first person ever to layout-Tsukahara her
way into America’s heart. “Olympic cham-
pion!” yelled Bela as he vaulted over the
retaining wall to administer a Romanian-
style bear hug. There was no
doubt about the 10, or about
Retton’s desire to prolong the
moment by going out and,
quite superfluously, scoring
another 10 on her second turn.
This was, after all, why she had
moved away from her family a
year and a half ago to study
with Karolyi in Texas, and
why she had traded a normal
school life for a correspond-
ence course. It was also why
she had undergone a risky knee
operation just six weeks before
the games—a fact that wasn’t
highly publicized until she was
wearing the gold medal. But
could she possibly ask for any-
thing more? Mary Lou consid-
ered that question for a split
second—and then said, “Yes, a
Porsche.” If only she had a
driver’s license.
In other areas, however, the American
athletes clung tenaciously to their losing
traditions. The soccer team dropped out of
the running early with a 1 -0 loss to Italy and
the United States was also a nonfactor in the
weight-lifting rounds. The big surprise in
weight-lifting was the emergence of the Chi-
nese, who lifted eight medals in the first nine
days. The People’s Republic was also doing
well in the shooting, where a fertilizer sales-
man named Xu Haifeng won the first gold
medal awarded at the ’B4 Games. Else-
where, though, the Chinese seemed to be
struggling a bit. Japan breezed past the Chi-
nese men in the opening round of the volley-
ball competition and the world-champion
Chinese women suffered a stunning upset at
the hands—and fists —of the U.S. team.
For some, inevitably, the pressure was so
great that they went too far in seeking an
extra edge. One Swedish pentathlete was
stripped of his points for illegally taking an
additional shot at a target when he thought
the judge wasn’t looking. And France’s
eight-man rowing team was given a free pass
into the finals after falling victim to a sabo-
teur; someone, it seemed, had filed down
one of their oarlocks so that it broke after a
few hard pulls. But the good news was that
the bad news was hard to come by. And, like
many people around the world, it was
buried in the sports pages.

Swimming Off With It
The gold-medal U.S. women’s freestyle relay team: Just one scene from a made-in-Hollywood week
KEN REGAN— CAMERA 5-ABC SPORTS
For America’s veterans, victory was especially sweet.
It was the first day of competition, the first
final of the swimming events. Americans
Carrie Steinseifer and Nancy Hogshead,
competing in the 100-meter freestyle,
plowed past Annemarie Verstappen of the
Netherlands and touched home, it seemed,
simultaneously. They looked anxiously at
the scoreboard —then gasped. The board
flashed a winning time of 55.92 seconds for
both. There was a pause, a wait for an
official ruling. When it came, Steinseifer
and Hogshead hugged and shouted with
joy. It was official: although the timing
devices on the pool wall could distinguish a
winner by a thousandth of a second, that
tiny difference was ruled insignificant.
“U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” roared the
crowd. The United States had won not one
gold medal, but two.
The dual golds—the first
time in Olympic history that
a single event has produced
two first-place medals—were a
made-in-Hollywood metaphor
for everything that followed.
By the time the swimming was
over, the U.S. team had run
away with 32 medals —includ-
ing 21 golds out of a possible 29.
But while the Americans
dominated, they were not the
only stars. The Canadians put
in a powerful showing, kicked
off by Alex Baumann’s world-
record setter in the 400-meter
individual medley—Canada’s
first gold medal in swimming in
72 years. Baumann followed
up at the weekend with another
world mark in the 200-meter
individual medley, but not before his team-
mate Victor Davis pulled down a gold med-
al in the 200-meter breast stroke. Another
Canadian, Anne Ottenbrite, also put in an
appearance on the top step of the awards
platform, winning the women’s 200-meter
breast stroke.
West German Michael Gross at times
seemed unbeatable; he ended the week with
a crescent of two golds and two silvers
around his neck. But even he was upstaged
at one point by Jon Sieben, a slight, unher-
alded Australian who won the 200-meter
butterfly. Sieben led a pack of young Aus-
tralians that captured 12 medals, the second
highest team total. Among them was sil-
ver medalist Mark Stockwell, who was
touched out by American Rowdy Gaines
Steinseifer and Hogshead in triumph: Not one gold medal, but two
DAN HELMS— DUOMO
after a controversial start in the
men’s 100-meter freestyle. The
Dutch women also made their
presence felt; after Verstap-
pen’s bronze, Petra Van Sta-
veren and Jolanda De Rover
picked up gold medals in
the 100-meter breast stroke
and 200-meter backstroke, and
the 400-meter freestyle re-
lay team claimed the silver.
For the American vets, the
success is especially sweet.
Many are survivors of the dev-
astating disappointment of the
1980 boycott; they hung on for
four more years in the hope of
gold, and won it: Hogshead
and Gaines, Tracy Caulkins
and Mary T. Meagher, and
team captain Jeff Float. It was
not easy for them to return to
their grinding training sched-
ules. “I wasn’t sure if the sacri-
fices were worth it,” said Hog-
shead, who dropped out of swimming in
disgust for a year and a half following the
boycott. Hogshead’s payoff for returning:
three golds and one silver. Caulkins, 21,
came back from despair. The winner of 48
U.S. titles in the last seven years, she was
favored for a handful of golds in Moscow.
“She cried,” remembers her mother, “and
that was rare.” Tracy lost her drive. “I
didn’t have a lot to point for,” she recalls.
“The motivation wasn’t there until this
year. I knew that after 13 years this would be
my first and last Olympics.” And last week
she burned, winning three gold medals.
Nineteen-year-old Meagher has been na-
tionally ranked in the United States since
she was 12, and snapped back from a 20-
pound weight gain to win a gold in the 100-
metgr butterfly. She, too, had considered
quitting. “Finally,” she said, “I’ve accom-
plished what I set out to do so long ago.”
Sippy Woodhead, 20, was favored to win
two gold medals four years ago and missed
her one chance at a gold last week by a
quarter of a second. But after
enduring a broken leg, mono-
nucleosis, chronic bronchitis
and four coaches in four years,
she was relieved to come away
with a silver. “The last 4 years
felt like 20,” she said. “I’m just
happy to have this medal.”
Woodhead’s was hardly the
most agonizing loss of the
week. That honor went to West
German Thomas Fahrner, 21,
who has lived in France since
he was 2 and speaks French
better than he does German. In
the morning qualifying rounds
of the 400-meter freestyle,
Fahrner, who had already won
a bronze at the 200-meter dis-
tance, swam a lackadaisical
heat and failed to qualify for
the finals. That same after-

‘The Albatross’ is the Games’ dominant swimmer.
His physique is rangy. His nose is beak-
like. And when he swims the butterfly, his
arms jut high out of the water like a pair of
wings, his finger tips almost grazing the
lane ropes. But Michael Gross’s nick-
name —“the Albatross” —only hints at his
range of talents. With sleek lines and power
to burn, the 20-year-old West German re-
sembles nothing so much as a stretch Mer-
cedes limo. “With a body like that,” said
George Haines, the dean of U.S. swim
coaches, as he watched Gross warm up last
week, “he’s just got to go faster.” Minutes
later, Gross exploded off the start for the
100-meter fly and sailed 15 feet through the
air. By the time he began churning the
water with his stroke, he was a
third of the way down the
pool—and on his way to an-
other world record.
By his repeated flashes of
brilliance last week, Gross
emerged as the dominant swim-
mer of the Games. He piled up
two gold and two silver medals
and beat the world record three
times. Even on the rare occa-
sions when he was out-touched
at the wall, as he was when his
come-from-behind elfort on the
anchor leg of the 800-meter re-
lay fell short, Gross exhibited
a formidable combination of
ability and determination. At
6 feet 7, Gross intimidated op-
ponents by his mere presence.
“When he walks into the ready
room it’s hard not to notice
him,” says U.S. swimmer Pablo Morales.
“Whenever you see a human who’s unique
in size and body, there’s an aura
about him.”
In Gross’s case, that aura is only en-
hanced by his quiet dignity and grace.
When he failed to overtake America’s
Bruce Hayes in the 800-meter relay despite
swimming the race of a lifetime, Gross felt
regret that his teammates had been denied
the gold medal. “This is the jewel of swim-
ming,” he said. “I would gladly trade my
gold in the 200 for a gold in the relay for the
team.” Gross is clearly someone who takes
camaraderie and sportsmanship seriously.
When hebeat world-record holder Morales
The gold medalist in flight: ‘He’s just got to go faster’
in the 100-meter butterfly, he made a point
of swimming over and hugging the Ameri-
can. “He’s a tremendous competitor and
very gracious in victory,” said Morales. “A
lot of people can learn from that. ”
Gross had arrived in Los Angeles with a
decidedly less flattering reputation, espe-
cially among the press. For one thing, he
refuses to sit for photo sessions except with
one photographer who is a friend. Some of
the ill will stemmed from an incident in
1982 when Gross skipped an awards dinner
in West Berlin to be with his club team-
mates at a meet in Aachen 300 miles away.
Many of thejournalists who had sponsored
the banquet were miffed by his absence.
Reluctant Hero: Last week Gross stirred
up a similar controversy. At one press
conference last week, he would answer
questions only through an interpreter, even
though his English is nearly fluent. That
annoyed some American newsmen. What-
ever the case, Gross’s real prob-
lem is that he is a somewhat
reluctant hero in a notoriously
mediagenic sport. “It’s not that
I don’t like the attention,” he
says. “But sometimes it gets to
be too much. You have to un-
derstand: we need time to
ourselves.”
In a variety of ways, Gross is
not exactly a standard-issue
swimming phenom. Unlike
most U.S. swimmers, who be-
gin competing almost as soon as
they outgrow their water wings,
he started serious training only
in 1978. His progress, however,
was remarkably swift. In 1979
he won four junior champion-
ships but was not given much
chance of making West Ger-
many’s national team for the


noon, American George DiCarlo won the
gold and set a new Olympic record. Just
minutes later, in the 400 freestyle consola-
tion finals (an exhibition for the morning’s
losers), Fahrner charged back from defeat,
turning in a time of 3:50.91, which bested
DiCarlo’s brand-new record. The crowd
booed ferociously when the pool announcer
said that Fahrner’s time would not count;
this was the first time that consolation races
were held, and there was no precedent for
the situation. But meet officials huddled in
an emergency session, and finally an-
nounced a decision: the medal would go to
DiCarlo, but Fahrner’s time would go into
the Olympic record books.
Sieben’s victory was as unexpected as
Fahrner’s was unusual. In 1982 Sieben, then
15, won a bronze in the 200-meter butterfly
at the Commonwealth Games, but by last
year the best he could do was a 25th-place
world ranking. The odds against his taking
the gold were almost overwhelming; Gross
had already won the 200-meter freestyle and
the 100-meter butterfly and held the world
record of 1:57.05 in the 200-meter butterfly.
But at the 150-meter-turn, Sieben exploded.
Coming out of fourth place, he passed even-
tual bronze medalist Rafael Vidal of Ven-
ezuela, then cruised past Gross in the last
five meters, besting the West German’s re-
cord by a hundredth of a second. “I was just
going for the wall,” Sieben said. “Normally,
I’ve had pretty bad luck finishing. This time,
every thing went right. ”
American vets and rookies combined for
their most emotional win, in the men’s
800-meter relay. Float and Dave Larson
sustained a two-length lead over the West
Germans, enough to win if anyone other
than Gross were swimming the final leg.
Gross made up 2 meters on his start, and
led after 75 meters of the last 200-meter
leg. U.S. anchor Bruce Hayes, who fin-
ished third at the Olympic trials in the 200,
looked lost. But Hayes pulled even at 125
meters and outtouched Gross by 4 inches.
Float, who swims without his hearing aids,
called the crowd noise “deafening”—and
it was. The Los Angeles Herald Exam-
iner headlined the four Americans as
GROSSBUSTERS, a takeoff on the new hit
U.S. movie, “Ghostbusters.”
The absence of the East-bloc countries
took some of the shine off the women’s
comeback golds. Not that the East Ger-
mans would have beaten them all: Caulkins
and Tiffany Cohen are the best in the world
in their events. And although the East Ger-
man swimmers would have won their share
of medals, they might also have pushed the
Americans to world records. The only miss-
ing male powerhouse was Vladimir Salni-
kov of the Soviet Union, the world’s finest
distance swimmer. Otherwise, the Ameri-
can men were up against the best in the
world: Gross, Baumann, Sieben and Da-
vis—and themselves.

upcoming Olympic year. He did anyway,
and proceeded to swim the 100-meter but-
terfly in 54.69 at a boycott meet that sum-
mer. (The winning Olympic time in 1980 in
the event was 54.92). When he later broke
the world records in the 200-meter butter-
fly and the 200-meter freestyle, Gross be-
came the first swimmer since Mark Spitz to
hold world records simultaneously in two
different strokes. Even so, Gross shrugs off
comparisons with Spitz. “Spitz beat every-
one by whole seconds,” he says. “I am
ahead by only fractions of seconds.”
Gross has made his marks on a training
regimen so relatively relaxed
that it would make most Ameri-
can coaches swallow their whis-
tles. Top U.S. competitors
routinely swim six hours a day,
covering about 15,000 meters.
Gross does half that, relying on
weightlifting, soccer, basket-
ball and running to help build
strength and endurance. But
what is most impressive about
Gross’s preparation is his disci-
plined drive. “I concentrate on
only one thing at a time,” he
says. “In the winter it is the
German club meets. In the
spring it is the European cham-
pionships. I only started to con-
centrate on the Olympics in
January.”
Jump Start: By last week, the
Albatross had replaced Sam the
Eagle, the Olympic mascot, as
the most sought-after bird in
Los Angeles. Swimming with
what looked like nonchalance
in the morning heats of the 200-
meter freestyle, Gross set a new
Olympic record. In the evening
final he broke his own world
record and finished two sec-
onds ahead of the closest run-
ner-up. The next day, after set-
ting a world record in the
100-meter butterfly in a morn-
ing heat, Morales jumped off to
a quick start over Gross in the
final. Drawing even at the half-
way mark, Gross surged ahead
in the last 10 meters to beat Morales by a
hand length and break the half-day-old
world record by .7 seconds. Gross prompt-
ly dispelled any notion that he was a cold
fish by cheering in the pool, consoling Mo-
rales and dancing on the deck.
Gross had less to cheer about on Friday
afternoon in the 200-meter butterfly, an
event that he seemed a cinch to win. With 25
meters to go, he held a slight edge over
Morales and Venezuelan Rafael Vidal. But
then from nowhere —lane six and fourth
place—came Australian Jon Sieben, who
lunged ahead at the last moment to break
Gross’s world record. Still, Gross was as
gracious in silver as in gold. “Nothing went
wrong,” he said later, this time speaking in
English. “I wasn’t disappointed, really. It
was the fastest 200-meter fly in history, and
to be second in a very good time wasn’t bad,
I think.”
“I do it for fun,” he says. “That’s the way
it has to be.” Even if he never does another
lap, Gross has plenty to look forward to.
He lives in the comfortable Sachsenhausen
district of Frankfurt with his mother and
father, the financial director of a chemical
company. His other interests run the gam-
ut from Goethe to Porsche (his father’s).
On the victory stand: Plenty to look forward to
KEN REGAN— CAMERA 5-ABC SPORTS
He recently scored well enough on his
Abitur exams to ensure entrance to one
of West Germany’s better universities.
About the only disappointment to befall
Gross was the recent realization that be-
cause of staff reductions at Lufthansa, he
will probably never fulfill his boyhood
dream of becoming an airline pilot. His
new goal is to be a television newscaster —
covering politics, not sports. But in all
probability Gross will continue to swim at
the club level. Certainly, as any team
would agree, this is one albatross that will
never be a burden.

Beyond the Standards
Li Ning on the horse, Vidmar: ‘Every year, someone goes faster and goes higher ’
For Olympic Moments, nothing beat gymnastics.
They floated through the stratosphere of
UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion like space
voyagers through zero gravity. And when
they landed last week, the American gym-
nastics drought had finally ended. It had
rained in California. Talk about your Olym-
pic Moments. Three days before the spunky
Mary Lou Retton bore down and won the
women’s all-round gold, an estimated
1 billion soon-to-be believers worldwide
watched the U.S. male gymnasts scarily
scrap a plan that would have earned them a
certain silver medal and gut it out successful-
ly for gold and glory. America’s latest in-
stant heroes were flashing winning smiles
even as they twisted and tumbled off" their
sport’s arcane apparatus and then stuck
themselves to the floor like nails entering
soft pine.
In the end, the American men had their
first team championship ever and their sec-
ond medal of any shade since 1932. Peter
Vidmar, the usually stoic Mormon who
would celebrate the team win over root beer,
wept openly on the awards stand. “We don’t
havejust one hero for the little kids to look up
to,” heexulted. “Wehavesix.”
Stunningly, the U.S. men’s team, whose
tallest member isn’t quite 5 feet 9, was
perched atop the world of sport after besting
the world-champion Chinese. How would it
sell in Peking? When the question was posed,
gymnast Tong Fei jokingly drew his forefin-
ger across his throat.
The watching world was more forgiving
than that, of course. Execution of a different,
very Olympian sort mesmerized it: Citius,
Aldus, Fortius. “Every year, someone goes
faster and goes higher,” said yesteryear’s
Cathy Rigby in rough translation of the
Latin. “These are better gymnasts. ”
At the 1968 games in Mexico City, Rigby
witnessed a back handspring on the balance
beam; it seemed to her the most acrobatic
feat the human torso could ever achieve.
Last week that trick was only a B on the A-B-
C scale of difficulty, and evidence abounded
that sheer competition had created an esca-
lating momentum. Every law of physics had
JOHN MCDERMOTT
Szabo:A tiny dynamo burdened
with the legacy of Comaneci
been defied save one: the tendency of gym-
nastic achievement, once set in motion, to
keep getting better and better.
The Romanian women—led by the dy-
namic Ecaterina Szabo and burdened with
the legacy of Nadia Comaneci —testified to
that in capturing the team gold. So did Chi-
na’s high-tumbling Li Ning, who took the
men’s individual bronze, and Japan’s Koji
Gushiken, who translated his nation’s repu-
tation for precision and steadiness into the
men’s all-round title —and then broke into
tears. So did Retton, the gold-
plated American spark plug
who proved that women gym-
nasts don’t have to be anorexic
to be awesome, and her team-
mate Julianne McNamara,
whose determined grace en-
tranced the crowds.
Miserly: But nothing spoke
more loudly than the numbers
that kept flashing on the score-
boards and the unfamiliar
chant, “10, 10, 10!” It began
with the award of perfect scores
10 times during the first day of
men’s competition. Despite
ebbs and flows, the flood con-
tinued. Both the expectation
and delivery of excellence
would become so unstinting
that, after Retton was awarded
a 9.95 for a floor exercise, the
miserly judges would be booed
by the crowd.
The high scores are becom-
ing controversial. “When I see

Thai s First Class has long been considered one of
the best in the air.
Things have changed. Now its even better.
Take your seat. Totally new in design, it has improved
back support and reclines further. The footrest extension is
now fully padded. And when extended the seat is more like
a bed than ever before.
Lunch and dinner have always been a gourmet
experience for our First Class passengers.
Now breakfast is, too.
With freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh eggs
cooked any way you like them, right there on the plane.
Caviar is yours for the asking. And what goes better
with the best caviar than the best champagne, vintage Dom
Perignon, no less.
The wine list is equally impressive. Superb French
wines specially selected in that country by Thai.
In keeping with this new standard of excellence, Thai
are introducing elegant new table and glassware to go with it.
Other little luxuries include, smart complimentary
toilet kits, more comfortable electronic headsets, and new
sleeping shades and comfort socks. Of course, Thai s
renowned Royal Orchid Service is as good as it
ever was, nobody could improve on that.
And as a memento, we give every
Royal First Class passenger a beautiful,
limited edition print of one of six
orchid paintings, specially commis-
sioned from a well-known artist.

10 points,” complains Japanese
men’s coach Abe Kazuo, “I want
to protest and tell them to lower the
score.” Some critics blame the
judges for a wave of liberalism that
results in score inflation. More,
however, point to the inflation in
athletes’ abilities, which simply
have transcended the limits of the
International Gymnastics Feder-
ation’s Code of Points.
Bonus: What both sides agree on
is that something must be done. In
November federation members
will meet in France to consider
changes. Among the proposed re-
forms is one to add judges, thereby
upping the unanimity required for
a 10 and producing more refined,
3-point decimal scores. Don Pe-
ters, the American women’s
coach, favors a more radical ap-
proach. “The scoring system . . .
devised four years ago was already
out of date when it came out,” he
says. His solution, which is one
that many gymnasts support, is to
permit judges to award bonus
points, hiking scores beyond
a 10 for truly outstanding per-
formances.
As it is, about the only significant deduc-
tions come for falling off an apparatus. With
so few competitors making that kind of mis-
take, top-level and second-tier gymnasts are
being squeezed closer together on the scor-
ing scale. In some of the competitions last
week, a single slight misstep, usually worth
only a 10th of a point, determined the out-
come. “ You’re looking at some routines that
are perfect,” says Rigby. “There isn’t much
they can take off for.”
Where will the stars of the future
come from, the ones who will
bounce and twist beyond tomor-
row’s rules? Perhaps from the two
Koreas, says one longtime observ-
er, pointing to the recent import of
coaches there from China and Ja-
pan. (The fact that the 1988 Sum-
mer Olympics will be held in Seoul
is a clear incentive for both
North and South Korea to im-
prove.) Almost certainly, a good
number of the champions-to-be
will come from the same place they
always have: the absent Soviet
Union, whose wunderkind Dmitri
Bilozerchev —“the best gymnast
ever,” in the view of UCLA coach
Art Shurlock —will be only 20 by
the 1988 games.
But as last week proved, the
Americans are coming on strong.
The improved performance of the
U.S. women could be attributed in

After defecting in 1981, Karolyi spent his
first two months in the United States wash-
ing dishes at a Los Angeles restaurant before
he could land a coaching job. Karolyi picks
his students not on the basis of technical
ability—with enough dedication, he says,
that can be taught —but rather for the “fire”
in their eyes.

plainly produced results. Even though Mc-

Namara had only started to work
with Karolyi a few months before
the Olympics, she said she could
already detect a difference in her
approach to training and competi-
tion. “Eve improved a lot,” she
said. “I feel so much more confi-
dent.” Five hundred girls, grist for
the Americans’ future, have en-
rolled at Karolyi’s school in Hous-
ton; they were drawn largely by the
magnet that ABC-TV boss Roone
Arledge had exploited so delight-
fully in 1972 —Olga Korbut,
whose image dispatched thou-
sands of young American girls
onto beams and bars and horses.
And now they were growing up.
The U.S. men’s team had
cropped up almost overnight. In-
dividual and school rivalries —all
but Bart Connor came from
UCLA or the University of Ne-
braska —disappeared the instant
the team hit the floor. “That
wasn’t a UCLA home crowd,”
said team member Jim Hartung.
“That was the U.S. up there.”
Scott Johnson willingly sacrificed
his individual ambitions by lend-
ing his rock-solid stability to low-
er-scoring leadoff positions, thus helping
to set a foundation on which others
could build.
The real test came on the last night of
team competition. The Chinese had edged
up to within .25 points of the Americans,
and U.S. coach Abie Grossfeld felt “nerv-
ous sick.” The American team had to
make a difficult choice. Grossfeld consid-
ered asking Mitch Gaylord to play his
high-bar performance conservatively-
—leaving out the risky twisting
somersault that carries his name.
But Mitch would not be denied.
Grossfeld later admitted that he
couldn’t even bear to watch Gay-
lord at the gymnast’s finest mo-
ment; he just averted his eyes and
waited for the roar of the crowd
to tell him: it had worked.
The Glow: And so a piece of
American impossibility called the
Gaylord II had joined the litany of
tricks named for those who have
gone before: the Tsukahara, the
Hecht, the Diamadov. But wheth-
er the glow of medals would swell
the thin ranks of male U.S. gym-
nasts —now outnumbered by fe-
males 10 to I—remained1 —remained an open
question. There was, perhaps, an
omen last week in the leafy Los
Angeles suburb of Westwood.
As a repairman strolled up a
sidewalk, he actually recognized
the blond character on the stoop.
“You Vidmar?” he asked. “The
gymnast? God bless you.”

ASIA
A Breakthrough
For Hong Kong
London and Peking reach an agreement that allows
the colony to keep its free-market system intact.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian
called it “a breakthrough. ” British For-
eign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said it was
“historic.” And the Hong Kong stock mar-
ket rallied in relief. After nearly two years of
rumors, uncertainty and near panic over the
colony’s future, London and Peking finally
reached a preliminary agreement last week
that would allow Hong Kong to keep its free-
market system well into the next century.
Though important issues must be resolved
before the pact can be signed, the news
brought a fresh burst of optimism to wor-
ried residents and stilled the colony’s latest
outbreak of financial jitters. “This is wor-
thy of our rejoicing,” said Woo Hon-
Fai, head of Hong Kong’s Chinese Gold
and Silver Exchange Society. “We hope
there will be more good news ahead.”
The sudden agreement surprised many
Hong Kong leaders, who had come to
expect little progress from the Sino-British
negotiations on the colony’s status after
Britain’s lease from China expires in 1997.
Only recently, sources were saying that
Margaret Thatcher was in a “Falklands
mood” and was prepared to order her team
to walk out of the talks. But the British
prime minister reportedly paved the way
for Howe’s four-day visit to Peking last
week by sending a persuasive, conciliatory
letter to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
Deng responded in kind. After Howe met
with Wu and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang,
Deng cut short a summer holiday to see
the British foreign minister —and praised
the “spirit of mutual understanding and
. . . accommodation.” Though long wary

J. MESSERSCHMIDT— BRUCE COLEMAN
Deng and Howe in Peking: After nearly two years of hard bargaining and ‘give and take,’ the colony is more secure about its future—and the stock market is on the rise
of Peking’s promises, Hong Kong took the
latest pronouncements seriously: the Hang
Seng stock-market index recorded its big-
gest surge in 2Vi years.
The pact, Howe said, required a good
deal of “give and take.” The British agreed
to a Chinese demand to establish a joint
“liaison committee” to ensure a smooth
transition away from colonial rule —a step
London had resisted because many feared
the committee would become a shadow gov-
ernment, imposing Peking’s authority be-
fore 1997. But Britain won assurances that
the committee would have no supervisory
powers and would not interfere with the
colonial authorities. And the Chinese
agreed to a surprisingly detailed agreement
that assured that Hong Kong’s basic eco-
nomic and social systems would remain
intact. “[The accord] will provide for a high
degree of autonomy,” Howe said, and will
guarantee “the preservation of all the rights
and freedoms which the people of Hong
Kong now enjoy.”
Havens: In the colony, the favorable reac-
tion from the financial community drowned
out a mild protest (“Don’t Trust Commu-
nist China,” warned a white banner outside
the Legislative Council chamber). But the
euphoria masked an underlying uncertainty
about Hong Kong’s future. Some critics
argued that the specifics of the accord were

NEAL ULEVICH— AP
little different from the promises Peking had
made a year ago and that there was no
guarantee that China would abide by the
pact once the British had departed. Many
business leaders said the accord merely
bought Hong Kong stability until 1997 —
not afterward—and they continued to make
plans to join a growing number of the colo-
ny’s residents who have found havens
abroad for their money and themselves.
Britain tried to calm the fears. Howe
stressed that China has a tradition of re-
specting international accords despite do-
mestic ideological shifts, and that it was
ultimately in Peking’s interest to keep
Hong Kong’s economy strong. Added one
British official in London: “The Chinese
have a vested interest in a stable and pros-
perous Hong Kong, if for no other reason
than that the colony provides China
with money.”
The motivations for reaching an accord
just now were clearly political. Deng had
made the Hong Kong issue one of his top
priorities, and he wanted an agreement be-
fore China celebrates the 35th anniversary
of communist rule in the fall. For their part,
the British were apparently not eager to test
Deng’s threat to impose his own plan if a
pact couldn’t be negotiated successfully by
September. In the end, both sides compro-
mised. The Chinese agreed to Britain’s re-
quest for a legally binding document that
will guarantee Hong Kong residents the
right of free speech as well as freedom to
travel, to own property and to invest money
abroad for 50 years after 1997. The agree-
ment will also allow the colony to keep its
present judicial system, with the highest
courts based in Hong Kong, not in Peking.
“We couldn’t simply let Peking fill in the
blanks later,” said one British diplomat in
Hong Kong. In exchange, the British
agreed to China’s desire for a more general
statement of principles. To accommodate
the wishes of both sides, the final accord is
likely to consist of at least two documents,
say diplomats in Peking.
Lukewarm: There are still some sticking
points. The two sides have yet to resolve
issues of government-owned land, civil avi-
ation and the eventual citizenship status of
Hong Kong residents, 2.5 million of whom
hold joint British-Hong Kong passports.
Perhaps most important, London and Pe-
king have not established how Hong Kong’s
semiautonomous government will be cho-
sen after China reasserts its sovereignty.
Peking had said that it would allow the
people of Hong Kong to govern themselves.
The colonial government recently issued a
“green paper” on the future of Hong Kong
that advocated limited elections for public
officials before the Chinese takeover. But

That’s why
we have developed ICL
multi-user microcomputer

ICL computers bring
people together by
letting them share

And it doesn’t stop there.
As your business performs
better together, it will probably
grow. So ICL have a whole range of
microcomputer systems to take
you into the future - like the brand new ‘ICL Clan’
that handles up to sixteen operators at once,
without loss of power.
ICL’s experience in mainframes has made us
Europe’s leading, and one of

Picketers demonstrating against the agreement: ‘We don’t trust Communist China’
RICHARD TOMKINS—GAMMA-LIAISON
Peking has snubbed even that lukewarm
proposal, saying that China has “no ob-
ligation” to honor any current plans for the
colony’s self-rule.
Such ambiguous signals have led many
Hong Kong residents to make plans to leave
the colony, regardless of the agreement Chi-
na and Britain reach. Many fled to the
colony after the 1949 communist takeover
on the mainland, and they still have a deep
and abiding mistrust of Peking. To a large
extent, the exodus from Hong Kong has
already begun. Since London and Peking
started bargaining in September 1982, in-
vestors have transferred several billion dol-
lars abroad or traded their money for for-
eign exchange, and requests for visas and
emigration permits for countries such as
Britain, the United States, Australia and
Canada have risen dramatically.
In recent months, the outflow has been so
great that many companies have com-
plained that the loss of managers and skilled
workers could sap Hong Kong of its eco-
nomic vitality long before the Chinese take
over. According to a recent survey by
the Hong Kong Management Association,
nearly a third of the colony’s executives who
were interviewed have made plans to emi-
grate within five years. Though some man-
agers living abroad could eventually return
to Hong Kong after their applications for
resident status in other countries have been
approved, they could easily leave again if
conditions deteriorate.
Renege: Hong Kong residents may soon
have a clearer picture of their future. If all
goes well, the remaining disputes should be
resolved by September; the British Parlia-
ment and China’s National Peoples’ Con-
gress will then debate the accord, and win-
ning approval is likely to be a mere
formality. Whether the people of Hong
Kong will like what they see is another
matter. Hong Kong is unlikely ever to
achieve the degree of economic vibrancy
and speculative verve it enjoyed before 1997
became an issue. For most Hong Kong citi-
zens the reason is painfully obvious: should
the Chinese decide after 1997 to renege on
their promise of “one country, two sys-
tems,” there is little Britain or anybody else
could do to stop them.

Japan’s Leap of Faith
While many foreign investors in Hong Kong are glancing
nervously at the clock as Britain prepares to turn the colony over
to China, the Japanese are moving in as if time and laissez-faire
capitalism were inexhaustible commodities. The reason: Tokyo
has been eagerly expanding commercial ties with Peking, and
investing in Hong Kong could put Japan even closer to China’s
opening trade door. “From Hong Kong, we have easy access to
any part of China,” says Yasushi Kajiwara, Hong Kong branch
manager of the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Despite the jitters that marked the two-year run-up to last
week’s tentative accord, Japanese investments in the colony
never slackened. Between April 1983 and
March 1984, Japanese firms poured a
record $563 million into Hong Kong, up
41 percent from the previous 12 months.
Dozens of Japanese firms —including
YKK Zipper Co. and Asahi Optical Co.,
the maker of Pentax cameras —are build-
ing new plants or expanding operations
in Hong Kong. The surge in manufactur-
ing investments has been matched in the
financial sector. By this fall, 13 Japanese
banks will have Hong Kong branches.
Japanese investments have largely
flowed into enterprises that offer short-
term profits without requiring heavy
commitments in fixed assets. Sixty per-
cent of Japanese funds aresunk into small

light industries that are easily transplanted and stand a good
chance of returning a profit before 1997. But the Japanese have
clearly made their own judgments concerning the post-1997 era,
and Japanese companies are finding long-term investments near-
ly as attractive as those with shorter payback periods. In part this
is due to a basic sense among Japanese businessmen that they
understand the Chinese and can do business with them.
The Japanese expect to reap a variety of long-term benefits by
staying in Hong Kong. China’s demand for consumer goods is
expected to soar over the next decade—and Japanese firms
expect to fill much of that demand. Japanese banks hope to profit
from Peking’s growing economic liberalism by financing Chinese
trade deals in Southeast Asia and by funding projects in China’s
free economic zones. Yen-based financial institutions have al-
ready begun leapfrogging from Hong
Kong into China.
Despite the recent investment surge,
Japanese companies recognize that
pumping money into the colony is a risky
proposition. “If Hong Kong loses faith
in its future, businesses will be less ac-
tive,” admits Hiroyuki Hayakawa, a
Bank of Tokyo official in Hong Kong.
“Our judgment may be proven wrong.”
But the Japanese hope their farsighted
strategies will help them steal a march on
the United States—currently Hong
Kong’s largest trading partner—in the
quickening race for China’s markets.

I Think I Can, I Think I Can
Shamir and Peres with aides, shaking hands at the King David summit: After seven barren years, Labor didn’t want to share the spoils
SVENNACKSTRAND —GAMMA LIAISON
With Israel in a political muddle, Peres bargains hard to form a government.
Shimon Peres knew he was already a two-
time loser —a politician who had failed
twice to become Israel’s prime minister. So
when the divided Israeli elections gave him
one more chance last week, the Labor Party
leader was determined not to let it slip away.
Courting everyone from Peace Now doves
to ultra-Orthodox rabbis, Peres fought to
recruit enough partners to form a majority
in the Israeli Knesset. Over a conference
table at the King David Hotel, he also
talked with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
about the prospects for a national-unity
cabinet if neither Labor nor Shamir’s Likud
bloc could muster a ruling coalition. De-
spite the show of conciliation, Peres still
believed he could form a government by
himself. And this week, Israeli President
Chaim Herzog may give him the go-ahead
to try and do just that.
Whether Peres could actually capture the
prize he had sought for so long was still an
open question. Labor had only 44 seats in
the 120-member Knesset. It could count on
the backing of two leftist parties—Shinui
and the Movement for Citizens’ Rights and
Peace (MCRP). With the help of former
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, Peres also
managed to hang on to the support of sever-
al key centrist parties. Weizman told Peres
that he could rely on his own Yahad party.
His loyalty stemmed partly from gratitude:
Peres was one of the few political leaders
who stayed in touch after Weizman broke
with former Prime Minister Menachem Be-
gin in 1980. Weizman also worked to keep
two other parties in the Peres camp: Tami, a
small Sephardic party, and Ometz, a party
whose sole program is to fight Israel’s 400
percent inflation rate.
Promises: That gave Peres 55 seats. To
command a majority, he still needed to win
over two of four small religious parties. He
and Shamir were locked in a fierce battle for
their support. Early in the week Shamir met
with leaders of three of the parties —Agudat
Israel, the Sephardic Torah Guardians
(Shas) and Morasha. Shamir vowed that if
he returned to power, he would push
through the Knesset a highly controversial
“who is a Jew” law —a measure that would
grant eligibility for Israeli citizenship only
to birthright Jews and those converted by
Orthodox rabbis. He also pledged to allow
rabbis to decide which historical sites could
be explored by archaeologists, and to ap-
point a Shas deputy as the next minister of
religious affairs. The promises were enough
to persuade both Shas and Morasha to an-
nounce their support for Shamir.
But Peres still had hopes of wooing Agu-
dat Israel and a second uncommitted group,
the National Religious Party (NRP). Both
parties were ideologically closer to Likud.
But both wanted to hold on to government
jobs and money, and they seemed willing to
consider an alliance with Peres if Labor
otfered a better prospect of delivering both.
In his effort to win over Agudat and NRP,
Peres made some pledges of his own. He said
he would maintain the ban on El A 1 flights
during the Sabbath. He vowed not to elevate
the status of Conservative and Reform rab-
bis. But on the question of Jewish identity he
was less forthcoming than Shamir: he prom-
ised only to let his supporters vote their
conscience in the Knesset; he also suggested
that the issue be put to a vote of leading
rabbinical scholars around the world.
Given the deadlock, many Israelis were
still hoping that Peres and Shamir would
form a national-unity government. It was
Herzog who asked for the unity summit at
the King David Hotel. Flanked by their top
deputies, Shamir and Peres talked for a total
of 7Vi hours over two days about economic
and security issues facing the country.
Spokesmen on both sides called the atmos-
phere positive, but pointed out that the
exchange was only preliminary. Mean

0. K., so you travel to Sydney a lot. And you want to stay somewhere
that’s comfortable. Obviously. All business executives do.
But you want it to be central so you save on time and taxi fares.
And you want the staff to take good care of you.
Naturally you’d like all these things to come at a price that doesn’t affect
your budget.
Then consider the following proposition.
The Southern Cross is Sydney’s newest hotel. It’s centrally located near
all public transport and en route to the airport, too.
Comfort? Australia’s foremost decorators, the guys who do a lot of
boardrooms for our major corporations took care of it, so they have a pretty
good idea of what a business executive wants.
Relaxed colour schemes, plush carpets, good lighting, comfortable
oversized beds. Large desks and phones at the ready.
Most visitors even go so far as to describe our rooms as luxurious but
we’ll leave that for you to decide.
Other Southern Cross touches that could be described as “luxuries,”
but we’d prefer to call them “little extras,” include a garden and heated
swimming pool on the roof, a first class restaurant and valet parking.
But as you’re a business executive we imagine that the thing that will
appeal most are our rates.
Staying at the new Southern Cross in Sydney may well seem like a
luxury to you. But it will never look like that on your expense report.
We could promise you that when you stay with us you’ll be “cradled in
the lap of luxury.”
But, really, we’d prefer just to say that The Southern Cross
represents probably the best value for money of any hotel in town.
The Southern Cross in Sydney. It’s a great business proposition..

equipment for their own phone system.
the Belgian government.
Together they formed a
joint venture company to
handle the transfer of tech-
nology for the world’s most
advanced digital telecommu-
nications switching system,
ITT System 12.™
With the full approval of
the United States and
Belgian governments, this
contract will help set a new
standard for telephone
systems in China.
After first importing
100,000 equivalent lines,
China will then produce up
to 300,000 equivalent lines
of System 12 a year.
But it’s not the digital
equipment alone that will
help the People’s Republic
of China meet the increased demand for telecommunications.
It’s the System 12 technology itself, a patented process called fully
distributed control.
It uses many microprocessors in a modular design to control the
network, rather than a large central computer.
So more lines or service can be added easily and economically. Without
upsetting the entire system as it grows.
Fully distributed control is an outgrowth of over $7OO million in research
and development by ITT engineers all over the world.
It’s also why the People’s Republic of China is one of 17 countries that
has ordered System 12.
It’s the kind of trade agreement that would have made Marco Polo proud.

while, Herzog indicated that even if he does
ask Peres to form a government, he will
continue efforts to persuade Labor and Li-
kud to come to a unity arrangement. “I’ll
lock up Peres and Shamir in a room and tell
them they can’t come out until the white
smoke comes out the chimney,” Herzog
told a friend.
In principle, Peres and Shamir were in
agreement on many steps a unity govern-
ment would have to take. They both recog-
nized the need for emergency economic
measures —a cut in defense spending, a
freeze on wages, prices and taxes, lower
export subsidies, and a monetary reform
that would tie the shekel to the U.S. dollar.
Labor strategists were also eager to share
the responsibility for austerity; otherwise,
they warned, Labor might suffer big losses
in next year’s elections in the Histadrut
trade union. On Lebanon, both Labor and
Likud favored withdrawing Israeli troops
as soon as the south Lebanese Army is
strengthened and limits are placed on the
size and movement of Syrian forces in the
country. Here, too, both sides admitted
that it would be better for the country
if a Lebanon pullout were a bipartisan
decision.
Sticking Points: Still, Likud and Labor
remained divided over other key issues.
Two sticking points were settlements in the
occupied territories and peace talks with the
Arabs. In theory, a unity government could
choose to ignore those issues. But members
of the leftist Mapam wing of the Labor
Party, along with their allies in Shinui and
the MCRP, remained unwilling to compro-
mise with hawks who had organized the
Lebanon invasion and sought to annex the
West Bank. In a Mapam central committee
meeting, most of the 100-odd members
came out strongly against a deal with Sha-
mir. “The gap between us is too wide,” said
one Mapam leader. “We’d rather put on the
skullcap and cook up a kosher program
with the religious parties than sit at the same
table with the likes of [former Defense Min-
ister Ariel] Sharon.”
Perhaps even more important, many top
Labor Party members simply didn’t want
to share the spoils of victory with Likud.
They had spent seven years in opposition,
without cabinet posts, without the perqui-
sites of power and without the patronage
that comes with 200 key government jobs.
Many of them hoped that even if Peres did
have to make large concessions to the reli-
gious parties, a Labor government could
still push through much of its program and
go back to the electorate in four years with
a record of economic recovery and peace-
making. Nobody clung to that dream more
tenaciously than Peres. After getting the
nod from Herzog, he would have at least
three weeks to form a government. And
this time, he was ready to do everything he
could to avoid going down in history as a
three-time loser.

EGYPT
A Case of the Mystery Mines
Adel: The wishful thinking finally gave way to more realistic countermeasures
The 1,579-ton Dutch merchant ship
Joint Frost had unloaded a cargo of
frozen poultry and eggs at the port of Ho-
deida, in North Yemen. She was steaming
south into the Red Sea last week when the
captain sent out a sudden signal of distress:
he was “mixed up in a mine field.”
Someone is playing a very nasty game in
the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez. The culprits
may be radical regimes such as Iran or
Libya, or individual terrorists. Whatever
the case, the mystery mines could be a new
wrinkle in thuggery. A group calling itself
Islamic Holy War telephoned news offices
in London to announce that it had sown 190
mines in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez —to
punish “imperialists,” it said, for “encour-
aging the expansion of the Iran-Iraq war.”
There was no way of verifying that
boast. Some Defense Department officials
in Washington suggested that Iran might
have planted mines in the hope of carrying
the war with Iraq beyond the Persian Gulf.
Three Iranian vessels —and at least one Lib-
yan ship—have been seen recently in the
Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. They could
have dropped mines without being detect-
ed. The Libyan ship behaved suspiciously,
first sailing north, then turning south. But
none of that proved who was responsible for
the explosions.
The Reagan administration did what it
could to help combat the mine menace. As
reports of explosions rose, the U.S. govern-
ment warned ships to use “extreme cau-
tion” in the area. At Cairo’s request, Wash-
ington flew 15 U.S. Navy mine-warfare
experts to Egypt. The USS Harkness, a U.S.
Navy research vessel that carries two heli-
copters and sophisticated sonar equip-
ment —and was already in the Red Sea on an
oceanographic mission—stood by to lend a
helping hand. And the Navy began loading
six RH-53D minesweeping helicopters
aboard Air Force C-5 Galaxy transports at
the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Va. On
orders from Washington, they could be air-
lifted immediately to the Red Sea-Gulf of
Suez area. The helicopters—identical to
those that were used to sweep mines from
Haiphong harbor after the end of American
involvement in Vietnam —tow sledges that
duplicate the sound and magnetic signals of
ships, thus causing the mine to explode.
Disabled Rudder: Since last month, un-
derwater explosions have rocked at least
15 commercial vessels plying those waters.
At least seven ships of various nationali-
ties, including a Soviet container ship, have
encountered trouble just south of the Suez
Canal. Nine more, according to Lloyd’s of
London, have been hit near the mouth of
the Red Sea. Two of them, the Greek
freighter Kriti Coral and the Turkish ship
Morgul, suffered only minor damage. A
third, the East German cargo vessel Georg
Schumann, dropped anchor off the coast of
Saudi Arabia —its rudder disabled by a
mine explosion. The damage in most cases
has been slight; none of the vessels has
sunk and no crewmen have been injured.
Egypt was deeply worried that the threat
would frighten ships away from the Suez
Canal —a prime source of foreign-currency
revenues. At first, Egyptian officials sought
to play down the danger. The chairman of
the Suez Canal Authority, Ezat Adel, said
that the explosions might have been caused
by oil-exploration equipment in the Gulf of
Suez, but certainly not by underwater ord-
nance. “There are no mines, either in the
canal or its outlets,” he insisted. But the
mines were there, and it will take some doing
to get rid of them.

SUDAN
Nimeiry’s Risky Course
A Sudanese market, Nimeiry: Stirring up religious tensions in a polarized nation
ERIC BOUVET—GAMMA-LIAISON
It is a regular Friday ritual these days in
Khartoum: several thousand people
gather inside the dun-colored walls of
Kober Prison for a look at Islamic justice in
action. At the center of the arena, a prisoner
sits on a chair on an elevated platform. A
guard first cloaks the victim’s face with
white cloth, then holds his hand aloft and
shouts out his name and his crime; it is
usually theft. Then the guard intones a verse
from the Koran—and a surgeon steps up,
brandishing a sharp knife. The doctor
quickly and cleanly cuts off the
prisoner’s hand. Briefly, the
hand is held aloft. “Allah Akh-
bar [God is great],” the crowd
shouts. Then the victim is tak-
en to a nearby hospital.
The grim spectacle in the
prison yard is just one of many
signs of the Islamic policies
that President Jaafar Nimeiry
imposed on Sudan close to
a year ago. Nimeiry, long
known as a pro-Western mod-
erate, turned to religion in a
time of trouble. His country is
sharply divided between the
Muslim north and the Chris-
tian and animist south; last
year a long-dormant southern
insurgency started to boil
again. But Nimeiry only cre-
ated more division in the
country by abruptly unveiling
a strict Islamic legal code.
Non-Muslims of the south re-
garded the new laws as tanta-
mount to a declaration of war
against their region. Mean-
while Egypt and the United
States, Nimeiry’s closest al-
lies, were baffled and dis-
mayed by his seemingly irra-
tional moves. Washington’s
nightmare was that Nimeiry’s

PHOTOS BY IVERSON—GAMMA-LIAISON
policies could destabilize the nation —and
lead to the emergence of a radical Islamic
regime like the one next door in Libya.
To speed the implementation of the
sharia —the Islamic legal code —Nimeiry
declared a national “state of emergency”
last spring. Special Islamic courts were es-
tablished. Now, people who have television
sets can watch a popular new program
called “Decisive Justice”: for 20 minutes
after the evening news, an announcer in-
tones the names and punishments of the
latest victims of the new courts.
Last week one woman received
100 lashes for “fornication.”
Her partner received an even
stiffer sentence: 100 lashes plus
a year in prison. Nimeiry him-
self, meanwhile, personally
carries his crusade into the
country. On a visit to one of the
provinces, he said that he could
smell liquor on the breath of
Regional Housing Minister
Mamoun Mohamadi Ahmed.
The official, who pleaded
that the smell was from a tooth-
ache medicine, was nonethe-
less fired and sentenced to
40 lashes.
Hairdressers: Punishments
for other “crimes” are equally
severe. Two Italians caught
with two Eritrean women were
arrested and convicted by an
emergency court of “contem-
plating adultery.” They were
promptly flogged and impris-
oned. In another recent case,
20 male hairdressers were
rounded up one day in Khar-
toum and sentenced to 25
lashes each. Their crime: giv-
ing women permanent waves.
The harsher punishment of
amputation is reserved for theft
and armed robbery, crimes that are consid-
ered especially serious. Since the formal
introduction of the sharia penal code last
September, 30 prisoners have had hands
severed, and 11 have lost both a hand
and a foot.
The imposition of the sharia has spurred
more unrest in the south. At the moment,
4,000 to 12,000 guerrillas in the region are
locked in a stalemated war with about
15,000 government troops. Several weeks
ago the insurgents attacked a string of re-
mote villages along the Ethiopian border
and scored a notable success by shooting
down one of Sudan’s four American-built
F-5E fighters. But an expected guerrilla
offensive aimed at capitalizing on the rainy
season has not materialized.
The upheaval in the south has apparently
sobered many members of Sudan’s Parlia-
ment, which normally rubber-stamps Ni-
meiry’s decisions. In a surprising show of
independence, the assembly recently decid-
ed to postpone voting on scores of amend-
ments to the Constitution —all proposed by
the president—that would have had the
effect of transforming the nation into an
Islamic state and elevating Nimeiry to the
position of imam, or holy leader.
Human Rights: The Reagan administra-
tion has tried to talk Nimeiry out of his
present, unpredictable course. For years
Washington has viewed Nimeiry as a bul-
wark against the spread both of communism
and of Muammar Kaddafi’s brand of radical
Islam. Over the past nine months, high-level
U.S. and Sudanese officials have met an
average of once a month. The message has
always been the same: the Americans have
critized the religious laws and pressed for
reconciliation with the south. “We have told
[the Sudanese] bluntly that we consider the
application of the sharia a violation of hu-
man rights, particularly if used against
Christians,” says one U.S. official in Wash-
ington who met with Nimeiry recently.
Nimeiry, for his part, has angrily rejected the
advice, insisting that his people are in favor
of Islamic justice and that the West simply
does not understand the sharia.
Despite the obvious rift between the two
governments, the United States is not
about to abandon the Nimeiry govern-
ment. The Reagan administration is re-

Uncrowding the World
MARY ELLEN MARK—ARCHIVE
Immunizing babies in Haiti: 800 million more mouths worldwide in the last 10years
Population controllers see progress —and some setbacks.
Delegates to the International Confer-
ence on Population that begins this
week in Mexico City need do no more than
gaze out the window to know why they are
there. Just across from the marble and glass
meeting hall of Mexico’s Foreign Ministry
looms the great gray mass of the Tlatelolco
Urban Group —one of the most densely pop-
ulated areas of a city expected within this
century to become the biggest ever on earth.
One hundred thousand people squeeze into
barely a third of a square mile. Families
unable to afford an apartment live on roof-
tops a dozen stories above the street. It is the
global population explosion, writ large and
unnervingly real. And as the assembled rep-
resentatives from more than 140 countries
know too well, it is very likely an accurate
vision of much of the world’s near future.
Since the United Nations’ last global pop-
ulation conference in Bucharest a decade
ago, 800 million more people are walking the
planet, for a total now of 4.7 billion. Accord-
ing to figures announced in June by the
U.N.’s Fund for Population Activities,
worldwide population growth actually
slowed over the last 10 years, from 2 percent
annually to 1.7 percent. But even that will
mean a doubling of the current total by the
year 2025—and even sooner in many of the
poorest countries of Africa, Latin America
and Asia, where the growth rate is often
twice the world average. Population officials
are guardedly confident that the explosion
can eventually be contained. But in much of
the world their efforts remain hobbled by
public resistance to birth control and lack of
official support for family planning—a situ-
ation that could worsen as a result of a
Reagan administration threat to withdraw
U.S. funding from international family-
planning programs that support abortion.
Although population-control efforts by
Third World governments mushroomed in
the wake of the 1974 conference, their total
price tag last year came to only $2 billion —
an average of barely 50 cents a person, a
quarter of that from international aid. A
recent U.N. World Fertility Survey found
that in developing count ries half the women
who want no more children have no access to
family-planning programs. Combined with
declining infant mortality rates and greater
longevity, the result in parts of the Third
World has been an actual acceleration of
population growth. In the case of Africa, for
example, annual growth has jumped from
2.7 percent in 1975 to 3 percent today.
Given that failure even to hold the line in
many of the countries that can least accom-
modate more hungry mouths, the Reagan
administration’s announcement has given
the Mexico City conference a decidedly con-
‘We Want the Species to Survive’
Rafael M. Salas is director of the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities
and secretary-general of the International
Conference on Population being held this
week in Mexico City. Before the confer-
ence he spoke with Newsweek’s Wendie
Lubic in New York. Excerpts:
On population projections: These are defi-
nite trends that have been established
over the past two or three decades, not
just inventions because we want to be
optimistic. You may vary some figures,
say 1.7 as against 1.67 for the current
world growth-rate percentage. The vari-
ation cannot be avoided, but either way it
is lower than the 2.03 of 10 years ago.
On a world population “peak”: World
population could stabilize at 8 billion if
countries really drop their fertility
rates, as Singapore has done. If nothing
is done the population could reach 12
billion. But our medium projection is
10.2 billion, 80 to 110 years from now.
On Malthusian “doom” sce-
narios: We have always been
able to produce more food
than population. The prob-
lem is in the distribution of
food. There will always be
periodic areas of crisis, as is
happening now in Africa.
But in global terms, no.
On abortion as family plan-
ning: This is a question left to
individual countries. As a
matter of fact, the [U.N. pop-
ulation] fund has no abortion
program. And the U.N. never

involves itself in any program that its
governing bodies judge to be coercive. For
instance, we have never funded or encour-
aged sterilization programs.
On international assistance: For every dol-
lar that we put in, countries on the average
put in four of their own. In the
case of India, for example, the
input from international or-
ganizations is only 8 percent
of the total [family plan-
ning] budget.
On an optimum world popu-
lation: Our present knowl-
edge says that it will be better
for developing nations to sta-
bilize their populations so
that individuals can develop
fully. We want the species to
survive on this planet. The
sooner population stabilizes,
the better.

frontational edge. Abortion has long been a
sensitive topic in international population-
planning circles, where it is regarded at best
as a last resort. Although estimates of the
number of abortions —legal and other-
wise—performed globally each year run as
high as 70 million, U.N. family-planning
declarations rarely mention them. Since
1974 U.S. law has barred government funds
from being used to subsidize abortions over-
seas. Nevertheless, the Reagan White House
wants to go further. “The United States does
not consider abortion an acceptable element
of family planning,’’ reads an eight-page
white paper due to be presented to the con-
ference this week by U.S. delegation chair-
man James L. Buckley—and if abortion is
part of the program, Washington “will no
longer contribute.”
The practical effect of the new U.S. ban
may not be great. When a draft of the propos-
al was leaked in June, public outcry prompt-
ed a watering down of provisions that might
have barred countries with abortion pro-
grams from receiving any U.S. family-plan-
ning aid. Beyond that, less than half the
current $240 million in annual U.S. popula-
tion-control aid is likely to be affected, and
even that would be switched to other pro-
grams rather than withdrawn. The only real
victims are likely to be private organizations
such as the International Planned Parent-
hood Federation, which could lose its $ll
million annual U.S. subsidy because a mi-
nuscule portion of its $ 50 million worldwide
budget goes for abortion services.
Fears: Many at the Mexico City confer-
ence have dismissed the White House move
as election-year grandstanding aimed at
mollifying right-to-life conservatives in the
United States. But there are also fears that
raising the abortion issue could spark a divi-
sive round of moralistic debate. Similar con-
cerns surround a second, and in many ways
even more controversial theme of the U.S.
white paper: that “oppressive economic
policies” rather than overpopulation are the
chief cause of global poverty. That argu-
ment, ironically, echoes the sentiments of
Third World officials who a decade ago
denounced birth control as a tool of Western
domination, contending instead that “eco-
nomic development is the best contracep-
tive.” Few population experts take issue
with the notion that prosperity pushes down
birth rates. But the overwhelming consensus
today is that real development in most of the
poorest countries cannot even begin until
the population landslide is halted.
Toward that end, a recent report by the
World Bank suggested that funding for fam-
ily-planning programs worldwide should be
boosted to $7 billion annually—more than
even U.N. population officials are currently
asking. Realistically, the chances of obtain-
ing even half that amount are virtually nil.
But as dozens of delegates in Mexico City
will be arguing this week, the ultimate price
of doing less could be even higher.

Contrasting Case Histories
In the spectrum of population-control
programs around the world, Thailand's
stands out as a remarkable success sto-
ry—while Kenya's determined efforts
have proven a sad failure. News week’s
David Hatcher in Bangkok and Charles
Harrison in Nairobi filed these reports:
To hear Mechai Viravaidya tell it, the
key to population control is humor, not
sermonizing. “The most successful pro-
grams never involve coercion,” says the
secretary-general of Thailand’s Popula-
tion and Community Development As-
sociation (PDA), the country’s premier
birth-control agency. “In matters be-
tween the navel and the knee, force has
never worked. So we keep it
joyful, voluntary and fun.”
Fun, to Mechai, means birth-
control carnivals, where fes-
tivities include contests in
which kids blow up condoms.
Or passing out key rings with
plastic-encased condoms at-
tached. Printed on the case:
“In case of emergency, break
glass.” Such silliness is all in the
name of a very serious goal:
desensitizing the intensely pri-
vate issue of birth control. Says
Mechai: “If you can get people
to laugh with you on the topic
of family planning, part of the
battle is over.”
‘Mechais’: In the last 10 years
Mechai’s happy-warrior ap-
proach has worked. Thailand’s
population-growth rate has
dropped by almost half, from
3.3 percent a year to 1.7 percent.
But the PDA is not all fun and
games. The agency has repre-
sentatives in more than 16,000
rural villages who distribute
birth-control devices and advice. Mobile
clinics provide free voluntary steriliza-
tion and other services. And everywhere,
PDA workers pass out condoms —so
many, in fact, that Thais now commonly
refer to the devices as “mechais.”
Thailand’s success has drawn plau-
dits —and funding—from all over the
world. More important, some 60 percent
of Thai couples now practice birth con-
trol. But even that impressive figure will
have to be improved on. Unless 1 million
more couples are added to the birth-
control rolls, the country will not reach
“replacement fertility” levels, or two
children per family, by 1990. That will
mean 8 million more mouths to feed—a
burden Thailand is ill equipped to bear.
In Kenya the government slogan
“Small family, happy family” has fallen
on deaf ears. Despite a decadelong, $ 100
million effort, the national birthrate is
still more than 4 percent a year, the
highest in the world.-Arnd that may not
reflect the extent of the problem, since
many births go unrecorded. Only about
250,000 couples—out of a population of
20 million —use birth control. Prenatal
hospital visits outnumber family-plan-
ning appointments by 10 to 1. “We’ve
made almost no progress,” says one fam-
ily-planning expert. “The message just
doesn’t get across.”
Part of the problem is that the very
concept of birth control clashes with
traditional Kenyan values. The society
Mechai: ‘We keep it joyful, voluntary and fun’
has a wide moralistic streak, and there is
little public discussion about contracep-
tion. Family-planning centers have no
public signs, and there is no sex educa-
tion in the schools. “We are not prepared
to teach girls about contraceptives,” says
Leo Odero, the Kenyan Education Min-
istry’s permament secretary. “That
would be a license for teen-age sex.” But
licensed or not, an average of 20 percent
of Kenyan girls drop out of school each
year because they become pregnant.
In the face of such odds, the govern-
ment is calling for urgent action. The
current target: reducing the birthrate
from 4.1 percent to 3.8 by 1988. Given
public attitudes, even that modest goal
may be impossible to meet. But Kenya
will face greater hardship if it cannot find
a way to defuse its population bomb.

EUROPE
The White Plague’s Toll
Police in Paris search narcotics suspects: Tougher laws have been little help to overwhelmed enforcement authorities
Once ‘America’s problem,’ drug addiction claims a
vast underground of addicts from Dublin to Rome.
When the fabled “French Connection”
drug network was dismantled 12
years ago, heroin addiction was rare in
France. The port of Marseilles, where opium
was refined into heroin, was only a way
station on the trail from the poppy fields of
Turkey to the street corners and back alleys
of the United States. Now the drug problem
has come home to France with a vengeance.
“It’s as bad here now as it was at the height of
the [U.S.] epidemic in the late 1960 s and
early 19705,” says Nicolas Panella, the head
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion in Paris. “It’s the same all over Europe. ”
From Dublin to Rome, the supplies of
cocaine and heroin are seemingly limitless,
and law-enforcement officials concede they
are fighting a losing battle to control them.
Every year police make more arrests and
intercept more shipments, but the mount-
ing statistics merely reflect a mounting
problem. No one could have predicted the
poisonous flood 10 years ago, when some
governments liberalized the laws for simple
possession of “softer” drugs such as mari-
juana. But those changes have come back to
haunt lawmakers and have plunged Eu-
rope’s big cities into a nightmare of crime.
Drug addiction—whether to alcohol or
narcotics—has bedeviled Europe for years,
but never has the heroin problem been so
bad. The human toll is staggering. Hundreds
die each year as a result of putting needle to
vein. Thousands of others suffer indirectly,
the victims of addicts who steal to support
their habits. Once restricted to the mean
streets of Amsterdam and West Berlin, her-
oin now cuts a swath through every country
in Europe, reaching even into Spain and

Ireland, which were previously almost un-
touched. Poverty is no longer a prerequisite
for addiction; lords and ladies now end up as
junkies, and children of the middle class,
some not even into their teens, are the fastest-
growing group of abusers. And the supply
routes from the headwaters of the drug trade
are so secure that for a girl in a Liverpool
public-housing estate, getting a fix of heroin
is “like buying a bag of sugar. ”
Brazen: In some places, it may be even
easier. Just yards from Paris’s bustling Gare
de Lyons, on the scruffy Rue de Chalon,
groups of pushers casually ply their wares at
all hours of the day. “White or brown, white
or brown,” they chant outside the railroad
station, indicating a choice between high-
grade white heroin and less-refined, less-
expensive “brown sugar.” To their regret,
Parisians are getting used to the brazen
street-corner drug dealing. But heroin is not
available just in the big cities. In the piazzas
of even the smallest Italian towns, teen-
agers inject each other in broad daylight.
And in the sleepy rural West German state
of Lower Saxony, 44 people died of over-
doses last year.
Europe’s heroin pipeline begins high in
the hills of Asia. Western governments have
campaigned for years to end the flow, with
little result. In the Golden Triangle—
Burma, Laos and Thailand —and the Gold-
en Crescent —Afghanistan, Iran and Paki-
stan —farmers outside the influence of any
government grow the opium poppies from
which the sticky brown heroin base is made.
The Continent’s burgeoning coke habit is
fed by the “Cocaine Express,” a network
reaching from the coca bushes of South
America through Madrid’s Barajas Air


port. Once the drugs arrive, there is no
controlling their spread, since many Euro-
peans can now drive from one country to
another without having their cars stopped.
Patterns of consumption are shifting
rapidly. “At first, hard-drug use was re-
stricted to certain milieus,” says Dr. Marc
Valleur of the Marmottan Hospital in Par-
is, Europe’s largest drug-abuse clinic.
“Now it has hit all classes.” Cocaine, once
affordable only by the wealthy, has trick-
led down to the lower classes, even as
heroin has climbed the social ladder. Earli-
er this year, James Spencer-Churchill, the
Marquis of Blandford, proved dramatical-
ly that heroin addiction is not limited only
to the downtrodden; the future Duke of
Marlborough and heir to a fortune esti-
mated at $52 million admitted he had been
a heroin addict and told of spending two
months withdrawing from the drug on a
remote Scottish island.
‘An Army of Children’: At 28, Spencer-
Churchill was old for a junkie. According to
French police statistics, people under 20
constitute the largest percentage of those
arrested for drug use, and some 80 percent
of French addicts are between 15 and 25.
Health officials in Bonn estimate that
1 million West German children aged 11 to
15 regularly take some kind of drugs. Deal-
ers in some countries are even using addict-
ed children as pushers and couriers, since
they cannot be prosecuted for their crimes.
“There is an army of children involved in
drugs in Naples,” says Italian psychologist
Carlo Cesarini. “The families sometimes go
along with it because often the kids’ income
is all the family has.”
The end result is a huge underground of
addicts: 120,000 in France, as many as
40,000 in Great Britain, even 6,000 in tiny,
conservative Ireland. With an estimated
250,000 abusers, Italy may have a higher
per capita junkie rate than even the United
States. The casualties are numbing: 472
deaths last year in West Germany, 190 in
France, 35 already this year in Amster-
dam’s seedy Zeedijk area. Italy did not re-
cord a single drug-overdose death until
1973; last year there were 257. Crime is
another apparently inevitable byproduct of
the spread of hard drugs. Spanish police say
that 75 percent of their crime is now drug
related. Behind the statistics are real stories.
One of the ugliest is the report of a 25-year-
old addict arrested in Italy last month for
allegedly forcing his 42-year-old mother
into prostitution to pay for his heroin habit.
The mounting death and destruction can
be blamed at least in part on liberal Eu-
ropean drug laws passed during the 19705.
Despite its grim drug and crime statistics,
Amsterdam still provides a haven for
abusers. The city government regards ad-
dicts as “patients” and provides a dormi-
tory boat for junkies who have nowhere to
sleep. And the Dutch Finance Ministry has
approved tax breaks for the parents of
abusers who support their childrens’ habits.
But in other countries pressure is on for
tougher laws. The outcry is loudest in Spain,
where penalties for using many drugs were
reduced in 1983. The increase in crime and
drug-related deaths since then has made the
softer laws a rallying point for opposition to
the 21-month-old government of Socialist
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
But tougher laws alone will not be
enough. After all, in West Germany the
personal use of marijuana can—and some-
times does —bring a full year’s prison term
and a fine of $360. Yet the country’s drug
problem is among the worst anywhere. Eu-
ropean police are simply outnumbered,

which means they are destined to lose the
white-powder wars. Police even admit that
the soaring numbers of arrests and seizures
are probably due more to the law of averages
than to any real gains against the pushers;
with so many people peddling so much her-
oin and cocaine, the authorities are simply
bound to discover it more often.
Despite their problems, the police do not
come up empty-handed every time. And in
the fight against hard drugs, they are discov-
ering that a little cooperation makes a big dif-
ference. Last April drug-enforcement au-
thorities in Italy, Switzerland and the
United States pitched in together to smash
an operation allegedly run by Gaetano Ba-
dalamenti, a Sicilian accused of running one
of the biggest heroin-smuggling rings ever.
According to U.S. Department of Justice
charges, Badalamenti masterminded an
elaborate scheme in which some $1.65 bil-
lion worth of heroin was moved from the
Netherlands to Spain and then to the United
States, where it was distributed through
neighborhood pizza parlors.
Record Harvest: But in the war on drugs,
good news is almost always balanced by bad.
The worst news of the year has to be the
record harvest in the poppy fields of Asia,
which will speed more, and purer, heroin to
Europe in the months to come. Unfortunate-
ly, as America’s drug warriors have learned,
there is probably not much that can be done
to stop it. Since the days of the French
Connection, the United States has waged a
relentless campaign against narcotics —at
the source, along trafficking routes and at
home. Despite those efforts, America’s drug
problem has only gotten worse. The grim
message for Europe may be that the latter-
day white plague is not going to go away.

WORLD BUSINESS
OPEC’s Upside-Down World
The OPEC ogre seemed to be strangling
on its own gasoline hose. Oil prices were
tumbling on the spot market, the market-
savvy Soviet Union had cut the price of its
crude exports by $1.50 a barrel, and U.S.
refiners were reducing the amount they
would pay for new oil liftings. W orst of all for
the producers, Saudi Arabia had at least
temporarily abandoned its role as OPEC’s
stabilizing force and had actually abetted the
free fall in prices. One industry expert sur-
veyed the supply-and-demand scene last
week and declared that the oil cartel was
fighting a losing battle. Henry Wojtyla, who
has a good forecasting record as an econo-
mist for Rosenkrantz Ehrenkrantz Lyon &
Source: Data Resources, Inc.
BOB CONRAD
Ross, said the world price of oil will keep
dropping until August 1985, when it will
bottom out at $l5 a barrel—about half its
current price.
A further drop in oil prices of any magni-
tude would be welcome news to energy con-
sumers everywhere. But a sharp drop in
world oil would also have negative repercus-
sions, and they would extend well beyond
the tight little world of OPEC producers.
The profits of major oil companies would
suffer; analyst Barry Good of Morgan Stan-
ley & Co. says the third quarter is already a
lost cause for the majors. Heavily indebted
Mexico, a non-OPEC producer, would be
even more hard pressed to pay off its huge
foreign debt. And the British pound prob-
ably would fall further in relation to the
rises or falls from the agreed-to level. The
trouble is that many members cheat on their
quotas and the oversupply persists.
Bombings and Boeings: The glut worsened
earlier this year as colder-than-normal
weather forced refineries to produce more
heating oil. Because each barrel of crude
they “cracked” to get heating oil also pro-
duced gasoline, inventories of that fuel
swelled. Oil users and speculators also
stocked up when they thought—incorrect-
ly, it turned out —that the tanker bombings
in the Gulf would reduce oil shipments. It
was a time for Saudi Arabia to cut its produc-
tion. But the Saudis wanted to buy 10 Boeing
747 s without depleting their cash reserves,
and they decided to pay in oil —playing
exactly the opposite market role from the
one they were supposed to. “Everyone as-
sumed the 36 million barrels of crude [to pay
for the planes] would be spread out into
100,000-barrel lots over a year,” says Mor-
gan Stanley’s Good. “Instead they seemed to
be selling them in four weeks.” Several
sources say the Saudis have now cut back
production—but their credibility as a stabi-
lizing force has been undercut.
Current market pressures may be too
much for the Saudis and the rest of the cartel
to cope with in any case. Fierce competition
in the sale of gasoline and other oil products,
especially in the United States, is reducing
prices and pulling down the price of crude.
This is true in the U.S. gasoline market even
though demand for the fuel is 5 percent
higher than it was a year ago. As a result, the
price of an average gallon of gasoline last
week was 92 cents, before taxes, down from
95 cents a month earlier and $1.13 two years
ago. Product prices aren’t falling sharply in
Europe, but there is no great demand either.
The European economy has yet to match the
American boom; and because oil is priced in
ever-rising dollars, European consumers
haven’t benefited enormously from nomi-
nally lower prices and continue to conserve
energy as best they can.
Politics: Big integrated oil companies can
be hurt two ways as prices fall. They get less
money for their own crude production, and
for political reasons they often continue to
pay high “official” prices when they buy
from OPEC. This is especially true of the
Aramco companies that still pay $29 a barrel
for Saudi light crude. Experts estimate that
each barrel of this “marker” crude yields
products that bring a total of only $25.22
in the marketplace. Major U.S. companies
have other profit sources to bail them
out, but many small refiners aren’t so
lucky. Even spot-market prices for crude
aren’t low enough to give some refiners
much profit—and many of them may soon
close down.
The consensus of the experts, however, is
that the oil cartel will be able to get its
production under better control before fall-
ing prices lead to the wreck of OPEC and
other segments of the industry. It is certainly
getting strong support from non-OPEC pro-
ducers. British Energy Minister Alick Bu-
chanan-Smith took the unusual step last
week of writing to major North Sea produc-
ers urging them to hold the line on prices,
and so far they have. But while OPEC may
avert outright disaster it seems helpless to
reverse the basic price trend. The U.S. De-
partment of Energy foresees a continuing,
gradual decline in oil prices at least through
1986, when it says the official marker price
will be $26 a barrel compared with $29
today. The price of oil, which contributed
more than anything else to high inflation in
the 1970 s and early 1980 s, is now playing a
new role: helping to hold down prices over a
broad spectrum of the economy.

dollar if Great Britain’s North Sea oil treas-
ure declines in market value. Says Gulf Oil
chairman James Lee: “I think we are kind of
on a razor’s edge.”
No one really knows, of course, which
way the price of oil is going and how far.
Spot-market prices seemed to be firming late
last week, and many experts said the worst
may be over. But a fundamental oversupply
situation has caused world prices to drop 25
percent since early 1981. OPEC can sell only
about 60 percent of the oil it can produce,
and the cartel has agreed to limit its produc-
tion to prevent a ruinous glut. Saudi Arabia,
OPEC’s biggest producer, is supposed to
adjust its production up and down if demand

Wall Street’s Wildest Week
As surely as the August heat bakes the
pavement along Wall Street, money
managers hope for a summer stock-market
rally. Last week they finally got it. The Dow
Jones industrial average soared nearly 87
points, closing the week just over 1,200 for
the first time in six months. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange climbed to a
record 172 million shares on Thursday—
then lofted to a stunning 237 million shares
in Friday’s trading. So frenzied was the
excitement that there was only one apt met-
aphor: “It’s the Michael Jackson concert of
Wall Street,” one broker proclaimed.
The rally was reminiscent of an August
two years ago, when battered bears
launched the bull market almost overnight.
“We thought it was 1982 around here,”
crowed John Phelan, chairman
of the New York Stock Ex-
change, who personally rang
the huge bell that halted last
week’s trading. But the forces
that had unleashed the two
surges were as different as they
could be. The 1982 rally fore-
told economic recovery; the ’B4
version was spurred by signs
that torrid economic growth
was cooling at last. Factory or-
ders and housing starts were
falling, and many investment
managers were betting that in-
terest rates would drop. “Sud-
denly investors are saying may-
be we can have the best of all
worlds—a strong, sustainable
expansion with low inflation
for quite some time,” said Ed-
ward Yardeni, chief economist
at Prudential Bache Securities.
The big question now is
whether the rally will continue.
On the surface, at least, there
are plenty of reasons for opti-
mism. The supply of money
looks to be ample enough to
keep interest rates down. Fed-
eral Reserve Board chairman
Paul Volcker testified to Congress two
weeks ago that the Fed didn’t intend to
tighten money in the months ahead —an
assertion given fresh credence last week
when the central bank reported an unex-
pected $1.7 billion drop in the basic money
supply. And the nation’s inflation rate
seems likely to hold its southward path. The
trend stems in part from the strong dollar,
which has prompted consumption of cheap
imports over higher-priced goods produced
at home. Finally, labor costs have been ris-
ing only moderately, commodity prices
have been declining and sagging oil prices
seemed certain to lower overall prices still
further.
Still, there is good reason to doubt the
economy’s good fortune. While growth has
slowed —perhaps to a real rate as low as 4
percent from 7.5 percent in the second
quarter —analysts say the overall level of
economic activity is still quite high. The
stock-market rally, notes First Pennsylva-
nia economist Kenneth Mayland, could
even increase the pressures. A 100-point
gain in the Dow industrials, Mayland says,
would make Americans wealthier by $l5O
billion and could lead to a fresh round
of Vigorous—and inflationary—consumer
spending.
Swiss: The biggest imponderable may be
the federal deficit. The U.S. Treasury has
begun to consider new ways of making
sure that its massive credit needs are met
without driving up interest rates. One pos-
sibility, designed to keep capital flowing in
from abroad, is to offer so-called bearer
The Big Board at the close: Will the rally last?
Treasury bonds to foreign investors —af-
fording them the kind of anonymity most
can now find only at a Swiss bank or in a
tax haven. Another option is to issue
Treasury securities with yields pegged to
inflation.
Even with such new-fangled financing
gimmicks, government borrowing prom-
ises to prop up most interest rates for the
foreseeable future. But last week few inves-
tors seemed deterred: “People are just look-
ing at the potential good things rather than
the potential bad,” says Peter Lynch, a port-
folio manager at the Fidelity Group. If that
view continues to hold, Wall Street’s sum-
mer rally may keep sizzling.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Pocket PC’s: More Powerful Than Ever
In the computer industry’s trend to-
ward producing more compact machines,
many companies have come out with com-
plex calculators that they call “pocket”
computers. But the machines have generally
been either underpowered, too big or too
expensive to live up to the promise of their
name. Now Psion Ltd. of London has intro-
duced a pocket computer that just may live
up to its billing.
Psion’s calculator-size computer, called
the Psion Organiser, contains a built-in
data-base facility and an eight-bit processing
chip. It has a simple programmable lan-
guage, clock and calculator functions, a full
alphanumeric keyboard and a 16-character
liquid-crystal display. The Organiser’s chief
attraction is the data base, which allows
users to store up to 32,000 characters of
information at one time. A user could, for example, store the
entire contents of a pocket telephone book, an appointments
calendar and several shopping lists—with plenty of room
to spare.
The Organiser’s memory is stored in removable solid-state
cartridges, called datapacks, each of which can contain as
much as 16,000 bits of information. This allows users to
increase the Organiser’s capacity simply by purchasing more
cartridges. Theoretically, a pocketful of the thumb-size data-
packs could give the Organiser the same capacity as an IBM
Personal Computer, although only two datapacks can be
plugged into the computer at one time. Psion intends eventu-
ally to expand the datapacks to hold as much as 128,000 bits
The Organiser: Calculator-size
of information apiece. The Organiser also
has a search function similar to that found in
more sophisticated —and larger—word pro-
cessors. The user can gain access to stored
material through a process called string
matching: when a set of key letters, such as a
date, is punched in, the computer scans
through its memory until it finds the rel-
evant information.
While the Psion Organiser is a significant
step beyond pocket computers already on
the market, another British company has
come out with a less ambitious computer
that is also built on a data-base system —and
could prove an attractive alternative for
businessmen who don’t need the capacity
and flexibility that the Organiser provides.
Produced by Domicrest Ltd. of London, the
Biztec Pad is mainly designed to keep track
of expenses and travel arrangements. It has eight preset
categories of information: car expenses, hotels, entertain-
ment, meals, mileage, telephone numbers, travel and miscel-
laneous. Although it has a relatively small 4,000-bit memory
and no removable datapacks, the Biztec pad does have a
sophisticated appointments calendar, as well as built-in cal-
culator, calendar and stopwatch functions.
Both the Biztec Pad and the Psion Organiser are now on the
market in Britain. Psion plans to begin marketing the Organ-
iser in the rest of Europe and the United States by September.
Domicrest has not yet announced its overseas-marketing strat-
egy. Price: about $l3O for the Organiser; about $9O for the
Biztec Pad.
A New-Age Typewriter
Most modern offices these days are
filled with a host of devices designed to
translate words into type —from the lat-
est word processor to the outmoded but
still indispensable typewriter. Clerical
workers can waste a lot of time running
from their desks to printers and back to
their keyboards. With an eye toward
streamlining the clutter, Protype Corp.
of Sun Valley, Calif., has developed an
office-machine hybrid that combines
the electronic capabilities of a word
processor with the simplicity of a
typewriter.
The Display Typewriter falls some-
where between an IBM Selectric and a
video-display word processor. It con-
sists of a printer, a movable keyboard
and a display screen that can be tilted
and swiveled to adjust to the operator’s
position. For simple clerical tasks, such
as typing envelopes or labels, items can
be slipped in one piece at a time and the
operator can type directly from the key-
board onto the paper. For more com-
plex chores, such as producing form
letters, contracts and statistical tables,
the machine has a “display mode” that
allows the user to compose, edit and
store a document and print it once
it is letter-perfect. The standard memo-
ry holds the equivalent of 15 typed
Protype’s Display Typewriter: Hybrid
pages of material and can be expanded
to 105 pages.
The display screen shows the type ex-
actly as it will appear on a finished page,
including boldface, pitch changes, cen-
tering and margins. An “undo” key
erases the previous command and allows
a user to experiment without worrying
about ruining a complex block of text. A
document isn’t printed until the user has
composed every letter on the screen, so it
can be proofread and revised before it is
transferred to paper.
The Display Typewriter’s greatest ad-
vantage may be its ease of operation.
Printing and typing instructions appear
on the screen, and there are no hidden
commands that have to be memorized.
In addition, all special function keys are
clearly labeled and color-identified.
Protype plans to begin marketing the
Display Typewriter in the United States
by mid-August. The company has not
yet firmed up its plans for overseas mar-
keting. Price: $2,995.

The once flagship of the world’s greatest fleet, the “Alary Rose” is
hoisted from her watery grave on the 11th October, 1982, on an
ingenious ‘bed of air’ developed by Atlas Copco.
The “Mary Rose,” the pride of King Henry VIII and the
greatest Tudor warship ever to set sail, was tragically lost with all
hands in the Solent, off Portsmouth Harbour in 1545.
To this time, no-one knows the real cause of the disaster,
only that on that fateful day 438 years ago, she turned into the
wind to bravely face the attacking French fleet, heeled, and sank.
Rope nets, deployed to prevent enemy boarders, trapped
the 700 crew and took them to the sea bottom with the ship.
It was not until 1967 that she was rediscovered. The team
lead by historian Alexander McKee made the valuable find and

so commenced the mammoth task of retrieving her.
The raising was the result of a twelve year operation by a
team ofarchaelogists, with support from enthusiastic individuals
and companies.
Atlas Copco was among the earliest supporters of the
project, long before many knew there was a vessel worth
salvaging.
By adapting the imaginative ‘bed of air’ concept,
developed during the earlier recovery of the Swedish Galleon
“Vasa” and by providing air compressors, together with pumps,
turbo lamps and innumerable and varied pneumatic tools, Atlas
Copco equipment and technical knowhow has been a key factor
in the triumphant success of the project.

The importance of the "Mary Rose" is two-fold. She
represents a time capsule of life in Tudor times with beautifully
preserved artifacts ranging from weapons to domestic items.
She is of equal importance to Naval historians, being the

It was King Henry VIII who first ordered his salvage
experts to raise the "Mary Rose.” They were beaten by the simple
mechanics of the era, and it took 20th century technology and
Atlas Copco to crown the "Mary Rose" queen of the seas once
more. ’

Over one hundred years ago, in a time when man was a

was born.
Since that time, Atlas Copco has been the forerunner in
the development of pressure energy. Compressed air machinery

Today, Atlas Copco technology is working on the more
efficient use of energy and machinery, working on practical

environment, working on ideas that simply make mans work
easier.
In short, Atlas Copco is working on better ways.

Big trouble is brewing
in Aussies’ holiday island
Jean-Marie Tjibaou (left) and French Secretary of State for overseas departments Georges Lemoine: boycott threatened
New Caledonia, the favorite holiday island for thousands of Australians,
is heading for serious political trouble. STUART INDER outlines the problems
arising from a bill recently passed by the French national assembly.
TIME IS RUNNING out for those who
hope to achieve a peaceful solution to
the increasingly grave political prob-
lems facing New Caledonia.
A vital opportunity to slow the. race
towards the brink was lost last week
when the French national assembly
passed into law, by 321 votes to 151, a
bill which gives internal self-govern-
ment to the French Pacific territory and
the opportunity to vote on self-determi-
nation in 1989.
Despite the stated objectives of the
bill, none of New Caledonia’s political
parties wants it. The conservatives be-
lieve it will lead to civil war by remov-
ing the French “umbrella”; the five par-
ties making up the Independence Front
(IF) have said it does not go far enough
or quickly enough and will merely keep
New Caledonia a white French enclave.
In Paris, when the final vote was
taken, Roch Pidjot, one of New Cal-
edonia’s deputies in the assembly, con-
demned the new law as “sweeping aside
the rights of the Kanak people” and
“playing into the hands of the most re-
actionary forces in New Caledonia.”
The Independence Front will now do
what it threatened to do should the bill
be passed boycott the elections to the
reformed Territorial Assembly expected
in September and set up a Kanak “pro-
visional government” dedicated to inde-
pendence by 1986 when the next French
presidential elections are scheduled.
The IF is concerned that political
changes in 'France could upset the offi-
cial timetable for 1989 even if the pre-
sent administration does manage to
make some progress with it.
Some of the Independence parties
last week were talking of not merely
staying away from the elections but also
of occupying booths and closing ballot
boxes to disrupt the proceedings. There
was a renewed demand for Kanaks to
occupy European land.
The French Secretary of State for
Overseas Departments and Territories,
Georges Lemoine, warned in Paris that
the IF’s proposed actions “risked lead-
ing New Caledonia towards a zone of
uncertainty which no one knows how to
control.”
Of that, there can be little doubt. Al-
ready one of the IF members, the
Kanak Socialist Liberation Party, has
split from it over the strategy arguing
that the other IF parties were not
sufficiently organised to set up a pro-
visional government.
The partners have retorted that they
have had two years of experience of
government in the Territorial Assembly,
which was dissolved on June 30 in prep-
aration for the new elections. Vice-
president of New Caledonia’s govern-
ment council (cabinet) in that time was


IF leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou, an influ-
ential moderate who has been deter-
mined to work within the French consti-
tutional framework for independence
but recently has become disillusioned at
what he sees as the lack of real under-
standing by Paris of Kanak aspirations.
His leadership of the IF will make
the fight a far more determined one.
New Caledonia —l5OO km east of
north Queensland and, with its offshore
islands, comprising 19,000 sq km of
land has been French since 1843. At
the heart of its problems is the composi-
tion of its population 145,368 people
at the 1983 census.
They consist, in the main, of 61,870
Melanesians (42.6 percent of the popu-
lation), 53,874 Europeans (37.7 per-
cent), 12,174 Wallis Islanders (8.4 per-
cent), 5570 Polynesians (3.8 percent),
5319 Indonesians (3.7 percent) and 2381
Vietnamese (1.6 percent).
Of these, 76.7 percent were born in
New Caledonia and 17.2 percent in
France or other French territories (such
as Wallis or French Polynesia).
Another significant fact is that 76.3
percent of the European population is
concentrated in the capital of Noumea,
which is well developed, making it a
white enclave, and 75 percent of the
Melanesian population is dispersed
through the less-developed interior.
For various reasons, successive
French governments have encouraged
waves of immigration. The eggs are well
scrambled, with the majority of the
population having the right to call New
Caledonia home. They have no other
and they now have rights, too.
But the minorities among them, par-
ticularly the Wallis Islanders, have al-
ways feared that a Kanak government
would discriminate against them even
to the extent of repatriation. Thus they
vote with the European conservatives to
keep the Kanak parties in the minority.
Only a shift in internal alliances saw the
Kanaks recently in control of the gov-
ernment council.
The Kanak leaders see the new bill as
doing nothing to break this conservative
alliance.
The battle lines will be drawn in the
next few weeks as the Front’s detailed
plans for provisional government are
made known. Pressure will certainly be
applied in international forums with
the South Pacific Forum meeting to be
held in Tuvalu at the end of August be-
ing a critical benchmark.
New Caledonia is on the South Pa-
cific Forum’s agenda, as it has been for
years. Early strong criticism of France’s
colonial attitudes in the territory gave
way to a forum policy of “wait-and-see,
give-them-time” after the French social-
ists came to power.
Former New Zealand prime minister
Sir Robert Muldoon was the strongest
exponent of the non-interference pol-
icy, fearing that a French withdrawal
would destabilise the South Pacific.
Passing of the Paris bill guarantees a
heated debate at the forum. The hawks
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands
and Vanuatu will be restrained fur-
ther and the vital issue the forum will
face is whether it will support a move to
get New Caledonia listed with the UN
Decolonisation Committee.
Paris has always opposed such a sug-
gestion on the ground that New Cal-
edonia is an integral part of France and
not a colony. The Independence Front
sees such a move as a way of guarantee-
ing that Kanak rights will be made the
subject of regular United Nations and
world scrutiny.
The Kanaks can be expected to put
on pressure for such a listing. Vanuatu
particularly, but all members of the
Melanesian bloc at the forum, would
support it. Without Muldoon, it could
have a fair chance of succeeding.
Would a unilateral declaration of in-
dependence be possible and would the
IF want one? Right now, “No.”
Neither the inhabitants nor any of
New Caledonia’s political parties are
anti-French. The arguments have
centred around Kanak rights, as the
original inhabitants of the territory, to
control their destiny, preferably under
the French umbrella. The difficulties
have been in assigning the rights
of others who now live in New
Caledonia.
But the present situation is likely to
result in the frustrated Kanaks taking a
more and more extreme stand, a greater
polarisation.leading to a fight for inde-
pendence whether ready or not. □
NEW ZEALAND
Lange team
surprises
on two fronts
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALANDERS who con-
centrated so single-mindedly last month
on ridding themselves of the Muldoon
government are discovering that the
Lange government is full of surprises.
Previous Labor governments have
been unorthodox in the economic field
and extremely conservative in foreign
affairs but the Lange team looks as if it
will be heavily orthodox in its economic
policies and highly radical in foreign
affairs.
Already the South African consulate
in Wellington has closed its doors, fol-
lowing the reiteration by Prime Minister
David Lange that his government
would not deviate from the party policy
calling for the shutdown of the consul-
ate.
Though Lange had indicated the
South Africans would be given some
time to wind up their activities in Wel-
lington, the authorities in Pretoria de-
cided not to wait for the diplomatic
snub and instead recalled their diplo-
mats much to Lange’s satisfaction.
Although the South Africans had only
a small staff, the consulate had been
active with propaganda supporting ap-
artheid.
Lange has also been forceful in his
attitude to the proposed All Black tour
Associate Finance Minister Prebble (right) confers with Trade Minister Caygill


Former Foreign Affairs Minister Cooper: warned of serious trade consequences
UPI
of South Africa next year. There is un-
likely to be any of the equivocation that
marked the previous government’s
stance on rugby contacts with South
Africa.
Lange’s robust handling of the South
African situation suggests that he may
be equally unyielding on ANZUS and
nuclear policy.
Since the visit of the ANZUS part-
ners to Wellington soon after the July 14
election, it had been widely assumed
that the Lange Government would bend
under the intense pressure of the
ANZUS allies to modify its stand on the
visit of nuclear warships. But Lange has
said that his party policy is “non-negoti-
able.” Observers are wondering whether
he will bend (as Australian Foreign
Minister Bill Hayden did) when the full
weight of US Secretary of State George
Shultz is brought to bear. Lange will
have not only Shultz to contend with
but probably Bob Hawke and Hayden
also. The Australian government, con-
scious of its own left-wing demands for
a nuclear-free future, will not be im-
pressed by New Zealand’s determina-
tion to exclude nuclear warships and
weapons from its ports.
Whether the US and Australia like it
or not, the Lange government plans to
pass legislation next year to declare
New Zealand nuclear-free. The legisla-
tion will be based on the controversial
private member’s bill sponsored by
Labor’s Richard Prebble (now Associ-
ate Finance Minister) which helped to
trigger the snap election. Heavy hints
from Washington that New Zealand
could face trade sanctions have not
shaken Labor’s conviction that it must
proceed. A leading government
backbencher, Helen Clark, who was the
party spearhead on disarmament when
Labor was in opposition, said: “The
Labor government will be seeking a new
and more mature relationship with the
United States.
“Clearly that, and our election, has
come as something of a shock to those
who presently determine American for-
eign policy. This country is under no
obligation to accept visits from the nu-
clear ships of any nation.”
The US government, she added, had
to come to terms with the broad man-
date the New Zealand government had
for its policy. “It is not desirable that we
should be cast in the role of a surrogate
policeman for great power interests in
the South Pacific,” she said.
Labor would sponsor a South Pacific
regional conference under United
Nations auspices to work towards a
nuclear-weapons-free zone. The aim
would be an international treaty signed
by South Pacific countries to prohibit
nuclear testing in the region, stop
signatories acquiring nuclear weapons
or nuclear military bases on their ter-
ritories and prevent the dumping of nu-
clear waste. Clark said the treaty would
also be open to ratification by nuclear
powers, such as the US and China.
Meanwhile, the former Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Warren Cooper, has
warned that New Zealand faces serious
consequences in its trade relationships
as well as its defence posture. What
probably disturbs the US government is
the example New Zealand’s non-nu-
clear involvement might set others.
Lange probably will hear from Hawke
and other South Pacific leaders what the
New Zealand government’s stand
means to them when he goes to Papua
New Guinea for the Commonwealth re-
gional heads-of-government meeting
next week.
If the Lange government has been
making waves in its external relations, it
also has been acting decisively on the
domestic front.
In the wake of New Zealand’s 20
percent devaluation and the freeing of
interest rates, nearly $1 billion of the
$1.4 billion that fled the country has re-
turned home and the country’s foreign
reserves at $2.5 billion are higher
than ever before.
Former prime minister Sir Robert
Muldoon has urged a revaluation but
this has been resisted by the Minister of
Finance, Roger Douglas, who said he
would not take advice from the man
who had led the country to the brink of
economic ruin.
It is now clear that, at the height of
the devaluation crisis, New Zealand was
within days of defaulting.
Labor spokesmen make clear that
New Zealand must bite the bullet.
Douglas says the government is being
forced to make hard tax choices
“There will be some pain but we must
ensure that it is borne fairly.”
The tax system was being reviewed,
he added, to put the emphasis on re-
warding the earning of income rather
than on capital gains. It seems that the
tax break which those on higher in-
comes enjoyed during the Muldoon
years are no long going to prevail.
Douglas, already one of the pace-
makers in the Lange cabinet, lifted the
13-month embargo on Australian in-
vestment in New Zealand to break the
deadlock on the trans-Tasman invest-
ment dispute which has been stifling de-
velopment of the closer economic rela-
tionship between Australia and New
Zealand.
Muldoon imposed the embargo in
retaliation for the unfavorable treat-
ment New Zealand companies were be-
ing given by Australia’s Foreign Invest-
ment Review Board.
Douglas’ move is clearly in anticipa-
tion of a move by Australian Treasurer
Paul Keating towards harmonising in-
vestment rules between the two coun-
tries.
If that can be done, a rapid surge in
trans-Tasman investment and trade can
be expected. And the Lange-Douglas
team, already in high favor with the
business community, would be looking
like gold medallists. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
The Big Australian
puts on a happy face
BHP opened the doors and windows on its corporate soul last week in a
remarkable PR exercise which showed, as DA VID HASELHURSTreports,
a deep-seated concern about its share market rating and vulnerability.
BHP is at once Australia’s largest com-
pany and a paradox in its own land.
While other major Australian re-
source stocks sell at prices of between
12 and 30 times earnings, the unfeeling
stock market, in pricing BHP at $lO, ac-
cords the Big Australian a lowly rating
of only 7.2 times latest year’s earnings.
It is selling as chairman Sir James
Balderstone said last week at “a bar-
gain basement price.”
Indeed, after revealing a well-antici-
pated record net profit of $622 million,
BHP’s shares actually fell from $9.74 to
a low last week of $9.60. The recovery to
$lO late in the week added $lBO million
to BHP’s market capitalisation, which
now stands at around $4.5 billion
twice as large as Australia’s next-biggest
listed company, CRA.
It is difficult to speculate on how
much of the recovery might have been
due to the tens of thousands of dollars
BHP plunged into an extraordinary
public relations exercise to follow the
preliminary profit announcement.
BHP’s profit was announced to the
stock exchanges after lunch on Friday
July 27. The shares promptly fell 4c in
the afternoon. The next day, remarkable
full-page advertisements appeared in
the major capital city morning dailies
throughout the nation and in provincial
centres where BHP has operations, such
as Newcastle, Wollongong, Whyalla
and Rockhampton.
The one-day advertising splurge, or-
ganised through Melbourne
agency Saatchi Saatchi-
MCR Compton, cost around
$60,000.
At first glance, it could
have been the opening shot in
the Hawke government’s next
election campaign. The page
was headlined: “What initia-
tive, hard work and consensus
have achieved.” Without re-
stating the figure, it referred to
BHP’s “healthy” profit and
praised the government and
unions for co-operation and
constant constructive dia-
Sir James Baiderstone: bargain price
logue. It urged all Australians to share
BHP’s pride in its commitment to Aus-
tralia’s future.
Had Bob Hawke been an advertising
copywriter, he hardly could have im-
proved on the theme.
On Sunday afternoon, finance jour-
nalists from all over Australia began fly-
ing into Melbourne for a two-day talk-
fest with BHP directors and senior man-
agement.
BHP picked up the air fares for 33
journalists from places as far away as
Port Moresby and Perth but sensibly
held the generosity to economy class to
avoid any impression of spendthrift PR.
The journalists were accommodated
grandly, wined and dined and next
morning issued with plastic bags con-
taining $1.20 each. It was tram fare for
the trip along Bourke Street to BHP’s
steel and glass headquarters and back.
In the theatrette they joined 19 Mel-
bourne-based journalists, 49 brokers,
analysts and institutional investment
managers and head office corporate
public relations officers for an all-day
talk-and-question session.
BHP for many years has flown jour-
nalists to Melbourne to attend the com-
pany’s annual meeting in September
but never before has it arranged a press
gathering (or a gathering of such size)
immediately following the release of its
preliminary final figures. The company
plainly was eager to get across the mes-
sage that the bad times were behind it
and the giant was on a new growth path.
Managing director Brian Loton
opened the session with a round-up of
BHP’s achievements in the past year
and what was to come the “exciting”
Jabiru oil discovery, the opening of the
Worsley alumina refinery, the com-
missioning of the $4OO million River-
side coal mine and the $260 million
Stage I of the Kooragang coal loader,
the $2.4 billion Utah acquisition, the
first gold from Ok Tedi and
the first gas to flow from the
North West Shelf to Perth in
September.
Russell Fynmore, execu-
tive general manager, BHP
Petroleum, gave the afternoon
newspapers the first chance to
file copy $l5O million to be
spent on oil exploration this
year and production in Bass
Strait to be cranked up from
an average 359,000 barrels a
day in 1983 to 411,000 in 1984
with a target of closer to
500,000 a day.

Utah’s Jim Curry: presented a sweeping review
Broker Jim Bain: congratulated BHP for frankness
He also confirmed that
BHP was seeking to acquire a
profitable oil company in the
United States (with a reputed
price of up to half-a-billion
dollars) plus income-produ-
cing oil interests in the North
Sea. (BHP will be driven into
those acquisitions because the
Australian government, un-
like the US and British gov-
ernments, will not allow over-
seas exploration costs to be
deductable for tax against
domestic profits.)
Then David Rice, execu-
tive general manager, BHP
Steel, got another story in the
afternoon papers a further
$2O million steel sales contract
with China, raising sales to
that country to $7O million
this year. He also detailed
some $5OO million in capital
spending to be launched this
year in raising the productiv-
ity at BHP’s steel plants in
Port Kembla, Newcastle and
Whyalla and the shedding
of another 1000 men, bringing
steel division employee numbers down
from 46,000 in 1981 to fewer than
28,000.
After Jim Curry, executive director,
Utah International Inc, presented a
sweeping review of all the goodies BHP
had picked up in the Utah purchase
completed in April, the fact-infested
meeting broke for a BHP-hosted lunch.
By 2.15 pm everyone was back at it
and more stories were dropped for the
morning papers. Dick Carter, general
manager of resource planning and de-
velopment, reviewed all the major pro-
jects and pointed out that with a turn-
Managing director Brian Loton: round-up of achievement
over in the minerals division of around
$BOO million a year it ranked among the
top mining houses of Australia a fact
that was, he said, “often overlooked.”
Carter also said that the minerals
division expected to bring in at least
one new major gold mine, a major base
metals mine and “some other” major
mine within the next decade. We would
see expansion and downward integra-
tion in aluminium and possibly copper.
Late in the afternoon, Geoff Heely,
executive general manager, finance,
gave the meeting a peek into the corpor-
ate purse, revealing BHP’s enormous
financial muscle. The gearing
ratio remains at a modest 23
percent, despite swallowing
the Utah takeover, capital
spending totalled $2.1 billion
last year and cash flow ex-
ceeds $1.5 billion.
After broker Jim Bain,
chairman of the Australian
Associated Stock Exchanges,
congratulated the BHP man-
agement for its frankness,
those journalists not filing
copy for the morning papers
adjourned to hostelries where,
alas, they squandered their re-
turn fare.
A cocktail party with vari-
ous directors back in town
moved on to a dinner. BHP
was able to prevail upon
Charles Goode, senior partner
of Potter Partners, to outline
glowingly the scope of the
company. He predicted earn-
ings a share for 1984-85
of $1.60 which would
put BHP on a price-earnings
multiple of only six.
Goode, along with practi-
cally every other securities analyst in
Australia and Balderstone, agrees that
BHP’s shares are worth more than the
market rates them. The table on page
122 reviewing the past five years’ results
shows BHP selling at nearly $1.50 under
disclosed net assets a share (reduced in
the past year to $11.47 following the re-
cent one-for-five bonus issue).
The share price level probably didn’t
worry the management greatly until
August 1983 after all, they are very
tiny shareholders. But the dreaded
Robert Holmes a Court then launched a
bid for BHP stock through an obscure


Perth company called Wigmores Ltd,
now Bell Resources.
Holmes a Court appears to have
taken a beating following the slump in
BHP’s share price but, with some 20
million shares, his group has become
No 2 to the AMP Society on the share
register. The directors are acutely aware
now that a predator could arrange a
couple of billion dollars, take control
and turf them into the street.
Only two stocks are classified by the
stock exchanges as diversified resources
companies involved in a wide range of
commodities BHP and CSR.
The following tables show the split of
their profit sources:
BHP
$OOO %
Steel division 72.337 11.3
John Lysaght 39.363 6.2
Minerals division 66.331 10.4
Petroleum division 426.384 66.7
Utah division 9.887 1.6
Other sources 24.390 3.8

Aluminium, minerals and chemicals 15.3 16.7
Coal 11.9 13.0
Oil and gas 11.5 12.5
91.7 100.0
BHP clearly has put its troubles be-
hind it and although earnings from oil
will not be so strong this year, due to
higher taxes, most analysts are project-
ing a net profit of $6BO million to more
than $7OO million for 1984-85.
CSR, with heavy reliance on an
alarming world sugar market, is looking
at little or no growth in the coming year.
Yet CSR sells on a price earnings
multiple of 14, around twice the BHP
rating. Part of the reason may be that
CSR in recent years has paid two-thirds
or better of its earnings out in dividends
to shareholders whereas BHP, with a
long reputation of stinginess to share-
holders, has restricted dividend pay-
ments over the past decade to as little as
one quarter of annual earnings and at
best to well under half.
If comparisons with the Australian
market are dismissed, BHP is rated very
much in line with major US companies
in the same fields.
More than 20 percent of BHP is held
by overseas investors and it is their buy-
ing and selling that appears to deter-
mine BHP’s ranking.
The next big chance for BHP’s share
price will be the result of the Jabiru No
4 well, 2km north-east of the discovery
well. The new well spudded in last Sat-
urday and we shall know before the end
of August whether BHP has a bonanza
or a bust. □
THE MEDIA
Maxwell promises
to shine a
tarnished Mirror
By ROBERT DARROCH
ROBERT MAXWELL’S £113.4 million
($lBO million) acquisition of the Lon-
don Daily Mirror and its group com-
prising 33 million weekly newspaper
sales may have been greeted with mixed
reactions in and out of Fleet Street.
For the Czech (born Jan Ludvik Hoch)
who fought for the British during the
war, won the Military Cross, bought a
small technical book firm in 1951 and
parlayed it into a printing empire worth
at least £2OO million it has been the
realisation of a dream to be a Press
Baron. The dream dates back more than
15 years to when Rupert Murdoch beat
him to the News of the World ; then it
was the Sun and, in later years, The
Times.
Maxwell’s satisfaction at gaining
perhaps the greatest prize Fleet Street
has to offer is a delight to behold. The
joy of the Mirror Group (MGN)’s for-
mer owners, Reed International, is no
less palpable. They have been support-
ing perhaps the Street of Shame’s fattest
cat (profits last year £5.7 million, down
£2.4 million, on £277 million turnover!)
and putting up with a workforce of 8900
whose perks, privileges and low produc-
tivity are the scandal of even this indus-
try.
Robert Maxwell: a press baron at last
PAUL ARMIGER/CAMERA PRESS
Reed wanted to hive off MGN via a
float but the disappointing Reuter’s
float, a general shares slump and poor
figures sliced the prospective market
value to less than £6O million. So, when
Maxwell put in a bid first of £BO million
then of more than £llO million, Reed
reneged on staff promises not to sell to
any individual and accepted with al-
most indecent alacrity. The takeover
also won the approval of the city and
institutional investors who have forgot-
ten that Maxwell was once was branded
in a government report as “a man unfit
to run a public company.”
The print unions, who had had deal-
ings with Maxwell when he cut 25 per-
cent of British Printing Corporation’s
staff after acquiring that ailing giant in
1981, were horrified. They regard him as
the toughest negotiator in the business
and expect him to try the same inroads
at MGN. The journalists were even
more scandalised.
That there was plenty of fat to cut at
MGN was brought home to Maxwell on
his very first morning at headquarters.
The ranks of waiting executives were
stacked four deep (“Half of us didn’t
know who the other half were,” con-
fessed one.)
Particularly poignant was the atti-
tude of the Labor Party. The Mirror has
long been the party’s sole voice in Fleet
Street, supporting socialism through
thick and thin. The spectacle of an ex-
Labor MP and proud publisher of
Marx, Lenin and Chernenko might
have been expected to please but the op-
posite was the case.
Despite Maxwell’s normally socialist
credentials, the left has grounds for
worry. Not only has he
evinced some admiration for
Tory Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, he professes to want
to be a “Beaverbrook-style”
proprietor, supportive of the
“sensible (his emphasis) left.”
Journalistically (and financi-
ally), Maxwell’s acquisition of
MGN is being seen by many
as a good thing. Though the
Mirror has closed the gap on
the Sun from one million to
600,000 behind, it has lost
sparkle. “Maxwell has bought
a ghost,” commented histor-
ian A. J. P. Taylor. The paper
that virtually invented UK
popular journalism in the 30s
has been outdone by a newer
and brasher style of “tits-and-
bingo” journalism exempli-
fied by the Sun. Maxwell has
vowed to change that and re-
turn the working-class dowa-
ger to her fairy-floss glory. He
has made many promises, in-
cluding a new London even-
ing by September. □

What Mercedes-Benz
has learned from7syears
of cheating the wind.
A Mercedes-Benz saloon sweeps through
the stormy night along a rainswept highway.
Inside the car, stereo music muffles the
rhythmic slap-slap-slap of the wipers and
everything is normal.
But outside the car, everything is not normal.
The rain is heavy, but the side windows
remain oddly unstreaked.
The surface of the drivers outside mirror is
almost free of swirling water.
Sheets of rain should be streaming down and
over the rear window glass, but they aren’t.
Enough grime is kicked up as the car whisks
along to cake the tail lights. But the tail lights
still glow ruby red.
Something strange and wonderful and
aerodynamic is happening to this
Mercedes-Benz.


It is happening by design.
The Mercedes-Benz 4 S Class’ is one of the
most aerodynamically pure four-door saloons.
Its drag co-efficient eclipses many exotic
sports cars and coupes in sheer wind-cheating
efficiency a crucial feat, when every gain of
10 percent in aerodynamic efficiency can yield
a gain of three to four percent in fuel economy.
But for Mercedes-Benz engineers, it is only
step one in the exploitation of aerodynamics.
They look beyond the numbers- game of low
drag co-efficients, to the way a moving car and
the moving air around it interact. They use the
flow of on-rushing air, as it passes over and
around the car, to perform vital extra functions.
In brief, they put aerodynamics to work.
Extending the science of cheating the wind to
include the idea of harnessing the wind.
As that Mercedes-Benz saloon forges ahead
through the storm, aerodynamic science is
being used to sluice rainwater away from its
side and rear window glass.
The shell of its outside mirror has been
aerodynamically shaped to help conduct
swirling rain and slush away from the mirror
surface itself.
The tail light lenses are deeply ribbed to
resemble washboards: not a styling trick but an
aerodynamic art, meant to keep the recessed
grooves clean by sheltering them from the
vortices of airborne water (and mud and slush)
in the car’s slipstream.
Wet weather or dry, aerodynamics helps to
exert a constant downforce on the front axle of
a M ercedes-Benz as it moves along
countering a natural tendency of the front end
to “lift” as speeds rise and more firmly bonding
the tyres to the road.
The car’s body side configuration is
aerodynamically critical. Correct shaping can
help resist the sudden force of violent
sidewinds, invisible blows that could jar a car
off its true path.
A Mercedes-Benz utilizes aerodynamics to
continuously cool specific heat-sensitive
electronic components under its hood. To feed
fresh air into the cabin while silently extracting
stale air. To prevent irritating drafts and
pressure imbalances in the occupants’ ears by
maintaining a constant level of cabin air
pressure at all speeds. To draw exhaust gases
away into the airstream behind the car.
A Mercedes-Benz also employs
aerodynamic science to help calm its driver’s
nerves. Even the outside mirror is shaped to
generate minimal wind noise; if the driver
experiences an almost eerie absence of wind
buffeting and howling as he drives along,
credit the presence of rigorous aerodynamic
detailing.
Mercedes-Benz believes that cheating the
wind in the cause of more fuel-efficient driving
is good. But Mercedes-Benz believes that both
cheating the wind in the cause of fuel effic-
iency and harnessing the wind
in the cause of driving efficiency
is better.
And that is the difference
between aerodynamics and
Mercedes-Benz aerodynamics.
Engineered like
no other car.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Outlook bright for talc miners
KALGOORLIE Southern Gold Mines
NL lodged its annual production report
with the stock exchanges on the last day
of July but nobody seemed to notice.
The company’s major business is
mining talc in partnership with Western
Mining through a jointly-owned com-
pany, Three Springs Talc Pty Ltd.
Business is booming, takeover
raiders are sniffing about and the com-
pany is due for a shake-up that can only
benefit shareholders.
KSGM last March declared a maid-
en dividend of 3c a share paid in April
after a turnaround in profits following
greatly increased production from the
talc mine. December half-year figures
showed:
1983 1982
Ist 'A Ist A
Turnover $ 1.703 m $493,000
Other Income $354,000 $BO,OOO
Pre-tax profit (loss) $374,000 ($14,000)
Tax $297,000 nil
Net profit (loss) $577,000 ($14,000)
Depreciation $llB,OOO $189,000
Earnlngs/share 10.75 c nil
Dividend/share 3c nil
During that same first half, talc pro-
duction attributable to KSGM rose to
38,578 tonnes (previous first-half 18,663
tonnes) and sales amounted to 32,585
tonnes (8530). The company reported
“encouraging strong demand” and
doubled its work capacity with the in-
troduction of two shifts.
The latest production figures for the
full year show output up to 65,749
tonnes (previously 44,239) and sales at
71,915 tonnes (32,815). During the last
quarter, both KSGM and Western
Mining were paid a dividend of
$775,000 from Three Springs Talc.
Profit figures for the full year are not
yet out but sources close to the company
suggest to Wildcat that pre-tax profit
should exceed $2 million.
Then there’s the blue sky in the com-
pany which has at least nine active
minerals exploration projects farmed
out to majors with expenditure commit-
ments in WA running into millions of
dollars. They include:
■ Emu Creek (north-west of
Nullagine): A joint venture with a pro-
specting syndicate in which KSGM is
negotiating with a major international
to farm-in on its 80 percent interest.
This follows the results of geochemical
sampling reported last week which has
outlined a copper-zinc anomaly with as-
sociated minor gold and silver kilo-
metres long and up to one km wide.
■ Nullagine: Mitsui and Sumitomo
have farmed into a gold/base metals ex-
ploration area to earn a half interest by
spending $265,000 in calendar 1984.
■ Golden View (Hannans Lake,
south of Kalgoorlie): Esso is spending
$750,000 to earn 50 percent. A drilling
program has been completed and assays
are awaited.
■ Fimiston Leases (Kalgoorlie):
CRA is spending $900,000 to earn 90
percent in two leases by seeking exten-
sions to a known small but rich primary
ore body.
■ Gullewa (south-west of Yalgoo):
Renison Goldfields is spending $150,000
on this prospecting licence area to earn
70 percent with a diamond drilling pro-
gram to start this quarter.
Other joint ventures are held in WA
with Mitsui, Sumitomo and Anaconda
on rare earths, gold and base metals.
KSGM is 52 percent owned by
Perth-based Universal Milling Co Pty
Ltd and the next-largest shareholder is
Holdings Macquarie Pty Ltd (10.4 per-
cent), controlled by Melbourne ac-
countant Leon Serry.

“Solving the energy problems of tomorrow
calls for new ideas today”
Scientists and advisers at Hoechst.
World energy consumption
is rising, whilst energy reserves
are declining.
The kind of future our
children can look forward to
largely depends on how
vigorously we tackle this
problem now.
Hoechst has taken up this
mammoth challenge.
In association with several
other companies, we have
built in Spain the first experi-
mental updraught power
station in the world. Sun,
wind and heat generate electric
current that is harmless to the
environment.
We have developed new,
high quality plastics for use
in motor production so
increasing their safety and
reducing their petrol
consumption.
These and many more
such projects underline the
determined efforts of Hoechst
scientists and advisers in their
relentless bid to develop alter-
native energy forms which will
enable our children to look with
assurance to the future.

WILDCAT
Brokers show they do give a hoot
FRESH FROM the launch of the sale of
its unit trusts in the 1395-branch Austra-
lia Post network, Potter Partners has
dumped its time honored logo of the
seahorse for an owl.
Arrived at after much research, the
owl will be a star performer in the stock-
brokers retail campaigns and will ap-
pear on company documents and stat-
ionery. Potters marketing manager,
Winston Marsh, told Wildcat that the
homework of advertising agency
Clemenger Harvie and a research group
showed the seahorse a hermaphrodite
did not have much financial standing.
He claims: “People felt the seahorse be-
came vexed in making a decision either
way, that it floated a little with the tide.
“We looked at everything from the
hunting falcon to the fox. We asked the
public what animal or bird they felt epi-
tomised their understanding of a broker
and someone who they would seek out
for investment advice.” The owl was
seen as wise and strong.
Towards the end of the month Pot-
ters will launch a television campaign
the first attempt at mass marketing indi-
vidual equity products advertising the
equity and property trusts marketed by
its subsidiary, P. P. Management Ltd.
The broker will spend $300,000 on the
campaign. The sign-off line reads:
“Where the wise make the most of their
well-earned money.”
Marsh sees the marketing of the
trusts through the post offices as the first
step in educating the public to the basic
investment opportunities in equities. He
says: “The second step may be a nice
company float such as the popular
Jupiters Trust offered to the public
earlier this year.”
Marsh also believes that the market-
ing of shares through the post offices is
not far off. “Once the post offices get
terminals like the banks and building
societies the public should be able to go
in and put an order for 1000 BHP over
the counter.”
Offshore success
ABRAHAM Goldberg, better known
for his forays in the rag trade, is taking
an increasing interest in oil and gas.
Goldberg, chief executive of Entrad
Corporation Ltd (formerly Bradmill In-
dustries Ltd) and his deputy chairman,
Ron Deans, have high hopes for the
group’s US oil and gas exploration and
production activities.
Deans told Wildcat that to date
Entrad had invested some $l6 million
in buying oil areas and working inter-
ests and in drilling and other expendi-
ture in oilfields from 113 wells in which
it had a stake was around $3 million a
year.
In the year to June, Entrad con-
solidated its various investments in oil
and gas syndicates into American Fron-
tier Exploration Inc an 80-percent-
owned subsidiary. A publicly listed
company, American Frontier is traded
on the US over-the-counter market and
quoted on the National Association
of Securities Dealers Quotation
a secondary market for companies
not listed on the major stock exchanges.
At the end of June, American Fron-
tier had a 27 percent interest in 36 wells
in Texas and from 25 to 100 percent
interests in 77 wells in Oklahoma. In the
last six months of 1983-84 the company
increased its working interest by around
25 percent in all wells.
Deans says the company has just be-
gun a major drilling program in which it
will have from 25 to 100 percent inter-
ests in 40 gas wells in Oklahoma. The
present owners are operating successful
wells in these areas and will be entitled
to percentages of revenues as “back-in”
arrangements become operative after
the full cost of the wells has been recov-
ered.
Change initiative
THE ADELAIDE Stock Exchange
hopes to lure previously wary private
companies on to its boards later this
year with the introduction of a second
board market.
This exchange will offer the smaller
companies a chance to raise capital
from the public but at the same time
remain safe from takeover predators
roaming the main board. Alan
Cunningham, the exchange’s secretary,
said that proposals submitted to the
National Companies and Securities
Commission were for the issue of two
types of share. The vendors share-
holders in the private companies
would be entitled to an “A” class share
giving them three times the voting
power of the ordinary “B” shares held
by the public.
This would mean vendors could sell
as much as 70 percent of a company to
the public but still retain control.
Cunningham says: “One of the main
ideas of the board in South Australia is
for the family type companies to enter
the boards without fear of takeover”.
The exchange has supplied the South

Scotch again
SIR JAMES Balderstone’s appointment
to the chair of BHP reasserts the tra-
ditional hold that Melbourne’s Scotch
College old boys have on the company’s
top seat.
Bulletin columnist and Scotch old
boy himself, David McNicoll, reminded
Wildcat that a 30-year domination of
the chairmanship by the old school tie
has only been broken by the reign of Sir
James McNeill from 1977 to his retire-
ment in June.
Sir James was a Newcastle High boy.
The first in the Scotch line was Sir Colin
Syme (1952-71) followed by Sir lan
McLennan (1971-77).
The new Sir James is in some ways
an unlikely head of the resource-based
company. The son of a grazier, he was
general manager of meat processor and
exporter Thomas Borthwick & Sons
from 1953 to 1967 and founded the Aus-
tralian Meat Exporters’ Federal Council
in 1964.
Balderstone is also chairman of the
Stanbroke Pastoral Company Pty Ltd of
which the AMP Society is a major
shareholder. His other directorships in-
clude the AMP, Westpac, ICI Australia
Ltd, and Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
THE CHARTIST
Media stocks lead the industrials’ surge
by Russell Lander
ALTHOUGH the All Ordinaries Index
had been stuck in the mud until last
week its two principal components
the All Industrials Index and the Metals
and Minerals Index have been mov-
ing apart. The general firmness in indus-
trials has been particularly evident in
media stocks John Fairfax and Herald
& Weekly Times, in property developer
Westfield Holdings, in APM and
Brambles.
The rush into media stocks began
last year with the meteoric rise in the
share price of News with the running
being taken up this year by John
Fairfax. The latter has put on some 50
percent in 1984 with its recent run up to
$6. The market’s enthusiasm for media
groups has now focused on the vener-
able Melbourne-based Herald & Week-
ly Times which has vast newspaper,
radio and television interests through-
out Australia and is popularly regarded
as a slumbering giant.
The two charts produced from the
Bridge Data computerised charting sys-
tem show Herald & Weekly Times on a
monthly price range basis over 10 years
(adjusted for issues) and on a weekly
range together with a 16-week moving
average over the past two years.
The spike on the monthly chart
towards the end of 1979 represents the
takeover attempt by News and the de-
fence of Herald & Weekly Times by
John Fairfax. Only now is the price ap-
proaching the heady levels seen on that
memorable occasion. The weekly chart
throws trading since August 1982 into
sharper relief and highlights the tend-
ency of the stock to edge into new post-
-1982 highs. The 16-week moving av-
erage has been pierced on several occa-
sions this year but has not itself turned
down. This signifies that the primary
uptrend is still alive and well even
though its gradient has slackened since
the end of 1983.
Stocks such as Herald & Weekly
Times which are doing well in a pre-
sently subdued stockmarket should
really excel when the market traffic
lights turn green. A linear reading from
the rectangular trading pattern which
has taken shape since the end of last
year gives an upside count to around $4.

THE MODEST FARMER
What the market will bear
by Bert Kelly
AT THE END of 1981, when the Fraser
government was trying to screw up its
courage to do something sensible about
the car industry mess, a group of more
than 30 members of federal parliament
did their best to make the government
take the inevitable decisions that the
Labor government now has had to take.
This group became known as “the
dries,” to differentiate its members from
“the wets” who talked bravely about
tariff reductions particularly when
overseas but did nothing about it.
One of the dries was Grant Chap-
man, the member for Kingston (South
Australia) which electorate contains the
Mitsubishi car plant. For Chapman to
speak out as he did took courage and all
the political pundits prophesied his im-
minent demise. He was defeated, too,
but suffered a much smaller adverse
swing than did other Liberals who
kicked with the wind as per instructions
from on high.
Chapman had another virtue which
endeared him to me: he was (and is) a
member of the Society of Modest Mem-
bers. This is a group of past and present
members of state and federal parlia-
ments who believe, as I do, in less gov-
ernment intervention in business and
who also believe that MPs should do
what is right rather than what is popu-
lar. I am proud to be their patron.
You can understand, then, that I was
desolated when Chapman was defeated.
He disappeared from my view for a year
or more, so I was delighted when he
bobbed up again recently still a mem-
ber of the Modest Members Society and
still talking sense. He has written a
chapter, “Labor And The Market,” in a
book called The Crisis of Unemployment
which is to appear soon, edited by Pro-
fessor Cooray of Sydney.
I do not pretend that Chapman has
uncovered any new earthshaking truths
but he has spelled out with unusual sim-
plicity the plain facts of the labor mar-
ket. His message can be summed up in
this paragraph: “If a shopkeeper sets a
price for an item above the market
clearing price, some will be left on the
shelf. Similarly, if the price for labor is
consistently above the market clearing
price, some will be left on the shelf; that
is, unemployment will result. The more
the price for labor is above the market
clearing price, the higher will be the un-
employment.”
Some high-stepping intellectuals will
sneer at such a simple, self-evident
statement. But they will not sneer at a
statement by the high priest of labor re-
lations in the Labor Party, Clyde
Cameron. In his book Unions In Crisis,
after describing briefly how hard he had
to work and his determination that the
youth of today not suffer as he did, he
said: “We have not helped the young by
demanding that they may not be em-
ployed unless paid excessive wages. We
priced them out of the labor market and
we deserve no thanks for that.”
I learned the hard way what happens
when prices are set above market rates.
My dad had recently handed the
farm over to me and we were struggling.
Mavis had three kids at foot and greedy
little beggars they were. I once drove
350 wethers 13km to the Riverton sheep
sale with stern instructions from the
banker that I had to get at least 35 shil-
lings for them. But the bidding stopped
at 27 and, though I got up on the rail
with my youngest and hungriest off-
spring and made a powerful speech
about the injustice of it all, the audience
just melted away and I had to drive the
sheep back home.
When I went inside, Mavis said that
the banker wanted me to ring him at
once. I did so, of course, and told him
the sad news. “You wanted too much
for them, Bert,” he snapped. “You
should have met the market.”
As it was the banker who had in-
sisted that I must get 35 shillings, I
thought his attitude was most unfair but
unfortunately I was not in a position to
tell him so. So I just said meekly, “I am
sorry, sir,” and went out and milked the
cow.
It is significant that, though our
economic performance has been
gratifyingly good lately, our unemploy-
ment rate has fallen hardly at all.
In many businesses, it is just not
profitable to employ people; it is not
that no work is to be done but we can-
not afford to pay people to do it. This is
the case on our farm. But in the US,
where they have a much more flexible
system which allows them to adjust
wages to the demand for labor, the un-
employment rate has been falling.
Justice Higgins started the rot here
early this century when he said that it
would be better for an industry to be
closed down if it could not pay proper
wages. When proper wages plus all the
fringe benefits are higher than the mar-
ket for labor, unemployment follows as
night follows day.
Chapman’s may be a simple message
but that reinforces its validity. □


‘lfyou fly out that night, you'll avoid
a 5 hour wait in Bahrain.’
That advice
from ANZ Travel
certainly made
my trip a
lot easier.
You see, I knew the European Sales
Seminar was due to end Thursday
afternoon. So I thought - “I’ll stay put
Thursday night, get a good rest
and fly to Asia next day” Good idea?
Wrong! If I’d stayed on that night,
instead of getting my rest and relax-
ation in a comfortable hotel in
Jakarta, I’d have spent five hours the
following day contemplating the
transit lounge in Bahrain. And I didn’t
need that.
Obviously I’d put more thought
into my business commitments than
into my travel arrangements.
What a relief to find that my ANZ
Business Travel consultant made it
his first priority to get me wherever
I had to be in the quickest and most
convenient way
At ANZ Travel they understand
the needs of the business traveller.
They look after all the usual travel
arrangements. But they also think a
little further ahead and make the
extra effort to eliminate those
irksome little problems that can so
needlessly occur. Their aim is to give
business travellers all the time and
relaxation they need to cope with the
stresses and strains of just
going about their business.

Quintet by Rover.
The most exciting way
to spend $13,400.
When you find the car that you always
wanted, life can get pretty exciting.
Particularly when the car has all the
trappings of a luxury car in an economy size.
All the verve and grace of a Rover.
All the economy reliability and high
resale value of the best imported Japanese cars.
And, best of all, a modest price tag of
$13,400.* (Which is about what you’d normally
pay for a Toyota Celica Hatchback, Mazda 626
Super Deluxe 5-Door, oraTelstarTXs Ghia.) **
As you can see, the Rover Quintet is really
something to get excited about.
The luxury in exciting detail.
When you discuss the Quintet, it’s best to
start with a long list of comforts and features,
and just tick them off.
Power steering. Electric windows. Electric
aerial. Twin remote control exterior mirrors.
Pioneer stereo radio/cassette.
Seats, doors and headrests beautifully
finished in crushed velour.
Carpet you’d be happy to have in your
home. (Even the load space is carpeted.)
Alloy wheels. Radial ply tyres.
Tachometer. Interior releases for the fuel filler
cap and rear hatch.
You’ll also find a 16-way warning light
display that lets you know if doors aren’t closed
properly or if a bulb has blown.
And warning chimes in case you leave
your lights on.
Electric sunroof and air conditioning are
attractive options.
Exciting Performance.
The Rover Quintet is surprisingly quick. 1
More than a second quicker up to 100
km/h than the Camira SL/X 4-speed and the
Toyota Celica 5-speed 3-door.
The Quintet is also more economical,

using between IV2 and 3 litres per 100 km less
petrol around town. ++
Standard petrol at that.
The source of this remarkable perform-
ance is the Quintet’s highly efficient 1.6 litre,
4-cylinder engine with its overhead cam, alloy
cylinder head and its electronic ignition.
To cap it all off, the Quintet has cat-like
agility. With 4-wheel independent suspension
and front wheel drive.
Exciting but sensible.
For all its luxury and performance, the
Rover Quintet is also a surprisingly practical car.
It has four doors, a rear hatch and rear
seat backs that fold down independently.
It’s so well built, you’re assured of trouble-
free motoring.
(You only have to walk around the car to
see how well it all fits together.)
All in all, can you think of a more exciting
way to spend $13,400?*

PIERPONT
Goodbye to the White Cargo cult
HAVING READ Robinson Crusoe and
Somerset Maugham at an impression-
able age, Pierpont for years had a strong
temptation to become a South Seas
beachcomber.
In his mind’s eye, your correspon-
dent could see himself reclining under
the palm trees by a coral lagoon, sipping
at a Tom Collins and waiting for
Tondelayo to arrive on the next tramp
steamer.
But Pierpont discovered on closer
acquaintance with the tropics that palm
trees are one of nature’s more lethal in-
ventions, capable of dropping coconuts
from great heights on to unsuspecting
crania, that every coral lagoon in this
world contains a shark and that the only
ladies who were prepared to go to
pieces with your correspondent did not
look anything like Hedy Lamarr in
White Cargo.
Pierpont then toyed with the notion
of becoming a South Seas trader, on the
ground that it would be more amenable
to make money in a pleasant climate,
but the business opportunities somehow
always seemed better in the temperate'
zones of the world. So he gave away the
tropics, except for the occasional luxury
cruise, and confined his decadence to
the Croesus Club. Similar thoughts
seem to have occurred to Charles
Perkins, until recently of the Aboriginal
Development Commission. One of the
ADC’s objectives is to succor Aborigi-
nal-run businesses and last November
Charles was in northern Queensland
trying to do just that.
Pierpont is grateful, however, to see
that Charles was intelligently wary
about the prospects. At an ADC meet-
ing on Thursday Island, he said that the
commission had about 460 businesses
and all of them were “going bad.”
He said: “We say, if a white person
hasn’t picked up a business loan or a
business as such, you can bet your bot-
tom dollar that there’s something wrong
with it. So it’s no good for us going and
picking something up and somebody
expecting to make money when that
white person has tried to make money
and couldn’t make money.”
It is gratifying, at a time when gov-
ernments of all labels are prepared to
pour endless sums of taxpayers’ money
into worthy causes, that an administra-
tor such as Charles can bring some com-
mercial sense to bear on the subject.
Pierpont hopes that Charles will be
around to advise for some time yet be-
cause there is another project which ap-
parently needs killing off in north
Queensland. This is the proposal to pro-
vide hovercraft services from Towns-
ville to Magnetic and Palm islands and
from Thursday Island around the
Torres Strait.
Your correspondent has just read a
report on the viability of both services
to the Queensland regional director of
the ADC.
The hovercraft out of Townsville was
intended primarily to service the Abor-
iginal community on Palm Island, some
60km north of Townsville and as the
ferry could go past Magnetic Island en
route, it would have made sense for the
hovercraft to ferry tourists there.
The report goes on for some 11 pages
about operating costs estimates and
cash flow projections. They work out
charter costs, salaries of staff, usage of
lubricants, telephone and promotion
costs and “signalisation” whatever
that may be. The report has two only
drawbacks: The first is “significant un-
certainty” in revenue and capital cost
forecasts, the second that Palm Island-
ers don’t want it and would not use it.
This, Pierpont would have thought,
is something of a handicap.
The report accordingly recommends
that “the project should not be pro-
gressed until such time as the Palm
Islanders have indicated a full commit-
ment to the service.”
If it comes to that, why even consider
starting a business let alone preparing
a report on it where customers don’t
want to buy? Maybe the islanders
changed their minds in mid-stream but
the chaps writing the report would have
been spared the trouble of pricing lubri-
cants and could have got on with recli-
ning under the palm trees or whatever
they do in Townsville.
The second proposal was for a ser-
vice based on Thursday Island and
operating a regular scheduled service to
all other Torres Strait islands, visiting
each community at least once a week.
Once again the report checked out
the details of hovercraft charter, lubri-
cants and signalisation. They came up
with the conclusion that the service
would make an operating loss of about
a quarter of a million dollars in the first
year and a marginal profit in the sec-
ond. Once again, the “significant un-
certainties” concerned the revenue and
capital cost forecasts.
“The specification of even reason-
ably reliable, workable, minimum and
maximum revenue estimates is difficult.
Further, more detailed surveys of reven-
ue potential are most unlikely to lead to
a more reliable estimate than that used
above,” the report says.
The plan has a few other problems.
One is its likely impact on the service
run by a craft called Tropical Princess :
This profitable operation would have to
be scrapped and its three employees re-


trenched. Tropical Princess takes four
hours to do a run which the hovercraft
could accomplish in 50 minutes but the
latter’s fares would be higher and the
frequency of the service has yet to be de-
cided.
In other words, a viable enterprise
would have to be scrapped to make way
for one which would have to be sub-
sidised.
The report seeks to justify the Torres
Strait service on the ground that the
population would benefit from vastly
improved mobility. “The ramifications
of this in terms of social, education,
economic, cultural and political devel-
opment are beyond quantification and
hence defy being readily ac-
commodated into the more commonly
acknowledged methods of evaluation,”
the report says.
Put another way, the Torres Strait
Islanders’ lives would enriched by en-
abling them to gad about in a subsidised
transport service. Pierpont would have
thought this proposition socially argu-
able as well as being financially un-
sound.
The report also claims tourist poten-
tial for the trade, although admitting
that “the extent and timing of future de-
mand for passenger sea transport ser-
vice from tourists is largely unknown”
and that “tourist activities are currently
in their early infancy and could not be
expected to be the source of any signifi-
cant demand for at least a number of
years.”
The report concludes that a
hovercraft operation in the Torres Strait
is unlikely to operate as a commercially
viable enterprise in the foreseeable fu-
ture but that the redeeming aspect of the
proposal is that it would enrich the
quality of life for the inhabitants.
And that’s about all it would enrich,
by the sound of it.
Pierpont urges Charles and his co-
horts to drop this one before he has a
461st loser on his hands.
CHESS
Going north for a laugh
by Terrey Sbaw
NOTHING is better calculated to
snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
than to relax when you’re winning. The
price of victory is eternal vigilance.
Easy to say, difficult to do. I had
settled down comfortably in my chair
towards the middle of the following
game, confident in the knowledge that
my three extra pawns, coupled with my
super technique, would ensure the win.
On move 18, I routinely developed
my Bishop to a sensible square, not
bothering to check the consequences.
Luckily my opponent wasn’t at the
board or he would have seen the look of
pure horror on my face as my fingers
left the piece and I noticed it could be
captured for nothing.
I swear that as soon as I made the
move a clutch of insensitive kooka-
burras, watching the game through the
windows from a nearby tree, burst into
laughter.
Not daring to trust my face not to
give the game away, I dragged myself to
the window and stared determinedly
out at the grounds looking for a rock
to throw at those blasted kookaburras.
Luckily, my opponent didn’t take the
ornithological hint. He moved quickly
and let me off the hook. Nobody has
ever protected a Bishop as fast as I did.
The game was played in the warm
sunshine of Cairns during last Sep-
tember’s Far North Queensland Grand
Prix Chess Circuit. The circuit is on
again this year, embracing four week-
ends from August 25 to September 16. If
a relaxing holiday in the Far North plus
a spot of chess appeals to you, ring me

INTELLIGENCER
TAA may be on right track
THOSE in the know in Mel-
bourne say that the search for
a new general manager for
Trans-Australia Airlines is
over. The successor to Cap-
tain Frank Ball, 64 in Nov-
ember, is tipped to be NSW
railways boss David Hill.
Kim Beazley who works at
being Aviation Minister when
he isn’t standing in for Mick
Young named Hill as a mem-
ber of the Australian National
Airlines Commission, TAA’s
board, a couple of weeks ago.
There is a familiar pattern
here. NSW Premier Neville
Wran named Hill to the board
of commissioners cdntrolling
the railways before changing
the organisation and making
him chief executive.
Beazley has been looking
for someone with a good track
record in public enterprises to
get TAA up, up and away.
Hill has demonstrated the sort
of dynamic leadership needed
to take the airline out of the
doldrums into which it drifted
during the recession and when
it became a football between
Liberal free-marketeers and
National Party subsidisers of
the Fraser government.
Hill would leave a big hole
in the still-troubled NSW rail-
ways administration. The ap-
pointment is likely to miff fed-
eral Transport Minister Peter
Morris who sees elimination
of the $1 billion combined
losses that the Australian rail-
way system chalks up each
year as a top national priority.
Hill has attacked the NSW
deficit determinedly but still
has a long way to go.

weather they’re having down

plained helpfully.

Queues on application
Passport applicants bide their time in Sydney
KEITH BARLOW
THE introduction of the per-
sonal interview requirement
for applications is causing
headaches in national pass-
port offices.
Applicants last week
waited for up to three hours
for interviews on the ground
floor of the Australian Gov-
ernment Centre at Chifley
Square in Sydney. A Bulletin
scribe a would-be traveller
found himself on the end of
a queue of 100.
•Some 100 people staff the
office but a maximum of 18 at
any time occupy interview
booths. Two receptionists, a
spokesman says, “field gener-
al inquiries” and provide a
ticket that tells you how long
you have to wait.
The queues have been
created by rules introduced
on July 1 in response to rec-
ommendations of the Stewart
royal commission of inquiry
into drug trafficking.
Among other require-
ments, the passport office now
demands a full certified birth
certificate, any expired pass-
port, two identical photos (no
automatic machine jobs) and
that all documents are origin-
al (no photocopies will be ac-
cepted).
Application forms are
available at post offices and
postmasters also act as inter-
viewers when they have the
time.
An application with a post
office will take a month on av-
erage, barring extenuating cir-
cumstances such as death of
an overseas relative or busi-
ness obligations. The wait
after interview with the pass-
port office is 10 working days.
THE Foreign Affairs Depart-
ment and the Yugoslav con-
sulate worked overtime in
Melbourne to provide 100
new passports and visas for
the Australian Youth Orches-
tra so that it could take off for
its first European tour.
The original passports
were stolen from the South
Yarra hotel room of tour
manager David Bishop, little
more than 24 hours before de-
parture.
A spokesman said the pro-
cedures were streamlined for
the musicians.
Oh for some of that speed
in normal circumstances.
Sex and the singles bar
THE Human Rights Commis-
sion has a small embarrass-
ment: it apparently doesn’t
understand its own Sex Dis-
crimination Act.
The commission launched
an advertisement last week to
begin its campaign to teach
Australians about the new
law. The advertisement fea-
tured five Tandberg cartoons
showing various breaches.
Unfortunately, one of
them shows a single father be-
ing rejected as a tenant on the
grounds that lettings are made
only to married couples. This
is not a breach of the act un-
less the landlord is a corpora-
tion.
The cartoon is being re-
moved from the foreign lan-
guage advertisements, not yet
published.
Many happy
returns?
IN THE guessing game about
when the next federal election
will be held, Rob Chalmers’
newsletter Inside Canberra
has come up with December
8. “It has been pointed out to
us by a close mate of the
Prime Minister that Sunday
December 9 is Bob Hawke’s
birthday,” the newsletter says.
“And it should be remem-
bered that his election victory
last year coincided with the
birthday of Mr Hawke’s
father.
“As Mr Hawke’s close
mate said, ‘Bob’s an omen
man and December 8 will at-
tract him’.”
Somewhere in the Labor
backrooms, they’re probably
working on a. campaign ad
along the lines of “Give Bob a
happy birthday.”

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
BLACK rolls a 2-1. It is a good
roll in the circumstances but there
are many ways to play, several
with distinct advantages. Which is
best?
White already has a man on
the bar so White’s next roll is par-
tially forced he must re-enter.
Black can put another one or even
two White blots on the bar.
Should he hit another two and, if
so, which two? Does he have other
options? The thing to do is estab-
lish priorities. However many
White blots are on the bar one,
two, three or even four is rather
irrelevant if White gets an anchor
in Black’s home board. Once
White establishes that anchor he
will have a point on which to re-
enter.
Of course Black always will be
ahead in the race if White has sev-
eral men back but if White gets a
hit at a later stage the tables could
turn. The time to be ahead is at the
end of the game when both
players are bearing-off.
Black could anchor White’s 3
point. This not a bad move but it
still allows White to anchor 84.
Now is the time for Black to go all
out. He should hit on B 4 and 87,
leaving the blot on W 9 alone.
White now has three men on the
bar. If he rolls a 4 he will re-enter
and hit the Black blot but he will
not anchor the 4 point.
Splitting B 8 is not risky. It
gives Black options to capture
points in his home board and, as
White has three blots on the bar,
Black’s men are safe. If White fails
to roll a 4 he can almost resign
himself to losing.

Opening lead — king of
diamonds.
BRIDGE is a partnership game
but in many deals it is evident that
the partners are pulling in oppo-
site directions. Obviously, when
partners are communicating with
each other on different wave
lengths, almost anything can hap-
pen — and frequently does.
Take this deal where East-
West were out of tune. West bid
one heart, North bid two clubs,
South two no-trump, North three
no-trump and East doubled.
East’s double in this sequence
carries a special meaning. It states
that East thinks the contract can
be defeated if West leads a heart,
the suit with which he opened the
bidding. It is a lead-directing
double. Had West led a heart,
South would have gone down one.
The defenders would have scored
four heart tricks and a club.
But West led a diamond and
South made the contract. He won
the diamond with the ace, estab-
lished dummy’s clubs and made
the contract with an overtrick
after West cashed the Q-J of dia-
monds
It is easy to sympathise with
West, who was naturally more in-
clined to lead a diamond from a
solid suit than a heart from a
broken suit. We’ve all witnessed
worse leads that turned out more
successfully.
But here West had no one to
blame except himself. Once part-
ners agree that a double in a given
sequence such as the one here
is lead-directing, the player on
lead should feel sure of his ground
before over-riding partner’s clear-
ly expressed wish.
It must be assumed that part-
ner is not doubling just to hear
himself talk and, if he directs a
certain lead, it is good policy not
to disobey him unless the circum-
stances are exceptional and
strongly indicate otherwise. It is
better to play a partnership game.
