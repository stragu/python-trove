THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Royal commission problems
One of the problems with giving royal
commissioners such as Costigan the
right to smear under privilege is the
likelihood of mistakes.
The Costigan Commission had a
staff of more than 100. After publishing
volume one of its report, some 18
months after starting its work, Mr
Costigan sent “Corrections” some days
later. These included:
“In paragraph 17, page 116 the
report stated ‘Shortly afterwards
Harding was murdered by Taylor and
subsequently Taylor was convicted of
that murder. Thus Taylor had com-
mitted by that time some two murders in
the space of three years, notwithstand-
ing that at the time of the second
murder he was in prison.’ In fact Mr
Taylor was acquitted of this murder, not
convicted. The commission sincerely
regrets this error and trusts that its
correction will receive as much public-
ity as the original mistake.”
He then went on to say that as a
result the commission had reviewed the
chapter to ensure that if there were any
other mistakes, they could be corrected
immediately. Unfortunately, said Mr
Costigan, a number of mis-statements
had been discovered. I quote again: “In
paragraph 5.13, it is stated that Maloney
was murdered by O’Driscoll. The name
should be Driscoll, not O’Driscoll. It is
true that Driscoll was convicted of this
murder, however the conviction was
upset on appeal and he was acquitted
on his new trial. In paragraph 5.20, it is
stated that Raymond Kane was
murdered. It is in fact his brother, Leslie
Kane. In paragraph 5.21, it is stated that
Bennett when murdered was at the City
Court on committal proceedings from
another murder. He was, in fact, at the
court on committal proceedings for
armed robbery. In addition, it is stated
that Stone was murdered. He, in fact,
survived the murder attempt.”
No wonder Sir James Killen, then
Minister for Defence in the Fraser
cabinet, said: “As a lawyer I found
myself in substantial disagreement with
the style and form of the report.
“I looked upon it as a disgrace to
judicial inquiry. Names were mention-
“Think of the phrase ‘nuclear winter' then
create a shade of lipstick to go with it. "

OTHER LUXURY CARS ARE UP TO3OO KILOS OVERWEIGHt
AS YOU CAN TILL FROM THEM FIGURES.
OTHER LUXURY CARS ARE UP TO3OO KILOS OVERWEIGHT.
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THEIR FIGURES.
Too much weight on a car is as
unhealthy as too much weight on a
person.
But whilst today’s executive is
becoming fitter and trimmer, the
overlong, overlarge luxury car is still very
much in evidence.
It seems as if built-in obesity is the
mark of the breed,.
But not for BMW though.
The BMW 735 i is as in tune with the
times as the modern executive.
It is designed to be lithe and
sporting in nature.
The computer-controlled engine
management system actually re-tunes
the engine at every revolution. It
monitors temperature, humidity, and
engine speed and adjusts the fuel/air
mixture and ignition timing for optimum
performance and efficiency, to levels of
accuracy simply unavailable in less
refined systems.
And just as a fitness expert
constantly monitors you, so a computer
monitors the way the car is driven. It
then tells you the precise moment a
service or oil change is necessary.
As a further measure to increase
efficiency, the BMW 735 i is equipped


with a four-speed overdrive
transmission. At certain speeds it
actually bypasses the torque-converter,
saving energy. This results in the first
automatic to give you the performance
and economy of a 5-speed manual
gearbox.
Despite this leanness, the BMW 735 i
still gives you safety, space and features
like the computer-controlled anti-lock
braking system - known as ABS.
It is said that the fit and active get
more out of life. So the BMW driver gets
more satisfaction out of driving. The car,
like its driver, is supple, dynamic and
progressive.
For a test-run please make an
appointment with your BMW dealer.

Vanishing liberties
I would like to endorse the comments of
Trevor Kennedy (B, October 9) on some
of the worrying aspects of the Costigan
commission. It is important that all
Australians should resist erosion of
basic human rights in the name of drug-
busting.
Unfortunately, the bureaucrats al-
ready have won a victory over the
people in one important instance.
Acting upon a recommendation
from the Stewart royal commission of
inquiry into drug trafficking, the
government has changed passport ap-
plication rules. All Australians now are
required to lodge passport applications
personally.
This is not a serious handicap to
those who live in cities served by
passport or Australia Post offices. To
those of us living abroad in cities
without Australian diplomatic
representation, however, it is a serious
inconvenience and severe financial
strain. I suspect that drug criminals will
continue to get around the difficulty
anyway. The new procedure is merely a
bureaucratic nightmare for the
"I want a sex transplant-brought my own donor!”
overwhelming majority of law-abiding
citizens.
The new rule also falls into a logical
trap from which it is impossible to
escape. Either the stringent require-
ments are going to be effective in
establishing identity or they are not.
If the new procedures are foolproof,
passports can be issued in the future on
the strength of passports issued after
July 1, 1984. An existing passport
should be sufficient proof of identity.
If the procedures are not fool-proof,
no additional security has been gained.
Instead, the law-abiding majority has
once again been harassed by the
vainglorious, power-wielding petty
bureaucrats.
It is time we put a stop to such severe
infringements of the freedoms and
rights of the majority. The balance
between the hunt for the drug pedlars
and the liberties of the community must
not be lost. The bureaucrats are paid to
make life easier for us, not the other way
round.

Socialist propaganda
As I can no longer stand the socialist
propaganda printed by your magazine,
I am not going to renew my subscrip-
tion. The issue (B, October 16) with your
leader (not mine) in six smiling poses
was just too much! Doesn’t he ever snarl
or cry and hide behind his wife’s apron

The Liberals’ future
The Bulletin in recent times has pro-
duced many articles which analyse lib-
eral and conservative ideas and
politicians. However, most of them have
been written by those with different
political perspectives or incapable of
making a fair and balanced evaluation.
The article by Michael Sexton on “Why
the Libs Can’t Fill Menzies’ Boots” (B,
October 23) is an example. The Bulletin
describes Sexton as one of Australia’s
more perceptive political commen-
tators. This is a highly contentious
statement. It could, with more accuracy,
have added “reflecting socialist and left-
wing perspectives.”
The article says that a free market
model is recommended by the Valder
report. In the context in which govern-
ment controls 43 percent of the
economy - measured in terms of GDP
and likely to grow to 50 percent in the
next few years as a consequence of state
and federal Labor administrations no

one seriously talks about a free market.
The emphasis in the Valder report is
about deregulation and providing more
scope for private enterprise in a highly
taxed and regulated environment. This
complete misrepresentation and mis-
understanding of the thrust of the
Valder report infects and renders ir-
relevant much of Sexton’s analysis.
Sexton asks the question (the wrong
question) whether free-market policies
will be electorally appealing. The policy
which will be electorally appealing is
one which emphasises the problems
arising from the growth of government,
the failures of socialist regulatory
policies and that private enterprise
alone can provide growth which is
essential for economic and social
recovery.
The explanation of such a policy will
be difficult given media and academic
ridicule but will strike a responsive
chord with the community which has a
commonsense which many in the
media, academia and activist pressure
groups lack.
Sexton makes some valid points
when he refers to the extent to which the
coalition in the 50s and 60s was
responsible for the growth of govern-
ment regulation and the problems
which deregulation imposes due to the
power and influence of established in-
terests. But is this a reason for not
making the effort? The political realities
must be recognised and changes will
have to be made gradually and in-
crementally.
Is it too much to hope, even with its
obvious political bias, that The Bulletin
in future may provide more opportunity
for balanced presentation of political
issues?
The trendies and the regulationists
are preaching a message which is on the
way out. It is a message which ex-
perience shows has far outlived its
usefulness. More than anything else, the
support which Ronald Reagan is
drawing from young people demon-
strates this. The issue before the Liberal
Party is whether it is willing to ride the
wave of the future or whether it will
look to the trendy regulationist ethic
which is discredited and which is in any
event the preserve of the Labor Party
and the left. Socialist commentators
have a vested interest in drawing the
Liberal party in this direction so that it
will remain for ever in opposition. If the
coalition chases the regulationist and
trendy vote which is the natural
preserve of the Labor Party it will
remain in opposition forever.

Khaled’s record
In your pictorial report on the “Death
March of the Child Soldiers” (B,


October 30), the caption to one of the
photographs describes Leila Khaled as
“the famous PLO woman fighter.” In
view of her long record of kidnapping,
hijacking and murder on behalf of the
PLO I think the term “terrorist” or
“murderer” would be a more ap-
propriate description.
It is a sad feature of the Palestinian
movement that, while the Peace Now
movement grows in Israel, people such
as Leila Khaled are passing on their
hatreds and disrespect for human life to
the new Palestinian generation.

Racial tensions
My desperation rarely reaches such a
level that I find myself writing in
response to your articles. However, the
unbridled lunacy of Mr Hugh Hudson’s
disadvantage equaliser system in educa-
tional matters (B, October 30) covering
inter alia full-blood and part-blood
Aborigines and persons whose native
tongue is not English has goaded me
into action.
It is divisive, socialist policies of the
type espoused by Mr Hudson and
warmly embraced by Senator Susan
Ryan that stir up racial tension in the
Australian community much more than
the reasoned analysis of persons such as
Professor Blainey.
Would Mr Hudson please care to
elaborate on the definition of who is
and who isn’t an Aborigine so that we
will all know why children with lower
marks pass whilst others with higher
marks fail so that we may be better able
to point out to any children in the
category who fail exactly why they did
so?

Clients of Soviets
Colonel Mengistu rode the crest of a
Soviet wave upon the barren, parched
lands of Ethiopia and, having sprinkled
Marxist salt around the place, he sits
with his empty sand castles while the
Soviets show their bums on the ebb tide.
How can the Soviets let this happen?
Has the west ever let this happen to
more than five million people?
It wouldn’t surprise me one little bit
if it were to be found out that the
majority of relief grain comes from
good old apartheid South Africa.
My goodness! What a difference
between the west (including South Af-
rica) and that machine that grinds
behind the Iron Curtain. A three-minute
item on our tele and we give our best to
a mob on the other side of the planet.

Yes! But heart?

Marxists caused famine
Although the greedy multinationals
may not have caused the drought in
Ethiopia, her Marxist government
certainly caused the famine. Our
socialist prime minister, as expected,
failed to mention that.
The Marxists caused famine in
Russia and China when they took over
agriculture in order to destroy the in-
dependent farmer. They will do the
same for us here. They’ve already
started on the doctors.
Marxist Russia would have starved
to death 60 years ago if the United
States hadn’t fed and equipped her (and
then saved her from her nazi imitators:
what socialist will tell us how Hitler
modelled the Gestapo upon the
NKVD?). Russia and China still survive
by cheating on their own Marxist
religion, as parasites on and furtive
imitators of their chosen enemy,
“capitalism,” and eating imported
“capitalist” grain.
Will we also beg the US to save us?
Or Russia or China?

Funding the arts
Brian Hoad continues his trenchant
support for the large arts organisations
(B, October 30) and his confusion about
the essential criteria for arts funding.
Excellence indeed is an important
factor in funding considerations but
often no less than innovation, creativity
and strong “audience” support.
It is against these latter criteria that
many large arts organisations
(somewhat perversely called the
“flagship companies”) have foundered.
There is considerable evidence that the
greater the subsidy the less innovation
and creativity.
The Australia Council is not, I
believe, carrying out any particular
policies of the government in beginning
to threshold some larger funding grants
for the purpose of spreading a few
dollars among the (multicultural) com-
munity arts. The arts that stem from the
community may not always be ready for
Carnegie Hall but they are the arts that
reach and involve far more people than
the “high” arts.
If the Australian taxpayers wish to
see the 73rd production of a 16th-
century piece of dated theatre, with a
large percentage of funding applied to
the cocktails and beverages, they should
be allowed to do so free of a subsidy
that is 20 times that of a local, in-
novative theatre company striving for
excellence and featuring tea and
biscuits at the opening.
The Australia Council finally is
beginning to fund the arts that are
practised and supported by the majority
of Australians and not a cloistered
minority who see excellence as the sole
criterion for funding.

Ferntree Gully
Ferntree Gully High School (B,
November 6) sounds wonderful. I
searched the length and breadth of our
city to find a similar school for my
children.
Just imagine, children wanting to
learn, liking school, being part of the
decision-making process, feeling happy
radical notions to be sure.
My family is organised on exactly
these lines and the kids have now grown
up and left school. And no, they are not
long-haired hippy drop-outs. They all
achieved good school results. With en-
lightened encouragement rather than
the dreaded “discipline” one is an
apprentice chef, one is nearly qualified
as a commercial pilot and one is soon to
start agricultural college. Two of them
are dedicated members of the Army
Reserve.
I strongly believe in participatory
democracy, at school and at home.
Good on you, Ferntree Gully.

Teaching competition
I would like to lift one word, describing
the STC-program, from Tim Duncan’s
“The horror story of Ferntree Gully
High” (November 6). The word is “non-
competitive” as the aim of the
characteristic Ferntree Gully High
educated (?) youth.
These most assuredly won’t be
tomorrow’s inventors, discoverers or
leaders of the nation.
How will the unfortunate blubberer
fare when he reaches the end of his
education period, based only on age,
entering the grim, competitive world of
real people? Will he (or she) blush like a
shrinking violet and grab mother’s skirt
whimpering: “But I was not taught to
compete, Mother!”
It requires little foresight to predict
the future career of a Ferntree Gully
High School leaver: from high school he
will “graduate” straight into the arms of
the Department of Social Security and
to the dole.
Only uneducated educators could
devise such a bleak future for the next
generation of Australia.

Toyota 4 Runner. Run smooth
There is now a 4WD that you the realist
can feel comfortable with, and you the escapist
can go nuts about.
It's not a weekender, it's a 7-days-a-week
vehicle, built to run smooth in the City, wild in
the bush.
The new Toyota 4 Runner is all new. Inside,
you'll find it's sedan comfort, with good space
for five adults, front reclining seats, excellent
stereo, power rear window and power steering.
The only clues as to what you do on week-
ends are the two gear-sticks and the dashboard
altimeter and clinometer that read-off your height

and angle of climb. 4 Runner has
the Toyota HiLux pedigree of a
true 4WD, with a Toyota Super
Responsive Engine - petrol or
diesel. And the whole back
canopy is detachable r for a heightened
sense of freedom.
So if you set off to the milk bar and end up
at Marble Bar, it isn't because you're lost.
It's because you've found the only vehicle
that truly leaves the options up to you.
The 4 Runner won't let you down in public,
and won't quit on you in the bush.

It's not a truck, and it's notjustacity sedan,
and it's more than a 4WD.
The 4 Runner is all of
those, in a very individual
blend. And incidentally,
the escapist won't care, but
4 Runner's price will be of
considerable interest to the realist in you!

inations was the exciting way of the
student I knew at the Stephaneum, a
boarding school of secondary education
run by the Jesuit order in Kalocsa,
Hungary, before the war.
Another quote from the same article:
“The runs are on the board as far as the
STC is concerned. People are coming
into it by the busload.”
“Runs” without scoring? What is the
use of the “board”? How can a pro-
spective employer or an institute of
tertiary education evaluate an applicant
from Ferntree Gully High?
Of course, one does understand the
arrival of busloads of prospective drop-
outs, scared of exams, running for the
security of a high school without tests or
exams or discipline.
Teaching subjects without testing
leads bloody nowhere. How are these
teachers assessed by the Education De-
partment of Victoria? All teachers
should have to justify the spending of
taxpayers’ money on them by way of
results obtained by pupils in classes they
have taught. Otherwise, they would be
more productively employed as manual
laborers.
And I have a first year student at
Melbourne CEA; Australia’s largest
teacher college! Fortunately, she is
blessed with commonsense.

Bored with the card
Medicare, the medical marvel of 1984,
supposedly the socialist’s panacea for a
streamlined, low-cost health scheme,
aims itself at the hip pocket nerve. The
little card has been delivered to millions
of Australians, whether they wanted it
or not. The centralist, socialist scheme is
epitomised by the enforced levy of 1
percent (for now) on the average work-
ing person. Out it comes from your pay.
A massive Canberra-based com-
puter, recording levy payers en masse,
has been installed and the additional in-
sult to the injury is the established fact
of our loss of freedom. Pay up with no
option, simple, easy socialism accept
it or else, but pay anyway. In essence
the choice to be medically insured or re-
main exempt has been removed until
Labor is voted out of office along with
their endless interventionist schemes.
When do all these intrusive regula-
tions that emanate from Canberra end?
No doubt after December when we see
Medicare dismantled. Freedom, options
and choice will thus be returned to Aus-
tralians, instead of paying plenty for an
overdose of government control.
Medicare manipulation simply means
that the government will pick up the tab,
but the levy goes up, because big bu-
reaucracy costs.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Coote inquest
BRISBANE coroner Robert
Bougoure convened an in-
quest into the death of former
Capalaba bank manager Per-
cival lan Coote, mentioned in
the Costigan report as a sus-
pected murder. Coote died
last December after a blast
from a .410 gauge shotgun
severed an artery close to his
heart. Based on police reports,
the Beenleigh coroner found
that Coote had committed
suicide and recommended to
the state Justice department
that no inquest be held. The
first sitting, which lasted
about 15 minutes, served only
to introduce barristers A. J.
Williams for the Crown Sol-
icitor, C. L. Hughes for the
Westpac Banking Group and
R. Perrott for Coote’s widow.
New cable link
AUSTRALIA’S new $4OO
million telephone cable
linking with New Zealand,
Fiji, Hawaii and Canada was
inaugurated by Queen
Elizabeth 11. The 15,000 km
metal cable, with a projected
life of 15 years, already has
been outdated by technology.
It is to be superseded by
optical fibre. But the new
cable will give 20 times the
present telephone capacity.
Sydney storms
SYDNEY was hit by a series
of violent electrical storms
which caused severe flooding
over much of the city. One big
insurer, the state-owned
Government Insurance Office,
received more than 1500
reports of damage to homes
and property.
Uren accused
FEDERAL Territories and
Local Government minister
Tom Uren was accused of
trying to influence the out-
come of a Family Court case
with a letter sent to Justice
Basil Hogan. The letter
referred to a deserted wife,
behind with house payments,
who was being visited by a
psychiatric nurse. Hogan
termed Uren’s move “ob-
jectionable and impertinent”.
Literary loss
NOVELIST Xavier Herbert,
author of six books including
Poor Fellow my Country and
Capricornia, died at Alice
Springs, aged 83. Herbert had
been in ill-health for months.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke
said: “Australia has now lost
a person who made a great
contribution to our under-
standing of our own country.”
Evatt tragedy
RICHARD Southan, the 21-
year-old eldest child of Justice
Evatt, was found dead in
Sydney Harbor. Evatt is the
head of the Family Court in
NSW. Police said that no sus-
picious circumstances sur-
rounded Southan’s death.
Jobless drop
UNEMPLOYMENT reached
the lowest point in two years
last month, at 8.6 percent.
Tasmania had the highest rate
9.6 percent followed by
South Australia (9.5),
Queensland (9.2), NSW (8.6),
Western Australia (8.5), Vic-
toria (6.5), the Northern Terri-
tory (5.7) and the ACT (4).
Murder charge
IN SOUTH Australia, Emily
Perry, 58, was charged with
having murdered her hus-
band, Albert Haag, a Vic-
torian policeman who died of
arsenic poisoning in 1961 at
the age of 35.

percent of the popular vote in
one of the biggest landslides
in United States poll history.
His 53 million votes was a

Nicaragua alert
UNITED States officials said
no advanced MiG-21 fighters
had been unloaded from a
Soviet freighter, the
Bakuriani, docked at Corinto
in Nicaragua. The fear that
the ship carried Soviet fighters
had brought relations between
the US and Nicaragua to
flashpoint. The US govern-

ing intercepting Soviet ships
at sea.
NZ budget
THE New Zealand Labor
government’s first budget
slapped big increases on the
price of petrol, cigarettes,
spirits, electricity and coal
and raised road-usage


charges. It dropped some
farming subsidies, tax rebates
and company perks. A new
value-added tax was fore-
shadowed for introduction in
1986. The tax would go on to
the purchase price of goods
and services at every transac-
tion.

AUSTRALIA
How Hawke is wooing the
Liberal heartland
Prime Minister Hawke, ever the unconventional politician, is making his
final campaign thrust at the true blue Liberal voter. RICHARD FARMER
explains Hawke's daring gamble.
BASING A television commercial on
an Australian Broadcasting Corpora-
tion program, which most viewers have
probably never seen, is one measure of
the Labor Party’s daringly unorthodox
tactics for this election. Prime Minister
Hawke, who enters the formal stage of
the campaign as one of the shortest-
priced favorites to win in the history of
Australian elections, is now out to woo
traditional swinging voters. From now
until December 1 Hawke is taking his
message right into Liberal heartland. He
is out to attract the support of people
who have never before voted Labor and
if he succeeds then the Liberal Party will
be a very sorry rump in the next
parliament.
Labor’s television commercial, based
on Mastermind , is very much a part of
the strategy. People in working class
suburbs, who never turn their television
sets to Channel Two, might not
understand what the man sitting alone
in a chair answering “Pass” to questions
about the Liberal Party is all about. But
the middle-class voter that Hawke is
after might not only recognise the re-
ference and chuckle a bit but
understand the commercial’s political
message as well.
Labor wants this election to be
decided on the question of economic
management. With inflation falling, un-
employment dropping, interest rates
appearing to be coming down and
growth continuing, the record of the
Hawke government stands in stark con-
trast with the closing days of the last
Liberal-National Party administration.
In television commercials and speeches
Hawke will be doing everything he can
until polling day to encourage people to
make the comparison.
The essentially conservative nature
of the prime ministerial message is very
much part of the strategy to convert the
hitherto committed Liberal. At appear-
ance after appearance Hawke spells out
how disciplined his government will be
in financial matters. He has promised
that the budget deficit will not be
allowed to rise as a proportion of gross
The ALP’s Mastermind advertisement: aimed straight at middle-class Liberal voters
domestic product during the next three
years. The spectre of the big-spending
Whitlam years is put to rest with the
assurance that increases in government
spending will be kept below the
economic growth rate. And in his at-
tempt to diffuse concern about new
taxes on wealth and capital, Hawke
pledges that the overall tax burden will
not rise throughout the next three years.
What traditional Labor Party
supporters think about it all is the least
of Hawke’s worries. There is no pro-
spect of them deserting in the next two
and a half weeks even though the policy
approach delivered this week was very
short on rewards for them. Labor
leaders in the past might have had to
proffer a bribe or two to hold the party
faithful. But not this leader. His
popularity with Labor’s traditional
supporters is such that he can afford the
luxury of directing his promises further
into the middle ground than his party
has dared to go in the past.
Monitoring the success of party
strategy is ANOP, the pollsters Labor
has used for more than a decade. This
year their approach is different than in
the past. No longer are interviews con-
ducted with people previously identified
as swinging voters people with some
record of changing how they vote. This
time the concentration is on a much
harder group for Labor to win people
who are normally Liberal voters.
Indications so far suggest that
Hawke is having considerable success.
Something higher than 1 percent of the
pollsters’ targets are planning to desert
their allegiance to the Liberal Party.
That gives Labor strategists every confi-
dence in believing that the opinion polls
sampling the whole electorate are right
in predicting a sizeable win for the
government.
It is certainly not a happy environ-
ment for Liberal leader Andrew
Peacock to officially launch his cam-
paign. Peacock has already been on the


PUBLIC OPINION
Poll sets the
Senate alarm
bells ringing
LABOR IS set to sweep the House of
Representatives, on the latest results
from the Morgan Gallup Poll, but has
no hope of controlling the Senate,
where it is losing votes to the anti-
nuclear parties.
The Senate results must be worrying
to the major parties. Labor’s vote has
slipped from 47 percent to 43 percent
while that of the Nuclear Disarmament
Party has leapt from 3 percent to 8
percent. A move of this magnitude
should be treated with some caution
until confirmed by a subsequent poll,
but it nevertheless sounds a warning
bell for the government.
On the break-up of the Senate poll
the ALP would comfortably win three
of the seven seats in each state, the
coalition two and the Democrats, with
substantial support from the Nuclear
Disarmament Party, one. In Tasmania,
the Brian Harradine Group candidate,
Kath Venn, would win a seat.
The seventh seat appears uncertain,
with the odds favoring the coalition. But
it is by no means inconceivable the
Democrats could win two seats in some
states.
The Morgan Gallup Polls were taken
on the weekend of November 3-4, from
a sample of 1109 voters. This was at a
time when Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock’s campaign was performing at
its peak to date and getting favorable
media coverage.
Despite this, electors still gave 52
percent support to the ALP and only 38
percent to the coalition. The fact that
Peacock’s approval rating improved a
further four points to 28 percent will be
some personal consolation but his party
still seems to be heading for a crushing
defeat.

road for four weeks doing the
best he can, yet the polls have
hardly budged from where
they were when the election
was announced. Any blips in
the results there have been
suggested that Hawke has in-
creased his lead rather than
Peacock reduce it.
Peacock, it seems, has been
the victim of another example
of Hawke’s unorthodox ap-
proach to campaigning.
Giving nearly eight weeks’
notice of an election broke
new ground for a prime
minister. So did granting an
Opposition leader access to a
VIP jet right from announce-
ment day so that he could be
off and running immediately.
Conventional political
wisdom has it that govern-
ments benefit from short cam-
paigns and denying their op-
ponents from as many means
as possible of getting their message
across. Hawke dared to be different. His
announced reason for doing so was that
he did not approve of attempts to
hoodwink the public. People were
entitled to know as soon as a prime
minister made up his mind. There was
the unstated assumption that by being
treated in this way people would not
have the residual resentment that norm-
ally occurs when elections are called
before their time.
That assumption has proved correct.
At previous early elections the Opposi-
tion has been able to strike a chord at
least for a week or two with cries that
this election is unnecessary and simply
the result of political opportunism.
Peacock did his best to plant the idea
that December 1 was chosen by Hawke
because a mini-budget with horrifying
tax increases was coming in March but
he could not make it stick.
Hawke’s real reasoning for giving
ample notice of polling day and actively
assisting Peacock in beginning cam-
paigning was a belief that the extra
exposure would hinder rather than help
his opponent’s image. Hawke and his
advisers believe that Peacock is held in
such low esteem that the more people
come in contact with him the less they
think of him as a potential prime
minister. They could not believe their
good fortune when the Liberal Party
actually began their campaign advertis-
ing with a sombre-faced Peacock
talking into a camera.
Peacock certainly had a whirlwind
start to his campaign, jetting off in his
air force plane around the country.
What is more, he wrong-footed Hawke
a little by concentrating almost ex-
clusively on matters of tax. The bald
assertion that Labor would introduce a
Andrew Peacock campaigning in Bondi: the strain is showing
NEVILLE WALLER
capital gains tax, a wealth tax and death
duties was impossible for Hawke to
deny just as baldly.
Hawke well realises that he will not
be able to break any promises after this
election in the same way as he did after
the last. Then he could blame the
Liberal and National Parties for hiding
the true facts about the disastrous state
of the economy. This time any hidden
facts will have been covered up by
himself. So how to stop taxation rather
than economic management and
leadership becoming the key campaign
issue?
Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating
began by simply saying “trust us” that
any review of taxation will be fair and
equitable. They did not hide the fact
that such a review was being carried out
but said there were as yet no proposals
before the government for any kind of
new tax. Peacock, with admirable
support from his deputy John Howard,
kept plugging away with the bald asser-
tion of taxes to come and for a day or
two the Labor Party looked rattled.
It is a measure of Hawke’s political
sense that he seized on a suggestion by a
caller to a talk-back radio program for
the way out of his dilemma. The caller
suggested that reforms to the taxation
system should be settled by a taxation
summit. Hawke, on the spur of the
moment, promised to think about it and
immediately put his public servants and
staff advisers to work. A statement duly
followed promising just such a summit
for late next year. Coupled with the
comment not to raise the overall tax
burden, this has taken much of the sting
out of Peacock’s tax attack.
Lor Peacock, the difficulty now is to
find something else to talk about. His
campaign has, on the face of it, peaked
too early. Other issues are
hard to find. Medicare, so the
pollsters say, has some
potential but not the sort
which would turn around the
deficit now facing the Liberal-
National coalition. The assets
test has won some pensioners
away from Hawke but the
damage of that issue already
has been done. Pensioners
have for weeks known what
was being done to them and if
they have not changed their
voting intention by now they
are unlikely to do so.
The closing stages of this
campaign for the Liberal and
National parties thus have an
air of desperation about them.
The polls suggest that they
could end up 50 or more seats
behind the government in the
148-member House of
Representatives. National
Party leader lan Sinclair faces
the additional problem of holding on to
his own seat of New England. The polls
show that a swing greater than the 2.7
percent needed to defeat Sinclair is
quite possible. That is hardly an
environment that enables Sinclair to
campaign strongly away from his home
base. Perhaps, though, that is an ad-
vantage. The Labor Party believe
Sinclair is even less popular than
Peacock. Hence the inclusion of dis-
paraging references to him in the
Mastermind advertisement.
The most potent symbol of a cam-
paign in trouble came when Andrew
Peacock appeared on a talk-back radio
program in Tasmania. Nobody called to
talk. Similarly, a rally in Sydney was
abandoned at the last minute when no
one was present to listen to the alterna-
tive prime minister’s address. Even the
Liberal Party faithful, it seems, are
finding it hard to get enthusiastic.
For Peacock this must be a most
dispiriting experience. He long ago gave
up any real hope of beating Hawke. But
he wants to continue in politics as
Opposition leader and knows that a
creditable showing is needed to do so.
With all the signs being that he will not
make such a showing, it will be hard to
get out of bed and go shaking hands in
shopping centres for another two and a
half weeks. Already there are signs of
the Peacock team getting weary and
irritable with the travelling press corps.
There is no surer sign of a party in
trouble than that.
John Howard is maintaining his
enthusiasm but then his campaign has a
different end than Peacock’s. Howard
wants Peacock’s job and must be
strongly favored to get it after the
election. Howard’s major problem
could well be to find enough talented


PICKERING’S ELECTION


colleagues left in parliament to mount
an effective challenge to Labor in 1987.
To rebuild the Liberals from the posi-
tion the opinion polls suggest they are
in will be difficult indeed.
Labor, taking a long view un-
characteristic of the party, has shown
what they think of Peacock by turning
their critical attention on to Howard.
Finance minister John Dawkins has the
assignment of reminding people that
Howard was Malcolm Fraser’s
Treasurer and that as such he presided
over the recession. If Dawkins succeeds
with his version of a “memories” cam-
paign then Howard will not only have
to rebuild his party but his own reputa-
tion as well.
Much of Labor’s campaigning in
these final weeks will have an eye to the
likely result in the Senate rather than the
House of Representatives. And here the
enemy is not seen as the Liberal or
National Parties but rather the
Democrats and the Nuclear Disarma-
ment Party.
Foreign minister Bill Hayden has
been encouraged by Hawke to suggest a
Labor government is prepared to put
pressure on the United States to enter
into meaningful discussions with the
Soviet Union about arms control. The
aim is to stop short of putting
Australia’s treaty relationships with the
Republican administration in jeopardy
while giving an impression of concern
about the dangers of nuclear war.
Labor has been quite surprised by
the strength of feeling on this issue as
reflected in the polls by indications of
support for the Democrats and the
NDP. If this support continues until
polling day then chances of Labor even
getting close to control of the Senate
looks very remote indeed.
Hawke devoted considerable time in
his policy speech this week to an at-
tempt to re-establish his credentials on
this issue which suffered so considerably
when the party decided at its conference
to allow uranium mining to continue.
The government must address, he said,
the very real concerns of the young that
they do not inherit a world over which
hung even more ominously the spectre
of nuclear holocaust.
Given the link in the public mind
between uranium mining and nuclear
disarmament, Hawke’s chances may be
slim. Which makes it all the more
important for him to attempt to lure
Liberal voters into the fold. There is
certainly nothing in the policy speech to
frighten such normal Liberals. The
speech could in fact have been delivered
by a conservative. There was much
rhetoric about Labor’s vision for the
future of Australia but nothing very
startling about the way Hawke wants to
get there.
His promise is to give three more
years of government in the same style as
the past 20 months. Consensus and
reconciliation are the key words
throughout. It is a formula that has
worked well for Hawke throughout
those 20 months and it is thus
understandable why he chose not to
give an extensive set of promises.
Andrew Peacock finds himself in a
different situation and it is he who has
had to revert to trying to tailor policies
to suit particular interest groups. There
is more than a little irony in the fact that
the result is Labor attacking the Liberal
and National parties over the question
of where the money is coming from. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Wide belief in benefits of lower taxes
ONE IN every four electors believed
before the December 1 federal general
election was announced that lower taxes
would be of most benefit to them and
their families, the Roy Morgan Political
Issues Index finds.
Other areas which electors believed
would be of benefit were reducing
unemployment, reducing the cost of
living and housing/home loan costs.
These results came from surveying
an Australia-wide cross-section of 1708
electors in September. They were asked:
1. “Thinking about Australia as a whole,
in your opinion, what are the three most
important things the federal govern-
ment should be doing something about?
If fewer than three, what else should
the government be doing something
about?”
2. “Thinking about yourself, what could
the government do that would benefit
you and your family?”
Answers to the first question are
shown in Table 1. They show that most
electors believed that the government
should be doing something about reduc-
ing unemployment. Other areas
mentioned were help for the elderly,
lower taxes, improved education and
immigration matters.
Answers to the second question are
shown in Table 2.

MEDICARE
Ailing health
insurance plan
needs treatment
By DAVID BARNETT
having its full impact only on the
medical profession and on hospitals.
The public is just beginning to feel it.
The fundamental flaw is the decision
to discourage people from taking out
private insurance. It was taken for the
purest ideological reasons. Medicare,
said Health minister Dr Neal Blewett
when introducing amendments to the
legislation which set up the scheme,
would provide basic health cover “free
of the hassles and worries of the private
insurance schemes.”
The government was already con-
tributing more than $1 billion to health
insurance when it introduced Medicare.
It added $2053 million to federal health
costs consisting of $lOll million for
medical benefits, $854 million for the
states for their hospitals to compensate
for the loss of bed-day fees and medical
fees met by private health fund patients,
$54 million for additional payments to
THE FEDERAL government will have
to do something about Medicare next
year. The health insurance scheme is not
yet a disaster but it is a mess and pre-
election surveys have turned up worries
about it.
Australian Labor Party polling
shows that 40 percent of the community
does not like Medicare and that the
split is closer to 50-50 in marginal
electorates.
Liberal polling has identified resent-
ment about delays in hospital treatment,
about inability to take out gap insur-
ance to cover the difference between
what Medicare refunds to patients and
what doctors charge and about the limit
of 35 days on hospital treatment except
for patients in acute need of care.
The Opposition polls rank Medicare
fifth as an issue of concern after
taxation, provision for the aged, un-
employment and social welfare. Taxa-
tion was ranked as the prime concern by
30 percent of those questioned, an
increase in six weeks of 4.5. Concern for
the aged polled at 15 percent (up 3),
unemployment was unchanged as an
issue at 8 percent, social welfare was at
7 percent and health ranked as a prime
concern by 6 percent up 4.6 in six
weeks.
That does not make Medicare a big
election issue but the government had
thought of it as a potential plus when
the time came to stand on record and
face the polls. Instead, it is something of
a minus.
The government is probably
fortunate. At this stage, Medicare is
Health minister Blewett: problems
private hospitals, $2O million for com-
munity health and $ll4 million for
administration.
The 1 percent levy on incomes raised
$ll9l million. In addition two account-
ing transfers comprised $630 million
which would have been paid out of
general revenues for health insurance
and an $BO million reduction in the
commonwealth contribution to the re-
insurance fund for long-term patients.
The shortfall is $152 million, made
up from general revenues. However,
medical insurance is only part of the
story.
Fourteen years ago, health services
consumed 5.1 percent of the gross
national product. Ten years later, the
year in which Medibank was in-
troduced, they had reached 7.6 percent.
The Fraser government began the
cutback in 1980-81 when it ended hospi-
tal cost sharing with the states and the
National Health Bill was down to 7.3
percent or about $9 billion by 1982-83.
There is less money in the system.
Before Medicare, some 60 or 70
percent of patients in the hospitals were
private patients. The corresponding
tally now is about 50 percent. Some
people with private health insurance
entering hospitals are putting
themselves down as Medicare patients.
In a small country town, you get your
own doctor anyway. People who have
switched from the conventional health
funds to the catastrophe insurance
offered by commercial insurance com-
panies may also use Medicare.
The shortage of funds is producing
delays in obtaining beds, worst in
Victoria.
Another by-product has been strikes
by laundry workers and nurses who are
dropping out of the system as working
conditions deteriorate.
The highest-profile result has been
unprecedented industrial action by doc-
tors in New South Wales and the
Australian Capital Territory doctors.
The first was over a section of the
Medicare legislation which gave the
government power to overrule contracts
between doctors and public hospitals
setting the terms on which patients were
to be treated there.
Doctors struck in the ACT and NSW
in April and the action was spreading to
other states when the federal govern-
ment commissioned an inquiry which
vindicated the doctors. It found that
radiologists and pathologists were not
overcharging for their services and
recommended rights of appeal and
mechanisms for consultation.
It was at this stage that relations
between doctors and government
publicly deteriorated.
Blewett called them paranoid and
Prime Minister Bob Hawke compared
striking doctors to builders laborers.


NSW Premier Neville Wran threatened
them with a seven-year ban from public
hospitals.
The sessional fee offered for treating
“hospital patients,” as the Medicare and
former public patients are now
described, reflects the squeeze on the
health services and is barely enough to
cover the costs of running practices.
The highest sessional fee is $5O an
hour for senior specialists such as or-
thopaedic surgeons. But their expenses
for running practices are about $46 an
hour.
The current strike in NSW involves
about 4000 specialists and general
practitioners, many of whom have
formally resigned from their positions
as visiting medical officers to hospitals
resignations which hospital boards
often are refusing to accept or acknowl-
edge.
Australia has about 30,000 doctors.
Their professional body, the Australian
Medical Association, accepted that the
Hawke government had a mandate to
introduce Medicare and did not fight it
as they fought Medibank 10 years ago.
But there is a general resentment of a
scheme which puts pressure on them to
agree to bulk billing under which they
do not bill their patients but instead
send the bills directly to Medicare and
receive back not the fee which they
regard as proper for their service, nor
the scheduled fee laid down as a
regulated charge, but 85 percent of the
scheduled fee.
No other section of the community is
required to work for 85 percent of the
theoretical fair rate. Doctors also see the
trend to bulk billing as turning them
into employees of Medicare, which they
fear is a form of nationalisation of their
profession.
There are other rankling aspects to
the way in which Medicare is working.
It has brought back the days of the
criminal doctor which were associated
with Medibank. The federal Health
department has a team of investigators
chasing down doctors who infringe the
elaborate health regulations and are
guilty of what the government markets
as Medifraud.
Twenty-eight cases are with the
federal police and 41 more with the
Director of Public Prosecutions, includ-
ing 25 doctors before the courts.
Four doctors have been disqualified
from treating patients under Medicare
for three years that is to say, deprived
of livelihood and another 16 under
investigation could be similarly dis-
qualified.
One new Medicrime arises from the
35-day rule.
Before Medicare, a very sick patient
lost entitlement to full hospital care and
was downgraded to nursing home
benefits unless held by a doctor to be in
need of acute care, to require pro-
fessional attention, to be under active
rehabilitation or to require continued
management.
With the four alternative grounds
reduced to one, if the doctor does not
certify a patient as needing acute care,
he or she is re-classified as a nursing
home patient.
If a pensioner, the patient must then
pay 87.5 percent of that pension to the
institution.
That works for people who live in
nursing homes but not for an elderly
person recovering slowly from surgery
who maintains a private home.
Others for whom this change has
produced hardship are accident victims,
patients with severe chronic conditions,
psychiatric patients and the terminally
ill.
The decision on their circumstances
comes down to a doctor who faces a fine
of $lO,OOO and five years’ jail if the
judgment is found to be false or mis-
leading in a material particular.
In the atmosphere created by Health
department investigators, some sur-
geons are saying that to itemise ac-
counts by schedule number is too
dangerous because they face the same
threat of jail and fine if a secretary puts
a wrong number down.
Blewett acknowledges that the
government must find more resources
for the health system and notes that
Victoria increased funding for hospitals
in its latest budget.
The current prosecutions of doctors,
he says, in the main pre-date the in-
troduction of Medicare last February
but Blewett concedes that the stepped-
up investigations have created such an
atmosphere.
That has been in response to pressure
from the Auditor-General and from the
Public Accounts Committee of parlia-
ment.
The penalties remain the same as
they were before Medicare, he says.
The government has drawn up
guidelines to help doctors in defining
acute cases under the 35-day rule,
Blewett says.
He dismisses fears about mis-stating
items on accounts: The penalties relate
to deliberate fraud, not to mistakes.
Doctors who consistently mis-stated the
category for a procedure would be
warned and counselled.
Blewett also says that the
government has decided to
broaden its range of consulta-
tions and, as well as seeing the
national AMA, will also con-
sult with state AMA bodies.
In short, he recognises that
something must be done.
In Hawke’s consensus
Australia, no other section of
the community has been so
vilified as have the doctors.
They are the tall poppies, the
equivalent of Chairman
Mao’s rich landlords (who
were rehabilitated last week
when the Chinese government
formally abolished class en-
emies. China, incidentally, re-
introduced private medicine
at the same time).
There is another pro-
spective casualty from the ap-
parent official hostility toward
the medical profession and
the vigorous pursuit of
Medifrauds.
Surgeons sew up wounds
and penicillin kills bugs but
much of what a doctor
achieves arises from a relationship of
trust and confidence between
practitioner and patient. Real doctors,
let it be whispered, are also faith
healers.
They do not argue such a case but
Medicare and what is flowing from it
erodes that faith, by cutting off the
hospitalised Medicare patient from a
doctor he or she knows and by portray-
ing doctors generally as being out for a
fast buck.
If Blewett cannot sort Medicare out,
the prospect is for a steady erosion in
the standards of a public hospital
system increasingly staffed by disillu-
sioned doctors with a growing recourse
for those who can afford double cover
to private insurance and private hospi-
tals.
Where would that leave a universal
health scheme? □


POLITICS
Ian Sinclair thriving on a fight
lan Sinclair launching the National campaign: the hide of an elephant, the charm of a diplomat
By LENORE NICKLIN
“IT’S A DAMN sight easier when
you’re the leader because you get the
plane to travel round in,” said lan
Sinclair, striding purposefully toward
his waiting VIP twin-engined turbo-
prop Hawker Siddeley 748 at the Glen
Innes airport. Sinclair, wearing well-cut
sportscoat, fawn slacks and R. M.
Williams elastic-sided boots, is conduct-
ing his first election campaign as leader
of the National Party. He is finding the
run-up to election day less arduous than
some of his colleagues. He is used to late
nights and early mornings. He can get
by comfortably on two or three hours’
sleep a night “you try and have one
good night’s sleep a week.” He is used
to hopping in and out of planes and on
and off utilities. He thrives on hard
work.
Sinclair’s Hawker Siddeley is known
as the drinking man’s plane unlike the
newfangled jets, it gives its passengers
time for a gin and tonic or two before
the next stop. Those who follow Sinclair
on his mostly rural election train are
known as wombats. They wear ties with
yellow wombats on them. They read
Phantom comics. (“Nadi, where did the
message come from?” “By runner, O
Ghost Who Walks.”) The election cam-
paign is too long to be taken too
seriously. Wombats like to fly. Down on
the ground they have to follow the
leader into old people’s homes, new
supermarkets, sheltered workshops,
shopping malls, country showgrounds.
They have to inspect flooded rivers and
watch flag-raising ceremonies. They
have to listen to the same speeches and
the same jokes over and over again.
The Phantom is many men . .. old
jungle saying.
So is lan Sinclair. A smooth-talking
city-slicker. A tough-talking country
farmer. A ruthless parliamentary
tactician. A man’s man. A woman’s
man. The hide of an elephant, the charm
of a diplomat.
He has represented New England for
21 years but this year farmers in Guyra,
taxi-drivers in Armidale and shop
owners in Glen Innes all agree that he
has a fight on his hands. The Labor
candidate, Tamworth solicitor Joe
Horan, requires a swing of 2.8 percent
to oust him. “We regard the seat of New
England as one we can win,” says Prime
Minister Hawke who is giving heavy
personal support to Horan’s campaign.
“He could lose,” says Armidale.
“Never,” says Glen Innes. “Armidale is
terribly pro-Labor.” If Armidale is pro-
Labor, you wouldn’t guess it from the
late-afternoon rally in the city mall. It
was as tame as the vicar’s tea-party.
“Whatever happened to hecklers?” one
of the wombats asks Sinclair. “I called
the meeting at this time to give them a
go but I suspect they are all studying
for their exams,” he replies. Sinclair is
quick on his feet and would welcome
some verbal jousting. Like Mike Young,
he is a master in the art of trading
personal insults. He calls for questions
unlike the Prime Minister who
requires notice of them in advance
but the questions are shameless
Dorothy-Dixers. There is no sport.
Sinclair and his team are campaign-
ing fiercely. “He’ll get in but he’ll
probably just get in,” conceded one
National Party supporter. “It’s hard to
see him losing,” said a fat-lamb pro-


lan and Rosemary Sinclair campaigning: a 2.8 percent swing would oust him
ducer from Guyra. “A lot of the stink
from the big court cases has blown over.
New Englanders are a pretty con-
servative lot and a lot of them don’t
approve of him but he’s such a strong
performer in parliament and he’s on the
right side, so it’s hard for them not to
vote for him.”
Sinclair’s wife Rosemary, a former
top model and Miss Australia, is also on
the hustings - for the first time. Sinclair
makes frequent references to “my wife
Rosie.” The elegant Mrs Sinclair says:
“This is the first year I’ve been able to
travel with him extensively the first
time in 15 years I haven’t had children
at home.” The Nationals believe
strongly in the traditional family unit,
according to their pamphlets. “The
Nationals believe the family and the
institution of marriage are the founda-
tion of Australian society.”
The National Party campaign launch
takes place at the Workmen’s Club in
Tamworth. Some 40 or 50 mostly
elderly women do not pause in the
playing of poker machines. For some
unidentified reason, the burglar alarm is
loudly ringing. A large poster of lan
Sinclair the Iron Man of politics
falls to the ground. Subdued, well-
scrubbed New Englanders fill the hall
while a band called The Squatters (three
of them Blaxlands) plays On the Road
to Gundagai.
The speeches begin. “Could I have
your attendance (sic)?” asks Sir Adrian
Solomons, a local luminary. Grace is
said. God Save the Queen is sung with
feeling. The loyal toast is given. To go
with the cold chicken, there is also
humble pie. “When we were in Govern-
ment last, we made some mistakes,”
says Sinclair. “But we’ve learned from
those mistakes.” And: “I could promise
you the world, tell you that if you vote
for the National Party you will live
happily ever after. That’s not the case
you know it and I know it. What I can
do is give you the commitment that the
National Party will work to make
Australia a better place to live, to work
and to play.”
Sinclair is at his best speaking
without notes but today he is following
the script. “All we need is the grabs and
we can go,” says a television wombat,
Sinclair attacks “the biggest spending,
biggest taxing, biggest deficit govern-
ment in Australian history” and
reiterates his undertaking to abolish the
lump sum superannuation tax in-
troduced by the Hawke government.
The speech covers everything from
the sanctity of family and allegiance to
the Queen, to the promise of brucellosis
and tuberculosis eradication campaigns
and unemployment benefits to cane
growers. There is no reference to flat
rate income tax schemes as there had
been the previous week in Bundaberg.
Sinclair “recognises the worries” of fat-
lamb producers about the level of
imports from New Zealand. (One fat-
lamb producer said afterward that they
wanted a good deal more than recognisi-
tion of their worries.)
After the speech, lots of hands are
shaken (unlike the Prime Minister,
Sinclair is not a big campaign kisser and
even babies tend to be safe). With his
wife, he climbs into a small hire bus and
heads once more for the airport. The
driver of the bus is the wombat from
The Sydney Morning Herald who has
the necessary driving qualifications.
Sinclair cheerfully shouts directions. A
left here, a right there. He is easy-going,
a good travelling companion.
In Armidale, Sinclair and “Rosie”
dine with the wombats at Victor’s
restaurant. A TV set is placed on the
restaurant bar so all can observe the
newly recorded National Party com-
mercial. Sinclair points to a small figure
standing behind him on the screen. It is
Paddington Bear. Let no one take the
new humble Sinclair too seriously.
The next day, he crosses the border
into Queensland for early morning
radio and TV interviews and a gigantic
hiccup. At the noon launching of the
National Party’s Queensland campaign
at the Park Royal Hotel, with wombats
nodding in the sunshine, Senator Ron
Boswell drops his bombshell about
blocking supply if the Labor govern-
ment money bills include death duties,
wealth tax or capital gains tax pro-
visions. Sinclair’s eyes roll heavenward
(clearly more than brucellosis needs to
be eradicated) as Boswell announces:
“National Party senators will block any
legislation creating capital gains, wealth
or death duties taxes. If that means
blocking supply bills, then we will go to
the barricades on it.” Sinclair clearly is
not going to be joining them at these
particular barricades and dodges
questions by saying that the coalition
will be in power after December 1 and
therefore the matter will never arise.
There is a sharp drop in excitement
level the next day. Lunch at a nursing
home in Kempsey replaces the
scheduled official opening of the rodeo
which has been washed out. Arthur
Slack who owns the nursing home and
who is the National campaign director
for the area (“I’m Slack by name but not
by nature”) proudly introduces his
party leader to the frail, grey-haired
audience. “We had Father Jim this
morning and we are getting Slim Dusty
up sometime soon,” Slack promises
with great and unmatched enthusiasm.
Restless wombats wonder aloud how
many votes there are in visits to old
people’s homes.
They are looking forward to that
night’s barbecue at Wauchope. They are
looking forward to climbing aboard the
Hawker Siddeley and listening to the
gentle hum of engines, the tinkling of
iceblocks. Will they find inspiration in
the deep and puzzling mystery of the
Ghost Who Walks, the man who cannot
die? On the flight to Port Macquarie, the
National Party leader pokes his head
into the wombat cage and asks: “How
many Phantom comics are there?” The
answer, not to be found in Hansard, is
811. □

OPINION
Disappointments
of the Age
of Consensus
The Bulletin has asked prominent people
from outside the mainstream of politics
for their opinions on the election.
RICHARD WALSH, publisher of Angus
and Robertson, gives a personal view of
the Hawke consensus.
I SHALL, as always, be voting Labor
and as always with considerable
reservations.
At its best, the ALP is a party
dedicated to social justice but these days
it is, in my view, dominated by a faction
of dubious ethical character which con-
sistently underestimates the idealism of
the Australian people and the pace at
which social reform can be confidently
enacted without creating significant
electoral backlash.
My major disappointments at this
election are:
1. I am totally unconvinced by the
performance of the NSW state govern-
ment and regard the federal party’s
attempts to aid and abet the yet-unfold-
ing debacle as threatening to undermine
its credibility.
2. Given the size of its present
majority and its future prospects, the
Hawke government really should dis-
play more political courage. On the
taxation issue, for example, instead of
being so defensive about a capital gains
tax and death duties (thus arousing fear
and suspicion) it should boldly pro-
claim the positive benefits of such taxa-
tion and detail the benefits that can
accrue to wage earners who are both
productive and living.
3. It continues to be a disappoint-
ment that the Age of Consensus has not
opened the eyes of more people in the
Labor Party to the genuine idealism of
many people in the business community
who were utterly appalled by the con-
frontation strategy of the Fraser govern-
ment. Enterprising private businesses,
regulated in an efficient but not officious
way by government, have more to offer
their employees, consumers and
ultimately Australia than ALP hard-line
dogmatists will ever comprehend.
4. I am appalled at the rise of the
Nuclear Disarmament Party and
amazed that so many seemingly in-
telligent people can allow themselves to
be beguiled into believing that if World
War 111 broke out tomorrow a disarmed
Australia would somehow be spared. I,
too, fear nuclear catastrophe but see the
solution as complex and global. The
self-indulgent simplicity of the NDP
adherents obscures the fact that Bill
Hayden’s foreign policy is making a
considerably greater contribution to
what they so desperately desire than
anything they propose; armed neutral-
ity (which I support) would assist his
efforts but would not marginally detach
us from the fate we all share with
America and Switzerland, India and the
Soviet Union.
In other words, nuclear disarmament
of itself achieves nothing if it is not
backed up by an intelligent, effective
and outward-looking foreign policy and
by enlightened domestic policies in
Richard Walsh: Australia is ripe for radical new ideas
KEVIN BROWN
areas such as immigration and educa-
tion to ensure the development of
Australia as a country at peace with its
neighbors. Uranium mining, in my
view, is a different issue entirely and
those who link it to the disarmament
debate too often reveal their blind fears
rather than their capacity to find
rational solutions to the real dangers we
face.
Finally, we are now only four years
off the bicentenary. I am sure that
the enduring appeal of the NDP,
Democrats and other fringe parties in
the past 15 years has been an increasing
dissatisfaction of a significant section of
the electorate with our present political
institutions. I believe Australia is ripe
for radical new ideas about how we
might govern ourselves and these ideas
should form part of the current political
debate. What a pity that our oldest party
is too entranced by the realpolitik of
now to dream a little of what, with more
imagination, might yet be. □
HEALTH
Doctors unite
to fight
industrial ills
By GLENNYS BELL
THE NEW phenomenon of repetitive
strain injuries, the crippling cost of back
injuries, industrial safety, disability,
compensation and rehabilitation will be
tackled by the medical profession in a
seminar in Melbourne next week. The
theme for the seminar is Disability in
the Work Force.
It is being organised by the Royal
Australasian College of Surgeons and
the Royal Australasian College of
Physicians, which have combined for
the first time on a community issue
because they are so concerned over the
problem.
As Peter Nelson, a surgeon and
chairman of the organising committee,
says: “Both physicians and surgeons
have to deal with the injuries and we
felt, because we are involved in their
treatment, that we could make a positive
contribution to helping prevent them.”
The seminar will cover a broad range
of topics, from the type of injuries
suffered to industrial compensation and
legislative objectives. Some 400 del-
egates from government, industry, the
trade unions and the legal profession, as
well as the medical profession, will be
attending. Speakers have been drawn
from organisations such as the
Australian College of Occupational

Medicine, the Australian Council of
Trade Unions, the Disability Advisory
Council, the Law Council, the Repco
Corporation and Mobil Australia.
The cost of disability in the work
force, in both human and financial
terms, is one of the factors which led the
medical colleges to take action. Con-
servative estimates put the cost at more
than $6OOO million annually in lost
production and medical and other costs.
More than 500,000 people are injured
each year and around 1000 are killed in
work-related accidents. More produc-
tion time is lost through industrial
accidents than through strikes.
The medical colleges want to find out
'''-how to prevent and treat injuries to
create a safe industrial environment and
to ensure that individuals are
adequately compensated for their in-
juries.
One factor which heightened their
concern is the growing incidence of
repetitive strain injury. As Nelson says:
“The back injury and back problem
have been with us a while, but repetitive
strain injury and injuries such as ten-
osynovitis and tendonitis are of growing
importance. In NSW, for example, 60-
70 percent of workers’ compensation
claims for women workers are due to
these kinds of injuries.”
[Tenosynovitis and tendonitis are
injuries caused by repetitive movements
which use up the fluid lubricating the
tendons, causing inflammation and
pain. Repetitive strain injury is still
being investigated, but it is more to do
with soreness in the muscles, rather than
the tendons.]
The colleges refer to repetitive strain
injury as a new Australian disease, one
suffered increasingly by keyboard
operators, packaging process workers
and electronic parts assemblers. It is
poorly understood by the medical
professional and responds poorly to
treatment.
The colleges suggest that it may be an
illness rather than an injury. Functional
impairment is more prominent in this
type of injury, in contrast to the better
recognised and understood tendonitis,
tenosynovitis and other conditions
which are more capable of treatment
with better prospects of cure. They
suggest that studies of the cause, preven-
tion and treatment of repetitive strain
injury be undertaken.
There is, according to the colleges, a
widespread desire among employees to
negotiate improvements in the working
environment and the development of
safety standards. It is estimated that at
any one time, some 4-6 percent of the
work force is disabled through back
injury, tenosynovitis, heart disease, con-
ditions caused by industrial toxins,
chemicals and gases or simply traumatic
injury at work. □
HUMOR
'... so smooth, so
green, so full of
goodly prospect’
By JOHN CUNNINGHAM
TELEVISION and radio golf com-
mentators at the Australian Open will
have to watch their words.
There is no room in golf for the rustic
humor of John Arlott as in cricket; for
Mossopian tautology as in Sydney
rugby league or for the reverential awe
which soon changes to hysteria for those
who report on Australian football.
Let the commentators turn to
Shakespeare for guidance: as always, he
had a word or a phrase for everything.
But there are still pitfalls.
The commentator should not begin
by asking the players on the first tee:
“... where go you
“With bats and clubs ... ?”
(Menenius Agrippa, Coriolanus, Act 1 Scene
D
“Bats” belong to cricket, dear boy.
The golfer uses from the tee a driver:
“... with those hands that grasped the
heaviest club.”
(Antony, Antony and Cleopatra, Act 4 Scene
12)
And as he drives he murmurs to
himself, as would, say, Greg Norman:
“Boldness be my friend.”
(lachimo, Cymbeline, Act 1 Scene 6)
thus hoping that such an injunction to
his ball
.. gives strength to make it fly.”
(Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, Act 1 Scene 3)
But really to no avail for
“Even with the stroke and line ..
(Vincento Duke of Vienna, Measure for
Measure, Act 4 Scene 2)
he was
“Hooking ... wrong ..
(Isabella, Measure for Measure, Act 2 Scene
4)
or was it a
“Slice, I say ... a slice”?
(Nym, Merry Wives of Windsor, Act 1 Scene
V
Anyway, all the golfer can say is:
“... and so my shot is lost.”
(First Keeper, Henry VI Part 3, Act 3 Scene
V
“... lost in a thorny wood.”
(Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Henry VI Part
3, Act 3 Scene 2)
At the last moment, however,
“It is not 105 t...”
Desdemona, Othello, Act 3 Scene 4)
But it still remains in
“... a monstrous lie.”
Trinculo, The Tempest, Act 3 Scene 2)
Golfers can be temperamental and
may well angrily demand of the caddy:
“... fetch me an iron.”
(Antipholus of Ephesus, Comedy of Errors,
Act 3 Scene 1)
Looking from the lie to the pin, our
commentator may say, to be in agree-
ment with the golfer:
“How lush and lusty the grass looks, how
green!”
(Gonzalo, The Tempest, Act 2 Scene 1)

And, for a further bonus
“Without apparent hazard ...”
(Duke of Milan, Two Gentlemen of Verona,
Act 3 Scene 1)
for it seems that
“... all ways do lie open.”
(Ford, Merry Wives of Windsor, Act 2 Scene
2)
and that our hero has the chance of
“Making the green ...”
(Macbeth, Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 1)
But there are the bunkers
“... those pretty traps to catch.”
(Exeter, King Henry V, Act 1 Scene 2)
Still, from that “monstrous lie,” he
has other problems should he hook or
slice under
“The thorny brambles and embracing
bushes.”
(Venus and Adonis)
Then comes disaster, for the golfer
has an air swing, which the com-
mentator can variously describe as one
of
“... our vain blows”
(Marcellus, Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 1)
or that he did
“Strike not a stroke.”
(Achilles, Troilus and Cressida, Act 5 Scene
7)
In losing a stroke, he also loses any
hope of making
“... the princely eagle.”
(Ear! of Warwick, King Henry VI Part 3, Act 5
Scene 2)
The next stroke is a poor
one, as the commentator
remarks sympathetically:
“You have shot over ..
(Constable of France, King Henry
V, Act 3 Scene 6)
To get back to the green,
the golfer has only
.. an ordinary pitch.”
(Flavius, Julius Caesar, Act 1
Scene 1)
But he muffs it and finally
.. hack’d and chipp’d”
(Ulysses, Troilus and Cressida,
Act 5 Scene 5)
to
.. the quaint mazes on the
wanton green.”
(Titania, A Midsummer Night’s
Dream, Act 1 Scene 2)
Alas! and again! that chip
“... o’er the green ... did
pass.”
(A Song, As You Like It, Act 5
Scene 3)
And while the golfer
cursed
“... this strange course.”
(A Friar, Much Ado About
Nothing, Act 4 Scene 1)
the commentator had realised
it was far too strong:
“It cannot hold: it will not.”
(Senator, Timon of Athens, Act 2
Scene 1)
and that it
“... dost not bite.”
(Amiens, As You Like It, Act 2 Scene 7)
And it doesn’t. So our unhappy
player stamps his
“... clouted brogues”
(Arviragus, Cymbeline, Act 4 Scene 2)
while uttering a good mouth-filling
oath, quite forgetting that
“Good words are better than bad
strokes.”
(Antony, Julius Caesar, Act 5 Scene 1)
He can be forgiven because on a par-
four hole he is now
“Labouring for nine.”
(Philotus, Timon of Athens, Act 3 Scene 4)
He cannot now really look forward
to
“The golden round ...”
(Lady Macbeth, Macbeth, Act 1 Scene 5)
But at this hole and at last and to his
great relief, his ball finally
“Ran on the green ...”
(Polixenus, The Winter’s Tale, Act 4 Scene
3)
where he became fortune’s darling for
he was a
“... putter-out of one.”
(Gonzaio, The Tempest, Act 3 Scene 3)
Now, there was only the long trudge
back to the clubhouse where, no doubt,
he could find
“Room for six scotches more ...”
(Scarus, Antony and Cleopatra, Act 4 Scene
7)
Premier Bjelke-Petersen: academic backlash over advertising
QUEENSLAND
Backlash over
Joh’s edict on
switching ads
By JANET WILSON
NEVILLE WRAN may be “Nifty” and
Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen could be termed
“Thrifty” but the premiers have one
thing in common they support Rupert
Murdoch.
When the Queensland leader an-
nounced two weeks ago that his govern-
ment was moving its newspaper ad-
vertising from The Courier-Mail to the
less-widely-read Daily Sun, nobody sus-
pected that the decision would include
the state’s universities as well as cultural
interests. But Bjelke-Petersen’s edict
applied to all government departments
and statutory authorities including
tertiary institutions.
Academics are privately furious but
publicly guarded over what they see as
an attack on their independence.
All any university, college or in-
stitute has received ostensibly is a
memorandum asking it to place
newspaper advertising with the govern-
ment’s central agency Leo Burnett Pty
Ltd. From there, Leo Burnett
places the advertisements
under a bulk-buying arrange-
ment with the Murdoch-
owned daily and Sunday Sun.
Under the edict, all
classified and semi-classified
ads must be placed with the
Sun newspapers with display
ads split 50/50 between them.
The Premier describes it as
“sound business practice.”
He said: “The government
has been able to achieve dis-
count rates in the order of 43
percent on classifieds in
Brisbane and we are presently
negotiating discount rates for
all other publications, includ-
ing The Australian (also
owned by Murdoch) which
carries by far the majority of
tertiary vacancy advertise-
ments.
“People looking for ads in
the Brisbane papers will very
quickly learn to go to the
source. There is no problem
with that.”
Bjelke-Petersen added that
the system would allow ter-
tiary institutions to place ads
in The Australian and every
other newspaper outside
Brisb’ane, as well as in pro-
fessional journals, and enjoy


considerable savings on previous rates.
The State Board of Advanced Edu-
cation, along with several universities
and colleges, has appealed to cabinet
without success over the scheme which
is on trial until next July.
Some universities are starting to fight
back. Queensland University, for inst-
ance, rejected the government’s
directive at the monthly meeting of its
senate late last week. The senate called
on the government to re-negotiate its
advertising requirements. The decision
was surprising, as 11 of the senate’s 35
members are government appointees.
The Griffith University council
decided at its most recent monthly
meeting to liaise with Queensland and
James Cook universities to have
themselves exempted from the decision.
Griffith’s acting vice-chancellor, Pro-
fessor Robert Segall, says that un-
iversities are in a different category from
most statutory authorities. He is doubt-
ful about claims that the move will save
money.
“If, as a result of an advertisement
which costs you less, you ultimately
don’t get as strong a field for
the job, obviously you haven’t
in any real sense saved
money,” he said. “You’ve
made smaller outlays but you
haven’t been cost-effective.”
Statistics may prove him
correct. Using Roy Morgan
poll figures, 92,000 of The
Courier-Mail’s readership are
deemed to be university-
educated compared with
22,000 of the Daily Sun’s.
Segall sees a major pro-
blem with overseas advertise-
ments and the use of the
agency: “We’re concerned
with the specialised nature of
those advertisements. We’ve
got quite an elaborate network and
means of advertising through the As-
sociation of Commonwealth Un-
iversities. I’m not at all confident that it
will be easy to operate in the new
system.”
Other members of Griffith’s academ-
ic staff have been very vocal in their
disapproval of the move.
Dr Peter Coaldrake, head of the
School of Administration and an
elected faculty member on the univers-
ity council, has foreshadowed a motion
for next month’s council meeting to
ignore the government’s direction if
cabinet refuses to exempt the university
from it.
“The universities potentially are
being caught up as pawns in a political
game,” he said. “That political game is
the politics of punishment. We’ve al-
ready seen it in New South Wales with
the Wran government making a similar
initiative to that occurring in
Queensland. It has been inspired by the
state government’s aggravation with a
certain news outlet.”
Coaldrake added: “I think, if we lie
down and take it at this stage, we have
no guarantee where the game goes from
here. Too often, Queenslanders show
themselves to be politically punch-
drunk incapable of being fazed or
astounded by anything.”
Meanwhile, as a statutory authority,
the Queensland Theatre Company is
also considering the implications of the
ruling. Company director Alan
Edwards says that the move probably
will not have a great effect on the
subscription audience but could affect
single-ticket or off-the-street sales the
primary target of newspaper advertise-
ments.
“We run a very tight campaign in
terms of money,” he said. “Basically,
it’ll mean splitting our budget down the
middle between both newspapers.
“The people who read the Sun are in
the lower socio-economic bracket and
they’re the people who don’t normally
come to the theatre.” □

Fail-safe braking
system may enjoy
export bonanza
By BRUCE STANNARD
EIGHT YEARS ago truck driver Colin
Skelton drove a load of rubbish to a tip.
On his way out of the dump the ropes
from his trailer’s canvas cover caught
under his wheels and brought him to an
abrupt halt. Skelton got out and saw an
idea that today promises to save lives
and to yield millions of dollars in export
earnings.
Australian owned and managed
Dunlop Olympic Ltd has just completed
negotiations for Australian and in-
ternational rights to the device that has
become known as the Skelton
Emergency Stopping System.
The concept is as simple and
effective as it is revolutionary.
A rubber belt 700 mm long, 250 mm
wide and 12mm thick, impregnated with
nylon cord, smooth on one side and
tracked like a tyre on the other is
mounted on the chassis above and
slightly ahead of the inside dual wheel
at the rear of the vehicle.
The belt, activated pneumatically
from the cabin, drops to the road by
gravity and is swept under the tyre with
the tread facing the road surface.
The belt tension creates a downward
deflection of the axle suspension and
produces an anti-drive effect which
brings even the heaviest vehicles to a

short but completely controlled stop.
The system, which has been proven
100 percent successful in all conditions
including snow and ice and heavy rain,
is set for final New South Wales Depart-
ment of Motor Transport approval at
the end of this month.
Dunlop expect to market the device
world-wide with a retail price of around
S3OOO per unit.
Final acceptance of the system
comes after a long and costly battle
against industry indifference and the
inevitable knockers, particularly in
Australia.
When Skelton died in 1980 his
widow went into partnership with
Sydney antique dealer George Macedo
who poured a great deal of his own time
and money into its testing and promo-
tion.
“I wanted this to be an all-Australian
device,” Macedo said. “Here was an
Australian invention that ought to be
manufactured in Australia and sold to
the world. I wanted it to create jobs for
Australians and earn this country hard
export dollars. But at every turn I was
met with the usual Australian con-
servatism. Anything new and different is
automatically suspect. It took a lot of
convincing. Now we are well on the way
to a world market which will be worth
rhany, many millions of dollars to
Australia.”
Secret testing at the Goulburn Valley
Driving School in Shepparton, Victoria
showed that the belt could stop a 41 seat
coach (among the biggest on the road)
doing 80 km/h in just 56m in wet
conditions. Similar results were
obtained from tests with heavily laden
tri-axle trucks.
Russell McKenzie, the Australian
marketing manager for the Dunlop
Olympic tyre group said the tests
showed the heavier the load the more
efficient the belt system was in stopping
the vehicles. McKenzie said production
was expected to begin in Melbourne
within a month.
“We are marketing this as a safety
device, pure and simple,” he said. “It
may be a once in a lifetime thing but it
does have the capacity to save life. We
are all aware of the disasters that occur
when coal trucks get out of control on
the Bulli Pass. We know what happens
when school buses go haywire in the
wet. The belt can and will prevent those
sorts of tragedies.”
McKenzie said several large heavy-
vehicle fleet-owners were set to place
orders for the first of the belts.
Woollahra Council in Sydney wants
them for its garbage compactors and the
NSW Department of Main Roads is
anxious to install it on their road-
making equipment following several
near disasters on construction sites be-
tween Sydney and Newcastle. □

When you’re late for the dance,
you’d better have averygood reason.
The party started about three years

COVER STORY
The homes industry surges
back with first owner scheme
Housing has been a star performer in Australia's general economic recovery, boosted by
a federal government initiative which proved to be so successful as to require tempering
in the latest budget. MICHAEL MEAGHER looks at where we go from here.
NEW HOUSING starts and housing
prices have surged over much of
Australia this year. Sydney remains the
most expensive place to buy a home but
the other capital cities have narrowed
the gap dramatically. Between now and
the December 1 polls, the Hawke
government can be expected to hammer
home the results of a catalyst of the
housing situation the First Home
Owners Scheme.
Possibly THE winning move of
Labor’s 20-month term, the scheme has
been embarrassingly successful for the
government. It cost more than double a
1983 budget allocation of $l2O million
in the first nine months of operation, to
last June, helped 80,000 buyers into
houses in the 12 months to October and
was a factor in lifting commencements
off a 20-year low of 105,000 in 1982-83
to 137,000 last financial year.
The building industry has criticised
recent changes to the scheme which
toughen income eligibility levels and
virtually rule out single applicants. The
Housing Industry Association says that
commencements could fall from an
annual rate of 150,000 in the middle
months of this year to 130,000 and
lower in the next few months.
The new home buyer initiative has
lifted prices, particularly at the lower
end of the market. A chain reaction has
occurred as owners have sold up and
bought higher on the scale. Jim Wood,
managing director of Jennings In-
dustries Ltd which is the country’s
largest home builder, says that after
stage one the buoyant activity
through the First Home Owners Scheme
the cycle has entered the “move-up”
stage in which buyers seek larger
premises.
The average contract price of a
Jennings home 12 months ago was
$43,000 but this has risen 23 percent to
$53,000. Wood says that costs have risen
only 4 to 5 percent, which means that
the builder is providing bigger homes.
The accompanying tables show how
the scheme, lower interest rates for most
of the year, a healthier general
DON McPHEDRAN
Melbourne real estate agent Malcolm Gray: the market will remain strong


Jennings Industries’ Jim Wood: buyers are seeking larger premises
economic outlook and dramatically
higher lending by both banks and build-
ing societies have boosted prices in most
states in the September quarter.
Adelaide, coming from a very low base,
and Melbourne have been the most
active markets. At the other end of the
scale, Sydney has been little changed.
Home-seekers look to have missed
the boat in terms of “cheap” buys in
Adelaide and Melbourne at least at
the lower-priced end of the market
but experts predict a stabilising of the
market and steady price increases in
most states through the first half of 1985.
Good news for home-buyers is that
finance should continue to be freely
available in the new year.
Australia’s largest home finance pro-
vider, the Commonwealth Bank es-
timates that it will lend $1.76 billion this
financial year well up on the $1.5
billion of the year before. All the banks
look likely to have ample finance avail-
able at least until mid-1985 when loan
availability may tighten.
Releasing savings bank deposit fig-
ures for September last week, Ron
Cameron who is director of the
Australian Bankers’ Association
Research Directorate warned that the
rate of increase of deposits might not be
high enough to sustain the level of
lending.
Growth in deposits reached 24.4
percent in September 1983 when the
banks’ savings investment account rates
were very attractive compared with
their competitors. Deposits were up
only 10 percent last September
Building societies, too, have opened
their coffers and are continuing to
provide finance at the levels which saw
their loans shoot from $l.B billion in
1982-83 to $3.4 billion in the year ended
June.
Buyers may be hopeful of a fall in
the banks’ lending rates from the
common 11.5 percent but that appears
to be unlikely. Westpac’s chief manager,
retail products, Peter Street says that
margins are tight with a growing slice of
the bank’s deposits attracted through
the plastic card Advantage Saver ac-
count which offers a rate of 9.75 percent
for amounts over $2OOO. He also expects
a tightening in the demand for funds
from the March quarter next year.
The housing prices in Table one
dramatically show how the other capital
cities have made ground on Sydney
prices in the 12 months to September.
The prices used are the average of
medians over the year. The Sydney
market charged ahead from 1979 to
1981. Brisbane made its move in 1982
and Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra
have followed these examples in the
past 12 months. Canberra appears to
have justified the theory that real estate
Where the first Home Owners Scheme made its impact


booms in the national capital go hand-
in-hand with Labor governments.
While the prices in Table one show a
broad trend, those in Table two il-
lustrate how the market has accelerated
this year. The figures again median
prices, averaged over the March and
September quarters show steady and
even slightly falling markets in Sydney
and Perth, steady rises in Brisbane and
solid increases in Melbourne and
Adelaide (particularly in established
homes and units).
Melbourne is the standout in prop-
erty price performance and stamina.
Describing housing real estate activity
as “not a boom but a very active
market,” the president of the Real
Estate Institute of Australia in Victoria,
Noel Allen, says that there has been “a
lot of growth at the lower end of the
market which has put pressure on other
price brackets.” Melbourne real estate
agency Gray and Johnson recently
reported that average residential prices
there increased by 21 percent to $72,000
in the year to June 30. The market has
not fallen since. One of the agency’s
partners, Malcolm Gray, says that av-
erage prices are ahead 5 percent in the
first four months of this financial year.
He expects this gain to hold up, giving a
full-year move of 15 percent.
Another index of the Melbourne
market is the success rate at auction
the percentage of houses offered which
are sold. Gray estimates that this rate is
running at 72 to 73 percent, compared
to 71 last year. In the doldrums of 1977-
78, the rate was 35 percent. The number
of houses going to auction also is on the
increase. In July, Gray says, some 300
homes a week went to auction but that
had risen to 450 to 500.
The bullish Gray believes that, with
“a continued lack of pressure on in-
terest rates together with the ample
availability of finance through to mid-
next-year, the market will remain strong
with upward pressure on prices.”
While prices may have peaked, the
Adelaide market appears to be strong.

Note: Figures supplied by the Real Estate institute of Australia are median prices. The median is the midpoint of the
number of houses sold. The 12 individual medians, for each month In each year to the end of September, are averaged
to give a moving annual median for the year.
From a low base, the new federal
government and lower interest rates
provided stimulants along with last
year’s breaking of the drought which
was more important to South Australia
than to any other state.
South Australian president of the
Real Estate Institute, Gary Taplin says
that the greatest price increases have
been in fringe suburbs and blue-collar
areas. He hopes to see a stabilisation of
prices. “The rate of increase in prices
has already stabilised but the increases
are still there.” Scope may remain for
price rises at the top end of the Adelaide
market. Taplin says: “I think Adelaide
is grossly undervalued in the high price
bracket.”
Sydney has been a most disappoint-
ing market to real estate agents over the
past year. The latest property price
review of the NSW Building Society,
covering six Sydney regions to the end
of the September quarter, shows little
price movement.
The society’s survey is based on
a sample of some 5000 dwellings
sold, classified into houses, town houses
and home units. Few categories per-
formed higher than the inflation rate in
the 12 months to September. The
strongest were the inner-west and
Parramatta and western regions. Houses
in the Camperdown-Marrickville-Sum-
mer Hill sub-region showed average
increases of 7.6 percent, to $77,600, over
the year and that growth rate was
equalled only by town houses in Ab-
botsford-Balmain-Glebe which finished
at $9*6,400.
Threat of a capital gains tax has been
holding the Sydney market down, says
Richard Bird, who is NSW sales man-
ager at L. J. Hooker. He adds: “The
small investor makes up a large part of
the market and he’s holding his breath
about the tax. The assets tax is not really
having an effect.”
Sydney’s ritzy areas have faltered.
The average price of $205,000 in the
suburbs of Potts Point and Vaucluse is 4
percent down on a year ago. North
Shore prices, too, are slightly down.
While most of the states had strong
price increases in the last financial year,
the market seems still to offer buyers
opportunities if they can identify the
start of an upward cycle.
A recent study by analysts BIS-
Shrapnel Pty Ltd shows that the
Northern Territory posted only a 1.8
percent growth in private housing activ-
ity in 1983-84. However, BIS expects an
upturn of 32.6 percent this financial
year. The Australian Capital Territory
which has had big price gains is
suffering “an accommodation shortage
and is expected to achieve an increase
of 23.3 percent in private house com-
mencements in 1984-85.”

According to Bls’ predictions for
building activity in Western Australia,
that state has a way to go in its cycle.
Private commencements jumped by 54
percent in 1983-84 and the high growth
has continued in approval figures for
July and August.
With the lowest costs for new house
construction in Australia in its favor
and a relatively high population growth,
BIS expects the WA market “to undergo
boom conditions in 1984-85, with
further growth of 24.4 percent, to reach
its highest level since 1972-73. Activity
should peak about June 1985 and then
turn down steadily in 1985-86.”
Tasmania appears to have hit its
cyclical peak. Private housing saw a
strong upturn in 1983-84 in the state,
with commencements up 68.5 percent.
BIS forecasts a slowing in growth in
1984-85 to a 10 percent increase.
Five-year figures of the growth of
median prices in Hobart were not avail-
able for Table one but, according to
Graham Cooke who is president of the
Real Estate Institute for the state, the
market is strong. The median price for
Ron Silberberg: changes threaten recovery in the building industry
September of $49,100 was 20 percent up
on the same month last year. Cooke says
the whole Tasmanian market “feels
good. It’s a nice, controlled market.”
The rich end of the market is also
moving up. A residence in Hobart city
went for a record $450,000 last month.
Banks and building societies are
keen to finance further home activity.
The Commonwealth’s assistant general
manager, lending and insurance, Strett
Napier, says the bank lent $l5O million
for housing in October compared to
$132 million in that month last year. It
would average $l4O million for some
months yet.
Both banks and building societies
have eased loan eligibility rules. Banks
are lending to people with little or no
history with them albeit at a rate
usually higher than the preferential one
for customers with good savings
records. Westpac this week introduces a
guaranteed home loan scheme. Accord-
ing to Street: “For those customers who
want the security of saying, ‘l’ll qualify
my money with Westpac,’ we are saying,
‘We will look after you’.” The loyal
customer will be able to get high loan-
to-deposit ratios. The guarantee is not a
new idea it has been tried on occasion
but is typical of the competitiveness
of the banks.
New deals for repaying loans also
are widely available. Buyers can choose
to pay less in the first couple of years
and catch up when their income is more
substantial. Alternatively, they can
suffer the strain of higher payments
earlier on and make smaller payments
when say one of the marriage
partners has to leave the workforce to
look after a child.
The Commonwealth last month in-
troduced a very low-start loan with
repayments $5O less in the first year than
for a traditional loan. Napier says that
the first three weeks have seen 50 loans
go out at an average of $45,000. Most
were to first home buyers. The National
Australia Bank has enjoyed success with
its low-start version.
The continuing boost the housing
industry gets from new dwellings is
contingent on the smooth working of
the First Home Owners Scheme. Deputy
executive director of the Housing In-
dustry Association, Dr Ron Silberberg,
says: “To our minds, there has never
been a more effective or better-
publicised scheme of home assistance.”
Silberberg says: “The take-up rate
has been phenomenal. We estimate that
from 85 to 90 percent of people who
were eligible for the scheme and wanted
to buy new homes applied for the
assistance. That puts the scheme in the
league of the age pension and un-
employment benefits.” The association
feels that the scheme added about
15,000 commencements to the figure of
137,000 for the year ended last June
and created 40,000 jobs.
The Minister for Housing and Con-
struction, Chris Hurford, will be
emphasising the success of the scheme
in the run to the federal election. The
government apparently was con-
templating last month an advertising
campaign promoting the scheme and
the changes made to it in the budget but
The Bulletin understands that it was
postponed, for reasons of “propriety,”
after the election had been called.

of adverse electorate reaction to the
changes may have been a factor in the
delay.
Before the budget, the scheme
offered eligible home-buyers subsidies
of up to S7OOO spread over five years.
The full grant was available to those
whose taxable income in 1982-83 was
below $24,300, with assistance phasing
out for those whose income exceeded
$27,900.
The changes mean that the maximum
grant of $7OOO may go only to
households with incomes up to $20,000
a year. More controversially, the upper
income limit for single applicants was
nearly halved, to $13,950 a year, with a
grant of $5OOO payable to single applic-
ants with incomes of $lO,OOO a year.
Silberberg says that the changes are
threatening continuing recovery and
that the number of applicants is running
at an average of 1400 a week compared
to 2300 previously. If the less generous
scheme continues in its present form,
Silberberg says, Hurford’s prediction of
a new housing commencement rate of
145,000 in the year to June next year
will not be realised. Silberberg thinks
that a 140,000 total only slightly
above last year’s commencements is
more likely.
Builders are not thrilled by the
tougher requirements. Jennings’ Wood
says that, in part due to the changes,
sales are running at some 440 a month
in the current year against 500 in
1983-84.
However, the higher average prices
mean that the builders’ revenues are still
ahead. Wood says the Victorian and
Adelaide markets “are still very strong
indeed.”
Less optimistic is Hooker Homes’
managing director Alby Stockwell who
says that the market slowdown since the
eligibility changes shows signs of
worsening. He says Hooker “is taking a
fairly cautious view. We are not build-
ing up high levels of inventory.”
A supplier to the housing industry,
CSR Ltd’s Gypsum Products Group
does not see an abrupt end to the
buoyant activity but a levelling off in
housing activity in the first three months
of next year. General manager Richard
Smith believes that the rate of activity
will be steady once it reaches a plateau.
Groups such as CSR Gypsum, which
supplies gyprock plasterboard in all
states, would not feel any pinch in the
building industry as early as would
Jennings and Hooker. There is a lead
time of about two-and-a-half months
between a housing commencement and
the time gyprock is used. Smith told The
Bulletin : “If you ignore seasonal
demand, I think the underlying demand
has been reached and a level of around
140,000 commencements a year is sus-
tainable.” □

PUBLIC OPINION
NSW, Victoria
rise on
Hawke’s coat-tails
THE POPULARITY of the Victorian
and New South Wales governments
rose last month, apparently pulled up
by the strong support being given to
Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
Australian Labor Party backing in
Victoria jumped 3 points, to 51 percent,
with the Liberal vote dropping 4, to 34.
The government’s backing in NSW
was up by 4 points, to 48 percent. The
Liberal-National Party Opposition’s
support fell 4, to 43 percent.
The most likely explanation for the
improved ALP support is the increased
exposure Hawke has received during
the early weeks of the federal election
campaign.
The ALP would have been returned
with an increased majority if an election
had been held in Victoria at the end of
October, the Morgan Gallup Poll finds.
Premier John Cain’s approval rating
was up 6 points to 58 percent. The
approval rating of Jeff Kennett as the
leader of the Opposition was 40 percent
(unchanged).
In this poll, 1251 electors throughout
Victoria were surveyed in October. They
were asked which party would receive
their first preference “if a state election
were being held today?” Of those sur-
veyed, only 7 percent did not state a
preference.
The following table compares the
Wran: approval rating up 2 percent

Gallup Polls and the April 1982 state

IF AN ELECTION had been held in
NSW last month, the ALP would have
been returned with a reduced majority.
The approval rating of Neville Wran
was up 2 points to 40 percent while 48
percent (down 4 percent) disapproved
of the way he was handling his job.
Approval of Nick Greiner as leader of
the Opposition was down 2, to 49.
These findings came from interview-
ing 1498 electors throughout NSW in
October. Electors were asked which
party would receive their first pre-
ference “if a State election were being
held today?” Of those surveyed, 6 per-
cent didn’t state their preference.

South Australia
It’s no secret that South Australia
has very tempting business incentives
If you can create employment, broaden our manufacturing base, or produce products for export, we’ll do almost anything to get your
business. Government assistance is available in most States, but there’s one significant difference with our business incentives we tailor
them to suit you.
For example, our Industrial Land and Factory Scheme is totally flexible. There are a number of basic packages
available, ranging from 100% finance to fixed rental agreements.
But your options don’t stop there. We’re open to suggest-
ions and will structure individual packages.
The South Australian Housing Trust co-ordinates this
scheme and arranges everything from design through to construct-
ion and finance. Their brief is to make it possible for business to
relocate with minimal capital outlay in tailor-made buildings that
meet all requirements.
In the past we’ve kept to ourselves and looked after our
own. But now we’re making no secret of the fact that we want to
attract new business to this State.
Government incentives are just one way of tempting you to
consider South Australia.

EDUCATION
School funding
‘needs’ to be
re-assessed
By MICHAEL HOGAN*
THE STATE aid game is a futile one.
Take the response to the latest school
funding guidelines issued by the federal
Schools Commission. The supporters of
private schools expressed some pleasure
over the decisions made while defenders
of public schools forecast doom. The
position last year was almost exactly the
reverse. This is the way the game is
usually played.
Australia has a dual system of educa-
tion. All major political parties agree
that both private and public schools
should receive a share of public funds.
The present government in Canberra
has committed itself to that for the next
eight years. All parties agree that
government funds should be distributed
through the commission, with the gener-
al aim of reducing inequalities among
schoolchildren. In other words, any
government in Canberra will administer
some form of needs policy.
Arguing about the rights and wrongs
of state aid made some sense in the
1860 s or the 1960 s but in the 1980 s it is
pointless. Those matters are settled for
the foreseeable future. Pitting the rights
of state schools against those of in-
dependent schools obscures the fact that
some government schools are quite ex-
cellent while others fall short of an
acceptable standard. Likewise, there are
many excellent independent schools,
while others (usually parish schools) are
struggling with few resources to educate
the children of the poor.
Entrenched pressure groups have
pushed to the background these
questions:
■ What should be the criteria for
deciding which schools are needy? The
main test has been the level of resources
(especially teachers) available to a
school and, for independent schools,
the level of school fees.
Surely a good school is not what
resources go into it but what results
come out of it. Is not a needy school one
which cannot give its students a good
education? The government has ap-
pointed Professor Peter Karmel to chair
a committee to report on “quality of
education” and on ways of relating
funding to some measures of education-
al effectiveness. But how will that com-
mittee define quality of education? Is a
good school one which finds employ-
ment for its ex-students or gets most of
them into university? Or teaches them
to spell correctly or inculcates good
moral values? Let us hope that the
Karmel committee does not investigate
in a vacuum.
■ What should be a reasonable target
of desirable school resources or educa-
tional effectiveness? The first Karmel
committee, in 1973, set targets based
largely on teacher resources. These were
reached in public schools a couple of
years ago. Given the quality of some
public schools in Australia, these were
clearly minimum standards.
This year the Schools Commission
produced a new set of targets based on a
“community standard” of resources. It
is a disappointing effort which merely
spells out an updated version of the
1973 targets. There is little appreciation
of the importance of physical resources
such as playground space or workable
classrooms. There is little attention to

the quality or mobility of teacher
resources, TThere is no attempt to define
targets in terms of what might be
regarded as a good education for
children.
■ Who should determine needs
within state government school systems,
and what criteria should be used? The
commonwealth simply gives a block
grant to state authorities for schools’
recurrent needs. The grant is assessed
on student numbers. Each state is
assumed to be equally needy of com-
monwealth funds. The state government
determines which schools are needy.
■ What about funding Catholic
systems? Some Catholic schools are
assessed for need according to the 12
categories announced this year but most
are “systemic”, controlled and funded
by the diocese and local parishes.
Diocesan school authorities are given
block grants to allocate according to
their criteria. School fees in the Sydney
diocesan system, for example, are
standard for the same level of schooling
whether a child goes to school on the
leafy North Shore or in the deprived
south-western suburbs.
This year’s guidelines to the Schools
Commission have signalled the negotia-
tion of agreements between the com-
monwealth and systemic authorities.
However, since government schools and
Catholic systemic schools use their own
criteria of need, the commission’s
criteria apply to only those 10 percent
of children in the other independent
schools.
■ Is there any future in making
everyday expenditure the main cutting
edge of a needs policy? Just over two-
thirds of all commonwealth school
funds are allocated to general non-
capital grants. This discriminates only
the autonomous independent schools
which educate 10 percent of children
that is, between most of the richer
schools but not among the poorest. A
more specialised program designed for
poorer schools, the Disadvantaged
Schools Program, gets only about 2.5
percent of commonwealth school funds
and can make no long-term impact on
inequality of opportunity. The in-
dependent schools seem to have won,
for the time being at least, their battle to
gain a guaranteed base level per capita
grant. Perhaps it is time to level off all
recurrent grants at the lower level and
use other programs to do something
about inequality.
■ In a competition for pupils be-
tween public and private schools, how
can public schools become more com-
petitive? The argument on levels of
funding has diverted community atten-
tion from a serious discussion of quality
in education and the availability of
freedom of choice within the state
school systems. State authorities gener-
ally have tailored the schools to respond
to demands of their teachers rather than
to the demands of the community. Not
surprisingly, many parents are using
their power of choice to withdraw
children from the state system. For
schools, the answer surely is to respond
to parental demands. Perhaps in-
novative educational solutions can ap-
pease both teachers and parents and
arrest the flow to the private sector.
■ All schools receive funding from
commonwealth and state governments
and are in that sense public schools.
What should be the extent of govern-
ment involvement in schools which
cling to the independent title? For
independent schools this is a problem of
their autonomy; for governments it is a
matter of getting educational and social
value for money. Taxpayers have an
interest in seeing that government and
non-government schools whether for
the rich or for the poor provide a
good education for the generations to
come. □

DIPLOMACY
Lord Casey: Britain’s secret agent
By MICHAEL BIRGAN
SUPPRESSED sections of the
diaries and papers of former
Australian foreign minister
ambassador to the United
States and governor-general
Lord Casey show the extent to
which Australia intervened in
US domestic affairs on
Britain’s behalf to help secure
American entry into World
War 11.
Casey’s diaries, together
with records in the US
National Archives Office and
the Australian Common-
wealth Archives Office, dis-
close that from early 1940,
when Australia first opened
diplomatic relations with the
US, the Menzies government
allowed the British to use the
new legation as a conduit for
covert political activities in-
cluding massive funding of
the pro-war faction in con-
gress and of susceptible jour-
nalists. The British could not
do this because propaganda
activities by belligerents had
been declared illegal by con-
gress. The same law applied to
Australia.
Ostensibly, the principal
role of Australia’s diplomatic presence
in Washington was to raise and improve
Australia’s profile so that the US would
not remain indifferent should Japan
attack Australia.
The US was neutral in 1940 not en-
tering the war until December 7, 1941,
with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
fearing the consequences of British de-
feat, was disposed in 1940 toward giving
the assistance necessary to ensure a
British victory. But he faced a congress
dominated by isolationist Republicans
who wanted no part of the war.
Roosevelt also faced a campaign for re-
election at the end of that year.
In these circumstances, the British
believed that Australia was sufficiently
small to carry out illegal propaganda
and political activities without attract-
ing the attention of American author-
ities or criticism from anti-British sec-
tions of the American press.
(To put matters into perspective,
both Britain and Australia were fighting
for their lives at the time and were
forced to be sanguine about legal
niceties. Also, nazi Germany was

showing few inhibitions about its
support for the Bunds in the USA,
which were quite influential at the time.)
However, Australia’s covert activi-
ties constituted a grave risk to the
Menzies government when the nation
desperately needed American goodwill.
Archive documents from the Australian
External Affairs department show that
the funding of the concerted attempt to
influence American politics was
approved at the highest level in Can-
berra.
The Americans were suspicious of
Australian intentions from the start
even before Richard Casey presented
his credentials as ambassador at the
White House on March 5, 1940.
“So far as the Menzies government is
concerned,” reported the new American
minister in Canberra, P. E. Gauss, to the
State department in January 1941: “I
have no doubt that the principal con-
sideration in the decision to send an
Australian minister to the US was the
desire to obtain aid for Britain and the
empire.”
Today, it remains an article of faith
with the Australian left that US intelli-
gence agencies played a role
in the downfall of the
Whitlam government in 1975.
Such underhand intervention
does not help cement alli-
ances, especially if it becomes
known to the public. Perhaps
it is for this reason that the
Australian Security In-
telligence Organisation,
vetters of the Casey diaries,
have restricted sections about
our ANZUS ally. The censor-
ing was not intended by Casey
when he bequeathed the diar-
ies to the National Library.
The late statesman was an
avid and methodical diary-
keeper. It is clear from his
correspondence and cables to
Prime Minister Menzies and
to the then External Affairs
minister, John McEwen, that
Casey intended his 1940 diar-
ies to be much more than a
record of his achievements.
Casey’s diary also was his
work-book. Much of what he
wrote in it at night turned up
in official communications to
Canberra the next day. While
key documents remain
restricted, at least one throws
light on the extent of the propaganda
plan.
In a cable to McEwen dated March
11, 1940, Casey urged establishment of a
Commonwealth Bank branch in New
York. It would be “yet another
Australian information office in the
United States that could circumvent the
propaganda legislation.”
“Wherever possible,” he advised,
“the hand of the Department of Infor-
mation should be invisible, in favor of
the private and unofficial medium.”
Casey was a skilled and enthusiastic
practitioner of the “private” and “un-
official.”
He roved the American mainland in
his private aircraft, stressing Australia’s
affluence, investment potential, racial
purity and common heritage with the
US.
Casey told The New York Herald-
Tribune that, if ever the US had any
trouble from Japan, it could count on
Australia. The unexpurgated sections of
his diaries help reveal his breadth of
contacts and acceptance in high coun-
cils.
He numbered the influential Ameri-


Allied leaders Churchill and Roosevelt (seated) with war strategy conference team: Washington, 1943
can columnist Walter Lippmann among
friends and dined regularly with the edi-
tors of America’s most important
newspapers. He also was in almost daily
contact with the British ambassador,
Lord Lothian.
While overseeing efforts to strength-
en the pro-war camp in the US, Casey
was tactful. On the war with Germany,
Casey stressed in one newspaper inter-
view that he had “not come to this
country in order to tell Americans what
they should think.”
Nevertheless, he was scathing in his
reports to Canberra about the isolation-
ists. The chairman of the US Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Senator
Borah who was responsible for
coining the term “the phoney war” to
describe the first months of engagement
Director-general of Information Sir Keith Murdoch: rivalry with Casey
in Europe was described by Casey as
“small-minded, provincial, without any
conception of the issues involved or
their implications for the future of man-
kind.”
Borah, Casey noted in a letter to
McEwen, “is one of the really evil
influences of our times.”
Despite the rosy picture painted by
Casey of his activities both in
despatches home and in his diaries
the available US State department ar-
chives reveal Washington’s suspicions
of Australia’s motives. While recognis-
ing that Australia had good reason for
courting the US, ambassador Gauss in
Canberra expressed doubts as to
whether Australia had the good sense to
go about it the right way. He wrote to
the Secretary of State: “Their pre-
ference for Britain seems at times even
to transcend considerations of basic
Australian interests.”
Gauss appears to have fallen quickly
upon details of Australia’s propaganda
plans on behalf of Britain in America.
The Canberra legation re-iterated in
February 1940 its warning to
Washington that “Australia had exten-
sive and expensive plans for pro-
paganda in the US and that, under the
present government, these will be on
behalf of the British Empire.”
Gauss instructed all American con-
sular offices in Australia to supply the
legation with a list of the names and
“other particulars” of prominent Aus-


Casey welcomes Prime Minister Menzies to New York, 1941

tralians seeking to travel to the US “to
identify, if possible, persons likely to be
going to the US in connection with the
Australian propaganda movement.”
The Americans were aware that the
Department of Information, from June
1940 controlled by Sir Keith Murdoch
as director-general, was intimately
involved in what Gauss termed: “the
Australian propaganda movement.”
Murdoch, friend of the proprietors of
The Times and the Daily Mail in Lon-
don, also had significant North Ameri-
can contacts.
He had founded the Australia-Am-
erican Association in the US. In many
respects, Casey and Murdoch were
public rivals.
In the latter half of 1940, Gauss was
able to supply the State department with
a list of individuals carrying out covert
operations from Casey’s legation.
Whether this list included American
recipients of British propaganda funds
is not clear.
The complete list is not available for
inspection in the US archives. Its
existence is known because of re-
ferences to it by Gauss.
Publication of the list could have led
to a major scandal, possibly endanger-
ing Roosevelt’s re-election campaign.
Casey’s communications with Can-
berra suggest that he suspected
Murdoch might have been in some way
responsible for the disclosure to Gauss.
Casey’s antipathy toward Murdoch re-
mained with him after the war. Describ-
ing a 1949 boardroom lunch at the Mel-
bourne Herald, Casey noted that
Murdoch was “at his most irritating
the faux bon homme cutting across
other people’s conversation, trying to
suck people’s brains whilst having
nothing except the most amateurish and
obvious views himself.”
Whoever disclosed the active partici-
pants in the plan, the source was clearly
in Australia. Gauss suggested that it
might be a good time to squeeze a few
concessions from Australians, such as
landing rights for trans-Pacific commer-
cial flights.
Australia’s diplomatic duplicity on
Britain’s behalf must have been all the
more perplexing to the Roosevelt ad-
ministration because it knew in 1940
that Australia, along with the rest of the
Far East, already had been secretly
declared expendable by the British. As
early as 1937, British naval planners
agreed with American counterparts that
in the event of a war against Germany,
Italy and Japan, Britain and America
would concentrate their main efforts on
the European front. This grand strategy,
known as “Beat Hitler First,” proposed
that the US Pacific fleet move into the
Atlantic and leave minimal forces to
stem a Japanese advance.
The grand strategy had become ac-
cepted at the highest levels in London
and Washington by 1940. Japanese
spies also had reported it to Tokyo.
Canberra remained blissfully unaware
relying, apart from a small legation in
China, on representation by the British
Foreign Office throughout the world.
In 1940, while the British were secret-
ly telling Washington that they could
not or would not send a substantial
naval force against Japan, Churchill
was re-assuring Canberra that they
would “cut their losses in the Mediter-
ranean and speed to Australia’s de-
fence” in the event of Japan entering the
war.
Churchill cabled Menzies in June
1940, after Australia had despatched
half its fighting fleet to help Britain: “It
is only to the untrained eye that Austra-
lia has been denuded of naval de-
fences.”
The Menzies government had been
led to participate in the clumsy attempt
to manipulate American public opinion
by abusing Australia’s fresh diplomatic
presence in the US, thereby risking rela-
tions with our only possible alternative
protector in a war against Japan, not
simply because Menzies believed
Churchill’s assurances but because the
Australians had to believe them.
Ironically, if the plan to bring the
Americans into the war earlier had suc-
ceeded, there would have been less se-
curity for Australia because the Pa-
cific fleet would have departed for the
Atlantic.
Gauss’s analysis of Australia’s covert
activities did not result in reprisals be-
cause Roosevelt besieged as he was by
isolationists was carefully plotting the
path of support for Britain.
It was an inauspicious beginning
for Australian-American diplomacy,
risking so much American trust and
goodwill. Perhaps it is because it sets
such a dangerous and unfortunate pre-
cedent for relations between the two
countries that the sensitive sections of
the diaries of one of our foremost diplo-
mats continue to remain secret after 40
years. □
Film for
Australian
Constitutional
Convention
Expressions of interest are invited from
film makers to produce a 30-minute
film for the Australian Constitutional
Convention on the work of the
Convention.
The film will need to place considerable
emphasis on:
• the Constitution and its place in
the system of Government
• the work of the Convention particu-
larly as a force for constitutional
change
• the role of the electorate in
referenda.
The film will be directed towards late
secondary and tertiary students and
other groups as a discussion-starter. It
should be able to be shown in seg-
ments. Within these parameters, and
within a budget of $BO,OOO, preference
will be given to creative, perceptive
and imaginative treatment of the
subject.
Further information as to the project
can be obtained from the Convention’s
Chief Executive Officer, Mr J. C.
Finemore on (03) 67-7240.
Three successful applicants will be
selected and further invited to submit
more detailed treatment. There will be
financial assistance to help defray ex-
penses forthose successful applicants.
Applications should be forwarded to
the:
Australian
Constitutional Convention,
15th Floor, 200 Queen Street,
Melbourne 3000.
to reach the Convention
by December 7, 1984.

MOTORING
Serious drivers
don’t need to
play with toys
America’s Dodge Daytona Turbo takes the sound system to extremes ...
By PETER WHERRETT
IN THE EARLY 19605, the sheer
grossness of American cars caused
many of them to bear the unofficial title
“lounge-room on wheels.” Some could
carry up to eight people in a degree of
comfort not far removed from a lounge
chair or sofa. To enhance this plushness,
the cars were suspended on huge soft-
riding springs which made them wallow
about more like small ships than land-
operated craft.
In time, such cars provoked ques-
tions about the self-indul-
gence they provided. They
were substantial consumers of
valuable and irreplaceable
raw materials for a start but,
as consumer activist Ralph
Nader was at considerable
pains to point out, many of
them also were unsafe.
And so, slowly, like the
dinosaurs, they began to dis-
appear.
But man has a penchant
for self-indulgence, so, while
the cars grew smaller and
more efficient, their creature
comforts began to increase. It
was some sort of perverse
compensation that luxury
should give way to luxury.
Cars became more like cars
but not much less like lounge-
rooms on wheels.
If, for example, a feature
of your living room happened to be a
four-speaker hi-fi radio/tape deck
system with graphic equalisers you
could have a similar system in your car.
It was impractical to include a record
turntable as part of such a system but
laser disc systems have made that poss-
ible, too, although the automobile is not
nearly as efficient a sound lounge as is
the living-room and much of the equip-
ment is wasted in terms of sound levels
and reproduction quality.
Excessive noise in an automobile
makes it impossible to hear surrounding
traffic noises (including sirens) and
therefore degrades driver performance.
Seeking a radio station or changing a
tape or disc is distracting.
Once, cars had side-curtains and
then glass which could be wound up
and down with not much more than the
flick of a wrist. Lazy, self-indulgent man
has requested that he be relieved of the
irksome task of winding
windows. Electricity does it
for him.
Failure of such electricity
might make it difficult for
either driver or passengers to
get out of the car in an
emergency, such as driving off
a bridge into water. Imagine a
collision which has isolated
the battery and injured one or
more of the occupants. How
does one get people out of the
car in such circumstances,
bearing in mind that a car
with power windows almost
certainly will also have central
locking electrically operated?
Do we really need the
luxury of automatic chokes
which often malfunction and
add to servicing costs? Is it
really so tiresome to have to
lean down in the mornings
and pull an insignificant button about
30 millimetres and then push it back in
some three to five minutes later?
Is it really so difficult to get out of the
car and unlock the boot lid or tailgate
with a key? All a thief needs to do to
gain access to that sometimes precious
storage area is break the driver’s side
window and lift the same button which
makes it so easy for the owner.
Are on-board computers which
monitor fuel consumption really essen-
tial? Most people I know who have such
an item fitted thought it a great idea
when they first saw it and have hardly
pressed a button since.
How about some plain cars, driver-
operated, which cost less to buy and less
to run and simply take us from point A
to point B safely? How about some
serious effort on ride, handling, steering
and braking? Playing with toys is not a
job for the serious driver. □

TRADE UNIONS
The BLF looks
to life
after Norm
By DEBORAH HOPE
STEVE BLACK, New South Wales
Builders Laborers’ Federation secretary,
was talking slow and tough about the
union’s brawl with the State govern-
ment and the rest of NSW’s trade union
movement. If attacked, the union would
defend itself.
But Black’s drawl can be deceptive.
The 31-year-old secretary is surprisingly
articulate. As head of the largest branch
of the union with a strong following
of 10,500 members, a third of national
membership Black now is being
described as heir-apparent to federal
secretary Norm Gallagher.
Charges against Gallagher from
the Winneke royal commission into the
federation are due to be heard in
February and his hold on the leadership
a sensitive point.
NSW Labor Council secretary John
Macßean was surprised last week to
receive a letter from Gallagher assuring
him that he would be standing for
another term as general secretary. The
letter referred to a report on the BLF
published last month in the Industrial
Relations and Management Letter, a
Victorian news-sheet.
Gallagher: “The report . . . contains
one major inaccuracy. It stated that I
will not stand for another term as
general secretary due to health reasons.
I can assure you that I will stand for
another term as general secretary and I
am confident that once again I will be
re-elected by the membership of this
union.”
Black won the position of BLF
secretary in NSW seven year ago, aged
24. The six years before that he worked
as a builders laborer. His swarthy ap-
pearance (shoulder-length dark hair
and Zapata moustache) and denims are
unusual garb for a union boss. Black’s
face is virtually unknown outside build-
ing sites but that may not be the case for
long. Recently, he has shown an un-
characteristic disposition to give in-
terviews.
His small, stark office is in room 34
on the first floor of the Dickensian
Trades Hall in Goulburn Street, near
Sydney’s Chinatown. The reception
area, reflecting Gallagher’s Maoist
leanings, is equipped with yellowing
copies of the Beijing Review. He is well-
schooled in the Gallagher art of
bludgeoning employers until they give
in to BLF demands.
Black denies any suggestion of a
power struggle in the union. “All I can
say is that people have to weigh up the
facts for themselves. Where such a
suggestion would come from when the
industry has settled down I’m blowed if
I know.”
He rejects discussion of his ambi-
tions. “I haven’t really thought about it.
I don’t want to be bumped into parlia-
ment or anything like that,” he said last
week.
Such a prospect is unlikely. The
NSW government last month in-
troduced legislation to de-register the
BLF in the state accusing it of using
violent and intimidatory tactics. It’s a
move Black is determined to overthrow.
“The BLF will not be taking that sort
of thing lying down. If attacked, we will
Steve Black: possible successor to Gallagher
ROBERT DORAN
defend ourselves,” he said. This would
mean job stoppages and demonstrations
around NSW until the legislation was
repealed.
“Now, if they want to jeopardise the
peace in the industry, that’s the way to
go about it. It’s ludicrous for (NSW
Premier Neville) Wran, a Labor leader
who says he’s interested in recovery and
getting the state going, to be doing these
things at the same time.”
Black claims the long-running dis-
pute over work at the new police
headquarters site in Sydney’s Goulburn
Street has more to do with a grab for
members by the BLF’s rival, the Build-
ing Workers’ Industrial Union than
with a power grab within the BLF.
According to Black, the BWIU, along
with the NSW Labor Council, has
obstructed BLF efforts to settle the
dispute. The BWIU claims that its
members will not work alongside
people who use violence and intimida-
tion against other workers.
Black: “There was a continuous
police presence at the police site - riot
squad, the lot. No one was injured or
arrested on the picket line; I think that
proves all this has been built up into
something like a storm in a tea cup.”
A police task force set up by the
government is investigating the BLF’s
activities and allegations that builders
pay BLF members picketing other
employers’ sites.
While the NSW government is deter-
mined to destroy the union, this is
unlikely to be a very effective move
without the support of the Australian
Council of Trade Unions, and the
Victorian and federal governments
support that has not been forthcoming,
According to Black, only about 100
NSW members work under state
awards.
A more important issue, he
said, was builders’ avoidance
of safety regulations. Three
BLF members had died on
building sites in the past six
weeks. “If people want to talk
about violence, what about
people getting killed in the
industry? Surely there’s no
more violence than families
losing their breadwinners,” he
said.
Black recently led a
demonstration of 2500 BLF
members to the office of NSW
Industrial Relations minister
Pat Hills to protest over
safety. He is jubilant that sev-
eral building inspectors in the
department are under investi-
gation following BLF claims
about corruption over adher-
ence to safety regulations.
“John Macßean and the
BWIU haven’t got all the
support they say they have. Reports
from rank and file members of other
unions have come to us that they’re not
too happy about it all, because the
majority know that the BLF’s the one
that’s done all the fighting in the in-
dustry. Action over asbestos, compensa-
tion, all those things.”
According to Black the union is
seeking an independent arbiter to
resolve the dispute. The ACTU ruling to
ban seven BLF members from the site
had been made in the knowledge that
the union would boycott the plan. Black
said he believed the ACTU officer in
question opposed the BLF.
Black is not the national BLF’s
bright boy. That title, industrial ob-
servers say, belongs to the union’s ACT
secretary, Charlie O’Dea. As a potential
leader of the BLF, however, O’Dea has
the disadvantage of ruling a smaller
branch. The most likely result, should
anything happen to force Gallagher’s
retirement, is a joint charge at the
leadership by Black and O’Dea. □

ART
The rich art of the dreamtime
Rock paintings at Waniliri, Gibb River, north-western Australia
By WILLA McDONALD
SWIRLS OF white on red. Serpents,
Spirits. Black-edged turtles. Intricate
symbols on bark, stone or string,
Australia s Living Heritage (Lansdowne
Press, $39.95) is Jennifer Isaacs’ latest
book - a discussion and pictorial ex-
travaganza of all aspects of Aboriginal
art from ancient fingerprints set in the
soft limestone walls of Koonalda Cave
beneath the Nullabor Plain, through the
finely woven and colorful dilly bags
used for food gathering, to the carved
funeral poles of the Tiwi people of
Bathurst and Melville islands.
Isaacs wrote the book to show
Aboriginal art as more than the familiar
paintings of Arnhem Land and “not just
‘Oceanic Art’, the last chapter in a series
of 13 in a book on world art.”
Illustrated with photographs by Reg
Morrison, it explains the symbiotic con-
nection of the art to the environment
the interweaving of the need to survive
in a harsh land with a rich culture that


preserves water, food and landscape.
The link between ancestral heroes and
the land is the basis of all Aboriginal
traditional art and is expressed in
dance, song, ceremony and material arts
constantly connecting the life of the
people to the dreaming.
Chapters deal separately with body
painting, fibre craft, rock engravings,
rock painting, bark painting, carved
weapons and utensils and sculpture.
The cultural importance of each art
form and the techniques used such as
spinning, dying and weaving are
discussed in detail.
Religious rituals are referred to but,
of course, not described.
The distinction is made between art
in daily life (clothing, headbands,
necklaces and pendants, utensils, bags,
mats, fishing nets) and ceremonial art
(body decoration, ground designs,
emblems and sculpture), although there
is no separation between art and craft in
Aboriginal society.
Traditionally, no one was regarded
as “an artist.” All adults were expected
to remember and reproduce the clan
designs appropriate to their level of
training and knowledge of sacred
secrets. Nor was there community of art
between men and women they had
separate but parallel art forms such as
the spinning and weaving of dilly bags
by women and the weaving of fishing
nets by men.
The book deals with modern tribal
art as well as with the ancient, such as
the necklace made from 170 Tasmanian
devil teeth which was discovered with
traces of a man’s skeleton in Lake
Nitchie in western New South Wales
and is thought to be about 6000 years
old. Such discoveries are rare because
so little Aboriginal art was intended to
be permanent. Its importance for
Aborigines is in the act of creating,
when the spirit power is activated.
Isaacs spent a year travelling
Australia to collect the information.
Working with 10 Aboriginal groups, she


Children at Mount Liebig wearing paint and seed decorations to perform traditional songs and dances
took part in expeditions to find dyes
and materials. She hunted for food
when necessary and learned craft
techniques at first hand.
She learned to be patient and to take
whatever the Aborigines wished to teach
her. “If I was disappointed because they
said, ‘No, we are not looking for dyes;
we are going to the beach for a picnic
that day,’ I would always be shown
something wonderful.”
A further six months passed in
waiting for approval for each section of
the book, including photographs, by the
Aboriginal groups involved. Photo-
graphs of people who have died may
not be included because they may keep
the spirit around the living, particularly
close relatives.
Time eases the problem if a book is
published and someone pictured inside
dies. “Careful people in Aboriginal
communities tend to seal the pages of
old books which include pictures of the
deceased, to stop the conjuring up of the
person’s being,” said Isaacs.
Her close work with Aborigines led
to the adoption of Isaacs and her family
by the Rirratjingu people of eastern
Arnhem Land and the Thanaquith of
Cape York. She was adopted by the
Rirratjingu years ago when, as personal
assistant to Dr H. C. (“Nugget”)
Coombs, she worked with the tribe
helping to formulate the first land rights
case (which they lost),
“It’s very common for people who
have for any length of time worked with
Aborigines to be given a title of family
member. There are strict and important
taboos in terms of behaviour which
make it necessary,” she said.

She first became involved with Ab-
origines and their art in 1969, as an
officer with the government forerunner
of the Aboriginal Arts Board: “At 24, I
was travelling around the country one
week in two.”
Her training was in Anthropology
and History at Sydney University,
combined with art school classes. She
moved into arts administration after a
stint as counsellor to Asian students.
She has been working freelance as a
consultant, lecturer and author since
1973. She has curated international
touring exhibitions and written articles
and catalogues on Aboriginal art for the
Aboriginal Arts Board.
Isaacs spent three years with her
family in Africa and England. She
studied Nigerian art at the Institute of
African Studies after taking a group of
Aboriginal musicians to play at African
universities. She collected pottery and
textiles there before travelling to Britain
where she ran a commercial pottery.
She convenes adult education classes
in Aboriginal culture, given by
Aboriginal speakers. Isaacs is also a
member of Redress Press, a women’s
publishing company which has put out
two novels and two volumes of poetry.
Her most successful book is
Australian Dreaming 40,000 years of
Aboriginal History , which is used in
schools to teach Aboriginal studies and
has been accepted by the NSW
Aboriginal Education Consultative
Group.
On a recent trip to Bathurst Island,
Isaacs visited the small Catholic mission
school. The school kept three copies of
her book one locked away, one on the


The huge Wandjina Rowalumbin rock painting at Napier in north-western Australia
Carved and painted ironwood figures by Declan Apuatimi of Bathurst Island
shelf and the third tied to a stand in the
centre of the room. That third one was
so well-thumbed by Aboriginal children
that it had lost its cover and pages hung
in tatters. Isaacs was delighted.
Her new book demonstrates the
changing nature of Aboriginal Art
varying with clans, tribes, the style of
the individual artist, dreams, important
events within the society, materials
available and the commercial exigencies
of the market.
Aboriginal art has gained in accept-
ance in the mainstream art world in the
past 10 years. It is shown in galleries
rather than in museums or private
collections. Art has become a major
source of income for many groups who
barter paintings and carvings in return
for sugar, tea, transistor radios and
washing powder. “That produces
change because what we want deter-
mines what prices we pay. A buyer
might say, ‘I want larger barks or flatter
barks or X-ray kangaroos,’ ” said
Isaacs.
Availability of materials affects style.
Greyish-blue recently appeared in cen-
tral Arnhem Land string and pandanus
weaving. The color was traced to the
new practice of boiling cardboard
cartons covered with blue lettering.
Similarly, there was a flurry of in-
terest about 30 years ago when blue X-
ray rock paintings were discovered in
the Kakadu National Park. The
“remarkable and unique blue pigment”
turned out to be Reckitt’s Blue, taken
from the laundry of friendly Europeans
at the next settlement.
Making dyes by boiling plants and
other materials is itself new for
Aborigines.
Without pottery or metals, they had
no pots for boiling until Europeans
came. Much of the color was applied by
painting or rubbing woven string
through ochred hands.
Traditional styles are sometimes kept
up because it is what Aborigines think
buyers want; where modern materials
are used, buyers may not think the
product to be genuine. Yet, says Isaacs,
“it may be an old man who was painting
his dreaming.”
The result is that whole groups paint,
for example, only rainbow serpents for
sale. “Now the buyer complains he can’t
get them to paint anything else but
rainbow serpents.”
Isaacs’ book shows that, despite style
changes, the importance of the land in
Aboriginal art remains constant.
“Whether it’s body painting, bark paint-
ing, Papunya painting all the abstract
patterns represent different parts of the
landscape ... It’s fundamental because
the art is all about the land, the
ownership of the land and their link to
the ancestors who physically made the
land their own.” □

The new marathon challenge
By GLENNYS BELL
AT THE Chicago marathon last
month, Welshman Steve Jones ran
13 seconds faster than Robert de
Castella’s fastest time set in
December 1981 to win in a new
world record of two hours, eight
minutes and five seconds.
It was a fast race right from the
beginning, as de Castella points out:
“Jones would never have been able
to set a world record and set such
fast times in the last part of the race
if the first part had not been very
fast as well.” He was surprised that
Jones ran so fast, mainly because
he is relatively inexperienced at
marathons, but de Castella adds
that Jones showed great courage in
doing so.
Despite the time set and the pace
of the last few kilometres, de
Castella is not planning to change
his training strategy or tactics. Nor
does he believe that the Chicago
event will have a major effect on
marathon running. Changes have
been occurring in both the runners
and the race for at least a decade, as de
Castella explains: “In the old days, it
was an endurance event. It was almost a
case where the last man left standing
de Castella: all marathons will be close and fast
was the one who won. Today, the
athletes who run in marathons are so
motivated, it’s no longer an endurance
event but a competitive race.
UPI
Steve Jones winning the recent Chicago marathon in world record time
“The athletes are more pro-
fessional, they have more time to
train, they have improved the
standard of the sport,” he continues.
“I think it’s the case now that all
marathons will be close and very
fast because the standard of runners
is so high and their ability so deep.
“It’s unusual for one runner now
to go so far ahead of the field as
Jones did but, then, competition
brings out the best in people.”
The Chicago marathon did not
have the same significance to de
Castella as this year’s Olympics
where finishing as well as possible,
rather than in record time, was more
important or the prestige of a
world championship, such as that at
Rotterdam which he won.
De Castella probably will not
run a marathon again until at least
April next year and he says that the
idea that everyone competing will
be aiming toward that new world
record does not frighten him. On the
contrary: “It’s one of the challenges.
Marathon running is unpredictable and
you have to be able to adapt to any
situation.” □

miles 385 yards faster than any man in
history. In doing so he beat 1984
Olympic champion Carlos Lopes and
world champion Rob de Castella with
the most decisive, sustained burst of
speed, tempo and power that I have
witnessed.
His time of two hours, eight minutes,
five seconds knocks eight seconds off
Alberto Salazar’s world best set in New
York in 1981. And Jones beat the
Olympic champion by 61 seconds and
the world champion by 64 seconds. Yet
he still does not consider himself a
marathon runner!
Since it was his first complete
marathon (he started last year in
Chicago but had to drop out at 16 miles
with an ankle injury) his tactics were
simple: “The marathon runners tell me
that the race does not begin until 20
miles (32 km), so my plan was to stick
with the leading group until 20 miles
and then start racing.”
When he did start racing, the world’s
best marathon runners could not keep
up. And no wonder: he covered the last
six miles at an average pace of four
minutes 44.8 seconds each!
In doing so, he projected himself
into a new world. He has become the
hottest property in the hottest area of
athletics road racing. Jones’ “par-
ticipation money” for winning was
£29,100 (about $42,000) plus £B3OO
($12,000) for a course record plus
£41,600 ($60,000) for his world record.
It will all go into a trust fund under the
control of the British Amateur Athletics
Board and Steve will be allowed to
draw from it for housing, transport,
food and medical expenses.
Not since the days of Aircraftman
Shaw, alias Lawrence of Arabia, has
there been a more famous and now
more wealthy member of the non-
commissioned ranks of the RAF.
Aircraftman Shaw had great trouble
handling his fame. Corporal Jones
should have no such trouble because he
is a man secure unto himself, firm in his
ambitions, anchored in his family and
in common sense.
He comes from the valleys of South
Wales from Ebbw Vale. His late
father was employed in the steelworks
which are dead. But the spirit of the
people of that valley will never die.
They came to it in the last century from
the hills and they dug into the earth to
enrich the coal masters and grew close
in their hardships. They sent men such
as Nye Bevan out into the world to fight
for the respect and the rewards that they
knew were due to them.
That is where Steve Jones was born,
bred and made aware.
He left school at 15, took a pre-
industrial training course for one year
and then served as a sewing machine
mechanic in one of the new factories in

Experts say there is
nothing easier than
making cognac, all one
needs is a father, a
grandfather and a great
grandfather to have made
it before you. At Camus,
four generations of our
family have been doing
this for over a century.
Today. Camus

enjoys an international
reputation as cognac of
the highest quality..and
every step of the
production process is still
supervised by a Camus.
One of our most
critical steps is the aging
and blending of cognacs from the various districts
of the cognac region to create a finished product
with the desired characteristics.
The art of tasting is of utmost importance and
tradition demands that it be carried out solely by
a member of the family. We use a blue tinted
snifter to eliminate the influence of colour on our
perception of taste, thereby allowing us to focus
on the bouquet, smoothness, delicacy and
robustness of a particular blend. Only in this
way can we ensure that
each bottle of Camus has
the perfect balance of
properly aged cognacs.
This is why to
connoisseurs around the
world, cognac is Camus.

the valley a factory that
made bras and girdles. After
two and a half years, he found
no satisfaction in the work
and so Steve signed on for 11
years when a RAF careers
information caravan came to
Ebbw Vale.
Because the forces provide
“sport for all,” he formed an
ambition to run for the air
force.
There was no sporting
background in his family and
little indication during his
school days of any real talent.
All he had done was to run
occasionally when a cadet in
the Air Training Corps. His
training had consisted of no
more than a few 30-minute
jogs but he had enjoyed
running and, when he was
posted to RAF Lyneham, he
managed to get into the station’s B
team.
“I set myself little targets next
week I would try to beat a couple of
guys in front. There are always targets
in athletics, at whatever level you com-
pete, but I didn’t think I could ever
reach international standard.”
He should have done so in 1976.
World cross-country championships
de Castella (front) in the Chicago marathon
were staged in Wales, at Chepstow
and each nation was allowed to
nominate nine runners plus reserves.
Steve finished seventh in the Welsh
cross-country championships but, as a
newcomer, was not selected. Instead, he
had to watch while Lopes then
“unknown” won the world senior title
and America’s Tom Hunt took the
junior title.
“That,” .says Jones, “was a
driving inspiration. I said to
myself, ‘From now on, they
are going to have to select
me’.”
He won the Welsh champ-
ionships in 1977 and they had
to select him. He finished
103rd in the world champ-
ionships in Dusseldorf,
Germany. Seven years later,
little target after little target,
he was third in the world
cross-country championships
in New York last March.
If cross-country was his
first love, track was his
second. He has been a reliable
figure on the track since 1978,
always ready to do his share
of the pacemaking, always in
the Welsh team, most often in
the British team. But his track
performances have never set
me alight. He has always seemed to be
the journeyman but never the star.
His problem has been speed that
essential quality which has made Coe
and Ovett and Cram' into the most
exciting athletes on the world’s stage.
And Steve has known it.
His plan for 1985 was to drop down
from 10,000 m races to 5000 m and “to
work on my basic speed. Now, things

may not be as simple as that I’ve got
to re-assess my whole situation.”
And so he has. The leg speed that
was lacking to enable him to reach into
Olympic medal class on the track is
more than enough for the marathon. As
he says: “Leg speed is what a lot of these
marathon runners haven’t got.”
But there is more to the marathon
than leg speed. There is also an intensity
of mind the ability to concentrate
without any lapse for more than two
hours. Steve lost that concentration for
only a moment in Chicago and then
“because I could see the finish. I so
nearly let it slip,” he said.
Two miles from the finish, when he
was heading for an historic break-
through, we dropped the lead car back
alongside him and over the bristling
array of cameras we shouted: “Keep
this tempo ... keep this tempo and the
world record is yours.”
He gave a little nod, although the
pace was making his whole body suffer.
But he thought of all those five-minute
bursts in training and said to himself,
“Just put another one in.” And he did
and the message in the fortune cookie
came true. □
THE PROFESSIONS
A long fight for
recognition of
overseas skills
By WILLA McDONALD
A VETERINARY surgeon of high
standing overseas migrated to Australia
and settled in Queensland. His skills are
so highly regarded by the University of
Queensland that he has been given a
teaching post. Yet, he is not allowed to
practise as a vet; the state’s registration
board will not recognise his qualifica-
tions until he sits for further tests.
According to Norman Hoffman, act-
ing executive director of the newly set-
up federal Council on Overseas Pro-
fessional Qualifications (replacing the
committee of the same name), veterin-
ary surgeons are one group particularly
wary of allowing people qualified over-
seas to come to Australia and compete
for jobs.
Job security, racism and a sometimes
justified fear of incompetence are the
main reasons that so few foreign educa-
tional qualifications are recognised in
Australia. The restrictions affect not
only migrants but all Australians who
are then deprived of an array of skills
and experience. More specifically, Aus-
tralian-born people have been dis-

JEAN-PAUL FERRARO
advantaged when courses they have
studied overseas, have not been
recognised here regardless of the level
of skill achieved by the graduate.
It is only since the former committee
(which dealt with 10,000 cases needing
individual assessment each year) was set
up 15 years ago that moves have been
made toward more equitable recogni-
tion. Progress has been slow, mainly be-
cause recognition of qualifications is the
responsibility of many organisations
from state registration boards to un-
iversities. Requirements are not un-
iform and recommendations made by
the committee did not have the force of
law.
The discrepancies between states are
puzzling and frustrating. It is easier, for
example, for pharmacists from Singa-
pore or New Zealand to gain recogni-
tion in Victoria than it is for those from
New South Wales.
In one case dealt with by the com-
mittee, a man was invited to take the
post of assistant director of nursing at a
hospital in the Australian Capital Terri-
tory. He had originally gained his quali-
fications overseas and had spent 12
years in practice in Victoria. He was un-
able to accept the ACT position without
going through all the procedures neces-
sary for someone newly qualified.
Following the findings of a commit-
tee of inquiry into the recognition of
overseas qualifications which was
headed by Ron Fry, retired executive
director of the Metal Trades Industry
Association of Australia, the Committee
on Overseas Professional Qualifications
was disbanded and replaced by the
council which has greater powers.
Hoffman warned that despite the
changes the council still has
no legislative back-up for its
recommendations and would
have to rely on reputation to
persuade individual bodies to
follow its proposals.
The arbitrariness of the
system is demonstrated by the
fact that, traditionally, people
with tertiary qualifications
from the United Kingdom
have no difficulty being ac-
cepted here. (Unless, as with a
recent case which came before
the committee, the qualifica-
tions were obtained from the
University of North West
London, the London College
of Applied Science and the
Sussex College of Technology
none of which exist.
Hoffman also told of being
contacted recently by the
German equivalent of the
council, which wanted to
check the qualifications of a
man who claimed to have a
doctorate of divinity from the
University of Saint Bartholomew,
Oodnadatta, Southern Australia.)
But often graduates even from pres-
tigious American universities cannot
gain recognition here. The council
claims it is not trying to sacrifice com-
petence to a notion of fairness. “We are
not trying to reduce standards to make
them fit the qualifications,” said
Hoffman. “What we are trying to do is
make an objective assessment of
qualifications that will fit the
standards.”
The first Philippines-trained doctor
recently was allowed to practise here.
Medical courses in the Philippines are
not regarded as being adequate but this
man had developed the necessary skills
on his own behalf and passed stringent
Australian exams.
Expert panels have been set up for
some professions which set guidelines
for the recognition of qualifications,
deal with the more difficult cases indi-
vidually and hear appeals.
Most professions now have exams
which applicants must pass to be recog-
nised. One problem is that exams for
medicine are aimed at testing whether
people are fit for general practice
whereas a successful and highly
qualified specialist in another country
may have forgotten the knowledge
needed for that.
The committee has been approached
by a Mexican surgeon, married to an
Australian, who wants to practise his
specialty here. He has passed the first
two components of the exam (English
and the multiple choice of theory) but
failed the clinical four times although
going close to the pass mark.

will enable it to help applicants such as
the Mexican surgeon. For example, it
can now set up bridging courses to help
them pass the exams. Until now, appli-
cants sat the exams “cold” there was
no way for them to get help without re-
sitting a whole degree or diploma.
But the new powers still are not
enough in some cases. The Australian
Society of Accountants and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants are willing to
allow migrants to undertake further
study and practical experience in Aus-
tralia after which they will be given full
recognition but will not give provisional
recognition to let applicants into the
country to do this.
More co-operation with the council
is obviously needed. “The new council
has only had one meeting,” said
Hoffman. “It’s ludicrous to suggest it
can change the world overnight.” □
DEFENCE
A plan to
pluck fighters
from the air
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
IF, FOR the Royal Australian Navy, an
aircraft carrier is pie in the sky, would
the admirals settle for a Skyhook?
A British Aerospace engineer, Fred
Hefford, has briefed Australian defence
brass on just such a project. The brass is
likely to take it very seriously and begin
local studies of the concept.
Skyhook was developed by the Brit-
ish manufacturer Dowty Boulton Paul,
which is mainly a supplier of aircraft
accessories and defence systems. Here’s
how it works:
Imagine a long, articulated arm like
the one on the Space Shuttle or, coming
down to earth, the familiar cherry
picker that electricity linesmen use.
Instead of a platform at the end of
the jointed assembly there is a robot
head with a claw device that can grab a
hovering aeroplane. So far the only suit-
able candidate is the Harrier and its de-
rivatives, which is why British
Aerospace, the UK manufacturer, is
taking the initiative to brief potential
users.
Skyhook and the Harrier go, so as to
speak, hand in hand. In operation at sea
the Skyhook is deployed from each side
of a ship (which can be as small as 4500
tonnes). Instead of making a landing on
the deck, the Harrier eases alongside the
host ship and goes into a hover, exactly
within a “box” of about 30 cubic metres
of airpsace.
Skyhook’s robot head then focuses
on a strongpoint on top of the Harrier’s
fuselage and, correcting itself as the ship
pitches and rolls, grabs the plane in
mid-air. With the Harrier held securely,
the load is transferred to a projecting
platform below the main deck where the
plane can be serviced and stored.
For launching, the procedure is re-
versed. The Harrier is rolled out on the
platform, picked up, starts its engines
clear of the ship, begins a hover and
then is released into free flight.
The concept came about when engin-
eers examined the Harrier to discuss
ways of lightening it to improve its
payload and range. They decided the
undercarriage could be disposed of for
a major saving and came up with
Skyhook for launch and recovery.
The first intention was to use it on
land. The Harrier, could launch off a
trolley, as the Australian Jindivik does,
then be recovered at the end of the
mission and put back on the trolley for
ground handling.
But further investigation suggested
the Skyhook could create mini and
hence affordable aircraft carriers.
Britain’s Vosper Thornycroft has
come up with an idea for a 5800-tonne
escort carrier capable of carrying six
Harriers and a helicopter. The mix
could be varied and the idea could be
adapted to get Australia’s anti-submar-
ine warfare Sea Kings to sea with the
navy. Since HMAS Melbourne went out
of service, they have been confined to
land-based sorties.
Hybrid escort carrier and supply
ships would also be a possibility.
Another use for Skyhook would be
to recover a load of stores from a hover-
ing helicopter, which would normally
have either to land on a crowded deck
or lower a sling through the maze of
antennas and structures which clutter
modern warships.
The British partners, who first un-
veiled the concept at the recent
Farnborough Air Show, emphasise they
still have a long way to go before the
Skyhook is fully developed.
But like other new projects being
presented to Australia’s financially
strapped defence planners for in-
stance the Bell-Boeing tilt-rotor tactical
transport it shows how technology
may one day come up with the answers
that of Australia’s defence force
urgently needs. □

CAMPAIGNING
On the hustings
with the King
of the Kids
Paul Everingham, a white hope of Australia's
conservative forces, is off and running for federal
parliament. BRUCE STANNARD reports on an
amazing campaign.
CAMPAIGNING at Nhulunbuy is like
electioneering nowhere else in
Australia.
Up here, on the far north-eastern tip
of Arnhem Land, in one of the country’s
most isolated settlements, political and
indeed personal survival is not merely a
matter of weathering the sauna heat of a
34-degree day; it also dictates that one
of the candidate’s eyes be kept very
carefully cocked for marauding buffalo
while the other scans the beachside
scrub for man-eating crocodiles.
An ability to sense the angry and
often sneaky presence of vicious blue
heelers, bull terriers, alsatians, dober-
man pinschers and yes even
chihuahuas also comes in handy.
As if that were not enough, the locals
assured me the mosquitoes are at least a
metre long and quite carnivorous.
But, like the veteran Top Ender that
he is, “Porky” Paul Everingham goes
armed with nothing more defensive
than his laconic style, a lopsided grin
and the reckless “She’ll be right, mate”
insouciance of the bushman.
With a cream canvas, broad-
brimmed sombrero pulled down hard to
shade his eyes and blue runners lashed
to his feet, he charges like a bull through
brilliant scarlet hibiscus hedges. He
ducks under fragrant frangipani
boughs, swings around trees laden with
mango and papaw while, at a maniacal
racing pace, he goes nosing in to one
home after another clutching the sweat-
stained Country Liberal Party
pamphlets which proclaim his bid to
“knock some sense into the Labor mob”
in distant Canberra.
Everingham far and away the most
successful and the most astute politician
in the Northern Territory has a pudgy
boyish face which is instantly recognis-
able from Alice Springs to Jabiru, from
Tennant Creek to Kakadu.
For six years he had served as Chief
Minister in the Territory’s Legislative
Assembly. Everyone calls him either
“Paul” or “Porky,” whether they know
him or not, and he in turn invariably
knows not only their first names but also
tiny details of their personal lives.
The “Porky” sobriquet came origin-
ally from his former articled clerk and
later law partner John Reeves, the
Labor Party incumbent for the Terri-
tory’s only House of Representatives
seat the one which Everingham plans
to take on December 1.
The nickname refers not so much to
his once-formidable 100 kilogram bulk
(he is now a mere stripling at about
85kg) as to his Tory-style political
beliefs. According to Everingham, the
young Reeves was “a mad left-winger
who used to knock about with that
communist bloke Jack Mundey.”
Reeves dubbed Everingham “Lord
Evering-pork” and that name became
twisted into “Porky” of legend.
Everingham’s approval rating is said
to stand at an astonishing 83 percent in
the Territory and yet that does nothing
to diminish his apparently insatiable
appetite for personal contact. In this
marathon eight-week campaign he will
have knocked on more than 100,000
doors and spoken to just about every
one of the Territory’s 70,000 voters.
Nhulunbuy, on the very tip of the
bauxite-rich Gove Peninsula, is a one-
purpose company settlement. Nabalco
built both the mine and the neat little
town that houses some 4000 people.
And, although it might seem reasonable
for a Country Liberal politician to stay
away from an industrial area and a
bunch of staunchly unionised miners
who traditionally vote Labor,
Everingham is determined to pick up
whatever support he can. “At least,” he
said, “they’ll know I’ve made the effort.
They’ll say, ‘Bloody Everingham’s been
in town,’ People give you credit for
BRUCE STANNARD
Paul Everingham doorknocking in Nhulunbuy:


“Even if I pick up half the vote, I’m happy”


trying. Even if I pick up half
the vote, I’ll be happy.”
Like pious Hindus,
Nhulunbuy families leave
their bright red bauxite-
stained footwear (invariably
rubber thongs and sandals)
stacked outside their homes in
driveways that also happen to
be crowded with fishing gear,
aluminium boats and four-
wheel-drive vehicles in
various stages of repair.
Most of the houses are left
unlocked and, although it was
quite disconcerting to
southern eyes, Everingham
had no hesitation in bowling
right inside to leave his calling
cards on the kitchen tables or
even on the stoves where
people would be sure to see
them.
“KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK,” he
bellowed in a voice loud enough to
rouse the huge green ants swinging
overhead in their gum tree nests.
“KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!”
When the kitchen flyscreens did
open just a crack, it was all the opening
he needs: “G’day.”
The drawl comes thick and slow, like
a Queensland drover home after a
month-long muster. “Paul Everingham
... sorry to disturb you .. . Campaiging
for the federal election ... No pro-
blems? ... Well, if I can be of any help
... and you can afford the cost of the
call to Darwin ... just give me a tingle
... Okie-dokie?”
There was no “vote for me” pressure,
no hard sell and yet Everingham’s pitch
seems to be as effective as it is dis-
armingly simple and direct.
So it went from one pre-fab house
to the next with the indefatigable
Everingham oblivious of the fact that,
having knocked on 150 doors in two
hours, he was thoroughly wet-through
with sweat. The Bulletin’s luckless
correspondent, 20 metres astern and
covered with stinging prickles and
burrs, was limping badly in his city
shoes.
The candidate turned once and gave
me a pitiable look when I asked if there
might not be a more effective way of
reaching the electorate.
“You can’t hold Nuremberg rallies
every day of the week up here, y’know,”
he said. “And, besides, what you drink
with the fellas the night before you
sweat out on the road?” Everingham
was right. I discovered too late that
essential equipment on any Territory
campaign not only includes an icebox
full of cold beer but several changes of
clothes as well.
Everingham’s predilection for a
“quiet little drink” is well known. On
one occasion still talked about in Can-
Everingham with wife Denise
berra, he and lobbyist David Combe
consumed 22 bottles of Riesling be-
tween them in a binge that extended
from lunchtime until 7 o’clock at night.
Although he prefers scotch and soda,
Everingham is quite happy to get stuck
into the NT draft with the boys in the
back bar of Darwin’s Travelodge. It was
there that a drunk once took a pair of
scissors and snipped off his tie.
Southerners (and, in Territory terms,
that includes everyone from south of
Brisbane) often make the mistake of
characterising Everingham as nothing
more than a hayseed, a redneck, a bush
lawyer and a Tory to boot. He may be
all those things but he is also an
exceptionally gifted politician who
knows precisely what his
electorate wants.
The almost comical snail’s
pace of his Deep North drawl
is a convenient (some say
carefully calculated) cover for
a brain both quick and inci-
sive. When he was an articled
clerk with an Ipswich law firm
in the 60s, the drawl was so
pronounced that the women
in the typist pool dubbed him
“Drawly Pauly, the typist’s
delight.” He uses it when it
suits him. Sipping a beer in
the bar of the Nhulunbuy
Golf Club (where thongs are
allowed) it takes on the old
familiar molasses quality. An
hour later, when he addresses
a dinner for the town’s
businessmen and women, he
can as Peter Leach, the local
pharmacist, put it “rattle off like a
machine-gun, just like people from
Sydney.”
If the first mistake which southerners
make with Everingham is to under-rate
his intelligence, the second is to
underestimate his influence and the
respect he commands particularly in
Opposition circles.
Even his arch-rival, the Labor leader
in the Legislative Assembly, Bob Coll-
ins, concedes that Everingham has by
dint of sheer hard work and savvy
achieved something of the status of folk
hero in the Territory. “I think he did a
more than competent job,” Collins said.
“I think he’s got a lot of ability. He’s
been lucky, like a lot of people in
The view from Canberra: only even money
PAUL EVERINGHAM will be putting
his personal popularity in the Northern
Territory to a very severe test on
December 1. In an election where an
Australia-wide swing to Labor
perhaps as much as 2 percent is likely,
Everingham needs a swing of 2 percent
the other way to enter federal parlia-
ment. Adding to his difficulties are
changes to his electorate since the 1983
poll which, on paper, seem to improve
Labor s chances.
The people of the Christmas and
Cocos Islands are voting for the first
time. Most on Christmas Island are
staunch trade unionists and Labor is
confident of receiving a considerable
share of their votes. On Cocos, Labor
expects to benefit from allowing the
islanders to become Australian citizens
and again emerge with the support of
far more than 50 percent of the voters,
The electoral roll in the Territory
itself is considerably increased and
many of the newcomers are Aborigines.
Aborigines have heavily favored Labor
and the approach of the Liberal and
National parties and of Everingham
himself to land rights is likely to make
that even more so on this occasion,
Labor Party officials see the net
result of all these new voters as increas-
ing the leeway to be made up by an
extra 1 percent. That would give
Everingham 5 percent to make up a
mighty task for any politician, given
that the conventional wisdom is that a
personal following rarely is worth more
than 1 percent.
Everingham certainly is no ordinary
politician. The result of the latest Terri-
tory election proved that. But, despite


politics. The cards really fell
his way. He’s been in parlia-
ment 10 years and Chief
Minister for six. In the 1977
election, their cabinet was
decimated. They lost their
Chief Secretary, Gough Letts,
who without the slightest
doubt would have become the
Chief Minister had he not lost
Victoria River. No one ex-
pected Letts to lose least of
all the ALP. Russ Tambling,
their deputy leader, also lost
his seat. Four cabinet
ministers all lost their jobs.
So, all of a sudden, there was
very little to pick from.
Everingham got up in a way
in which, under other cir-
cumstances, would never have
happened.”
It is an assessment at which
Everingham would not grumble. He has
a nice ear for dry, self-deprecating
humor. The events of 1977, he says,
meant that mediocrity was thrust upon
him.
Collins does a wickedly accurate
parody of the famous half-whine, half-
drawl as he tells how Everingham
within five weeks of being re-elected last
December and despite repeated assur-
ances that he would stay on for a full
term suddenly decided in a fit of
pique to resign and go for the federal
seat because Prime Minister Bob Hawke
would not see him.
Out of the side of his mouth Collins
says: “Aw, jeez ... I went down to
Canberra and I couldn’t get in to see
With a local resident at Gove: it’s a personal campaign
Hawke ... and I thought to meself ...
bugger this for a lark ... what’s the
point in me stuffin’ round up ’ere as
King of the Kids?”
The “King of the Kids” image comes
from Everingham himself. “I had gone
as far as I could in the Legislative
Assembly,” he said. “The time is right
for the move. Here is an opportunity
that may never come along again.”
Everingham has turned his back on a
$lOO,OOO-a-year salary, the most power-
ful political job in the Territory and all
the perks that went with it. Why?
“Like a man with a gambling habit,”
he said, “I actually enjoy it. I love work.
I love the challenge of something new. I
like the prospects of being able to
achieve more, not just for
myself but for the Territory.
“People call me a Territory
chauvinist. That’s the greatest
accolade a Territorian can
cop. I work my guts out for
the Territory and I love every
minute of it. I want to go on
doing just that.”
Everingham is a com-
pulsive worker. His wife
Denise testifies that he has “an
over-active brain” which
often has him up reading or
poring over paperwork at 3am
before he bicycles off to the
office at 5.30
The Everinghams are
practising Catholics but, al-
though there was a time when
he read the lessons in St Paul’s
at Nightcliff, Denise Ever-
ingham says that more and
more her husband’s work has become
his religion. “If he’s not working,
working, working,” she said, “he gets
very unhappy. He drinks too much and
he eats too much. He can’t sit still. He
takes things on and builds them up until
he can’t go any further; then he drops
them and goes on to something bigger,
more demanding.”
Like the young Hawke, Everingham
nurtured throughout childhood the
notion of himself in the federal parlia-
ment. As a Brisbane schoolboy, he sat
awestruck at rallies in which an im-
perious Sir Robert Menzies silenced
rowdy interjectors with razor-sharp
one-liners. Everingham also went to
Labor leader Arthur Calwell’s meetings
and remembers trekking to Eagle Farm
just to watch the arrival of the legendary
H. V. Evatt.
Everingham’s parents, forced to
walk off their banana farm during the
depression, wanted nothing more for
their only son than a secure job in a
bank. “My mother was deeply relig-
ious,” he said. “My father used to say
she should put a bed in the back of the
church and stay there. She thought very
little of lawyers and still less of
politicians.”
The current Everingham offspring
two boys and two girls, all at school
were called in and consulted, albeit
briefly, on their father’s decision to
enter federal politics. “The kids are
right behind their father,” Denise
Everingham said. “I was the one with
the reservations. We had quite a few
very heated discussions before I realised
there was just no point arguing. He had
already made up his mind. And, once
that happens, there’s no changing him.
He can be very stubborn, very
strongwilled, very determined to get his
own way.”
But there is more to Everingham’s
desire to go to Canberra than simple
his extraordinary popularity with white
voters, he is hardly more than an even-
money chance to end up in Canberra.
For a man to surrender the safety of
the chief ministership in the face of such
odds is a reflection of Everingham’s
considerable ambition. He believes that
the prime minister’s baton is in his
knapsack. Because of the belief, he will
join the Liberal Party if he wins.
To sit with the National Party in
federal parliament would effectively dis-
qualify him from reaching the top job.
However, Everingham would not
find everyone in the parliamentary Lib-
eral party extending him a welcoming
hand. He upset more than a few of his
potential colleagues with a speech to a
potential colleagues with a speech in
way in which the Liberal opposition
had performed in denouncing the evils
of Prime Minister Hawke’s brand of
socialism. Everingham might well be
correct with his thesis but to attack
people whose vote he would need to
become leader is a daring tactic.
There have also been some mum-
blings about hypocrisy by Liberals
when asked to comment about the
following part of that speech by
Everingham: “It’s what Voltaire called
the art of government. He said, ‘The art
of government consists in taking as
much as possible from one part of the
citizens to give it to the other.’ Hawke is
honing the art to perfection.”
Within days of delivering this
homily, Everingham returned to Dar-
win and passed legislation to take a
casino licence from Federal Hotels to
give it to another group.
Richard Farmer


Territory chauvinism. The Liberal Party
leadership situation has lead to serious
attempts to lure him into federal
politics. “I have been offered safe
federal seats in New South Wales more
than once,” he said. “No names, no
pack-drill, but those offers came from
very senior people who could deliver.
One guy in Sydney, a very prominent
nationally-known businessman, even
offered to provide me with a million
bucks to get me established.”
So, I wondered, what would have
been so unattractive about that?
“What’s the point in representing
some place I don’t even know,” he said.
“I want to get the Northern Territory
securely underpinned by achieving a
position of influence hopefully in the
next coalition government. I have
spoken to some people. Some people
have spoken to me. All the signs look
favorable. There have been pledges of
support but I know they mean bugger-
all. I’ve got to perform. I’ve got to
deliver. You don’t get nothin’ for
nothin’.”
Everingham made clear that Liberal
powerbrokers were not interested only
in his ability to deliver the Territory.
Rightly or wrongly, that much is taken
pretty much for granted.
“The sort of people who have been
encouraging me,” he said, “see me as
someone who has the ability to stand up
to the other side of politics.”
Although Everingham laughs at him-
self as a “poor man’s Hawke”, he
nevertheless clearly does have the sort
of straight-from-the-shoulder approach
which is going to be needed in any
effective counter to the tremendous per-
sonal following enjoyed by Hawke.
Although Everingham says that his
short-term ambitions extend no further
than being given a Liberal ministry
“say, Trade or National Resources”
he also makes no secret of his interest in
the leadership.
Would he like to be prime minister?
“I would be very challenged by being
prime minister,” he said. “The task is an
enormous one. I wouldn’t shrink from
it. We will have to wait and see. I may
flunk horribly. I may run off and sulk,
take my bat and ball and go home, retire
to the fastness of the Northern Terri-
tory. I think I can handle it but God
alone knows.
“There are people I won’t name
who’ve gone down to Canberra and
been a totally useless waste of money in
federal parliament. I might turn out like
them, just a sort of blowfly buzzing
’round the place.”
Everingham gives himself only a 50-
50 chance of winning the Territory seat.
Hawke’s personal popularity will, the
candidate says, be the unknown factor.
“My price must be shortened ac-
cordingly,” he said. □
Gloves off against a former partner
THE MAN Paul Everingham has to
beat to achieve stage one of his federal
political ambitions election to the
House of Representatives is a former
legal partner, Labor’s John Reeves.
Reeves, who has held the Northern
Territory’s single seat March of last
year, is 32 years old (although he looks
older) and like Everingham is a
Queenslander. Reeves is at least quietly
confident of holding the seat.
Reeves joined Everingham’s legal
business in 1975 and later became one
of the three partners. Everingham left
the business in 1977 when he became
the Territory’s chief minister.
“We sank a few gallons of grog
together in those days,” Reeves mused
the other day. “We’re political op-
ponents now but we still get on.”
The Territory, with its 70,000
widespread voters, does not lend itself
easily to gut feelings as do tight-knit
metropolitan electorates. “It’s a pretty
big paddock,” Reeves said, “but we
think we’ll maintain and strengthen our
traditional areas of support in the
northern suburbs of Darwin, the mining
towns of Groote, Gove, Tennant Creek
and Jabiru and the Aboriginal com-
munities. It doesn’t leave much left for
Paul even if he does improve his vote
around Alice Springs or Katherine, we
can’t see him overtaking us. He’d have
to win the northern suburbs resound-
ingly and he’s been going around door-
knocking at empty houses there, finding
one in 10 people at home in the
daytime.”
The northern suburbs vote in Darwin
is crucial to the outcome. It represents
about 25,000 people, most of whom
have arrived since Cyclone Tracy
devastated the capital in 1974.
Reeves’ spadework for this campaign
started not weeks but months ago. Part
of it has been a concentrated effort to
enrol new voters (the people at
Christmas and Cocos islands are
examples: about 650 new enrolments
from the islands represent some 1 per-
cent of the total vote and most of them
are expected to favor the ALP.
The roll has an all-up increase of
13,000 voters for this election, mainly
Aborigines and semi-skilled laborers.
“We think it will benefit us quite
dramatically,” Reeves said.
Reeves has challenged Everingham
to a public debate before the election.
But “Porky” responded with: “I don’t
want to talk to the monkey only the
organ grinder.”
John and Barbara Reeves with their children:
Reeves accuses Everingham of
hiding behind a series of advertisements
with mistruths and of avoiding the
issues.
“The facts are that, in the past 19
months, we’ve put up the money to get
the Darwin international airport started
($96 million) ... the Libs promised, we
delivered ... The same with the Tindal
air force base ($176 million) the Libs
hinted; we did it. The Libs promised to
increase taxation zone allowances. We
delivered in the last budget, increasing
them by 25 percent. They promised a
zone allowance for pensioner and
benefit recipients. We delivered this
year and there are about 16,000 in the
NT who have gained from that.
“In the past two Hawke budgets,
nearly $l.B billion has been poured into
the Territory. In this year’s budget, the
NT received a 12 percent increase
whereas the average for all other states
was 6 percent. It demonstrates the value
of having a voice in Canberra that’s
being listened to. If you want to kick
goals, you have to be in the team.”


“if you want to kick goals, you have to be in the team”
NEWS LIMITED
Campaigning for Reeves has meant
visiting and revisiting all the big centres,
calling on people at work, spending
Friday nights in pubs and Saturday
mornings at shopping centres and, of
course, door-knocking in the vital
northern suburbs. Reeves tends to rap
on front doors from 4pm to 7pm, when
people are at home. He says that regular
comments he receives suggest “Porky’s
gone off the rails in the past six
months.”
“In the period since self-government,
Everingham’s done a good job,” Reeves
said, “but now it’s almost as if he has
taken the Territory from self-govern-
ment to self-interest and has a desire to
get away from the messes he’s created.
The groundswell against him has been
of his own doing.
“A popularity poll taken a year ago
showed him rating at 82 percent. It’s
rumored that a recent poll shows him
rating at 55 percent and that was
taken in September, before the casino
deal had hit the deck. I’m certain the
reaction to the casino deal would cause
that to erode further. The findings of the
September poll have not been released.”
The casino affair was messy the
muscling out of Federal Hotels from the
Darwin and Alice Springs establish-
ments in favor of a replacement con-
sortium masterminded by Everingham.
The Territory runs on public ser-
vants. Everingham recently scrapped a
generous home loans scheme without
consultation (ALP supporters claim)
and then spent an estimated $20,000
through a housing commission advertis-
ing campaign to convince them that
they were no worse off. It prompted
work bans and a short strike and the
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association is said to be still furious.
Aborigines are not happy about his
attempt to change the Sacred Sites Act.
Legislation was first modified, then not
put before parliament. It will not be
heard until next year. That Aborigines
will vote substantially for the ALP is
generally conceded.
Many voters are puzzled about why
Everingham is planning to move on,
having promised last December to
“serve out my full term.” They find it
hard to come to grips with his salary
drop (should he win), from more than
$lOO,OOO a year to a federal back-
bencher’s $41,800, and doubt that his
“Canberra-bashing” reputation would
do much good in opposition for the next
four years.
His “I’m the King of the Kids”
stance has worked well in the NT (the
average age of a Territorian is 24) but
how would he mix it with the big boys in
the nation’s capital? In any case, in
making his run for federal parliament,
Everingham has left the Territory with a
Chief Minister lan Tuxworth who
is not particularly popular.
Reeves believes that all these things
will be taken into account on December
1, yet he realises the importance of the
election being seen in federal terms
rather than in Territory terms. His
constant use of the “royal” plural
“we” in statements should be
translated as “Bob Hawke and I.”
Reeves made a special dash to Sydney
to have his TV election ads filmed with
Prime Minister Hawke.
Reeves fought the 1983 election from
Alice Springs but has moved to Darwin.
A Catholic, married with three children,
he has the reputation of being a hard-
working man constantly farming out
lists which he likes to see returned with
ticks of achievement.
Politically, he is aligned to the New
South Wales right (“He knows where
the strength is,” said a member of
Reeves’ campaign staff). A few months
ago, he was appointed convener of the
committee on the development of
Northern Australia.
“There are no representatives in the
ministry north of Brisbane,” said
Reeves. “There’s a good argument that
the Territory should get one of the
junior ministries being offered after
December 1. I intend to put my name
up for anything going.”
Although Reeves is confident, he will
return to legal work should he lose.
Struggling to assess a likely outcome,
a Darwinian commented: “The Terri-
tory is a real mixed grill, running on a
cocktail of emotion over the whole deal
. ..” To boot, it is the time of “mango
madness” or the intense weather build-
up before the Big Wet when strange
things happen annually. This year, the
election outcome could be one of
them.

The problem with most desktop computers
is simply that.
They’re desk bound.
And the trouble with most transportable
computers is, apart from being under-powered,
they look more at home in the boot of your car
than on your desk.
Now fortunately, a computer has been
designed to fit neatly between the two.
The Apricot.
In a nutshell, it's a 16-bit desktop computer
that folds into a briefcase.
So it can take home work when you do.
While at the office, it competes on equal
footing with the desktop heavies.
Unbelievably, it’s more powerful than the
equivalent IBM PC.
It also incorporates a few practical advances
in computer technology that no other desktop has
caught up with.
For example, a Microscreen on the keyboard
which operates as a calculator, digital calendar,
time display and as a window on the main screen.
What’s more, the Apricot comes ready to go.
F rom $4444 with sales tax and $ 1000 worth of software included in the price. And the software includes Supercalc,


erful desk lop computers can do.
|:§
And one thing they cant.
It already has its own business software.
(In fact, over $lOOO worth of it is included
in the purchase price*)
But as well as that, the Apricot is readily
compatible with the computers that boast the
most software in the business, the Sinus and
the IBM PC.
So there you have it.
A computer that does anything any other
desktop computer can do.
And you don’t have to hire a removal van
to take it home.

Remembrance of kings past
PHILLIP ADAMS
I ONCE was intrigued by a BBC
television program called The Bloxham
Tapes, in which various people “regress-
ing” under hypnosis remembered
dramatic past lives. Sane-looking, reas-
onable people were “put under” and
taken back through the centuries. Bank
managers pre-incarnated into brigands,
respectable housewives into harlots.
Most of their accounts were hair-
raising, involving rapes and drownings
and wars and were related with
impassioned, hysterical intensity. The
BBC researchers checked out any
amount of historical detail. Surprise,
surprise: the magical, mysterious
memories turned out to be fairly ac-
curate and Oxford dons held them to be
“the sort of detail that only an expert
would know.”
Yet I found some cause for
scepticism. First of all, some people
regressed into fascinating period ac-
cents while others continued to chat in
their 20th century voices. A puzzling
anomaly. And a monumental blooper
contradicted the historical accuracies
from time to time.
For example, one girl recalled a life
some 400 years ago as Rebecca, the
daughter of a Jewish businessman. She
had been hunted by an anti-Semitic
mob and hidden in the crypt of a
church.
Rebecca’s unhappy experiences al-
legedly occurred near a place called
Coppergate which, under hypnosis, she
was asked to describe. “An
enormous gateway made of
wood, covered in beaten
copper,” she said. But, sadly,
Coppergate had nothing to do
with copper. It was originally
Coopergate, a place where
men made barrels.
Now, I have all sorts of
philosophic difficulties with
reincarnation. Like any other
concept involving life after
death, it strikes me as
remarkably egocentric as if
each of we countless billions
of human beings were so im-
portant that our precious little
consciousnesses, with all our
opinions and prejudices,
should be preserved for all
eternity.
Yet, the Bloxham tapes
and similar experiments are
undoubtedly intriguing. And
the most intriguing case was
Rebecca’s. Coppergate aside,
the depth of historical information was
formidable. When fully conscious, the
British housewife seemed to know
nothing whatsoever about bygone eras.
Professional historians professed
themselves astonished and said it was
“quite impossible” for an ordinary 20th
century woman to have this sort of
information at her fingertips.
Well, a few months ago the truth
came out. Hearing Rebecca’s words on
the BBC, a viewer found them strangely
familiar. The plot, the story, the details
struck a responsive chord. No, the
viewer had not lived before in the
vicinity of Coppergate. But she had
read the same novel.
It turns out that a minor novelist had
braved the gloomiest of libraries and the
dustiest of archives while researching
the period for a Mills and Boon-type
romance. Consequently our modern
housewife had read the book and, at
some level, remembered it. Under
hypnosis it was all regurgitated, com-
plete with a crack at a 16th century
accent.
REINCARNATION is alive and well
and living in Hollywood where the
supernatural has flourished for 50 years.
California has always been the state for
kooks, the place where the L. Ron
Hubbards and Charles Mansons and
Jim Joneses congregate. Film stars com-
bine considerable naivety with sizeable
egos and incomes and, so, have been
Shirley MacLaine: she recalls how she once lost her head
vulnerable to the predatory spiritualist
and the adroit fortune-teller.
It is little wonder that so many stars
are enjoying regressing with fashionable
Hollywood hypnotists. Leading the
fashion is Shirley MacLaine who has
sought out mediums (media?) as far
afield as Sweden and Peru. As a result,
Shirley now recalls any numbers of lives
both as a male and a female. She was a
court jester to Louis XIV who cut off her
head, in person, for telling impertinent
jokes. “I watched my head rolling on
the floor,” Shirley recalls. “It landed
face up and a big tear came out of one
eye.”
Sylvester Stallone also recalls being
decapitated. He was guillotined during
the French Revolution but assures us
that it is not all that painful: “Oh no, it
doesn’t hurt. You don’t feel anything
except when your head hits the basket.”
Stallone also recalls being a monkey in
Guatemala, feels a very strong kinship
for wolves and has a special gift for
doing American-Indian dances.
Glenn Ford is not very fondly
remembered in Australia by those as-
sociated with the Logies. He was, by all
accounts, the most difficult personality
ever to visit here. Perhaps his
unpleasantness dates from the time he
was cat’s meat in the Colosseum. For
Ford, a recent convert to born-again
Christianity, recalls being a martyr
masticated by a lion. He was also a
piano teacher in Scotland in the early
1800 s, a member of King
Louis XlV’s cavalry, a cow-
boy, and a 17th century
British sailor. But his favorite
life was as Flavius, that
doomed Roman Christian.
In my experience, many
actors are drawn to the pro-
fession to the security of a
script because thay are un-
certain of their own per-
sonalities. They suffer from
the Peter Sellers syndrome.
(More than 20 years ago, I
asked Spike Milligan what
Sellers was really like. Spike
said, with vehemence: “He is
an empty vase in which I
arrange the flowers.”) I have
lost count of the times I have
seen a frail, uncertain actor
luxuriate in a powerful part.
Little wonder the psychics
home in on the hollow men of
Hollywood. □


Move over, Sydney; Melbourne is throwing out a challenge
DAVID M c NICOLL
HAVING OVER the years given dear
old Melbourne fairly consistent serves
about its inadequacies, I am compelled
to backpedal. The Victorian Arts Centre
leaves Sydney so far behind that our
Opera House and Entertainment Centre
will just have to go on the back burner
while Melbourne becomes the artistic
Mecca of Australia.
I was lucky enough to have a con-
ducted tour by Rob Garrand, public
affairs manager of the arts centre and a
young man fired with zeal and en-
thusiasm. Apart from the magnificent
auditoriums, the centre leaves Sydney
trailing by having parking for 1500 cars
alongside the theatres and seats which
are not an affront to normal posteriors
as are the ones in the Opera House and
Entertainment Centre. The whole com-
plex is a triumph for the late Roy
Grounds and John Truscott. My only
criticism is of some of the paintings
too much Olsen and Kemp. I’d have
liked a bit of Rees and Brian Dunlop.
TOPPERS OR NO toppers? Once again
this vital topic has gripped Melbourne,
stimulated by a declaration by Premier
Cain that under no circumstances
would he wear one to the Cup.
The Premier, whose grave visage
seems admirably to suit his gloomy
attitudes, is not a man given to frivolity
or, one hears, to vice-regal occasions.
Last week, Victorian Opposition leader
Jeff Kennett named him Cromwell and
it is not a bad comparison.
To get back to toppers: I have
divided feelings. Translating the glories
of Ascot to a warm November race
meeting in the colonies is rather
ludicrous. On the other hand, toppers
seem to suit the Melbourne Cup because
it is not a race meeting it is a carnival
and carnivals are for dressing up and
playing up. One result of the Premier’s
thumbs-down was that more people
than usual wore toppers to the Derby.
The faint aroma of mothballs floated
gently across the car parks.
FOR YEARS, race clubs did their best
to stop information getting off the
course to assist starting price operators
no on-course telephones, a close
watch on walkie-talkies.
That is all history. With car phones
common, people all over the car park
were about to phone the TAB or their
bookies. “Is starting price still big in
Victoria?” I asked TAB boss Robert
Nordlinger. “About a hundred million a

year,” he said. “Just imagine if we could
get that money into the tote.”
WHY WERE the races running five
minutes late at Flemington on Derby
Day? Well, as the horses reached the
post in one of the early races, starter
David Wood was advised by the
stewards that a bit of essential gear for
one of the horses was missing but that a
substitute could be found in the starter’s
car.
Now, it happens that the VRC had
allocated a Rolls-Royce for the starter.
When Wood went to the boot, he found
that he could not open it. After fruitless
banging, Wood started to be very
exasperated and the race was running
late.
To the rescue: Ron Quinton, the
well-known Sydney postilion. He
jogged his horse across to and said, “Mr
Wood, I think I know what to do.” He
instructed the starter in the correct
procedure for opening the boots of
Rolls-Royces. A greatly relieved Wood
finally got the field away.
AT FLEMINGTON: That remarkable
retired naval officer Dacre Smyth who
has just produced his fifth book of
paintings, poetry and prose, In the Steps
of Von Guerard. Dacre has traced the
wanderings of the wonderful early
Australian painter Von Guerard and
has painted the modern scene of the
landscape the pioneer artist saw as
virgin bushland and plain.
THE DERBY Eve ball is one of the big
events of Melbourne at this time of the
year. The Hilton Hotel really turns on
the atmosphere and the fun is fast and
furious. A sober note was struck this
year when the chairman of the VRC,
Hilton Nicholas, announced that there
would be a speech by the famous
English amateur rider, steward of the
Jockey Club, and turf notable Major
Myles Hackford-Shanks. The major got
to his feet and proceeded to hold forth
on his experiences on the turf, the


The Victorian Arts Centre, Melbourne: a sparkling gem
inadequacies of Australian racing and
other topics. Not until later did the
bemused revellers realise they had been
conned by the famous Melbourne
mimic and master of disguise Campbell
McComas. Except for Nicholas,
everyone had been fooled.
A genuine expert visitor was at
Flemington Calvin Rainey, formerly
secretary of the New York Jockey Club,
one of the most influential men in
American racing. Rainey was impressed
by everything he saw in New Zealand
and Australia. “I was a little
embarrassed not having a top hat at
Flemington,” said Calvin, “but the com-
mittee excuses travellers. I can’t
remember going to a race meeting
conducted with more style than the
Melbourne Cup.”
ROBERT FROST of MEPC and Rob
Hirst, of Bollinger, were the big en-
tertainers at Flemington. Their marquee
was a sort of space age astrodome, a
marvellous warm refuge from the cool
winds which swept the course most of
the day. It seems to me that Melbourne
Cup entertainment grows in splendor
year by year.
In the car park, mini tents and huge
umbrellas are the order of the day;
dozens of people take along a uni-
formed waiter or two to handle the
food and drink. The Scouts who spent
the day moving round collecting bottles
reported that champagne consumption
this year exceeded all previous years.
Vlado’s: the best steak house
There was no rowdiness or unpleas-
ant scenes this year. The usual crazy
dressers were there people wearing
chook feet, men in tail coats and
underpants, dozens of women with
multi-colored hair but the
exhibitionists hardly get a second
glance these days which must be de-
pressing for them.
The VRC is in the middle of large
additions to the stands at Flemington
and, when finished, there is little doubt
it will be back as Australia’s premier
racecourse.
AT NICK Columb’s Mount Eliza
spread, I ran into Peter Reith who is the
Liberal candidate for Flinders. Peter is
now having his third election campaign
in 24 months. He won a by-election
when Phillip Lynch gave up Flinders,
lost the seat in the last general election
and is having another go. After he won
the seat, parliament was dissolved be-
fore Peter was able to warm a bench in
the House of Reps. Did they pay him
anything for the short time he was a
member? Yes. Although he did not get
to Canberra, he received three months’
pay. He is hoping for something more
permanent on December 1.
THE ANNUAL Government House
Cup-eve cocktail party is always full of
interest. The intriguing bit this year was
the second anthem played after Advance
Australia Fair.
Everyone was puzzled until the
Governor, Sir Brian Murray, explained
that it was the New Zealand anthem
and in honor of the Governor-General
of New Zealand, Sir David Beattie, and
his wife who matched the local product
in liveliness and charm.
I was interested to meet Richard
Parry who has become one of
Melbourne’s major tycoons and put up
the sugar for Victoria’s entry for the
America’s Cup.
Was he having another go in Perth?
No way, said Richard. He has put some
of his hard-earned capital instead into
the purchase of Raheen, the former
palace of Archbishop Mannix, which
Mrs Parry assured me was being made
quite cosy.
I DROVE to Melbourne. The work
being done on the New South Wales
side of the Hume Highway is quite
prodigious and reflects great credit on
the Department of Main Roads. The
Victorian side is still patchy some
stretches of dual highway but an awful
lot of narrow stuff with none of the
passing lanes which are a feature up our
way.
Melbourne, despite the sobering
efforts of Premier Cain, manages to
maintain great charm and quite a lot of
fun. It is a city of extraordinary con-
trasts dreary, rather dirty streets and
dull shops; superb parks and delightful
suburban gardens. But there is no doubt
that it now has three features which give
it a clear lead on Sydney: it has the best
arts centre, the best racecourse and the
best steak house Vlado’s. □

Poet Sandy
Thorne:
approaches
from
the US
The opening of Williams, the big-noters’
club in Sydney, seemed likely to be
interesting it will be exclusive
sybaritic, possibly even snooty but
not much more, until it was announced
that one of the attractions, along with
Lauren Hutton, would be Vanessa (The
Undresser) Williams. She is the stirring
black girl who won the title of Miss
America but had to give it back because
she had once posed, stripped to the buff,
with another charmer. The chances of
The Undresser giving a repeat perform-
ance are, to be frank, not good but that
is neither here nor there. Even in long-
johns, from neck to toe, she would be
mind-bending.
Sandy Thorne is, first and foremost, a
proud and patriotic Queenslander. Next
she is a proud Australian. This is
evidenced in her latest book, just
released by Rigby, Wags In Verse.
Every poem in it is, like its author,
distinctly Australian (if not actually far
right of right wing), and reflects her
great love for the Australian bush. She is
a real knockabout: After “shooting
through” from school at the age of 14,
she worked as a jilleroo, builder’s
laborer, cane cutter and trawler
deckhand. In between she has found
time to write three other books I’ve
Met Some Bloody Wags!, Tickle a
Bushie’s Fancy and Battler. Now there
have been approaches for her to go to
the United States to give readings of her
poetry. “I guess,” she says, “they see me
as some sort of poor man’s Pam Ayres.”
Facts one should know about the
movies in this case 1984 which is
causing people around the nation to
climb into hot baths and open veins: on
Sydney’s 2JJJ, John Hurt was telling the
Jay Team Rusty Nails, Roger de Sauve
and Lillian Pascoe about his trouble
with rats. In one of the real vein-opener
scenes in 1984, he was to be in “Room
101” and a special cage containing two
famished and carnivorous rats was to be
strapped to his face. But the rats had
spent hours under hot lights and had
become so docile that they were and,
more importantly, looked more
inclined to kiss the victim. An apparent
solution was to chill them down, and
summon up their blood, in a re-
frigerator. And it worked, up to a point:
they still would not emote but, if you
can imagine it, they would turn tail and
fart in the hero’s face.
Audrey II is a pot-plant with an ap-
petite for people. Read that again.
Perfectly clear? Right. Moving right
along ... Aud is a heroine, of sorts, of
Little Shop of Horrors the musical
which has filled all the best theatres in
New York and London and has set out
to do the same in Australian capitals.
This explanation comes from the people
at Sydney’s Theatre Royal, along with
the assertion that among those grinning
from Aud’s chops on opening night will
be Noel Ferrier, Harry M. Miller,
Wilton Morley, Stuart Wagstaff, Frank
Thring, Paul Dainty, Carol Raye .. . The
diet seems too succulent. If Australians
are to be devoured by pot plants it
might be better to offer Bob Hawke,
Andrew Peacock, Lionel Murphy, Frank
Costigan, Rex “Buckets” Jackson, Joh,
Robert Trimbole, Fine Cotton ...
There is a feeling among some wine-
buffs that champagne is not champagne
unless it has been made in the
Champagne country of France by
the methode champenoise (m’tod
shomp’n’wahz). Possibly the nearest
Australian fizz to that is Yellowglen
chardonnay made (by the OK
method) at Yellowglen in Victoria by
Dominique Landragin, who was born in
the Champagne country, at Verzenay,
near (or pres de, as the French-speaking
chaps like to say) Reims. Still, he and
the Yellowglen that the
wine be called “ methode champenoise
sparkling wine.” Gourmets find it diffi-
cult to wish them luck. Success will
make life a hell upon earth for people
who like cheddar, camembert, brussels
sprouts, frankfurts, limburger and
hamburgers.


No matter what the US thinks of Walter
(Fritz) Mondale, he is thought of hardly
at all in the north of North America. At
the National Press Club in Washington,
21 Canadian cartoonists were asked to
put together an exhibition of their views
of the United States then, at the last
minute, a panel lampooning Ronald
Reagan was vetoed. Why? Because it
was impossible to be fair. They needed
balance and there was a pronounced
lack of Mondale. “We looked around
for cartoons of Mondale,” said car-
toonist Terry Mosher, “and we could
only find about three done in Canada in
the past seven years.”
In city and suburban cricket in
Newcastle, NSW, one team is called
The Faulkners because not just most but
all of them a full team plus three
reserves are Faulkners and all are
related. They range, for example,
from 29-year-old Steve to 18-year-old
Michael. The latter got his place in the
team for rather more than his name: in
only two innings recently, he made a
total of 240 runs.
Author John Gordon Davis, 45, built a
13m yacht in Hong Kong and sailed it
all the way home to Spain. Only a few
kilometres from his landfall on the
Costa del Sol the boat came to a
grinding halt on, Gordon Davis was
convinced, an unmarked wreck. He was
sure he was 6km from shore. It was
pitch black. Leaving his Australian wife,
Rosemary, and the boat’s only other
occupant, Charlie the duckling, to fend
for themselves, he took off in enormous
seas in the dinghy for help. He finally
reached a tiny port. In the meantime,
Rosemary’s radio mayday had called
out the coast guard which converged on
the reading she had given. The boat was
not there. John had misread the chart.
The cruel light of dawn showed they
had run on to a nice white beach on the
mainland. The rescue people were
furious and the entire population from
thereabouts turned up next day jeering
as two trawlers towed them off. The
author, a pal of best-selling writer
Wilbur Smith, is in Australia flogging
his new book Seize the Reckless Wind
(Collins) and looking for new stories to
write (he plans a trip to outback
Queensland with the Flying Doctor).
Seize the Reckless Wind, a racy adven-
ture yarn, poses the idea of using
modern airships to overcome the high
cost of fuel. Gordon Davis wants to live
on a bigger yacht. In the meantime, he
has been doing some celestial naviga-
tion study.

Two-day courses in landscaping and

howmuch? A search of the boy’s past
turns up his singing and his one-time

An NC of Hedges, Hursts, Holts,

The answer is that Roddy has a

A Friend shaken, not stirred
RON SAW
THE SUMMONS came by telegram:
“Call London urgently stop Alexandra
Palace 8601 stop Australian High Com-
mission.” In the comparative cool of the
bungalow’s verandah, Donald Friend
read it with instant misgivings.
Telegrams, at the best of times,
brought bad news. And though the
times Ceylon, 1961 were not the
worst, nor were they the best. Colombo,
the Colombo of the Widow Bandara-
naike, of Sinhala nationalism, the end
of the British Raj and international
intrigue, throbbed with the meddling of
a dozen embassies; and Donald, having
worked for Intelligence in World War
11, was vulnerable to meddlers. He
rolled up the telegram, threw it into a
mountain of purple bougainvillea and
went back to his easel.
A day later there was another: “Call
London Alexandra Palace urgent
urgent urgent.”
He had a telephone, but Ceylonese
operators made a mere 75km drive to
the high commission in Colombo seem
preferable. He packed a toothbrush and
two clean shirts and dressed in a new
white suit. So they wanted him urgent
urgent urgent. What could he have done
or said that was wrong?
“I DON’T know what it’s all about,”
said the third secretary. “But just a few
minutes ago they called and booked a
seat for you for London with BOAC.
You leave two hours from now.”
“But I don’t want to go to London.
It’s Christmas there and all I’ve got is a
tropical suit and this little bag.”
“Hmmm. You’re one of these In-
telligence blokes, aren’t you?”
“Well, I was. These days I’m a
painter. Besides, my passport’s out of
order.”
“Our Mr Fernandez will fix your
passport. He’s good with all that top
secret stuff. Urgent urgent urgent, eh?
Strewth.”
At Heathrow, where it was snowing,
there was a man in a homburg, a long,
black and almost certainly snug topcoat
and the sort of spreading, ginger riot
that used to be called a “wizard prang”
moustache. Donald wondered if he had
a Beretta in his shoulder-holster.
“You’re Friend? Splendid. Come
along, then. I’ve a car outside.” He
looked non-committally at Donald’s
icecream suit.
A few miles later Wizard Prang said
quietly: “I suppose you’re in the
picture?”
“Oh, yes.” Only an ass would have
confessed ignorance. “I’m not sure of
the finer points, but...”
“Don’t worry about them. They’ll fill
you in tomorrow. Tonight we’ll put you
up in a little hotel we use. Nice and
quiet. Your name will be John Smith.”
“Smith? I s’pose that’s a little more
tricky than something like 007 or James
Bond.”
“Yerse. Heh-heh.”
The residents of the Connaught
Hotel, Lancaster Gate, could have
welcomed 007 or James Bond or
Bulldog Drummond and would have
said nothing. They were, mostly, elderly
ladies wearing lace chokers and smell-
ing of parma violet. If, in snowbound
London, they were surprised by
Donald’s white Ceylon suiting they
gave no indication of it.
Wizard Prang had told him to order
whatever he liked. He asked for a vodka
martini, shaken, not stirred. He went to
bed hoping that his assignment would
be somewhere warm.
The cabbie who picked him up next
morning was, transparently, a spy:
walrus moustache, bald head, heavy
tweed overcoat. His Oxbridge accent
was poorly disguised with a travesty of
Cockney.
“Ar, there, guv. Mister
Smiff, ennit?”
“Er, yes. Where, ah, er,
how long do ...?”
“Shoont take us moren
abaht twenny minits.”
They drove north through
the falling snow and the grey
slush and finally reached a
building which, by London
standards, was enormous. The
walls were alive with mosaics,
the elevators gilded. At a huge
desk in the huge foyer sat a
severe blonde (Miss Money-
penny?).
“Ah, Mr Smith. So we got
you. I’ll pass you on to our Mr
Bee.”
Bee was dressed in pepper-
and-salt tweed. His mous-
tache was pepper-and-salt. So
was his hair. So, probably,
were his socks.
“Ah, Smith. Good show. I
suppose they’ve put you in the
picture.”
“Oh, yes.”
There was an enormous
room with enormous picture
windows and it was crowded
by girls who all seemed to be wearing
cherry slacks and drinking martinis and
eating icecreams and ... good lord!
There was Dame Edith Evans. And
Margaret Rutherford. So this was how
Intelligence did it these days.
And now came a platoon of Wizard
Prang and Pepper-and-Salt men.
“Smith, eh? Well, Friend. Are you in
the picture?”
“Yes. Well, no! No, I’m not in the
picture at all. I’ve come 10,000 miles in
this tropical suit and nobody’s really
told me anything, apart from how to
have a drink with those old ladies.
What’s the job?”
“Good lord! You haven’t been
briefed? Bee didn’t put you in the
picture? Or even Snaffle? That’s carry-
ing our security a bit far.”
“Who’s Snaffle? The Wizard Prang
bloke?”
“Wizard Prang? Dear, oh dear, oh
dear. Look, you do know Peter Finch,
don’t you?”
“Finch? Yes, of course I do. I used to
share a flat with him in Sydney. Place
called Kings Cross. Finch, eh? Don’t
tell me he’s in this lark, too.”
“Well, of course he is. You’re here,
y’know, to do This Is Your Life, Peter
Finch.” □


BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
The full bottle on Australian wine
LEONARD PAUL EVANS; Vintage
1930. Has suffered several appalling
seasons, yet holding up surprisingly
well. Fading in color but you could not
accuse this vintage of being thin or
pallid. Excessively full in body. Opens
up well. Anything but a shy wine.
Incredibly generous, robust, yet good
balance of acid and enough tannin to
stock the Kiwi factory. Ex-
tremely ebulient, garrulous;
rich, exotic fruit, full of
character, inclined on
opening to salacity. True to
label. Has good grip on finish.
Well worth cellaring. Might
even last another 20 years.
Len Evans launched his
latest vintage of Complete
Book of Australian Wine
(Lansdowne, $39.95) at
Melbourne’s Hotel Windsor.
The reference work is enor-
mous, as big as the Gutenberg
Bible. Not a vineyard, not a
district, not a grape is untrod.
The book even has color
pictures of every label.
There’s a history of wine in
Australia.
Even if you were a beer
baron and dedicated to
having a further tax on wine,
you could use this book (791
pages) for standing on to
reach up to other books.
It is pretty good getting Evans in full
cry with the lunch paid for by someone
else. If you want him to speak at your
fancy function, like Phillip Adams, the
fee is around $lOOO which he donates to
charity. He told us what Australia was
when he first arrived from Wales, back
in 1955. He tried to buy some white
wine in Mt Isa. “What are you?” asked
the hotelkeeper. “Some kind of a
poof?”
Evans tried to get some wine with his
dinner in Darwin and was told: “Look
’ere, the dining room’s for eatin’ and the
bar’s for drinking’.”
He remembers waking in the
morning at a Queensland pub with a
cup of tea shoved under his nose ...
“Take sugar?”
“No!”
“You better not stir it, then,”
Evans says that Australia since then
has seen the most extraordinary change
of eating and drinking habits of any
country in history.
We have gone from about half-a-
glass of wine a head a year to more than
two cases. “I like to think, being a
megalomaniac, that I played some small
part in this,” said he.
Of course, what with the immense
proliferation of vineyards and wines,
his task in keeping up with it all has
become increasingly complex.
“My doctor said to me, ‘Evans, some
Len Evans: angered by the “silvertail” policy
people are a genius of the mind; you
don’t have to worry about that. Some
people are extraordinary athletes, like
de Castella, and have a genius of the
heart; you don’t have to worry about
that. But, by heavens, you have a genius
of a liver.”
The assorted publishers and wine
writers at the lunch asked him some
direct questions and he ceased to be so
lighthearted. He said “The wine in-
dustry simply is in a terrible mess. The
amount of quality wine being produced
is only 3 to 5 percent. Fifteen to 17
percent of just plain average wine is
produced in bottles. That means 80
percent of all Australian wine is being
sold in casks or flagons.”
Evans put a hand over his heart and
told us that he did not want to play
politics but it was a fact: the present
federal government had a “silvertails”
policy - it believed that people who
desired quality and better standards in
wines were “just bloody silvertails” and
they could damned well pay for it.
The result had been that it had
brought in a tax policy which meant 10
cents on a cask and a $1.50 on a bottle
of good wine. For good winemakers in
Victoria, it was costing $3 a litre. The
result was that small winemakers pro-
ducing some of the best in the country
were on the verge of bankruptcy. If we
were not careful, the top 3 percent
would be ruined. Striving to
produce quality wine would
have no point. That market
would go entrely to French
and imported.
The book has fascinating
chapters by Tim Knappstein
and Brian Croser, respectively
on white winemaking and on
red. Both imply that we have
been producing our grapes in
the wrong areas. The harsh,
hot Australian climate has
been the enemy.
Knappstein says that the
traditional winemaking areas
of SA, WA and NSW lie in
latitudes similar to those of
the north African and
Egyptian coasts while the
cooler areas of Victoria and
Tasmania are akin to those of
Lebanon, Syria and southern
Turkey.
Our hot autumns are an
agony. White wine’s worst en-
emy, oxidation, proceeds with
increasing speed as temperature rises,
Ah, but on the good side we get more
reliable seasons than does Europe. Then
we have combatted our climate pro-
blems by continuing technical ad-
vances. Instead of bloating our grapes
by irrigation, we have controlled drip
and soil moisture measuring equipment,
We have mechanical harvesting to
speed up picking, field crushing and
chilling of the crushed must to deter
oxidation. Evans detailed further a
whole range of modern methods for
grape handling, crushing and control of
atmosphere to bring that perfect and
(alas) more expensive quality product,
Croser told of new methods and the
hunt to produce grapes in the cooler
areas the Australian Alps, Strathbogie
Ranges, Geelong, Yarra Valley and
Drumborg in Victoria; Pipers Brook
and Hobart in Tasmania; Coonawarra,
Padthaway, Clarendon, Piccadilly^
Lenswood, Mount Crawford, Pewsey
Vale and Eden Valley SA; and Mount
Barker and Margaret River in WA. □

To measure the performance of the
new Holden Commodore SS V8, compare
it with the well bred Porsche 911 Carrera,
Both cars accelerate from rest to
lOOKs in under 7 secs. The Carrera in 6,1
secs, the SS in 6,7 secs.
Over400 metres, there's nothing in it:
14,3 secs for the Carrera, vs, 14.9 for V8
Commodore SS.
Not only does the SS go like a
Carrera, it stops brilliantly too, with big
discs all round.
The V8 Commodore SS handling is
also preferred over many of Europe's
finest. Designed by Peter Brock himself
the V8 Commodore SS is based on his
experience of seven wins at Bathurst.
Brock has included a limited slip
differential, a blueprinted ignition system,
and HDT high performance cylinder
heads with large inlet and exhaust valves.
He has also added a refined inlet manifold
with improved inlet passages and free flow
extractor exhaust system. Power steering,
HDT gas rear suspension, 15" HDT alloy
wheels and low-profile Uniroyals provide
an outstanding ride with precise handling.

EVEN WITH a bad lung and asthma, a
drip secured to one arm to feed her cor-
tisone and regular hits of oxygen from
her bedside mask, author Patsy Adam-
Smith sat propped up in Tier hospital
bed and looked cheerful.
She had come home to Melbourne
just for a few days to make an appear-
ance at the announcement of the
making of a $6.5 million television
series Anzacs , for which she is the story
consultant, and ended up for weeks in
Epworth Hospital.
She regularly flees Melbourne’s
damp and goes to the Kimberleys in
Western Australia. This time, Mel-
bourne got to her before she got to the
dry warmth.
“For someone as fit as me, it used to
humiliate me that I had to be put into
hospital,” she said. “But I get a lot of
writing done. I set myself up in comfort
and friends come in and I don’t have to
look after them. When I am fit, maybe I
am a bit of a bore. I walk too fast; I
break into a run. It must annoy people.
When I’m here in the summer, I do eight
laps round the footy oval every day
otherwise I feel bad, a bit soggy.”
She does not look 60. Her lispy little
voice tells you that she used to be pretty
but she looks pretty now in her lacy
pink nightie as she speaks of her many
former lovers, the adventures in her life
and an independence which is quite
extraordinary. She seems too tiny to
have been the only female sailor, cook
and wireless operator for six years on a
trading ship in Bass Strait. She smiles a
lot but cries easily at any mention of the
research she did for her powerful book
The Anzacs.
“I was always wild,” she said. “I
have always been my own woman, I
have not taken to direction from parents
certainly not others.
“I have noticed my unmarried
women friends have more peace of
mind than my married friends.
“If you know yourself enough, you
will know what will work for you. We
must expunge ourselves from all the
falsities we have been brought up with.
“In my girlhood, women were sup-
posed to be figures of temptation. When
you begin to look at yourself and no
one ever accused me of lacking feminin-
ity you find your strengths. Once I
began to take total responsibility for
myself, I found I could love much more
warmly; I could be more generous, with
no hang-ups as to whether it would last,
whether I would get pregnant or get too
involved. I can sit in warmth with a lot
of old lovers, holding hands, after a
break of 20 years or more.”
She will not answer whether she has
been married but she does say that she
brought up a daughter and a son on her
own.
She has published 21 books in the
past 20 years, eight of them best-sellers,
and another book Australian Women
at War is to be published by Thomas
Nelson in November.
In the meantime, she has helped
develop characters and plot outlines for
the Anzacs television series. This is
being produced by Geoff Burrowes
(who produced The Man From Snowy
River for the cinema), directed by John
Dixon, George Miller and Pino Amenta
and co-written by Dixon, James
Mitchell and John Clarke.
“When I was researching for The
Shearers ,” Adam-Smith said, “I got
angry. With The Anzacs , I just sobbed.
“When I was editing that down, to
cut out those boys, it was crippling. And
I had this terrible need to tell
Australians about those golden boys. I
knew I would be the last to speak to


them by the time the book came out
(in 1978), 60 percent of the 700 I talked
to were dead. And I got terribly intense
about it.”
Walking along the Somme, crying
her head off, was a long way from the
country childhood of this adopted
daughter of Gippsland railway fettler
Albert and his wife Bridget who was a
station-mistress. Patsy Adam-Smith is
still very close to her 87-year-old mother
who now lives alone in Gippsland.
Patsy left school at 13 and went to work
in the Depression, doing the account
books for a local butcher and baker.
“Then the war came and the boys
went and I missed them. Life was very
drear indeed. Before I knew it, I was
nursing first in Melbourne, then in
Ballarat and then in Queensland. You
were always falling in love with
someone who was going to have his foot
cut off the next day.
“You would flirt with someone and
find out later that his ship went down.
But you were on a perpetual high.
“That time - people will forget
was pre-pill, so there you were in what
the unforgiveable people of the time
said was moral danger but we were
nearer to being more womanly than the
other girls of group.
“You would be dancing with a boy
who was setting off on a ship the next
day and you knew the statistics of him
ever coming back.”
She says that she has learned to be
scornful of public opinion but she is
wary of anyone writing her biography.
“One would have to name names,” she
says. “Some of the men I have loved are
well known. Someone like me, who has
lived an interesting life, is bound to
meet men doing extraordinarily in-
teresting things.”
At the age of 19, she went to Tas-
mania. “I went because of a man, of
course. Where do I go anywhere except
for a man?” With a thousand books,
a wind-up gramophone and her
Beethoven records, she went to work on
a ship for six hard years. She brought up
her daughter on the trading vessel, got
what she calls her “reluctant lung” from
the cold, and started writing stories for
magazines. Kylie Tennant persuaded
her to start writing books. Adam-Smith
works outside any Australian literary
“push.”
“I have known people in all walks of
life which I notice most Australian
writers do not do,” she said. “They do
not seem to know their own country.
They look at it as an amorphous mass of
land with an amorphous mass of
people. They have made Australians
and us, as women into stereotypes.
“They have turned their back on the
sea, as if we are not an island, and they
have also turned their back on the
inland. A hell of a lot goes on out there
that makes us as a people. We have been
afraid of it, captivated and drawn to it.
We are not aware of its power.”
When Adam-Smith gets into a car
that will take her outback, she yells
“Whacko” and revels in being “a
straight Celt” who knows not modera-
tion.
Right now, she is probably on her
friend’s property in the Kimberleys
sleeping under the stars and not plan-
ning to return to her South Yarra
cottage until summer has come firmly to
Melbourne. □


THEATRE
Valid concern
lost in
confusion
By BRIAN HOAD
ROBYN ARCHER’S many devoted
fans are in for another surprise, in the
form of her latest entertainment for the
stage, II Magnifico. It is being given its
first production by Sydney’s Nimrod
Theatre Company. Archer is the author,
not the star performer.
Marking a move from her familiar
cabaret formats, the new work is still
not so much a play more an historical
pageant. As such, it has no song and
dance routines to talk about.
Female fans can be assured that
every effort has been made to show the
angry face of feminism, although they
must accept the historical fact
that the ladies did not have
many opportunities to make
their mark in the male-
dominated world of 15th cen-
tury Florence under the
benevolent tyranny of
Lorenzo di Medici (II Mag-
nifico) who in any case had a
strong sexual predilection for
the boys.
Much effort has been made
to satisfy fun-lovers with lots
of bawdy, mostly scatalogical
badinage. This, however, is
only the sugar coating on the
bitter pill of indigestible
didacticism. It is Archer as
schoolma’am who emerges
most strongly here. So sit up
straight and pay attention.
This is “relevant” theatre.
But the relevance often seems
to be lost as Archer (an in-
defatigably curious person)
ploughs her way through dec-
ades of turbulent history with
lots of excursions into class
politics, church politics and
sexual politics all of which
tend to obscure, rather than
illuminate, her central theme
of arts politics.
The central theme is most
clearly stated in the program
notes. Here she quotes from
that notable American histor-
ian Will Durant: “Despotism
was a boon to Italian Art. A
dozen rulers competed in
seeking architects, sculptors
and painters to adorn their capitals and
their memory; and in this rivalry they
spent such sums as democracy rarely
spares to beauty and such as would
never have been available to art had the
proceeds of human labor and genius
been equitably shared.”
Here is the central dilemma of arts
patronage in the late 20th century, a
dilemma which has surfaced in
Australia. For, although the arts of
western society still have their roots
deeply embedded in the achievements
of the Italian Renaissance, benevolent
tyrants or enlightened philosopher
kings of the calibre and style of Lorenzo
are no longer with us. The traditional
arts are at the mercy of arts ministers
such as our own Barry Cohen, a former
menswear magnate.
In such a situation, should one
simply accept that the old western
traditions of art are no longer compat-
ible with the newer western systems of
democratic government and so give in
to demands that the old elitist traditions
be scrapped for a brave new world of
populism in the arts?
It is a dilemma which Archer shares
with many free-thinking humanists (as
Fun and games at the court of ll Magnifico
opposed to democratic socialist ideo-
logues) who recently have been giving
themselves terrible headaches trying to
reach an equitable answer.
II Magnifico is Archer’s headache
made manifest. She is clearly an
admirer of the artistic achievements of
Lorenzo’s patronage. She is equally
clearly worried about Lorenzo’s ulterior
motives, both political and personal,
about all that money spent on art rather
than on social welfare for the poor and
needy and about all the graft and
corruption that went on to generate the
money to generate the art. The resulting
confusion has little to contribute to the
current debate. The confusion has
nothing to do with the validity of her
concerns. But the points she tries to
make are largely lost in the sprawling
nature of her pageant. She has bitten off
more than she or anybody else could be
expected to chew over during two or
three hours at the theatre.
Her huge canvas demands that a
dozen actors must struggle with in-
numerable parts a situation which, as
usual, leads to much confusion about
who is playing what role at any given
time.
Only Colin Friels is
allowed to concentrate on the
single role of Lorenzo and
find a character. For the rest,
only caricature is possible.
Some, such as Dina Panozzo’s
indomitable charlady Fran-
cesca or Bob Hornery’s dirty
old Pope Sixtus IV are
brilliantly comic. But the cast-
ing situation overall pushes
the evening toward farce.
Then, another session of
didacticism sets in and it’s
back to the soapbox. Efforts to
feed fun-lovers with forced
sessions of jollity end in the
realm of undergraduate revue.
II Magnifico is a sadly iron-
ic failure. Intended, it seems,
as a defence of the arts in
general, it ends up an indict-
ment of theatre in particular.
Archer is a richly talented
and skilled performer and
much admired for that. But as
a writer for the stage she is
still a beginner. Nonetheless,
this is her third new work to
be staged around the country
this year. Her name, it seems,
can still be exploited success-
fully at the box office. And, as
government support con-
tinues to be withdrawn, it is at
the box office that all theatre
companies must struggle for
survival.
Yet, if standards continue
to fall in the process, that
struggle is self-defeating. □

DANCE
New Sleeping
Beauty in
mint condition
A scene from act 1 of The Sleeping Beauty: a good picture of what the Imperial Russian Ballet may have been like
By JOHN CARGHER
OPERA HAS no equivalent to the
unique trilogy of classical Russian bal-
lets, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty
and Nutcracker. The Australian Ballet
now has a complete set of productions
as varied as you could find anywhere,
co-incidentally staged by successive
artistic directors.
Anne Woolliams opted for an
updated Swan Lake beautifully done in
the manner pioneered by Nureyev and
many others. Marilyn Jones gave us an
inchoate Nutcracker by a modernistic
designer which looks like the Christmas
card it really is, all glitter and little
dance. Now, Maina Gielgud has gone
back to the grand old days of St
Petersburg’s La Belle au bois dormant.
She may call it The Sleeping Beauty but
it is so close to the original that she
might just as well have stuck to the
French title.
The Big Three of ballet were the
climax of a great tradition started in
France, perfected in Russia and
exported to the west in this century.
They flourish worldwide but seldom in
Andrea Troy as the wicked fairy Carabosse
such pristine purity as the latest
Australian offering. Tchaikovsky’s
music probably keeps alive these
outdated mimed plays with interpolated
dances created by choreographers such
as Marius Petipa. The central work has
its share of longueurs but nobody would
want to miss any of the music and it
stays uncut. Anyway, all fairy tales have
padding though few are padded as
beautifully as this.
The reputed $400,000 spent by
designer Hugh Coleman ensures this
Sleeping Beauty’s success at the box
office. It belongs to the 1890 s, not the
1980 s, and gives a very good picture of
what the splendors of the Imperial
Russian Ballet must have been like. The
only innovation is the taking literally of
Princess Aurora’s 100 years sleep; she
wakes in a stylised 19th century, having
dropped off in the 18th, but Coleman
does it so discreetly that it never jars.
Choreographically, there is a direct
link to Petipa through Nicolas Sergeyev
who worked with the old man himself
and re-staged his Beauty in Russia in
1914 and again at Sadler’s Wells in
1939. Even Diaghilev’s much changed
1921 revival (which failed) had Ser-
geyev at its helm. What Gielgud has
done is to get as close as possible to the
1939 version while cutting the lengthy
mimed story-telling which is incomp-
rehensible to today’s audience. (In 1890,
most ballet lovers could “speak” as well
as understand traditional mime
language.)
Only one other change by Gielgud is
of major importance and that succeeds


Christine Walsh and David Ashmole: the right kind of Panache
brilliantly: the wicked fairy Carabosse
has been turned into an attractive danc-
ing villainess and so she should be.
Carabosse is a,fairy, not a witch a fact
which seems to have escaped Petipa.
There remains the question whether
a small company with depleted ranks of
principals, such as the Australian Ballet,
can cope with such a monumental work.
There are no fewer than 22 dancing
parts with solos, many with more than
one! Sadler’s Wells did it with one cast
in widely spaced performances. The
Australian Ballet is staging it in long
seasons, playing nightly, and Gielgud’s
juggling of multiple casts must be a
mathematical nightmare. Using only the
best in each role, she might get away
with one top-rank set of soloists but
even the first two performances the
gala opening of the Victorian Arts
Centre theatres and the official premiere
had substantial weaknesses in casting.
In Christine Walsh and David
Ashmole (a very worthy recruit from the
Royal Ballet), who danced on both
evenings, she has at least an Aurora and
Prince Florimund as good as or better
than any to be found in this country
today. The Aurora pas de deux was
executed with the right kind of panache
and technical perfection. Walsh slams
into rock-hard solidity at the end of
even the most complex moves, as any
good ballerina assoluta should, and
Ashmole’s excellent technique is made
to look easy because he is a stylist of the
first order.
The rest of the cast is too large to
mention individually but Andrea Troy
flashed wickedly and brilliantly among
Carabosse’s superb monsters and Ulrike
Lytton was not far behind on the
following night. Stephen Heathcote
made much of the thankless
choreography of Florestan and a whole
bevy of upcoming beauties showed
much talent in many of the minor roles.
Whether the likes of Lisa Pavane or
Terese Power are ready for Aurora
remains to be seen. Pavane did not
shine as the Lilac Fairy, though she
danced competently, and the by-now
fully experienced Joanne Michel was
not really that much better.
The problem of “competence” was
best illustrated by the two Blue Bird
couples. Paul de Masson/Terese Power
and Greg Horsman/Fiona Tonkin were
competent all right. But they should be
crowd-pleasers to bring the house
down. They did not.
The Australian Ballet as now con-
stituted is a young company which
cannot be compared with international
ones, as once it was. Its new Sleeping
Beauty is good enough to be around for
a long time long enough for its
talented juniors to develop into the
Walsh/Ashmole class.
It is a pity that budgetary considera-
tions force extended seasons of works
such as these. Under the internationally
accepted system of nightly program
changes, this Beauty with only oc-
casional cast changes, could have been
sensational instead of merely very good.
Still, in these days of reducing subsidies
for our leading companies, we should
be grateful that anything as good as this
is on offer.
Congratulations, Miss Gielgud! □


TELEVISION
Another
fine state
of affairs
By RON SAW
IF THE ORGANISERS of the Logies
really want to be objective, instead of
just encouraging the overweening, they
should institute a different award: a
copper-plated dunce’s cap, to be worn
by the producers who with the greatest
distinction have failed to bring some-
thing to pass.
The first would have to go to the New
South Wales Film Corporation for al-
lowing its South Australian equivalent
to give it a kindergarten lesson in
documentary film-making.
The Australian Broadcasting Corp-
oration’s series Discovery, the programs
of which are nearly always splendid,
returns to television on December 4.
Two of the documentaries are
Australian and one of them, made by
the SA Film Corp, is about funnelweb
spiders and the search for an antidote to
their poison.
Now, the funnelweb is a frightful
creature on which NSW seems to have
exclusive rights. Only a few years ago, it
was killing more people in Sydney than
were sharks. So were ticks, for that
matter but neither species made such
terrifying headlines, so they were almost
ignored.
The search for an antidote was
covered, brilliantly, in The Bulletin by
Robert Drewe a couple of years ago. All
the hoo-ha about who was right and
who was not seemed to be between
NSW and Victoria yet it was only the
Croweaters who had the go to make it a
TV program.
Mind you, this could be the begin-
ning of something really big: NSW
should be able to make a powerful
documentary on Tasmanian Huon
pine; Queensland could sell, overseas
certainly, a good film on the Sydney-
Hobart yacht race; and the possibilities
of tidal power from north-western WA
could be a piece for the Victorians.
SOMETHING, I feel sure, must have
gone wrong with the machine that
writes the idiot-boards for the 10
Network.
In Sydney the other night, Ann
Sanders (the pretty girl who was trained
at the Daily News in Perth and can,
therefore, do no wrong) was reporting
on the troubles caused by striking doc-
tors in NSW. Among those dis-
advantaged, she said, were women with
“optoptic” pregnancies. She may, of
course, have coined a word for women
who have babies through their eyeballs
but it seems more than likely that the
idiot-boarders were trying to cope with
the word “ectopic.”
A few minutes later, Wonn Casey
(who, admittedly, can mangle words as
difficult as “cat,” “fish” and “owl”)
talked about the cricketing woes of “a
lacklustre Talsmania.”
So here we are on pronunciation yet
again and I wish most passionately that
Nicaragua would either become less
newsworthy or change its name to
something such as Turkey or even
Talsmania.
On the ABC in Sydney, both
Geraldine Doogue and Clive Hale
managed to make it “Nicker-arguer.”
I’m carping, you say. Possibly. Yet it
was reported on 0/28 that eight tongue-
tangled journalists in Peru were hacked
to death by peasants to whom their
pronunciation of “journalist” sounded
like “terrorist.”
MIKE AGOSTINI, the publisher-hypo-
chondriac-honorary consul and fitness
freak, has not enough to do.
He is, therefore, taking over 0/28’s
Sports Magazine while Les Murray is
travelling with the Socceroos.
IT IS hardly right or even humane
to say that a “good piece to camera”
could come from Ethiopia at present.
But Kate Lee’s piece for the 10 network
was good old-fashioned reporting
more than enough to remind viewers
that she is far more than just a talking
head.
Quickly, efficiently, she and her crew
got the most telling pictures and fitted
them with the simplest and most
passionate words. You cannot ask for
more than that.
“LOOK, BROTHER, you were born
dumb and you’ve been working your
way backward ever since.” That was
Arthur Augustus Calwell, as quoted by
Fred Daly when plugging The Last
Bastion (10). Shafts of wit such as that,
he said, just stopped you dead in your
tracks.
It might be time that Fred took his
retirement seriously.
WHY on Earth do people, typified by
Robert Trimbole, go to such trouble to
hide their faces from TV and press
cameras? The result of hiding behind
magazines, weskits, etc is that people
peer like mad; whereas, after one clear
look, the most determined rubberneck
would lose interest in a full-frontal nude
of Karen Pini.
I, FOR ONE, had always thought that
“Sikh” was pronounced “seek.” I
sneered gustily at Americans, on
Channel 9, who, in the wake of the
Gandhi assassination, pronounced it
“sick.” Then, on 0/28, a NSW north-
coast man pronounced it “sick” and
he was a Sikh (pronounced “sick”). □

Eastwood
steps into the
Duke’s boots
Clint Eastwood in Tightrope: the first Eastwood hero with doubts
By SANDRA HALL
HANDY with a gun, contemptuous of
wish-washy liberals and grumpily intent
on protecting the innocent in a world
increasingly threatened by the work of
perverts, psychopaths and the KGB,
Clint Eastwood has gradually assumed
the role in films that was once John
Wayne’s.
There are one or two differences.
Wayne never flinched; Eastwood does
frequently. Nonetheless, if Eastwood’s
heroes suffer the occasional nightmare
they never acknowledge a dilemma.
Used to taking the law into their own
hands, they are sustained by an
unthinking piety which they call moral
responsibility and which enables them
to do more or less as they like.
But Eastwood is getting older (54 last
May) and, unlike Wayne, mellower with
it. So, in his new thriller, Tightrope, we
have the first Eastwood hero with
doubts.
His new character, burdened with
the bluntly improbable name Wes
Block, is another cop but, to underline
the change of mood, Eastwood and his
writer-director, Richard Tuggle, have
moved from their home ground the
Californian coast to New Orleans
where the French Quarter becomes the
setting for a busily contrived story
about a psychopath who strangles pros-
titutes.
Ostensibly, Wes is more respectable
than Harry. He is the domesticated and
loving father of two daughters with a
house in the suburbs. But he has had the
typical Eastwood luck in falling foul of
a difficult woman and he is bringing up
his daughters alone because his wife,
grown bored during the long hours he
had to spend at the station, has gone off
searching for a more interesting life.
So Wes is lonely and vulnerable, the
script suggests, although you are forced
to make up your own mind on this
point, as Eastwood’s performance, in
the manner of all Eastwood perform-
ances, offers few clues. When proposi-
tioned by every potential witness he
meets during his strollings around the
massage parlors, he does as he usually
does with women and takes their atten-
tions for granted. If he doesn’t exactly
give in with good grace, he doesn’t
waste much time in making up his mind
either. With a lordliness verging on
catatonia, he simply accepts what’s due.
Yet we are meant to divine from
these rather tepid interludes that Wes
and the psychopath have more than a
little in common.
Wes, we assume from this, is starting
to wonder about himself but the only
outward signs are a rather creepy twitch
he develops under his right eye
whenever he is telling fibs to the police
chief and a rise in his tequila intake.
But, if all this doesn’t quite add up to
a new maturity, there is the presence of
Genevieve Bujold as the head of the
local rape crisis centre. Admittedly,
strong-willed heroines are not new to
Eastwood pictures Sondra Locke
earned his approval in the last, Sudden
Impact, by systematically killing off her
sister’s rapist and getting away with it
but Bujold looks and acts the part,
which means she’s much too good for
everything else that’s going on around
her. For the plot is strewn with enough
red herrings to make Wes the slowest-
thinking detective of the decade.
As Eastwood films go, it is only
moderately violent. Most of the dying is
done off-screen, although there are one
or two memorably nasty touches,
together with copious viewings of naked
dead bodies and invitations to imagine
the worst. And, as usual, the villain is
dispatched as bloodily as possible
during a protracted finish staged with
an eye for both the macabre and the
revenge motive.
BRIAN McKENZIE’S discursively re-
vealing two-hour documentary, I’ll Be
Home For Christmas, seen for the first
time at the Sydney Film Festival earlier
this year, is observational cinema at its
most quietly provocative.
A study of a group of homeless men
who drift in and out of Melbourne’s
Royal Park drinking, talking and
gradually telling their stories to the
camera it works by stealth to disarm
suspicions of voyeurism and engage
your interest and your sympathy, so that
it eventually becomes a three-way ex-
change between subjects, film-makers
and audience.
McKenzie began the project almost
casually in 1981 while working on
another job. At first, he took
photographs of the men at a distance,
then he introduced himself and kept on
going back to them during the ensuing
months. Some members of the group
disappeared others joined it but as
McKenzie grew more serious about the
film, he began to concentrate on five of
the men, tracking them as they moved in
and out of welfare institutions and on
and off the bottle, examining the nature
of their extremely strong and sur-
prisingly humorous friendship.
There are a couple of uncomfortable
moments notably, when one man, a
Vietnam veteran (not one of the five)
becomes so upset by the presence of the
camera that he starts lunging toward it
but McKenzie is so
scrupulous in the business of letting the
men say what they want to say when
they want to say it that he avoids
completely the queasily anthropological
air often redolent of this kind of film-
making and achieves something both
touching and intimate in the best sense
of that over-worked word. □

Light shed
on Orwell’s
driving forces
By CLEMENT SEMMLER
IT IS Orwell’s year but I doubt if the
reams of print marking the event will
have conveyed as compelling and
memorable a picture of his unusual
personality and the political and social
effects of his writings as does next
Saturday’s BBC documentary (George
Orwell, November 17, ABC, 8.30 pm
EST).
Orwell, with characteristic
modesty, willed that no
biography be written of him.
But the Orwell estate in 1972
gave unrestricted access to his
papers to eminent political
writer and biographer
Bernard Crick. They were in
turn made available for this
documentary, produced this
year, with Crick acting as
adviser.
There are interviews with
Malcolm Muggeridge, Cyril
Connolly, Claude Cockburn
and others who knew Orwell;
hitherto unrevealed archival
material, both documents and
film; and the narration is
made up of Orwell’s words
from his novels and essays
from Down and Out in Paris
and London and The Road to
Wigan Pier to Animal Farm
and Nineteen Eighty-four a technique
which gives great impact.
At the end of two hours, viewers feel
as if they have known Orwell all his life;
they begin to understand what a formid-
able loner he was in a sense, the
political conscience of the 19305. For he
was determined to set down the truth as
he saw it something that many writers
of the left, in that crucial decade, could
not bring themselves to do and this
led him inexorably to write his
imaginative masterpieces of the entail-
ments of compulsory enthusiasm in
totalitarian politics.
We see his unusual, uncompromising
personality being forged as a schoolboy.
Connolly remembers that, when they
talked at their preparatory school,
Orwell (who, even then, stood apart
from his fellows) would ask questions
such as: “Would you drink a pint of
blood to save your father?” Sir Steven
Runciman, a fellow Etonian, recalls
that Orwell was not light-hearted com-
pany; he measured almost everything
with satirical objectivity.
When he put on rags and tatters to
investigate the conditions of poverty in
the slums of Paris and the British
industrial cities and wrote them into his
books, we can understand why he has
been spoken of as perhaps the best
reporter of his generation. Yet, as
Muggeridge recalls, “he tried to get
inside the skins of people downtrodden
and poor and never did”; Orwell
admitted that the class differences con-
fronting him were “like a wall of stone.”
The documentary amply demon-
strates, however, that Orwell’s greatest
strength was his capacity to stand out-
side the fashions of left-wing politics
while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on
the far vision of a realm of equality of
respect and of freedom of thought.
George Orwell: television tells his story convincingly
This comes home in the Spanish
Civil War sequences where, as a result
of some wonderful archival film and
telling interviews with those who fought
beside him, we begin to understand
that Orwell went to Spain neither
hypnotised by the catchcries of the
Popular Front nor to embrace com-
munism but solely to fight fascism. He
came away from Spain convinced that
the Communist Party had betrayed the
revolution by horribly persecuting
groups with which he had fought so
bravely for the people’s cause.
And so he spilled the Spanish beans,
so to say, in his Homage to Catalonia
(for which the rabid left never forgave
him) and from which extracts are read
to the background of the archival film I
have mentioned, with stunning effect.
It was inevitable, therefore - as the
documentary makes quite clear that
Orwell would write Animal Farm which,
with superb clarity and deadly satire,
brought out the simple and basic issues
of communist totalitarianism which so
many people of the time were busily
engaged in not facing. And just as
inevitable that, retreating as a dying
man to the remote island of Jura in the
Scottish Hebrides (where those still
living who knew him recall his last
years), he would write 1984 his great
and terrible projection of modern
possibilities, perhaps still probabilities.
For this, Orwell has left his name in
20th century dictionaries.
And the documentary shows the
reluctance to accept the former novel as
a great satire and the latter as a very
considerable work of political theory,
rather than of propaganda: there were
the narrow views of purists who disliked
any intrusion of politics into literature;
there was the tub-thumping of the
Marxists who denounced him “for
having run shrieking into the
arms of capitalist publishers
with a couple of horror
comics that brought him fame
and fortune”; and there was
especially the ignorance of so
many literary critics, then and
later, of the cold facts of
contemporary history.
In the end there is the
mutual agreement of Orwell
and Arthur Koestler that “his-
tory came to an end in 1936.”
For Orweil began by
embracing socialism; he ex-
perienced it face-to-face in
Catalonia and thereafter
forever distrusted its adher-
ants. When he came back
from Spain he wrote that he
had seen newspaper reports
which bore no relationship to
facts, victories reported where
there had been no fighting,
complete silence where hun-
dreds of men had been killed, troops
who had fought bravely denounced as
cowards and traitors, those who had
never seen a shot fired hailed as heroes,
eager intellectuals concerning
themselves with events which had not
happened.
History was being written not about
what had happened but about what
ought to have happened. Lies, said
Orwell, pass into history and what is
peculiar to our age is abandonment of
the idea that history can be written
truly.
Here is the story of one of the most
remarkable men of this century who
minded more than most of his con-
temporaries the loss of certainty
religious faith, class values, social hope
- which they all experienced. And here,
for once, television in a short span tells
the story more convincingly than do
any number of books and essays. □


BOOKS
Facets of a
city caught in
candid focus
Boys on Bondi, by William Yang and from the book Sydney Diary
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Sydney Diary: 1974-1984, by
William Yang. James Fraser, $45
A PROMISE MADE is a promise kept.
Therefore, when Jim Sharman’s film
didn’t happen, his born-again Chinese
friend coughed and said a -hem - or
whatever it is in Mandarin.
So Jim put up the loot and William
Yang or Willyoung and/or Willy
Young, as the photographer was known
until last year got his book.
His newly-found grass roots, inci-
dentally, were a sort of Life Begins at 40
birthday present from Mother Nature
but don’t let that get in the way. The
Australian born-and-bred Oriental al-
ways had a sneaky way with people: he
would pop up all over the place with his
camera and record this, that and the
other. No one objected because, for the
most part, no one noticed. Sydney
people were too intent on what
Sharman calls their incessant pursuit of
pleasure, ecstasy and desire to see
themselves in focus.
Now they can: beautifully laid out,
hard-covered, high-glossed and on sale
for $45 a thrill for some and a shock
for others because, if there is one thing
Yang does well, it is the snap he snaps
when the subject is caught napping.
This impulse which makes him go for
the runny make-up, the unguarded
moment, the Freudian slip, gives results.
There is sexy sleaze, Harry Seidler’s
knees and ladies of the Black and White
Committee caught on the floor with the
takings.
But the worst thing about photo-
graphing people is their vanity.. They
want to be seen but not like that. Judy
Davis comes out cranky, Dennis Lillee
dopey. For once, Jack Mundey is sort of
syrupy.
Patrick White has photophobia. He
adores Margaret Whitlam but will not
be snapped with her. In his opinion,
throwing people together is a photo-
graphic cliche. There is a funny picture
of the Living Legend wearing a
Christmas tree.
Much as Yang likes conversation, he
prefers parties where people do things
to one another. Enter Madam Lash and
1977’s sado-masochism which, accord-
ing to the happy snapper, went out of
fashion after too many people got into
it.
The “gay” scene lots of that
reached its peak in 1981 with massive
disco events. “Before AIDS, of course,”
as Yang points out.
His seascapes are lovely and grace
his walls. But there is a side which he
can’t resist, gut reaction stuff such as the
beautiful playboy maliciously blinded
by acid. Women find him even more
attractive now. Won’t hang him on his
wall, though. Don’t let that get in the
way, either.
This is Yang’s G-rated diary. The R
version is in his Bondi dwelling, ready
and waiting until his public has the
stomach for it. □


A luncher’s
view of
Melbourne
By EDMUND CAMPION
A Month of Lunches, by Kevin
Childs. Oxford, $14.99
No Return Ticket, by Clyde Packer.
Angus & Robertson, $14.95
THINK OF Melbourne and you think
of food and drink. So when publisher
Jim Hall persuaded journalist Kevin
Childs to put together a book of 28
interviews with Melburnians, play-
wright Jack Hibberd gave him
the title: “That sounds like a
month of lunches.”
Yet there’s no indigestion
here. The book is replete with
just the sort of salad conversa-
tions you might have with a
good lunch light but
healthy, inessential but inven-
tive. Photographs by Brian
Gilkes enable you to see who’s
talking. All in all, it’s exactly
the right holiday book for
beach, plane or train, cleverly
mixed by Kevin Childs to suit
any mood.
The sub-title says that the
lunchers “celebrate Mel-
bourne.” Curiously, I found
them more frequently whinge-
ing about the architectural
disasters of recent years.
There is a little bit of that
juvenile “We hate Sydney” stuff, but not
more than you would expect.
The book abounds in good stories.
Princess Margaret planted the custom-
ary royal tree in the botanic gardens
then refused to sign the visitors’ book.
Her tree has not prospered.
Prue (“I see myself as an anarchist”)
Acton knows a stockbroker who studies
the color of women’s fashion: the
brighter they are, the healthier the
stockmarket.
The genius of the Last Laugh theatre
restaurant, John Pinder, offered the
Moomba committee a new slogan
MOOMBA IS A JOKE. They turned
him down, politely.
Oh yes, A Month of Lunches will give
great delight. There are so many sur-
prises in it that it could start a new
holiday game: who should/should not
have been interviewed?
It is more difficult to know what to
make of No Return Ticket. It seems to
want to achieve for expatriate
Australians what Tall Poppies (B, 15
May) did for women. But where Tall
Poppies had an intellectual coherence,
this book seems to be little more than
transcriptions from an open tape
recorder. Where the interviewee is in the
theatre (Gordon Chater, Judith Ander-
son, Zoe Caldwell, Sumner Locke
Elliott) a list of stage appearances is
added. For the most part, this informa-
tion seems accurate.
One interview, however, stands out
from this otherwise vapid book.
Maxwell Newton is a journalist who’s
career has been almost operatic. From
being founding editor of The Australian,
he sank to a gutter life of booze, drugs
and call girls before climbing back.
Remarkably, he tells this story himself
in a voice that tears through the
authorial confines of No Return Ticket.
The Newton interview alone rescues the
book. □

Perceptions
from works
for children
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
Australia Through the Looking
Glass, by Brenda Niall. Melbourne
University Press, $25.
The Oxford Companion to
Children’s Literature, by
Humphrey Carpenter and Mari
Prichard, $35.
ANYONE interested in the slow pro-
cess whereby Australians were gradu-
ally emancipated from being second-
hand and second-rate British will enjoy
Brenda Niall’s book which, she says, is
not a history of fiction written for
children in this country but “con-
centrates on perceptions of Australian
life in books for children.” A flourishing
and independent children’s literature is
an essential part of national maturity.
Niall has already written an excellent
book on Mary Grant Bruce and Ethel
Turner and this one likewise reveals
scholarship and a lively mind and style.
Australia as a new source of “adven-
tures unlimited” made the bush, the
outback and station life the home of the
true Australia. Turner was most aud-
acious in successfully removing the
scene to Sydney, although she ran foul
of British prejudice when she intro-
duced Australian slang and even
mentioned The Bulletin, notorious for
its republicanism.
William Steele, Melbourne manager
of her London publishers, Ward Lock,
asked her to remove the name of The
Bulletin from a story and substitute that
of Punch.
Steele wrote to her in 1895 about her
new book, The Little Larrikin, suggest-
ing that Australia was being too much
for her: “A little English experience
would help to (excuse me so putting it)
correct the free and easy, somewhat
rowdy associations due to atmosphere,
climate, environment and the influence
of The Bulletin ... To ensure your
complete success, the English people
must be reckoned with and that is why I
advocate your staying for a time in their
midst.”
Fortunately, Turner married Herbert
Curlewis instead.
If we gained Turner, we lost Pamela
Travers author of Mary Poppins
who was born in Queensland. Niall
quotes an interesting autobiographical
piece by Travers explaining why she
could not write about Australia. As
Niall says, “the land, lacking an access-
ible mythology, offered nothing to her
imaginative inner world.” Australian
children’s literature has come a long
way; a wonderful book, Patricia
Wrightson’s The Nargun and the Stars,
offers just such a mythology.
Niall’s judgments of authors and
books are trenchant and independent.
For instance, she does justice to Colin
Thiele who unbelievably (perhaps
because he does not come from the
eastern states) did not win an Australian
Children’s Book Award until 1982;
again, she has some deservedly harsh
things to say about Ivan Southall’s
award-winning To the Wild Sky.
The only drawback to Niall’s book is
the self-imposed limitation that it dis-
cusses only fiction, thereby bolstering
once again the academic tendency to
overvalue fiction as against non-fiction.
She says that Cole’s Funny Picture Book,
“a major event in colonial publishing
history, would be central to any study of
Australian children’s reading.” But it is
outside the scope of her survey.
Pleasingly, Cole’s rates an entry in
The Oxford Companion to Children’s
Literature. The Australian coverage is
thorough, in a book that is com-
prehensive in every way. It is hard to


stop reading Oxford’s Companion.
Apart from gathering fresh information,
one’s own childhood memories are
stirred.
Like millions of other children, I was
brought up on Struwwelpeter and Max
and Moritz and did not become a sadist
or masochist before lily-livered
educators and librarians declared them
too cruel for children. But I had
forgotten the splendid sequel to Max
and Moritz (the precursor of comic
strips) when those naughty boys end up
being bundled into bags and given to a
miller who unwittingly grinds them into
little pieces which are then eaten by
ducks.
Long live the macabre!
The Companion gives one of the
superb illustrations of Lord Basil
Blackwood (“8.T.8.”) and a verse from
one of Hilaire Belloc’s immortal series
about Bad and Worse Children. “What!
Would you slap the porcupine! /
Unhappy child desist! / Alas! that
any friend of mine / Should turn Tupto-
philist.” Below it is Belloc’s tongue-in-
cheek pedantic note, pointing out the
Greek derivation of the word and that it
really does not exist.
The odious practice of writing down
to children, the Dr Seuss syndrome, did
not come till later. Even Huck Finn
bumps into Shakespeare.
One of my few criticisms of the
Companion is that it leaves out the
classics.
Generations of children were
brought up on the Odyssey
and the Iliad but neither of
those epics, nor Homer, rates
a mention.
On the other hand, it is
fascinating to read about
“Toilet Books, a type of book,
with moveable flaps,” for
ladies’ dressing tables. Or that
Kenneth Grahame, married
for the first time at 40 and
“shattered and repelled” by
adult sexuality, turned to the
river and its animals and
wrote The Wind in the
Willows. The book was turned
down by Everybody’s, the
magazine for which it was
written, and Grahame’s
agents Curtis Brown had
great difficulty in finding a
publisher.
Or that The Big Bad Wolf
in Disney’s Three Little Pigs
was taken as a symbol of the
Depression. Or that Bagheera
in Disney’s version of The
Jungle Books is addressed as
Baggy-Buddy. Or ... one
needs 587 pages, stopping at
Z, to do full justice to The
Oxford Companion to
Children's Literature. □
BOOK BULLETIN
On the interview trail
by Patricia Rolfe
WE REPORTED a few months ago that
Alan Davidson, promotions manager for
Macmillan, arranged more than 70 in-
terviews for English marriage specialist
Claire Rayner (an expenditure of energy
not reflected too well in sales). Now,
Maggie Chrystal of Pan Books reports
that she totted up 97 interviews in two
weeks for novelist Clare Francis and her
book Night Sky. Who will be the first
hard-working PR to break a hundred
or break an author?
Night Sky made Francis a dollar
millionaire before a copy of the book
was sold.
She received an advance of $600,000
from Warners for US paperback rights
and the book was the most expensive
acquisition British publisher Pan/
Heinemann had made.
Chrystal says that, with authors on
tour, it is not the quantity but the quality
of interviews that tests. Good inter-
viewers are much less tiring.
Regional radio interviews build the
total. These are mostly live. The author
may find herself at the other end of the
phone at any time or in any place. But
these interviewers who do not have a
battery of researchers are, Chrystal
Page of the Nineteen Eighty-Four typescript
says, usually well prepared. Sometimes,
they have even read the book.
NINETEEN eighty-four might not
have been the year of Big Brother but it
has been a good one for publishers of
the works of George Orwell. Penguin
have sold nearly 90,000 copies of the
paperback of Nineteen Eighty-Four in
the past year. With the release of the
film they have sold 20,000 in the past
month.
Bill West, who edited Orwell: The
War Broadcasts for BBC/Pitman, was
in Australia recently. West said that
Orwell’s war work, preparing broad-
casts for the BBC, was generally written
off as wasted time.
Going through the mass of unpub-
lished Orwell material in the BBC
archives, West decided that not only did
Orwell put a lot of work into his
programs but he found inspiration
there. The theme of Animal Farm was
derived from a talk about a pig farm
and Nineteen Eighty-Four can be traced
to Orwell’s experiences with the
ministry of Information and its censors.
Seeker and Warburg have recently
published a facsimile of the ms of
Nineteen Eighty-Four, at $65.
Orwell habitually destroyed
his typescripts but 183 of this
book were found recently.
JOHN UPDIKE’S new novel,
The Witches Of Eastwick,
which was to have been
published by Rigby will now,
following the end of Rigby,
come from Lansdowne this
month. Frank Thompson ap-
proached Updike’s British
publisher, Andre Deutsch, at
the Frankfurt Book Fair last
year and talked Deutsch into
letting him have the rights.
Thompson published Up-
dike’s The Coup when at the
University of Queensland
Press.
Updike said in a recent
interview that he had four
studies, all quite small and
former servants’ rooms, in
his Boston house. One is for
reading, one with a word pro-
cessor is for writing essays
and reviews, one with a view
of the sea is where he wrote
The Witches by hand, in
pencil and a fourth is for
answering mail.

The slum area of Port Sudan which Ethiopian refugees share with the poorest elements of the Sudanese population
A large part of Africa, of which Ethiopia is the focal point, is in the grip offamine
with millions of lives at stake. ROBERT DARROCH tells how it almost passed
without notice until exposed by a BBC camera crew.
THE EXTENT of the Ethiopian famine
would have passed almost unnoticed in
the affluent west had it not been for the
footage shot by a BBC television crew
fronted by its southern Africa
correspondent Michael Buerk.
Buerk’s report, first broadcast on the
UK 6 o’clock news on October 23,
caused a furore. The scenes of
thousands of starving children raking
the dust of the provincial town of
Korem for stray grains of wheat, of the
matchstick limbs of dying babies, of the
desperate faces of a people brought to
the brink of death, touched every
viewer.
Within minutes the BBC’s switch-
boards were jammed with offers of help.
The next day British charities were
overwhelmed with calls. Within 36
hours one charity alone, the Save the
Children Fund, got pledges from more
than 10,000 people. In the following
week £2 million (5A2.96 million) was
received by Save the Children, £1
million (5A1.48 million) by Oxfam and
millions more by other charities.
Buerk’s poignant film was syn-
dicated round the globe, evoking con-
cern wherever it was shown. In the
United States President Reagan com-
mitted SUS4S million for aid to
Ethiopia. The European Common
Market announced shipments of
surplus grain. In Australia Prime
Minister Hawke promised instant help.
While the west’s response was
remarkable, many people were not
aware that Ethiopia was but one of 16
African nations in the grip of starvation.
In Chad 2000 have died and 200,000
more are in peril. In Mali 2.5 million are
in danger. In Mauritania 1.7 million are
short of food. In Senegal 1.1 million are
starving. The same in Burkina Fago and
in Niger. In the Sudan, where 500,000
Ethiopians have taken refuge, and
many more turned back, there is an

acute food shortage, threatening
millions. In Somalia, which has taken in
700,000 Ethiopian refugees, the 1984
crop has also failed. In Mozambique 4.7
million have fled the land.
Buerk’s report galvanised news edi-
tors from Scandinavia to New Zealand.
Famine footage was at a premium.
Ethiopian embassies were beseiged by
reporters and film crews demanding
visas. Given the information that six
million Ethiopians were scheduled to
die in the northern provinces of Tigre
and Wollo, there was clearly a vast
untapped reservoir of human interest
stories waiting to be exploited.

The London Observer reported one
resulting incident. A “trendy” television
reporter (“designer jeans, boots and
cravat”) was seen in Addis Ababa
asking “What is Tigre?” Her ac-
companying crew, reported the
newspaper, attempted to film a dis-
tressed family carrying their dead child
across a plain. “The crew ordered it to
stop while they set up their cameras to
film it. A signal was given and the sad
cortege moved off, in focus. Then a cry
went up for the family to stop because
something was wrong with the camera.
The bewildered family waited until it
was given the go-ahead to set off again.”
Fleet Street and their ilk elsewhere
fell over each other to be the first to give
the readers the satisfaction of seeing
“their” aid reach Ethiopia. Robert
Maxwell, proprietor of the London
Daily Mirror group, chartered his own
Mirror jet to fly 30 tonnes of supplies to
Addis Ababa, accompanied by the pro-
prietor himself, four reporters and
ancillary photographers.
Each of the group’s titles milked the
stunt ruthlessly. “To the beat of a tribal
drum and a song of welcome from 3000
starving children, the Mirror group’s
mercy convoy today drove into the
heart of Ethiopia’s disaster area,” wrote
John Smith of the Sunday People.
“ ’Welcome stranger, welcome to our

land,’ the starving children sang.”
Alastair Campbell, of the stablemate
Sunday Mirror, chimed in: “Within
minutes our truck was besieged by
hundreds of emaciated yet beaming
children.”
A cynical rival paper pointed out,
rather unkindly, that the Mirror’s con-
tribution added up to 12 minutes of one
day’s need. Maxwell responded by
saying the gesture was intended only to
show what could be done.
The media reaction confirmed the
adage that news is where the newsmen
are (or, these days, where good TV
footage is). For, as TV critic Alexander
Chancellor pointed out in the London
Spectator, just as the 1974 Ethiopian
famine which served to topple the

feudal regime of Haile Selassie and
instal the Marxist one of Colonel
Mengistu was known as “the
Dimbleby Famine,” after Jonathan
Dimbleby’s report of that earlier disas-
ter, so the 1984 reprise will go down as
the Buerk Famine.
Because the unpalatable truth is that
though the Ethiopian disaster may be
news, it is not new. It took the Buerk
footage to make the disaster “real.”
The origins of the famine go back
years, if not centuries. The Ethiopian
government the world’s third poorest
has run annual famine appeals for the
past 10 years. International agencies
and charities are well aware of
Ethiopia’s problems. It was not they,
still less the Ethiopian government, who
were caught out by the more immediate
causes of the disaster. These roots are
traceable to the failure of the sorgum
crop in Wollo and Tigre in 1982,
following which peasants began to drift
off their land and gather at government
centres where food would be available,
partly from local stores, partly from
overseas agencies such as the Food and
Agriculture Organisation.
By January last year 5000 families
encamped round Korem were being fed
from government stores. Officials
pleaded with them to go back to their
land and plant next year’s crops. They
refused. At this point warnings began to
go out that a disaster similar to that of
1974 when 250,000 people died was
likely to happen.
At the beginning of this year the
Ethiopian government’s own relief
agency appealed for 900,000 tonnes of
grain. In March, Ethiopian Com-
missioner for Relief Major Georgis
forecast that if the rains failed again and
more food aid was not forthcoming, up
to 5 million peasants would starve. By
May the Korem centre was feeding
150,000 and deaths in the camps nearby
were running at 25 a day.
The rains did fail and the numbers of
peasants leaving their land, having eat-
en their seed corn and chopped down
their trees for firewood and having sold
all their possessions, mounted,
To outsiders, the simple solution
would seem to be to pump food into
Ethiopia at the required rate. However,


A peasant woman returns with her meagre provisions from a market in Mauritania

the stark realfty is that Ethiopia does
not have the infrastructure to handle
even a minor disaster, let alone one of
this magnitude.
What is happening in Ethiopia is not
primarily a famine. “What we see in
Ethiopia is a social and political col-
lapse,” said ohe expert. “Only sending
food to the distribution centres is treat-
ing the effect and may in fact be making
the underlying causes worse.”
Evidence of the true nature of the
crisis has been emerging slowly. In
September the Ethiopian government
spent vast sums to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the Mengistu regime
(this delayed the “breaking” of the
famine story until October, for the
regime didn’t want any unfavorable
publicity to spoil the celebrations).
From the stories coming out of
Ethiopia from reasonably uncommitted
sources it appears the Mengistu regime
had been somewhat slow in embracing
the cause of the relief of their own
famine. According to one source, it took
a formal demarche by the Italian am-
bassador in Addis Ababa, backed by the
entire western diplomatic corps, to get
Mengistu to set up a committee to co-
ordinate the relief effort and cut through
the tangle of red tape that was
hamstringing any serious attempt to get
the gathering food convoys through.
Even then it took a video tape of the
Buerk report to bring the reality of what
was happening in Tigre and Wollo to
officials in Addis Ababa. Moreover, it
inspired Mengistu to call in all the
eastern bloc envoys and demand what
they were doing to match the western
effort. The Soviet envoy, chief adviser to
the junta, flew to Moscow and within
days a huge Russian airlift of equip-
ment was announced, with other
Warsaw Pact nations following suit.
Such activity, however, came very
late, too late for countless thousands of
peasants. Probably the most telling
piece of evidence about the real cause of
the disaster came in a letter to The Times
from Dr Keith Griffin, president of
Magdalen College, Oxford. He led a
large team of experts to Ethiopia in
1982 to report on famine alleviation.
Griffin said he had warned the
Ethiopian government that population
was outstripping food resources at an
alarming rate and that food shortages
would occur as soon as rainfall hit a low
cycle. “If they had done what we
recommended people would not be
dying now,” said Griffin.
The point about population was
echoed by a number of people. Com-
edian Spike Milligan, whose seriousness
in such cases is not doubted, wrote to
the Guardian: “Another avenue to
relieve suffering would be to prevent the
birth of starving children. A loaf and a
pill would be an enlightened move.” □

ESPIONAGE
The great superpower spy war
The Kremlin: vast resources are devoted to infiltrating other countries’ spy services
By ROBERT S. DUDNEY
and
ORR KELLY
WITH THE arrest of the first FBI agent
ever accused as a Soviet spy, the public
is getting a rare look at a high-stakes
war being waged by two old adversaries
the espionage agencies of the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Fought with sex, money, blackmail
and even violence, this spy war has a
goal that goes far beyond theft of plans
for a new gun or an advanced piece of
technology. The stakes are the most
closely held secrets of the intelligence
services whose operations are crucial to
national security.
Amid a deepening chill between the
superpowers, the prospect of penetra-
tion is an ever-present concern. Both
sides are waging a relentless campaign
to plant operatives within one another’s
spy services.
For America, the chief target is
Moscow’s Committee for State Security
the KGB. For the Kremlin, it is the
Central Intelligence Agency.
In this shadow world of lies, decep-
tion, double crosses and double agents,
no one can say for certain which side
holds the upper hand. Both powers can
lay claim to major victories but both
have suffered costly and embarrassing
defeats.
For the US, the latest setback came
from an unlikely quarter the FBI, an
agency that long has boasted a blemish-
free record. Its spyproof image was
shattered in September with the arrest
of Richard W. Miller, 47, a 20-year
veteran accused of acting as an agent
Richard Miller: FBI agent turned traitor
UPI
The government claims that the debt-
strapped agent, married and the father
of eight children, sought $65,000 from
the KGB.
The extent of the damage is not clear
but Miller admits to having given
Moscow a 25-page classified document
which officials say would provide the
KGB with a detailed picture of US
intelligence activities, techniques and
requirements. The document did not,
however, spell out names of active
agents or details of current operations.
In the never-ending spy war, both
sides have found willing double agents.
A KGB “mole” spent years working
inside Britain’s code-breaking centre,
diverting super-secret US intelligence
data to Moscow. America had a man
inside Polish intelligence, blowing the
cover on Soviet spy operations in the
US as recently as last year.
CIA director William Casey boasts
that his agency last year helped give the
KGB the worst setback in its history,
aiding in expulsion of some 135 Soviet
spies worldwide. Yet some critics in a
position to know fear that US services
particularly the CIA are being placed
at a disadvantage in the competition
with their Soviet rivals.
“Today, the CIA is reluctant to mix it
up with the KGB,” asserts a knowledge-
able US official. “It’s a dicey game. Lots
of things can go wrong. They are not out
there in every nook and cranny trying to
roll up the KGB.”
The prospect of a Soviet mole’s bur-
for the Soviet Union in the bureau’s Los
Angeles office.
The charge against Miller: Peddling
secrets to a Soviet emigre named
Svetlana Ogorodnikova, 34, a self-pro-
claimed KGB major who allegedly
lured him into a personal relationship
and then offered money for classified
documents.


CIA director William Casey: boasts of giving the KGB its worst setback
rowing into top US intelligence
echelons has haunted America ever
since the defection of Kim Philby, one
of Britian’s most senior intelligence
officials, to Russia some 20 years ago.
US jitters worsened when Heinz Felfe, a
senior West German counterspy,
surfaced as a KGB plant in the 50s.
The CIA itself was thrown into
turmoil in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s
by counterspy James Angleton’s sus-
picions which he never proved and
which many ridiculed that a KGB
operative had penetrated the upper
reaches of his agency. Angleton left the
CIA in 1975.
The Kremlin devotes vast resources
to infiltrating other spy services.
Thousands work for the KGB, under
the command of Marshal Viktor
Chebrikov. Still more are employed by
the military-intelligence arm known as
GRU. They are supported by east
European spy agencies.
By itself, the KGB is said to have
10,000 espionage officers assigned
strictly to foreign spying including
500 in the US on diplomatic missions.
Says a senior FBI official, wryly: “We
are blessed with the best agents the
KGB has to offer. They are smooth and
westernised. They cultivate relation-
ships with everyone from clerks to
company presidents.”
The clearest penetration of the CIA
came to light in late 1980 with the arrest
of David Henry Barnett who remains
the only member of the ClA’s officer
ranks to be publicly unmasked as a
KGB operative.
After working under cover for the
agency in Indonesia through the 19605,
Barnett now serving 18 years in
prison resigned in 1970 to start a
private business in Jakarta. But within a
few years, his commercial venture col-
lapsed and financial losses mounted.
In 1976, Barnett $lOO,OOO in debt
turned to the KGB for help. In
Vienna and Jakarta, he delivered Am-
erican defence information including
data about a secret CIA operation to
the KGB. He disclosed the names of
Indonesians co-operating with the CIA
and furnished the identities of CIA
employees and Soviet employees
targeted by the US for recruitment.
Overall, the KGB paid Barnett
almost $90,000. Before Barnett’s arrest,
the Soviet spy service also instructed
him to re-enter the spy field a move
that would have placed an active KGB
mole in US intelligence.
Another case involving similar
charges is being thrashed out in federal
court. Richard Craig Smith, a former
army counter-intelligence official, was
indicted this year on charges of selling
secret information about American
double agents to Moscow. As part of his
duties, Smith was responsible for hand-
ling some of the military’s “doubles”
soldiers who pretend to be disloyal to
the US and to co-operate with the KGB,
although they secretly operate under
American control. In this way the US
tries to learn identities, interests and
methods of KGB agents.
But in 1982, US officials charge,
Smith became a turncoat and contacted
a KGB agent in Tokyo to offer informa-
tion about army double agents in ex-
change for money. Prosecutors say that
Smith gave Moscow enough informa-
tion to identify clearly at least one
double agent, code-named “Royal
Miter,” as well as clues to identities of
five others.
While the US charges that he ac-
cepted about $lO,OOO from the KGB
and was promised SUS 150,000 Smith
denies betraying his country. He insists
that he was playing a double-agent
game to discover secret Soviet opera-
tions under the guise of committing
treason. A federal jury next year is
expected to decide if he has been telling
the truth.
In an unquestioned espionage coup,
the KGB in 1978 obtained a classified
manual exposing details of the top-
secret KH-11 reconnaissance satellite
from CIA worker William P. Kampiles.
It had learned CIA communications
secrets by penetrating TRW Systems
Group, Inc, a major technology con-
tractor. Among those arrested was TRW
security officer Christopher John Boyce.
WASHINGTON, too, has pulled off
notable successes in what has become a
global cloak-and-dagger effort to com-
promise Soviet spy services. As early as
the 1950 s and 60s and even more so
today the CIA received exceedingly
valuable information about KGB
operations from Soviet defectors.
Moreover, some of the most effective
intelligence breaks involve the spies of
Soviet allies. For years, insiders say, the
CIA received regular reports from a
highly-placed mole in Warsaw who
provided not only inside information
on the Polish but also invaluable in-
sights into the operations of the KGB.
Information from this source helped
crack two of Washington’s most import-
ant counter-espionage cases of recent
years.
In one, his tips led to the FBl’s
capture of Soviet agent James Durward
Harper Jr, in 1983. Harper, of Cal-
ifornia, pleaded guilty of selling
classified data about America’s Minute-
man missiles and anti-ballistic-missile
defence technology.
Even as Harper was carrying out his
espionage tasks, America’s Polish mole
was discussing the case with Harper’s
Polish case officer. The mole passed on
the entire story to US agents includ-
ing word that the Poles had received
congratulations from Yuri Andropov,
the late Soviet president and former
KGB chief.
The existence of the Polish mole,
now living in the west under a new
identity, was revealed by the FBI at the
time of Harper’s arrest. His role in
breaking an earlier case was not made
public at the time because he was,still
working in place as an agent.
In that earlier case, Marian
Zacharski, a Polish “businessman” on
intelligence assignment in the US, and
American defence industry employee
William Holden Bell were found guilty
of espionage in Los Angeles in 1981.
Zacharski and Bell reportedly passed
on top-secret information about critical
“stealth” aircraft technology and the
radar used in US fighter planes.
The Harper and Bell cases are

recruitment of people from
the Soviet bloc is done among
those who visit the west and
return home as agents. Like-
wise, Moscow does much of
its recruiting in countries
other than the US because of
the danger of surveillance by
the FBI there.
This technique is illus-
trated by the case of
Aleksandr Ogorodnik. While
at the Soviet Embassy in
Bogota, Ogorodnik contacted
the CIA. Re-assigned to
Moscow in 1975 and with
access to KGB data,
Ogorodnik reportedly passed
the CIA hundreds of docu-
ments. He was uncovered and
arrested in 1977, however, and
is believed to have committed
suicide.
In a similar case, Anatoly
N. Filatov who was a colonel
in Soviet military intelligence, was
recruited by the CIA in Algiers during
the mid-19705. Over 14 months, Filatov
is said to have given the US details of
Soviet involvement in guerilla conflicts
among other matters. Re-assigned to
Moscow in the late 19705, the spy
continued to pass secrets to the CIA.
Yet, within months of his return, the
KGB apprehended Filatov. He received
a death sentence which was reduced to
15 years. The US never was sure if the
“burning” of Filatov resulted from good
Soviet detective work or betrayal.
IN THE KGB war against the CIA
another fruitful technique has been to
attack the US by working to comprom-
ise agents in an allied spy service.
A classical penetration of such an
intelligence service occurred in the case
of Geoffrey Arthur Prime who is serving
a 38-year prison term in Britain. He is
believed to have been responsible for
one of the longest and most damaging
Soviet infiltrations of western in-
telligence in the post-war era.
Prime, recruited by the KGB in 1967,
was a translator of intercepted Soviet
communications at London’s top-secret
electronic communications centre in
Cheltenham in western England. He
regularly had access to highly-classified
material flowing into Cheltenham from
satellites and ground stations around
the world.
Geoffrey Prime: US secrets gravely compromised
CAMERA PRESS (BRYAN HANKINS/RBO)
Between 1968 and 1977, he told
Moscow’s agents which Soviet codes
had been broken, how so and which
communications were being picked up
by allied intelligence. Prime handled
material after it had passed through
code-cracking computers. Because
virtually all data processed at
Cheltenham came from US eavesdrop-
ping devices, a British investigation
concludes: “US secrets have been no
less gravely compromised than our
own.”
Another damaging Soviet coup
scored by outflanking American in-
telligence involved South African Com-
modore Dieter Felix Gerhardt. The
officer enjoyed access to an enormous
quantity of western military secrets. As
naval attache in London, he visited
English and US naval bases to learn
about electronic warfare and exchanged
information with other western spy
officials.
Finally, Gerhardt assumed com-
mand of the vast Simonstown naval
station in South Africa. This gave him
full access to the massive Silvermine
communications centre, US electronic
intelligence and many North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation codes. When
Gerhardt was unmasked in 1982 by
South African intelligence, stunned US
intelligence officials found he had
worked for the KGB at least since 1965.
Even his wife was a Soviet agent, wed
for the purpose of protecting
his “cover”.
Of all the techniques of US
spycraft, few are as valuable
as the stratagem of double
agents. American officers have
been able to identify and
deceive Soviet operatives time
after time. For instance, the
FBI once set up an elaborate
trap, using a US navy officer
as bait, to catch two Soviet
spies operating as diplomats
in New York.
After years of preparation
and payment of thousands of
dollars to the American for
secret anti-submarine-warfare
information, Valdik A. Enger
and Rudolf P. Chernyayev
both Soviet United Nations
employees were arrested
and convicted of espionage. A
third diplomat, Vladimir P.
Zinyakin, was forced to leave
the US in the same affair.
Enger and Chernyayev were
sentenced to 50 years in jail
but returned to Russia in 1978
in a prisoner swap.
Another American
“double” operation that goes
back several years finally paid
off recently in the arrest of an
alleged East German agent-
courier, 67-year-old Alice Michelson, in
New York.
The case began three years ago when
a sergeant in the US army who was
stationed in West Germany reported to
his superiors that a KGB agent had tried
to recruit him. Encouraged by US
authorities to play along, the soldier
continued to meet the KGB represen-
tatives even on return to the US. The
Soviets equipped him with a miniature
tape recorder, a secret writing pad and
codes and twice sent him to Mexico for
training in the craft of spying.
Michelson was nabbed when the
American “double” handed her a secret
tape recording hidden in a cigarette
packet.
The possibility of a spy’s being a
double or even triple agent is a constant
threat to both the Soviets and Ameri-
cans. Consider the strange case of
Nicholas Shadrin, a Soviet naval officer
who defected to the US in 1959, deliver-
ing a trove of intelligence about the
Russian fleet.
Years after arriving in America,
Shadrin his real name was Nikolai F.
Artamonov agreed to become a
double agent for the FBI. Over the next
few years, he slipped the Soviets care-
fully doctored US “secrets” reporting
back to the FBI on KGB activities,
In 1975, Shadrin vanished during a
rendezvous with Soviet agents in
Vienna. What actually happened

His great grandson
still does.
When Thomas Gooper
started selling his brew around
Adelaide in 1862, it caused
quite a sensation. There was a
lot of speculation about how he
created the ale's unique and
naturally pleasant taste. Some
had heard about the oak casks
he used to ferment his brew in,
others that he matured the
brew in the bottle. But as far as
Thomas' care and attention to
his brew's final taste is
concerned, they are only too
small parts of the story.
Tb start with, Thomas used
a centuries old method known
as the naturally conditioned top
fermentation process. In this
natural process the ale is
brewed in open vats,
then transferred to oak
casks to ferment
After a week in the
casks it is bottled
with added sugar and
yeast, and left for six
weeks to naturally
carbonate and mature.
Which accounts for its
unique cloudy
appearance. Finally,
Thomas released it to
the public. And
though the Gooper
brewing business has
stayed in the family for
four generations, not
one descendant has
seen fit to change the original
recipe or methods.
Which is why his great
grandson Bill still ferments all
his brews in oak as soon as it
comes out of the vat And why
today you can still enjoy an
aged in wood traditional family
ale, with a real family tradition.
And a very special taste.
Coopers Ale.
Taste the difference family tradition makes

The ClA’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters: thousands of agents are involved in preventing infiltration
remains a mystery. Most US officials
believe that he was kidnapped but
some question whether Shadrin ever
was a bona fide defector. They suggest
that he may simply have returned to the
USSR after completing a KGB assign-
ment.
WHEN it comes to luring Soviet spies
to defect, American agencies can play
two important cards the political
freedom to be found in the west and a
less restrictive lifestyle. This gives them
a major edge in numbers and quality of
defectors, both of which pay off in an
enormous volume of information about
goings-on behind the iron curtain.
One US intelligence expert
maintains that Moscow gets virtually no
turncoats from the west while “we get
one or two good-sized Russian fish each
year. Our heavy knowledge of their
system comes from their defectors.”
The damage that defectors can cause
was demonstrated in 1978 when Arkady
Shevchenko, a senior diplomat in the
UN secretariat, sought asylum. A
protege and close associate of Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, he
gave the US intimate details of Soviet
arms control strategy.
These defectors sometimes remain in
place for a while, passing information
from inside the Soviet system. One
western authority on the KGB, John
Barron, maintains that Shevchenko had
been co-operating with the US for at
least 30 months before he made his
break.
American intelligence also benefits
from Soviet defections to friendly
western nations. Vladimir Kuzichkin, a
KGB major, in 1982 defected to the
British from his post in Iran where he
had served as a key intelligence
operative. Kuzichkin brought with him
vast knowledge of the Soviet espionage
network in the Middle East even
names of key agents. US intelligence
was given access to Kuzichkin’s in-
formation, which told much about KGB
operations in Iran.
EXOTIC as the techniques of the spy
war can be, the battle against Soviet
spying also continues along more con-
ventional lines specifically identifica-
tion of suspected KGB agents and close
surveillance of their every movement.
The value of this kind of dogged
detective work was demonstrated in the
case of Joseph Helmich, a former army
cryptographer who is serving a life
prison sentence for his treacherous
dealings with the KGB.
As a young army warrant officer
stationed in Paris in the early 19605,
Helmich sold highly classified com-
munications codes to Soviet agents.
These secrets, the government
maintains, could have enabled Moscow
to decipher and read all US messages
“scrambled” for security reasons during
the Vietnam war a service for which
the KGB paid more than $lOO,OOO.
In August 1980, more than 17 years
after Helmich committed his crimes, the
US finally caught up with him. Reason:
FBI agents conducting routine surveil-
lance on Soviet agents in New York
spotted Helmich talking with the sus-
pect Russians. Helmich pleaded guilty
to spy activity.
The effort to prevent penetration of
their own ranks and to penetrate the
opposition involves the work of
thousands of CIA and FBI agents.
The ClA’s counter-intelligence
operations are headed by David Blee, a
veteran officer and former chief of its
Soviet division. The FBI counterspy
corps is headed by Edward J. O’Malley,
an assistant director of the bureau.
Refuting critics of the US effort,
O’Malley insists: “The last few years
have been very good years. We have
been adding personnel and equipment,
and we have been neutralising the other
side very legally.”
The most important counterspy work
of all may be the least glamorous the
painstaking, detailed checking of the
activities and background of in-
dividuals seeking to enter US in-
telligence agencies. It is the ClA’s
primary task to uncover overseas leads
and transmit them to the FBI for follow-
up when the target returns to the US.
In addition, to stop infiltration, both
agencies conduct sweeping background
probes of potential recruits. The average
CIA investigation involves at least 22 to
26 interviews of co-workers, friends and
neighbors. The CIA and the National
Security Agency also require recruits to
undergo an exhaustive “lifestyle poly-
graph (‘lie’) test” not only before they
are hired but also after they complete
three years of probation.
Periodically throughout their
careers, CIA and security agency
officers are subjected to lie-detector tests
confined to counter-intelligence ques-
tions. These tests are so rigorous that
Soviet agents trying to infiltrate US
intelligence agencies generally seek to
avoid situations which could involve
such scrutiny.
But, in the human spy war constantly
being fought by the superpowers, there
can be no guarantee against one side or
the other’s pulling off the ultimate coup
putting an agent at the very top of a
rival’s espionage service.
History all too often has shown that
not even the most thorough screening
can truly spyproof an agency a lesson
most recently driven home to the FBI. □

NEIGHBORHOOD
PNG violence darkens cloud
over the border crossers
A fierce assault on Indonesian officials trying to help identify genuine refugees from Irian
Jaya and persuade border crossers to return has delayed any resolution of the
problem which keeps growing in camps in Papua New Guinea, as STUARTINDER explains.
IRIAN JAYA villagers who
have fled into Papua New
Guinea last week attacked
with stones, sticks and an axe
Indonesian officials who tried
to persuade them that they
could return home across the
border safely.
The attack occurred at
Blackwater camp in the
western Sepik district, the first
camp the Indonesians visited
along with PNG officials
in a planned attempt to per-
suade 10,000 refugees and
“border crossers” in 13 camps
to go back.
All the Indonesians in the
party were hurt in the attack.
One was injured seriously.
The team abandoned the
task immediately and In-
donesia lodged a strong
formal protest with Papua
New Guinea over lack of
security for the officials.
Some of the men involved
in the attack told a Radio Australia
reporter they had assaulted the In-
donesians because they “hated the sight
of them” and because of “their
inhumane treatment of the Melanesian
race.”
A delegation from the camp
demanded that both Indonesia and
PNG drop plans for repatriation.
The villagers’ camps have sprung up
throughout PNG’s western provinces.
Three of the camps, holding about 2000
people, are in the Sepik north of PNG’s
rugged central mountain spine. The rest
are in the south.
The visit by the team was part of a
process of trying to identify genuine
refugees from mere “border crossers”
who might be prepared to go home. But
the attack means that the Irian Jaya
villagers may have a long stay there,
perhaps even a permanent one.
Under the United Nations conven-
tion on refugee status and a subsequent
protocol in 1967, it is incumbent on a
country to give asylum to a fleeing
The Blackwater refugee camp in Papua New Guinea: ill feeling toward Indonesians boiled over
person who if returned would have
a well-founded fear of being persecuted
for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular social group
or political opinion. Any return must be
voluntary.
PNG officials had completed the first
requirement laid down by the office of
the UN High Commissioner for Re-
fugees for border crossers. They had
interviewed them all to decide who was
prepared to go back and who were
genuine refugees under the protocol.
Officials considered that most of the
crossers wanted to return.
The joint team action has been
postponed, however with no time set
to re-activate it.
“All the negotiations have now taken
one step backward,” said UN official
Michael Alford, in Canberra. “Some
small groups have quietly returned vol-
untarily but there are still people
coming over in all areas.”
Meanwhile, the UN High Com-
missioner’s office has budgeted to spend
more than $1 million on the border
crossers’ welfare for the three months to
December $600,000 of it made avail-
able by Australia.
Nearly half of the total will go on
food for the camps and $121,000 on
transport (aircraft, boats) to get it there.
About $53,000 is to be spent on water
supplies for the three months.
“In view of these latest develop-
ments, we’ll have to review the support
program in December and obviously
extend it after Christmas,” said Alford.
Alford said the High Com-
missioner’s office agreed with both In-
donesia and PNG that voluntary return
was the best solution but said there
could be no question of people being
forced to go back if they had a genuine
fear.
The alternatives under UN rules are
integration into the local community
and, as a last resort, resettlement in a
third country. “That last resort is still a
long way down the track,” said Alford.

NEW ZEALAND
A tough budget
wrestles with
national debt
By IAN TEMPLETON
THE NEW Zealand Labor government
promised the country a budget for the
family. It would be “tough but fair”,
said Finance minister Roger Douglas.
He kept his word. It is probably the
toughest budget since the black budget
of 1958 which led to the defeat of the
country’s second Labor government
two years later.
Douglas could have a longer run.
For one thing, New Zealanders are
living in a different economy than the
comfortable environment of the 1950 s
when the country was still in the top 10
for its standard of living.
Ten years ago New Zealand’s public
debt stood at $4 billion and the annual
interest charges were only $220 million.
Today the debt is over $22 billion and
the annual interest exceeds $2OOO
million. That is the accumulating effect
of a decade of borrowing to finance
annual deficits.
New Zealand has been living beyond
its means for years the time has come
to bite the bullet. That is the rationale
behind the budget.
Douglas has been working for nearly
a decade on rescue ideas for the
economy. He resolved years ago that if
he got the chance, he would have no
truck with what he calls “the timid
gradualism” with which other finance
ministers have managed the economy.
He argues that there is little point in
trying to treat the symptoms of
economic malaise: instead, attack the
root cause. In his budget he has
launched a massive onslaught on the
huge internal deficit inherited from the
previous government.
In what some have called the most
“creative” budget of the modern era,
Douglas has called on virtually every
weapon in the fiscal armory. He has
increased income tax and as well pro-
poses to tax fringe benefits such as
company cars and houses from next
April. He has stripped away $2OO
million worth of subsidies to farmers.
Hefty increases have been imposed on
government goods and services:
electricity, coal and gas, as well as
timber from state forests. The road
transport industry faces a 46 percent
increase in taxation. Petrol, liquor,
tobacco and motor car licence fees have
been hit once more. Exemptions for life
insurance, rates and mortgage interest
have been removed.
Douglas believes he can slash nearly
$1 billion off the deficit next year and
$lBOO million the following year. He
has not compromised his principles.
The budget is hailed in some quarters as
the work of an orthodox right-wing
monetarist. Some of the trade unions
are livid with what they regard as the
“free market” policies of the Labor
government. But through the election
and the economic summit, Prime
Minister David Lange and his
henchmen have been consistent in
saying that the priorities in the budget
were to reduce the deficit and to help
low-income families.
That second objective has been ac-
complished with a new “family care”
benefit which will provide an extra $lO
a week for each child to family groups
whose income is below $20,470 a year.
For someone on the average wage with
three children, the program is
equivalent to a boost in gross wages of
Roger Douglas: every fiscal weapon used
AAP/EVENING POST
$56 a week, or 18 percent. The full-year
cost of low-income assistance measures
is estimated at $390 million.
Clearly, Douglas had to find new
sources of revenue to cover that obliga-
tion and at the same time reduce the
deficit. Besides the new tax on fringe
benefits, he is proposing to introduce a
new tax on goods and services from
April 1, 1986, at the same time as he
abolishes the present non-standard
wholesale sales tax. That is, perhaps, the
most important tax reform proposal in
New Zealand since the introduction of
PAYE in 1957.
A switch from direct to indirect
taxation has been urged on the govern-
ment by successive commissions, but
each government has balked because
indirect taxes feed through into the
consumer price index and force trade
unions to demand compensatory wage
increases. Lange and his economic team
have worked hard to persuade the
unions to accept that those on low
incomes should be helped through the
social welfare and tax systems and not
through the wage round.
That strategy will be tested soon
when the unions and employers sit
down with the government to negotiate
a wage guideline for the coming round
of wage talks, the first in New Zealand
since Muldoon imposed the draconian
wage-price freeze in 1982.
If the wage rise cannot be contained
to a figure somewhere about 5 percent,
the government’s chances of preventing
inflation soaring seem remote. Already
it is rising sharply as a consequence of
devaluation.
Manufacturers are angry that they
are being asked to exercise restraint on
prices at the same time as the govern-
ment has raised fuel costs and other
charges.
Douglas contends that the lift in the
rate of increase in prices is “temporary”
and a “one-off situation.” He says the
price changes will have no lasting
impact on inflation, in view of the tight
control he is maintaining on the money
supply, as well as wage adjustments
which primarily reflect productivity
changes.
His other technique to step up com-
petitive pressures is to allow in more
imports, particularly in sectors which
have previously enjoyed full import
licence protection.
If Douglas succeeds with his taxation
reform which has to be carried out in
stages over the next two years and
moves the tax burden away from
incomes and on to consumption, he
could change the country’s attitude to
work, to investment and to productivity.
He might at last restore NZ to sustain-
able growth and ultimate prosperity.
That would be worth all the pain of his
first budget. □

When choosing a bank for their
corporate finance and international
business services needs, some
Australian executives unfortunately
subscribe to the view “foreign is better”.
Yet overseas, one Australian
bank is acknowledged as a leader in
the international money arena.
That bank is the ANZ.
ANZ has long been Australia’s
most active bank internationally, with
an extensive network of offices
covering all the International Financial
Centres throughout the world.
The ANZ is ideally poised to
assist Australian businesses with their
domestic and international finance
requirements.
Among the facilities we
can provide are foreign currency loans,
term loans, overdrafts, commercial
bills, leasing plus a full range of foreign
exchange and trade finance services.
Through the Capital Markets
Group we can also arrange specialised
facilities such as access to inter-
national and domestic capital markets,
project finance and big ticket leasing.
Best of all, we have some of the
finest banking brains in the world on
our staff and they’re at your beck and
call. They speak the same language
as you do.
And we believe they understand
Australian international and domestic
business problems and opportunities
far better than any foreign banker.
When you choose a banker for
international business services, look
for more than an impressive inter-
national address.
Look for skill, integrity, and good
old Australian know-how
Look to the ANZ.

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
Youth, nerve and good
luck a $2O million empire
From journalism and a Law degree if not quite rags to riches. That’s the story
of John Byrne and Chris Kyriakou who chance brought together to pool resources founded
on skill, nerve and verve, as DA VID HASELHURSTreports.
JOHN BYRNE was a newspaper
reporter in Melbourne and Chris
Kyriakou a Sydney suburban solicitor
seven years ago. They did not know
each other and about the only thing they
had in common was their age.
Through chance, however, they got
together and today preside over a stable
of companies capitalised at more than
S2O million with gold mines and pros-
pects stretching through Victoria,
Western Australia, Queensland, South
Africa, Canada and Indonesia.
Their companies should have at least
two significant gold mines in operation
next year one in Walhalla, Victoria
and the other west of Johannesburg in
South Africa. There could be more.
Although they did not do business
together until four years ago, they had
already become mining entrepreneurs.
Neither had had much “seed” money
but they made it with a mixture of
punters’ nerve, some fortunate judg-
ments and more good luck than bad.
Kyriakou - ex-Dapto High and Un-
iversity of Sydney having completed
his articles in 1975 put up his plate as a
solicitor at the age of 25. He borrowed
$50,000 the next year, and bought con-
trol of Slattery Thompson a practice
with offices in the Sydney suburbs of
Earlwood and Hurstville.
In 1977, a man who literally changed
the direction of his life came to his
office. The man was an old-time pro-
spector, Ray Fitzgerald, who had a
syndicate of mates looking for uranium
in the Northern Territory. They had
spent $lOO,OOO and needed another
$30,000 to get the “show” going.
Fitzgerald’s bank manager had knocked
him back and suggested he might see
Kyriakou, who apparently had im-
pressed as a man with a penchant for
risk-taking.
Says Kyriakou: “1 became con-
vinced that by putting up $30,000 I
would be worth $3OO million by
Christmas. By Christmas, of course, I
had lost my $30,000. 1 didn’t have it in
the first place but borrowed it against
my house, worth about S 40,000.”
Kyriakou’s short-term speculation
thus became a long-term commitment to
a small, unlisted prospecting company,
the name of which was soon changed to
Pan d’Or Exploration Pty Ltd. It had
mainly uranium hopes and some gold
prospects in the Northern Territory.
He looked around for a listing
vehicle a public company into which
they could put the prospecting interests.
The Hartogen group was rationalising
its structure and off-loading group com-
panies, including Omega Oil NL. Pan
d’Or Exploration was sold into Omega
in mid-1979 for $50,000 cash plus 3.75
million vendor shares and 1.25 million
options. Omega’s existing 7.5 million
50c shares were written down to 2.5
million 20c shares, leaving Kyriakou
and associates in control. The apparent-
ly high premium on acquiring the
uranium prospects was possible
because, ahead of the backdoor listing,
the private company was able to farm
out exploration commitments on its
prospects to others including
Jimberlana Minerals (controlled by
mining consultants A. C. A. Howe
Australia Pty Ltd) and Aquitaine, which
had an agreement to spend up to SI
million on Pan d’Or’s ground.
Omega was re-listed on the stock
exchange as Pan d’Or Mining NL and
sponsoring brokers A, B. S. White and
Co underwrote an initial share place-
ment to raise $400,000 working capital.
Kyriakou was now firmly committed to
mineral exploration and the company’s
interests soon spread to prospecting
applications for oil shale areas and
more gold hopes.
Away in Melbourne, Byrne had
spent six years on The Australian
Financial Review. He had been the
newspaper’s chief mining correspon-
dent for most of that time.
Says Byrne: “In that time, I had
never bought a share and I decided it
was time I made some money.”
So, at the age of 29, in 1978, he quit
the paper and went to work as a
consultant for the Melbourne broking
firm of McCaughan Dyson and Co. He
wrote research papers and also success-
fully played the market on behalf of
discretionary clients and established a
“bank for himself.”
Tracking the fortunes of small ex-
ploration companies requires much
sifting of the quarterly reports which are
mostly overlooked in the daily press.
Byrne, of course, had a lot of experience
in that and one day in late 1979 came
across a report from the still obscure
Pan d’Or Mining. He saw the name
Kyriakou and telephoned him to ask
about an alluvial gold prospect the
company held near Pine Creek, NT.
Byrne’s attention also had been drawn
to a brief statement that the company
had applied for oil shale areas in
Queensland.
Kyriakou visited Melbourne early in
1980, and looked up Byrne, whom he
found “in a little box room” off the
reception area at McCaughan Dyson.
Pan d’Or shares were starting to
move on the strength of its oil shale
applications. Byrne became enthusiastic
and bought two million shares on behalf


John Byrne, left, and Chris Kyriakou: a benevolent fate brought them together
of clients at prices up to Si. He sold out
within a few months for around $2.50.
At the same time, Byrne was putting
together some gold prospects on old
diggings in Victoria. For an outlay of
$35,000 he had acquired options over
several gold areas with an exercise price
of 51.2 million payable within four
years for transfer of the titles. Some
$344,000 had been spent on exploration
before Byrne’s company, Minova Pty
Ltd, acquired the option.
Byrne also needed a listed vehicle
ultimately to fund the purchase and
finance further exploration work on the
prospects. The loss-making hardware
company R. B. Davies Industries Ltd
became available in 1981. With 1.7
million shares on issue, it had traded
down as low as 18c. A company as-
sociated with Byrne took out the
directors’ shares; they, in turn, paid
$350,000 to buy the remaining hardware
assets and the new controllers stood in
the market for a month with an offer to
buy remaining shares at 40c.
R. B. Davies became Walhalla Res-
ources Ltd, acquired Byrne’s Minova
Pty Ltd gold prospects for that firm’s
total costs of $50,000 and granted Byrne
an option over 350,000 shares exercise-
able at 50c each.
McCaughan Dyson then underwrote
a non-renounceable one-for-one issue
at 40c which raised $680,000 and, with
what the company received for its
hardware assets, it had nearly $1.03
million in the bank. It was ready to go
gold prospecting.
Pan d’Or was one of the investors in
Walhalla’s issue and cross-share-
holdings were established between the
two companies.
This early corporate history of Byrne
and Kyriakou demonstrates how entre-
preneurs can get up and going without
significant cash resources of their own.
In the past three years, their two
companies took investments in a string
of others including the property-rich
Murphyores Ltd in which they invested
some 51.5 million in 1982 and sold out
this year for more than S 3 million.
They also acquired from the Wise-
Goldberg interests in WA Central Perth
Properties Ltd which, stripped of its
former property interests, has been
renamed Goldstake Securities Ltd. It
will become their group’s ultimate hold-
ing and investment company.
The group has been entirely
reconstructed in recent months, with
Pan d’Or Mining taking over Walhalla
Resources in an operation that will see
the merged companies renamed
Walhalla Mining Co Ltd. (See ac-
companying chart.)
That company, with a probable
market capitalisation of around $lO
million following the merger, will own:
■ One hundred percent of the
Walhalla mine in Victoria where
directors say they are confident of
blocking out sufficient ore to establish a
150,000-tonnes-a-year plant by Decem-
ber 1985. Having spent SI.B million on
mine development in the past 18
months, they have a $2 million budget
for the next 12 months and the expecta-
tion that two to three years’ reserves
averaging Bgm/tonne will be blocked
out before the mill opens.
■ A 40 percent interest in the
Randalls gold prospect east of Kalgoor-
lie, WA, where the operator (Nord
Resources) has outlined indicated open-
pittable reserves of 750,000 tonnes of
4.5gm/tonne material. Nord has an-
other 51.4 million to spend on the
prospect to earn 50 percent; the other
holder is Broken Hill Holdings Ltd.
■ Twenty percent of Broken Hill
Holdings and some $2 million cash.
The group’s other investments are:
■ 19.9 percent of Wallamain Ltd
(market capitalisation S 3 million) which
has 800 hectares of freehold at Caves
Beach, near Newcastle plus large
reserves of steaming coal.
■ 40 percent of Golden Shamrock
Mines Ltd (market capitalisation 52.5
million) which will hold most of the
group’s Victorian, Queensland and WA
gold prospecting operations.
■ 19.9 percent of Jimberlana
Minerals NL which has joint ventures
with Duval Alluvial Mining Inc (a sub-
sidiary of Pennzoil, of the US) over vast
placer gold prospects in Borneo. It also
has 61.5 percent of Laurasia Ltd, a
company listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange with a market capitalisation
of 55.2 million. Laurasia’s main invest-
ment is 50 percent of Wes Witwaters-
rand Gold Mines Ltd, a joint venture
company with Egoli Consolidated Mines
Ltd, of Johannesburg. □


MOTORING
Toyota set
to fire on all
cylinders
Toyota’s fuel-injected trio: the Avante (front), Cressida (rear) and Celica
By ALAN KENNEDY
TAKING the scattergun approach to
selling cars, Toyota has released yet
another bevy of new models which gives
it a startling coverage of the market and
must give its competitors nightmares.
From SI 1,000 cars to $27,000 ones,
Toyota has it covered. The newly-
released models come hot on the heels
of the company’s splurge last year when
it spent millions of dollars launching a
range.
The money was not wasted. Sales of
Toyota’s cars are up 28 percent in a
market which has grown 12 percent on
the previous year. Its bland but prac-
tical Corona is outselling Ford Telstar
and, most importantly, holds 40 percent
of the fleet market.
This year, the success of Toyota
boosted the profit of distributor York
Motors from 51.37 million to 54.54
million. York’s managing director,
David Shmith, said the profit increase
was mainly attributable to Corona sales.
Shmith was all smiles recently when
Toyota put its new models on display.
The updates to the Corona range can
only strengthen sales and Shmith feels
secure in the knowledge that his com-
pany’s profits should get a further boost
next year from this car.
As well as making the York Motors
shareholders happy, the launch dem-
York Motors’ David Shmith: all smiles
JOHN ELLIOTT
onstrated the remarkable breadth of
Toyota’s range.
A little over 18 months ago, Toyota
perceived a gap in the market and set
out to fill it.
The public’s perception of the Cor-
ona was that it was sturdy, practical but
lacking in excitement. So Toyota
ordered a 2.4 litre engine from Japan,
upgraded the suspension, made some
cosmetic changes to the body, fitted a
five-speed gearbox and called the car
Corona Avante. It is a model which will
capture buyers previously turned away
from the two-litre Corona.
Changes to the body have not
necessitated massive retooling, so costs
are kept down while buyers are offered
something new.
This speed, combined with the cost-
effectiveness of the exercise, is the name
of the game in today’s and tomorrow’s
car market.
Buyer loyalty counts for little these
days as purchasers are showing
neophyte tendencies and manufacturers
will have to titillate them with some-
thing new much more often.
The Celica and Cressida, released in
October, supersede models which are
only 18 months old. In the Celica’s case,
as with the Corona, the company has
finally acknowledged the criticism
heaped on the car for years that it
looked good but did not “go” and
dropped the two-litre engine in favor of
a fuel-injected 2.4 litre. Suspension has
been upgraded and the car performs
with more gusto than its pre-
decessor.
What this does for the re-
sale of last year’s Celica
remains to be seen.
Perhaps the most im-
pressive is the Cressida. It
offers a high level of trim, a
responsive engine, good road
holding and interior space.
Like most upmarket Japanese
cars, the body shape would
not win design awards but it is
not hard on the eye.
The manufacturers have
finally got the message about
Australian road conditions
and are devoting a great deal
of time to suspension
development locally rather
than on computer screens in
Japan.
The results are immediate-
ly apparent in the Cressida
which is a great leap forward
for Toyota and at $20,000 a
threat to Ford and GM-H’s
luxury cars.
It makes the Toyota’s top-
of-the-range Crown look ar-
chaic and spending an extra
$5500 on the Crown would be
hard to justify.
But Toyota rises or falls on the
Corona. It retains the two-litre
workhorse and now offers the fuel-
injected 2.4-litre Corona in the Avante.
The engine, plus the updated suspen-
sion and four-wheel disc brakes, puts it
ahead of its competitors.
When you look at the price
513,675 for the manual and $14,515 for
the automatic it is not hard to see why
rival manufacturers are worried about
Toyota. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Portfolio in clear skies
THE INCREDIBLE rain which
drenched Sydney last week flooded and
closed the basement trading floor of the
stock exchange but the “wet” did
nothing to dampen the prices of most
stocks in the portfolio.
The Speculator’s Diary has hit its
high point for the year with a gain of
105.8 percent by the end of last week on
our year’s opening portfolio of cash and
shares to a value of $15,000.
Base Resources was one of the big
movers last week after Chinese en-
trepreneur Lee Ming Tee’s Sunshine
Australia Ltd bought a substantial
shareholding from lan McNee. McNee
will remain on the board but Lee Ming
Tee becomes chairman.
Few Australian investors understood
Base Resources, which never seemed to
tell a satisfactory story about itself in its
reports. The company’s major interests
involve oil and gas production and
exploration in the United States, plus
gold prospects in southern New South
Wales. It recently took up a third
interest in Form Physics Corp of San
Diego, California, which is developing
powdered metal and ceramic
technology with applications in a wide
field of manufacturing.
With the recent appointment to the
board of Bill O’Neill (a director of
merchant banker Morgan Grenfell
Australia Ltd) plus the new presence of
Lee Ming Tee, we’ll stick in this pre-
viously near-dormant stock for a further
run in the share price.
Base Resources has 8.5 million
options exerciseable at 25c, expiring in
December, and option holders can look
forward to a profitable exercise.
Another celestial made news in the
market late last week when Hong Kong
businesswoman Sally Aw Sian bought
control of Smith and Miles Ltd, the
printing and stationery group which
Sally Aw: investment opportunities
was 96 percent-owned by E. Long In-
dustries Ltd.
E. Long will retain Smith and Miles’
operating assets and business and the
shell goes to Miss Aw for $3.50 a share
valuing the company at $2.7 million.
A similar price will be offered to
minority shareholders although, if I
had any, I would not sell.
Aw plans to rename Smith and Miles
and use it as a vehicle through which
Australian investors can participate in
her publishing and property businesses
and other South-east Asian op-
portunities.
One of the first investments the
company will make will be the purchase
of a slice of her Sing Tao Newspapers
Ltd the publisher of two Chinese-
language dailies in Hong Kong plus the
English-language Hong Kong Standard.
Aw, 51, is the heiress to the Tiger
Balm fortune established by her
father. She has been steadily acquiring
property in Sydney since the late 19705,
when she launched in Australia daily
editions of her international Chinese-
language newspaper.
Most of her commercial property is
in Sydney’s Chinatown.
Property sources suggest that her
Australian real estate holdings are
worth close to $2O million.
Her purchase of a listed vehicle in
Australia was engineered to a large
extent by Stephen Tsung now based
in Hong Kong as assistant general
manager of ANZ Finance (Far East)
Ltd.
Tsung was educated in Australia and
went into stockbroking in Sydney
where, until 1974, he was a partner in
the old firm of Rivkin and Co. His coup
will be seen as a fast result in a new job.
The new Smith and Miles will be a
stock to watch. In the meantime, I quit
Target Petroleum at a slight loss follow-
ing that company’s disappointing run
in its latest drilling program partic-
ipations.

WILDCAT
The view from the inside
BROWSING through the latest crop of
annual company reports, Wildcat was
intrigued to notice the eclectic spread of
board positions held by one M. S.
Gregg - a Fellow of the Institute of
Valuers from Western Australia.
It is no secret that one of the most
bitter commercial wars being waged is
in Perth where Robert Holmes a Court’s
Western Mail newspaper is doing its
best to win a greater share of the
advertising dollar from West Australian
Newspapers Ltd.
Gregg is a director of West Aus-
tralian Newspapers, together with being
on the WA board of the AMP Society, a
director of Chamberlain Holdings,
Cockburn Cement Ltd (deputy chair-
man), Parmelia Hotel Pty Ltd,
Westralian Sands Ltd and the Adelaide
Steamship Co Ltd.
To top all that, however, Gregg also
sits on the board of West Australian
Onshore Oil NL where he sits with
chairman Holmes a Court whose Bell
Basic Industries Ltd is the biggest
shareholder.
Modern mining
THE FIRST customer for Telecom’s
satellite communications service to start
next year will be a new gold mine, the
Bamboo Creek joint venture in the
remote eastern part of Western Aus-
tralia’s Pilbara.
The mine promises to be a sub-
stantial income producer, for the new
satellite service will not come cheaply.
It will be introduced after the Aussat
satellite is put into a stationary orbit
36,000 km above Earth next July.
Telecom then will provide customers
with earth stations to suit their needs
in Bamboo Creek’s case, a three-metre
dish antenna and associated equipment
to receive and transmit telephone calls,
text and data services.
Subscribers can expect to pay a
range of charges for the equipment,
installation, maintenance and call
charges for this speedy service.
The earth station and associated
equipment will cost either $30,000 in
annual rents or be offered for 95 percent
of capital cost amounting to more
than $BO,OOO to be paid over 13 months.
Installation costs are expected to be
between S5OOO and $25,000. Mainten-
ance costs also could be substantial if
technicians have to be brought in from
distant centres but the call rate will be
about the same as for interstate trunks.
The West Australian manager of
Telecom, Len Caudle, will attend the
mine’s opening ceremony on December
7 to sign the first contract although
Aussat will not be operational until
after mid-1985.
The companies developing the Bam-
boo Creek venture are Kitchener Mining
NL (50 percent), Haoma North West NL
(25) and a group of Swiss investors (25).
In the chips
THE TRADITION of unusual
questions from shareholders at the
annual meetings of Arnotts Ltd con-
tinued in Sydney last week.
Chairman and managing director
Stan Small “passed” on the question of
whether the company planned to in-
troduce nicotine to its biscuits to in-
crease consumption. Last year, a
shareholder suggested the company in-
troduce a scotch whisky biscuit. How-
ever, Scottish-born Small replied that
the thought was sacrilegious and that
“scotch is for drinking and biscuits are
for eating.”
Shareholders walked away after this
year’s meeting with samples of butter
cookies, a Scottish-type shortbread
Glengarry and Doritos, corn chips just
launched by Arnotts Snack Foods.
Doritos are reportedly performing
better than Arnotts had hoped in their
market, valued at $3O million a year
retail. APD Snackfoods’ brand CCs is
still the market leader in all states bar
Queensland where local brand Siesta,
made by Siesta Food Products, sells
most.
Arnotts Snack Foods’ marketing
manager, Alan Burgis, would not talk
market share but said that “our com-
petitors are worried."
Enterprising winners
A TEAM of truck and motor vehicle
accident assessors from the New South
Wales Government Insurance Office is
showing great interest in the laser
technology being produced in a factory
at Narellan, south-west of Sydney.
There Bruce Reilly is showing the as-
sessors how he can use laser beams to
straighten truck axles bent in accidents.
Reilly’s methods can repair a truck
for $2OO, against a normal cost of up to
$5OOO. At the factory of Reilly’s com-
pany Narellan Truck Wheel Align Pty
Ltd, axles are bent back into place using
hydraulic pressure, a heat shrinking
process and the laser beams which
ensure precision.
The laser and other innovations in
heavy vehicle machinery alignment
have won Reilly the major 1984 Busi-
ness Enterprise Award. Sponsored by
the Sydney Pink Pages, Sydney radio
station 2WS and NSW government’s
Office of Small Business, the award
gives Reilly two return tickets to any
Qantas destination plus $2500 cash
from Pink Pages, $2500 advertising time
on 2WS and a NSW government grant
for a relief manager while he is away.
Managing director of Solartint Sun
Control Industries Gary Lane won the
second award a 14-day P&O cruise,
the same advertising time on 2WS and
government relief. The studio manager
of Axent Recording Studio, Ross
McGregor, won third prize also the
radio time. □

THE CHARTIST
Gold producer makes a show of strength
by Russell Lander
BASED ON SUS averages for October
1984, gold and silver both have given
long-term buy signals on the Coppock
Indicator. In other words, the Coppock
lines have turned up from negative
territory. The last time this happened
was in the first half of 1982 which
presaged a run in gold up to just over
SUSSOO/oz in February, 1983. Neither
gold nor silver has broken its primary
downtrend but they would do so on a
move above SUS3SO/oz for gold and
SUS7.6O/oz for silver.
Most Australian gold stocks have
been a little firmer on the recent im-
provement in the price of the yellow
metal but the market is taking a wait
and see approach in case the price has a
relapse. One stock, however, which has
exhibited above-average strength is
Sons of Gwalia NL with a price moving
from 40 cents in July 1984 to 95 last
week.
The Bridge Data weekly bar chart
shows that turnover has been solid
during the course of this upswing. The
chart which encompasses all trading in
this stock since public listing in March
1983 also highlights a run of similar
dimensions in the second half of 1983.
Interest in this stock has been
rekindled by the commissioning of a
treatment plant at the Sons of Gwalia
mine 3.5 km south of Leonora. Gold
production in 1984-85 is budgeted to
reach 33,000oz and
36,000oz in a full year.
On published reserves
,this would mean a six-
year life for the mine.
Old-timers will
remember that the Sons
of Gwalia mine has
been a solid gold pro-
ducer, total production
in the 63 years to 1963
having been 2.5 million
oz.
The daily chart, also
by courtesy of Bridge
Data, shows the real
uptrend channel now in
place and that the criti-
cal resistance level at 95
cents has repulsed three
attacks by the bulls. A
break through this level
would point to a short-
term upside target of
about $1.10.

THE MODEST FARMER
Blame aimed for lagging growth
by Bert Kelly
FRED IS in one of his moods. Perhaps
he is brooding on all the work that is not
being done on his farm while he is
crying his heart out in the Rough Cruel
World wilderness with John Stone or it
might just be the weather.
Fred gave Eccles and me a stern
lecture yesterday.
“It is all very well for you to poke
fun at poor old Bruce, the industrial
relations dinosaur, and the industrial
relations club members who care for
him so tenderly but I didn’t come out
here just to help you and Eccles write
smart articles, Bert,” he snarled. “What
I want is a clearer picture of what is
really wrong with our industrial
relations machine.
'’“‘‘What about concentrating on that,
instead of trying to be funny all the
time?”
I took Fred’s lecture to heart and
told Eccles to concentrate his miserable
mind on the problem. He did this and
came back with a great table of figures
which showed that we were falling
behind the rate of progress of almost all
other developed countries. I think he
cribbed a lot of his material from a
paper by Professor Helen Hughes, given
at a seminar entitled “Australia, Poor
Nation of the Pacific” which was
arranged by the Institute of Political
Science in Melbourne in May. I shall
not include the table because it would
take too much room but it shows that
Australia had a high income per person
from 1870 through to 1913 but since has
been dropping behind. Our growth is
close to the slowest of all developed
countries now.
If Eccles is right, surely we should
ask ourselves why we who have so much
have done so badly? We had the natural
resources to lead in the development
race and since have discovered oil
which should have put the cream on the
economic cake but we dropped further
back.
There must be some powerful
reasons for our poor performance.
What are they?
Many people will say that we have
become so entangled by the interven-
tions of our many governments and the
bureaucratic red tape that this means
that we cannot move freely.
It is like expecting a trotter to race in
hobbles.
We are indeed a regulation-ridden
country but so are many others. This
seems to be a disease which almost all
democratic countries suffer.
Eccles thinks we waste too many
limited resources trying to make things
we are not good at, such as cars and
textiles, behind the shelter of our tariff
wall. I knew he would squeeze tariffs in
somehow. There is a lot of truth in what
he says and this is why Fred and I have
been patrolling the tariff wall around
the Living In The Past city. We even try,
in the darkness of the night, to knock a
few bricks off it. We know from bitter
experience that the wall encourages
wasteful resource use by the industries it
shelters. It also damages the export
industries which do not use it because it
enables the protected industries to give
in to wage demands that get passed
along the line to us at the end of the line
and we can pass them ,no further.
However, I doubt if even the weight of
the tariff burden is heavy enough to
excuse us.
I think we are not good at working
any more.
Our industrial relations system still
concentrates on fighting the class war of
the past.
This may have been necessary in
1907 but the scene has changed.
Most workers are little capitalists
now.
If you doubt this, talk to the workers
on the municipal golf links or those
sailing boats on weekends. But our rules
insist that disputes are necessary before
the industrial relations machine goes
into gear, so we start with a nice fight
and long practice has made us expert at
it.
I once knew a little kid who suffered
grievously from eczema. The poor little
beggar used to scratch himself night and
day, so much so that he had to wear
gloves all the time.
When his granny have him a doll, he
first cuddled it and then gave it a good
scratch thinking that that was the way
of the world for dolls as well as little
boys.
Our industrial relations system seems
to affect management and men in the
same way: As soon as a problem arises,
their first thought seems to be to have a
confrontation.
You may not agree that the three
main reasons that we do so badly when
we have so much is our having too
many regulations, our tariff system and
poor old Bruce.
Well, if it isn’t these, what sugges-
tions do you have? There must be some
reason which explains our lamentable
performance. □


PIERPONT
Taken to the cleaners
THE RESULT of the Melbourne Cup
has left Pierpont wondering, not for the
first time, whether God is actually
paying attention.
It was bad enough that Alibhai could
manage only second-last. As a track
veteran, your correspondent can endure
these things happening to his selections.
But having the winning speech made
by a frightful anti-nuke such as Janet
Holmes a Court left Pierpont with the
conviction that this is the end of civilisa-
tion as we know it.
Your correspondent is in-
communicado for the week in
a deep, deep sulk.
YOU WILL probably refuse
to believe this but the final
report of royal commissioner
Frank Costigan actually had
something to say about the
Federated Ship Painters and
Dockers Union.
On his first reading of the
headlines, Pierpont was under
the impression that the
Costigan commission had
successfully left its lower-class
origins behind it, abandoning
those grubby chaps who earn
a dollar scraping rust off
mouldy old boats and climb-
ing ladders to watch the
genteel middle-class fiddling their tax
forms.
Indeed, Costigan did largely escape
his lowly beginnings but perhaps for
purely nostalgic reasons he devoted
volume three of his final report to the
lads on the docks.
The most interesting part of this to
Pierpont was chapter two, in which
Costigan outlined a systematic pattern
of extortion on the South Australian
waterfront. On closer inspection, this
appeared to have been largely based on
a report by the federal police so your
correspondent will give them credit for
the report, too.
It appears that any vessel being
cleaned up for cargo in Port Adelaide
recently has been cleaned up financially
by the painters and dockers also.
Costigan cites 27 ships whose owners
were held to ransom in one form or
another by painters and dockers be-
tween 1979 and 1983.
Pierpont is not totally unsympathetic
to the SA painters and dockers.
Only a few are in permanent labor
and many are casuals. In 1975, the
maximum wage that could have been
earned by a casual painter and docker
attending pick-up regularly was $5OOO
a pittance, by any standards.
Whenever they get work on a vessel,
therefore, they appear to be determined
to wring as much juice as possible from
the job. This has usually happened
under a system called “job and finish.”
When an agent is anxious for a ship
to clear port, he can reach an agreement
with the workers who are cleaning it
that they put in an extra effort, miss
meal breaks and work harder. In return,
the agent agrees to pay them for the
time they would have taken to complete
the job if they had not put in the extra
effort. This system apparently began as
fairly honest bargaining between the
agents and the painters and dockers but,
on Costigan’s evidence, has de-
teriorated into a form of extortion.
Take the case of the m.v. Maaskroon.
In 1979, this vessel discharged a cargo
of caustic soda at Gove in the Northern
Territory. En route to Sydney, the tanks
were cleaned at sea. At Sydney, 11 of its
tanks were loaded without incident and
it proceeded to Port Stanvac in Saint
Vincent Gulf where the remaining four
tanks were to be loaded with lube oil.
An inspector required the four tanks
to be cleaned. When the master pro-
tested, an independent surveyor con-
firmed that cleaning was required for
two tanks and estimated four man-
hours for the job.
The vessel berthed at 1030 hours on
December 15, 1979. Port Stanvac
Marine engaged 15 painters and dock-
ers to clean the tanks which means, by
Pierpont’s arithmetic, that the job
should have been completed in about a
quarter of an hour.
Soon after they were engaged, the
union secretary approached Port
Stanvac Marine and demanded a “job
and finish” saying that the painters
and dockers wanted to be paid up until
midnight on the 16th. As the 16th was a
Sunday, this meant that they would be
paid double time for 24 hours.
If the demand was not agreed to, the
painers and dockers would not work
after smoko and would not
return the following day.
(Pierpont would have thought
that they could have finished
the job long before smoko was
due but obviously he has a lot
to learn about the waterfront.)
The painters and dockers
started work about 1300 on
the 15th. They stopped for
smoko soon after. When they
returned after smoko, they
told Port Stanvac Marine that
they had made an error
because it was actually 35
hours until midnight Sunday
which meant that they
wanted 35 hours’ double time,
instead of 24. If they did not
get it, they would walk off the
job and not return until the
morning of the 16th.
The agents, horrified at the prospect
of being removed to an anchorage and
charged additional harbor rates as the
vessel lay idle, agreed to the demand.
The painters and dockers finished
the job by 1750 on the 15th. Total
payment for the cleaning amounted to
about $14,000. The time paid for on the
job amounted to 498 hours, compared
with the surveyor’s estimate of four. The
painters and dockers were paid for 423
hours they did not work, including 98
meal breaks.
An important point here is that, in
many cases, the contractor who engages
the painters and dockers receives part of
any increase arising from a demand by
the unionists.
The economics of the system are
brutally simple: Berthing fees at Port
Adelaide run as high as $32,000 a day
and average $14,000 a day. As long as
the painters and dockers keep their
demands below the level of the berthing
fees, it is cheaper to pay them than to
stay in port and argue.
No shipper in his right mind would
bother making an application to the
industrial tribunal. That would involve


even longer delays. And everyone is in a
position to pass the cost on.
The contractor can relax because he
gets a higher profit out of the painters
and dockers’ demands. The extra cost to
the shipper is added onto the goods and
ultimately paid for by his customers.
Costigan says that the frequency of
reports of “job and finish” demands has
dropped dramatically since his royal
commission began.
Pierpoint certainly hopes so, because
the demands add significantly to costs.
In the seven cases cited by Costigan
where adequate figures are given, the
total paid by the shippers for cleaning
jobs came to $113,146 of which $53,432
an increase of 89 percent
represented the excess resulting from
demands by the painters and dockers.
Costigan’s remedy is to recommend
an elaborate amendment of the laws
relating to trade unions and extortion.
Demands would have to be reported,
unions would have to keep extra
records and investigators would investi-
gate.
It seems to Pierpont that the
bureaucracy created by these amend-
ments would probably cost con-
siderably more than does the extortion.
Your correspondent’s solution is
simpler: First, set a decent minimum
wage by law which must be paid for this
dirty and thankless job of cleaning old
rustbuckets. Second, abolish the
Federated Ship Painters and Dockers
Union and declare that ship cleaning
could be done by non-union labor.
No union then would be in a
monopoly position to impose extra
labor costs on shippers. Contractors
would bid competitively for jobs. Job
opportunities would open for the un-
employed. Market forces would reduce
costs of ship cleaning.
If we could then find some way of
passing the cost reductions on to the
public at large, everybody would
benefit. □
CHESS
My favorite classic
by Terrey Sbaw
MOST PLAYERS treasure the memory
of a favorite victory when they have
dazzled themselves and possibly even
their opponents with a polished display
of tactical brilliance.
Many published games are described
as brilliant and a prize often is offered
for the best of these in a particular
tournament. However, it is difficult to
remain objective about such things
when one’s own efforts are being
judged. Dr Tarrasch said of the awards
at St Petersburg in 1914, concerning his
match with Nimzovitch: “This game
was awarded the second brilliancy prize
whereas the first went to Capablanca v
Bernstein. I do not permit myself one
word of criticism in this book but
confine myself to exposing the names of
the prize judges to the judgment of the
present and future generations ... they
were Messrs Burn, Pollner and Znosko-
Borovsky.”
Is there a game which qualifies as the
best ever? People are unlikely even to
agree on the criteria to be used, let alone
which game gets the blue ribbon.
But there are many candidates.
Among the classics is the “Immortal
Game,” Anderssen v Kieseritsky, a
tactical battle royal played in London in
1851. More modern possibilities are
Alekhine’s inspired win over
Bogolyubov (Hastings, 1922) and Tal’s
rout of Botterill’s King in the European
Team Championship, 1973.
My favorite is the following un-
ashamedly tactical struggle between the
redoubtable Adolf Anderssen and Jean
Dufresne. Played in Berlin in 1852, it
has been dubbed “The Evergreen
Game.”

Rajiv’s Time of Testing
Indian Army troops keep the peace, the new prime minister sifts his mother’s ashes: Trying to hold a divided nation together
KYRIAZIS— SYGMA
The riots end and the investigations begin, but the Sikhs live in a state of fear.
The riots were over, at least for the mo-
ment. But the fear lingered, and the
hating had only begun. Order was restored
in India last week, ending the communal
blood bath that began when Indira Gandhi
was murdered by two of her Sikh body-
guards. Shops reopened in New Delhi while
buses and taxis returned to the streets, many
of them driven by Sikhs. But about 20,000
Sikhs remained in refugee camps—some
because their homes had been destroyed,
others because they were afraid to leave the
protection of the Army. All told, more than
2,000 people, most of them Sikhs, had died
in the riots, and another 1,000 or so were
still listed as missing. Many of the survivors
shared a strong sense of alienation. “I feel as
the Jews must have felt in Nazi Germany,”
said Khushwant Singh, a noted Sikh au-
thor .“We have been marked out as a people
to be hated.
The new prime minister, Indira Gandhi’s
son Rajiv, tried to keep things calm. He
insisted that all Sikhs should not be con-
demned for the murder of his mother by
“two misguided individuals.” He ordered
an official investigation of the riots and “an
all-out effort” to return looted goods to their
owners. He promised compensation to the
survivors—sB3s for a slain relative, $165 for
each non-serious injury, loans of up to
$30,000 each for burned-out businessmen,
He also appointed a new lieutenant gover-
nor of the Delhi territory, who quickly an-
nounced that “things have very much
returned to normal.”
But after the traumatic cycle of assassina-
tion and mass reprisals, “normalcy” had
become, for many, a permanent state of fear.
The capital remained under a strict 9 p.m. to
5 a.m. curfew enforced by khaki-clad
troops, who in many areas continued to
patrol the streets in armored personnel-
carriers and machine-gun-mounted trucks.
Suspicions and rumors crackled through
the Sikh community: that 5,000 of their
people had actually been killed; that the
Army’s elite Sikh Regiment was going to be
broken up; that the riots were the result of a
genocidal plot drawn up before Mrs. Gan-
dhi’s death.
Some of those fears had a factual basis,
For two days after the assassination, law
and order had broken down entirely in cities
and towns across the country. Authorities
received scores of reports about police units
ignoring calls for help during the riots. They
also heard allegations that some officers
had actually encouraged anti-Sikh mobs,
“There is no alibi for what happened,” said
New Delhi police commissioner S. C. Tan-
don, who submitted his resignation last
week. Three other police commanders
have been arrested for criminal negligence,
including the officer in charge at Trilok-
puri, the village just east of New Delhi
where one of the worst massacres occurred
(Newsweek, Nov. 12). Prime Minister
Gandhi moved quickly to replace some
top security and intelligence officials,
And he insisted that all 2,577 people ar-
rested for acts of violence would be pros

ecuted without political interference.
Critics of Gandhi and his Congress (I)
Party were not satisfied.“ There is clear evi-
dence that Congress politicians have started
the carnage and then interfered with the
investigation,” charged former Foreign
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, president of
the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
Aides to Zail Singh, the country’s ceremoni-
al president and a Sikh himself, sent a com-
plaint to the prime minister accusing two
prominent Congress Party members of de-
liberately stirring up violence. Speaking to a
group of reporters in his office, Police Com-
missioner Tandon denied that he had been
pressured by anyone in the ruling party to
release some of the arrested troublemakers.
But no sooner were the words out of his
mouth than a Congress M.P., Jagdish
Tytler, barged into the commissioner’s of-
fice and upbraided him for “hampering the
relief effort by holding my men.” A handful
of Tytler’s supporters had been arrested on
suspicion of looting and arson; not long after
his intervention, they were released.

assassination itself was moving slowly. The
two killers had been taken prisoner and then
were riddled with bullets by their captors —
during an escape attempt, it was said. One of
the gunmen, Satwant Singh, 21, was still
alive last week. He had recovered enough to
be taken off the critical list, and a newly-
formed team of investigators would soon be
able to interrogate him. Reportedly, the
authorities were looking for a third man, a
Sikh holy man known only as Giani, who
supposedly administered an oath to
Satwant Singh and his accomplice to kill
both Mrs. Gandhi and her son. Giani was
thought to be a follower of Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, the terrorist leader who was
killed last June, when Mrs. Gandhi ordered
the Indian Army to attack Sikh militants
holed up in the Golden Temple of Amritsar,
their religion’s holiest shrine. When police
went looking for Giani, they discovered
that he had left the country, for an
unknown destination, ten days before Mrs.
Gandhi’s murder.
Cremation: In the company of a Hindu
priest, Rajiv Gandhi went back last week to
the site of his mother’s cremation to sift
through the bones and jewelry and collect
her ashes. The ashes were placed in 30 brass
urns and then carried in elaborate ceremo-
nies to every major Indian city to be scat-
tered across the countryside. Rajiv himself,
surrounded by a heavy military guard and
clad in gleaming white, placed an urn under
a tree at Anand Bhawan, the family’s
sprawling estate near the northern city of
Allahabad. Rajiv Gandhi performed the
same rite he had performed nearly 20 years
before to honor his grandfather and India’s
first post-independence prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru. Later, Rajiv will scatter
Mrs. Gandhi’s remaining ashes over the
foothills of the Himalayas, symbolically
severing the link between himself and his
formidable mother.
The possibility that the break might turn
out to be more than symbolic was of some
interest to other governments. Pakistan’s
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq met with
the new Indian leader and suggested after-
ward that Gandhi might provide “a fresh
and young approach [to the] chronic prob-
lem” between the two countries, which have
fought three bitter wars since they gained
their independence from Britain 37 years
ago. U.S. officials, meantime, were hoping
that Gandhi might tilt a bit to-
ward Washington. His moth-
er’s old friends in Moscow
seemed to be worried about the
same possibility. Perhaps for
that reason, the Soviet press
continued to drop clumsy hints
that the American CIA had
been involved, somehow, with
her killers.
This week, Gandhi is expect-
ed to announce that national
elections will be held as sched-
uled in late December or early
January. His supporters insist
that the new prime minister is
up to the challenge. “In the last
few days, you have grown 10
feet tall,” industrialist Swaraj
Paul, a family friend, wrote to
Gandhi. But there was no guar-
antee that the new leader had
enough personal stature to hold
his party and his country to-
gether or to rebuild the somewhat dilapidat-
ed institutions of Indian democracy (box).
“Everyone accepts him as P.M., and we
hope he does well, because a prime minister
of India must do well,” said Maneka Gan-
dhi, the leader of a small opposition party
and widow of Rajiv’s ambitious younger
brother Sanjay, who before his death in a
flying accident four years ago had been their
mother’s heir apparent. “But now that he’s
Burning body: A Sikh train passenger
there, he must have confidence in himself
and not keep utilizing Mama.”
Already, however, trouble was brewing
in the ruling Congress (I) Party, itself the
relic of a political schism six years ago (the
“I” stands for Indira). Rajiv Gandhi kept
the cabinet pretty much as his mother left it,
but his personal aides were said to be spoil-
ing for a fight with the old-timers. They
drew up their own proposed cabinet list,
Sikh refugees: ‘We’ve been marked as a people to be hated’


India: The Price of Obedience
By EDWARD BEHR
It was said of Jawaharlal Nehru that he towered over
everyone like a giant banyan tree —and that under such a tree,
nothing could grow. Despite Nehru’s aristocratic style, India
weathered his passing in 1964, largely because Nehru had an
intellectual’s respect for democratic institutions. The same was
not true, however, for his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Mrs.
Gandhi demanded total obedience as a price for advancement,
and she used every opportunity to bend to her will the
institutions whose integrity she was supposed to safeguard.
The result is that now, as India struggles to recover from the
shock of her death, those insti-
tutions have been badly de-
based. “Indira Gandhi did not
want a strong parliament, an
independent judiciary or a free
press,” the Indian Express ob-
served last week. “The desire
for a centralized power system
weakened governmental au-
thority itself.”
Decay: The failure of the in-
stitutions explains some of the
tragic events of the past two
weeks. For 48 hours after Mrs.
Gandhi’s assassination, the
Delhi police failed to function;
in some cases, low-level politi-
cians from her own Congress
(I) Party led mobs to Sikh tar-
gets. But even before then, the
rot had been apparent. For
years Indian voters have been
aware that minor politicians—
and some of the more visi-
ble ones, too —are shockingly
lacking in morality and used
to getting their way through
a combination of Tammany
Hall and strong-arm tactics.
As Indian Express columnist
Swaminathan S. Aiyer points
out, “The only things that
came to matter were money,
muscle and influence.” In-
vestigative journalist Arun
Shourie laments the same
decay in other institutions:
“Courts survive, but justice does not. Civil servants have
become domestic servants, the police force a private army.”
Of course, the trouble is not all Mrs. Gandhi’s fault; the
police, for one, has been a corrupt, inefficient body for years.
But she certainly strengthened the antidemocratic trend by
accumulating so much power in her own hands, and by
surrounding herself with political allies, many of whom were
openly contemptuous of the democratic process. Some were
notorious smugglers; others had police records or functioned
as bagmen for a Congress (I) Party that had lost all semblance
of ideology.
Mrs. Gandhi’s private circle included figures like Dhirendra
Brahmachari, the owner of a chain of yoga ashrams, who once
produced a popular yoga hour on Indian TV. Brahmachari
combined such activities with successful gun manufacturing—
an occupation that attracted attention when he was indicted
Tending to a Sikh injured in the rioting: A bitter legacy
LANGEVIN— SYGMA
for allegedly exerting his influ-
ence to import Spanish rifle
parts illicitly. He denies any
wrongdoing. Once, when he was trying to buy a magazine in
order to turn it into a pro-Indira paper, Brahmachari told
the publisher: “A million rupees is like 10 paisa to peo-
ple like us.”
The height of Mrs. Gandhi’s autocratic behavior came
during the 1975-1977 emergency. Rather than accept the
verdict of a court invalidating her 1971 election, she suspended
democratic rules, arrested thousands and denied civil rights
both to her critics and to the poorest segments of the popula-
tion. Though she was defeated in the 1977 elections, which she
had called under the assumption that a win was all but certain,
she used her political skills brilliantly to get back into power 21
months later. But the institu-
tions never really recovered.
The independence of the judi-
ciary remained weakened, and
the people’s faith injustice had
plummeted. Many politicians
and bureaucrats had become
flunkies; some Army nomina-
tions were politically motivat-
ed. By the time the Punjab
crisis broke, uncritical approv-
al of Mrs. Gandhi’s policies
and whims had become the
only sure way of finding one’s
place in the sun.
Today, only a few institu-
tions remain relatively untar-
nished. Despite a mutiny last
June by Sikh recruits, the
Army is still an efficient force.
And having regained the free-
doms it was denied under the
emergency, the press is once
again an effective voice for
democracy.
Tragedy: But it is a grim
state of affairs that confronts
Rajiv Gandhi. As The (Lon-
don) Sunday Times put it, Ra-
jiv “inherits a party without
any real ideology outside the
populism harnessed by his
mother to ensure her political
survival.” He alone knows
whether he intends to sweep
the stables clean or continue
with his mother’s methods.
The tragedy is that he may fail either way. If Rajiv applies too
brutal a broom, he risks being toppled by the very people who
hope to use him for their own ends. And if he uses Mrs.
Gandhi’s tactics, he may face problems that will make the
Punjab crisis and its aftermath look minor in comparison.
Clearly, India’s institutions must be restored if there is to be
durable reform. But the magnitude of such a task might well
daunt even an intellectual giant of the caliber of Jawaharlal
Nehru himself.
Edward Behr served in the Indian Army in the 1940 s and
returned to India as a journalist in 1965, covering the India-
China war. As a reporter for Newsweek since 1967, he has
visited the country often, interviewing Indira Gandhi several
times and most recently covering the Punjab crisis that led to
her death.


excluding most of the holdovers. That ma-
neuver enraged some senior party leaders,
who demanded that the list be dropped
from consideration and warned against re-
pudiating Mrs. Gandhi’s legacy. “Rajiv is
surrounded by a mafia,” said Vajpayee, one
of several potential challengers for the post
of prime minister. “He is under their influ-
ence, and if unchecked, they will destroy
the country.”
The list of problems facing the new prime
minister is daunting, even without the Sikh
’question. A 20-year-old seccessionist strug-
gle continues to simmer in the northeast
states of Manipur and Nagaland. In Assam,
the influx of hundreds of thousands of il-
legal immigrants from Bangladesh has cre-
ated a potentially explosive situation; just
last year more than 4,000 people were
slaughtered during a wave of sectarian un-
rest involving Muslims and Hindus.
Throughout India, social tensions between
relatively prosperous farmers and the in-
creasingly organized rural poor have fre-
quently erupted into violence. As for the
economy, inflation and unemployment
have continued to rise, while government
spending stagnates.
*Bloody Angry*: Plainly, Gandhi’s first
and most telling task is to maintain law and
order and to try to close the gaps of fear
and resentment between the 14 million
Sikhs and the rest of India’s more than 700
million people. The outlook was not good.
“I was bloody angry after Amritsar, and
I’m bloody angry now,” said retired Lt.
Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora, a Sikh and a hero
of India’s war against Pakistan in 1971.
Like many Sikhs, the general was
convinced that the attacks on his
people had been carefully organ-
ized. “There was the systematic
destruction of Sikh property with
the intention of breaking the
Sikhs’ economic prosperity,” he
charged. “There’s no doubt in my
mind that there was an advance
plan to be implemented when the
opportunity arose.” Added a re-
tired admiral: “We could under-
stand an emotional outburst,
but the riots were directed by
people who knew exactly what
they were doing.”
Fears of setting off a new con-
frontation kept most such com-
plaints low-key, however. Across
India last week, Sikhs marked the
birthday of Guru Nanak, the
15th-century founder of their reli-
gion, with quiet indoor ceremo-
nies rather than the usual joyous
processions in the streets. The
Sikh community’s mood of de-
spair tinged with anger was espe-
cially evident in the teeming refu-
gee camps that have sprung up
around several Indian cities. At
the Shahdara camp in East Delhi,

more than 10,000 Sikh men, women and
children languished in the confines of a
secondary school. In the cramped class-
rooms, refugees were forced to crouch and
lie almost literally on top of each other.
Outside, they wandered aimlessly around a
dusty yard amid the overpowering stench of
garbage and human waste. Food and water
were scarce. But when several ranking gov-
ernment officials tried to enter the camp to
offer condolences and parcels of food, some
Sikhs in the camp refused to accept the food.
Currently, the Indian Army has about
100,000 troops stationed in the Punjab, the
home state of the Sikhs, to keep an eye on
troublemakers, including those who want
to create an independent nation called Kha-

listan. But many diplomats in New Delhi
believe that while a large military presence
in the troubled region may be necessary to
keep order, it is also likely to inflame nation-
alist passions. Some observers have suggest-
ed that the government withdraw the troops
gradually in order to defuse the crisis. But
the new prime minister and his advisers
have shown no interest in heeding that ad-
vice. According to several of Gandhi’s clos-
est aides, the troops will stay in the Punjab
on a more or less permanent basis, with no
chance of even a partial withdrawal. That
bitter reality has not been lost on Sikh lead-
ers. “They will stay there forever,” says
one Sikh in Delhi. “The day they leave, the
Punjab is lost to them and Khalistan
proclaimed.”
The lines were also being
drawn on the political front. The
Akali Dal, the Sikh political par-
ty, replaced its moderate leaders
with militants last week. And
many wealthy Sikh businessmen
were beginning to think about
moving their investments to the
Punjab, the only Indian state
where Sikhs are a majority, albeit
a slim one. Despite Gandhi’s per-
sonal assurances to business lead-
ers, a Sikh-owned chemical firm
has decided to build new facilities
in the northern state, rather than
in the Delhi area. “I don’t see
Hindus investing in the Punjab or
Sikhs expanding their invest-
ments in India,” said author
Khushwant Singh. “They have
made us outsiders in our own
land.” The Sikhs are among In-
dia’s most progressive and pro-
ductive people. But bloody events
have wrenched them out of the
mainstream, and they will be a
long time coming back.

THE PHILIPPINES
A Typhoon’s Swath of Fury
Packing winds of up to 125 miles per
hour, Typhoon Agnes cut a cruel
swath across the Philippines last week.
Winds, rain and flash floods flattened
crops, toppled electric and telephone lines
and obliterated bridges and roads. At the
weekend, the confirmed death toll had
reached 535, still climbing. Worst hit were
hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in
coastal villages; in some spots, 30-foot
waves engulfed whole hamlets and then
towed residents and their bamboo-
thatched homes out to sea. After touring
the devastated province of Capiz, First
Lady Imelda Marcos said, “I have never
seen so much damage in my life.”
When President Ferdinand Marcos de-
clared a “state of calamity” in six provinces
uation. After the September typhoons,
guerrillas of the communist-led New Peo-
ple’s Army stepped up operations in areas
where communications systems had broken
down. Last week the rebels struck again,
killing 15 soldiers and 11 civilians and sacri-
ficing 32 of their own. Meanwhile, urban
terrorists are suspected of setting several
deadly fires in Manila hotels in the last
month. In response, Marcos has hinted at
special new laws that would bring terrorists
to quick justice.
Opposition leaders fear that Marcos may
apply any new provisions to antigovem-
ment demonstrators as well as armed insur-
gents. While they wait to see what Marcos
has in mind, Filipino citizens continue to
count their dead. Late last week, at least 713
people remained unaccounted for in Capiz
and Iloilo provinces. If the missing did not
survive the storm’s fury, Typhoon Agnes
may well top the 1,200-person toll of Ty-
phoon Ike —and lay claim to being the
deadliest Philippine storm on record.
JILL SMOLOWE with RICHARD VOKEY in Manila
and four cities, it sounded almost like an
understatement. Manila was still struggling
to repair the damage inflicted by Typhoons
Ike and June in September. Agnes added
scores of schools and municipal buildings to
the toll, and it also managed to hit the few
economically important regions spared by
the earlier tropical cyclones.
Crisis: Marcos’s political opponents pre-
dict that he may try to use last week’s natu-
ral disaster to divert attention from his
man-made problems. Worries about a
crackdown have been mounting since the
release last month of an independent report
that found 25 military personnel indictable
for the premeditated murder of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino. Few doubt that
Marcos is facing a potentially explosive sit-

Cosmic Waves in Manila
Marcos welcoming the guru’s followers at Malacanang Palace: Spacey invaders raise an uproar with their plans for ‘enlightenment ’
GAMMA-LIAISON
At first the new arrivals in Manila
seemed a bit odd, but harmless. They
were hundreds of clean-cut young foreign-
ers who ate vegetarian food, wafted incense
through hotel hallways and paid their bills
in cash. Then came a flood of newspaper
ads, featuring photographs of a hirsute In-
dian guru. The ads said that the guru would
provide “perfect” health, “ideal” educa-
tion—and even seminars in levitation.
There was more to come. In September, the
followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
tried to purchase Manila’s cash-strapped
University of the East. Their goal: to use the
Maharishi’s “unified field” theories to save
the beleaguered Philippines from political
and economic collapse. “It is
our responsibility, as custo-
dians of this knowledge, to
make it available where there is
need,” said spokesman Geof-
frey Clements. A colleague
added simply: “We’re promis-
ing utopia to the Philippines.”
When the transcendental-
ists—some 1,200 of them,
mostly Americans and Europe-
ans—first began arriving in
July, Manilans were tolerant
and even amused by the “ma-
hari-sheiks,” as they were
quickly dubbed. But suspicions
soon began to build, and broke
into the open when the group
announced plans to take over
the country’s largest universi-
ty. Manila’s Cardinal Jaime Sin, declared
the unified field to be in open contradiction
with Christianity—a potent charge in the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country.
Even campus firebrands denounced the uni-
versity takeover deal as a scheme by the
“U.S.-Marcos dictatorship” designed to
quash escalating student protests. And last
week, the Justice Ministry ruled that the
proposed purchase would violate the coun-
The Maharishi
AP
try’s Constitution, which requires all
schools to be under Filipino control.
The spacey invaders had in fact been
invited —by Philippine President Ferdi-
nand Marcos himself. The Maharishi, who
gained fame in the late 1960 s as guru to the
Beatles and other celebrities, and whose
Swiss-based movement now claims 5 mil-
lion followers worldwide, had offered sever-
al world leaders the opportunity to take
advantage of his group’s self-proclaimed
spiritual powers. The only positive response
came from Marcos and his wife Imelda, who
in September hosted 600 of the guru’s devo-
tees at a reception in Malacanang Palace.
Marcos extolled the “scientifically tested
and proven technology of the
unified field” and in turn was
anointed “founding Father of
the Age of Enlightenment in
the Philippines.” He rang a
ceremonial “Maharishi bell of
invincibility,” while Imelda
was named a “Perpetual Inspi-
ration for All Mankind.”
The beleaguered president
certainly needs help, and the
Maharishi’s movement has
brought some tangible, if possi-
bly short-term, economic bene-
fits to the Philippines. The
guru’s followers booked 70
rooms for half a year at the
posh Manila Hotel, including
the $1,200-a-day presidential
suite and the even more expen-
sive penthouse. They took over all of the 340
rooms at the Mirador. And, according to
published reports, they also made roughly
$ 1 million available to underwrite the
group’s plans for the University of the East.
The movement’s promises were far more
grandiose—not to say bizarre. The guru’s
followers say that mass transcendental
meditation would improve business per-
formance, quell political turmoil and even
reverse the aging process. Unified field ad-
vertisements even promised to “avert ty-
phoons and natural disasters” by erecting
“invincible armor” around the country.
At the moment, however, it is the group’s
bid to buy the 47,000-student university—
as well as its overtures to at least eight other
academic institutions—that touched off
controversy. Activists vowed to boycott
classes in protest. Cardinal Sin chided the
guru’s followers: “You cannot fool the Fili-
pinos just because you have money.”
‘Age of Enlightenment’: The Maharishi
and his followers say that their plans are just
the opening act in their movement to bring
the Philippines into an “Age of Enlighten-
ment.” The Maharishi’s unified field in-
cludes a unique theory: if 7,000 disciples—
the square root of 1 percent of the world’s
population—chant their mantras together
daily in one place, crisis and revolution can
be averted. The sect says it expects help
from thousands of Filipino adherents, and
plans to have such a quorum ready in Ma-
nila by the end of the year.
The Maharishi joined 7,000 devotees for
such an event a year ago in Fairfield, lowa,
home since 1974 of Maharishi International
University. Heralded as “a taste of utopia,”
the mass meeting, its supporters claimed,
generated not only a brief lull in world crises
but also a bullish streak in international
stock markets.
In the Philippines, it seems to be a case of
promises, promises. Since the transcenden-
talists have arrived, Manila has been racked
by violent street protests. The Mayon volca-
no in the central Philippines has erupted
unexpectedly, two strong earthquakes have
shaken the country (including Marcos’s
home town), and a chain of hotel fires has
killed several dozen people—and injured
some of the Maharishi’s own followers. In
addition, three typhoons, the worst in dec-
ades, have killed nearly 2,000 Filipinos and
left at least half a million more homeless. So
far, the record of the “mahari-sheiks” seems
severely flawed.

LATIN AMERICA
The MiG’s That Weren’t There
To bring in high-performance
craft indicates that they are
contemplating being a threat
to their neighbors.
Unloading the Bakuriani: The mysterious shipment may have held Soviet air-defense weapons, and quickly led to a case of war jitters
The crates contained no jets, but Reagan is nervous about Managua’s arms buildup.
From hundreds of miles above the earth,
the reconnaissance satellite aimed its cam-
eras at the Soviet Black Sea port of Niko-
layev—and at the 12 large crates assembled
on the dock near the freighter Bakuriani.
Heavy clouds blocked the satellite ’s view on a
subsequent pass. But when the skies cleared a
day or two later, the crates, which resembled
those used to transport MiG-21 fighter jets,
were gone—and so was the Bakuriani.
For a time, the sighting caused little
concern in the United States, but when
the Bakuriani neared its destination at the
Nicaraguan port of Corinto last week,
Washington suddenly sounded the alarm.
In a flood of calculated leaks, U.S. officials
suggested that MiG’s might be on the way.
They repeated warnings that if the Sandi-
nistas and the Soviets were reckless enough
to bring in high-performance fighters, the
United States was more than ready to re-
move them. Warned one senior hand, “This
administration is prepared to use military
force to prevent Nicaragua from tipping the
military balance in Central America.”
Then, almost as suddenly as the crisis had
been whistled up, it subsided. Reporters
who observed the unloading in Corinto
were unable to spot any container large
enough to hold a MiG-21 fuselage. Steve-
dores reported that the Bakuriani had
brought in a number of high-speed patrol
boats. A second theory was that the ship
had disgorged military helicopters. A third
was that the crates hid a consignment of
surface-to-air missiles and radar, parts of an
improved air-defense system. Whatever the
case, after two days of threats Washington
suddenly played down the whole incident.
Secretary of State George Shultz said the
Soviets had assured him that no MiG’s were
Managua bound. And although a second
Soviet ship pulled into Corinto briefly late
in the week, senior White House hands
protested that the administration’s own
leaks had been hyped.
All sides appeared to be playing a very
clumsy and very dangerous game. The ad-
ministration has long warned Managua
that it is prepared to destroy any MiG’s
Nicaragua imports. So far the threat has not
been put to the test. But both countries are
stoking their war of words with very real
military gestures. With Soviet help, Mana-
gua has responded to the administration’s
pressure by furiously beefing up its antiair-
craft defenses. The buildup in turn would
increase the cost of any U.S. air strike
against strategic targets in Nicaragua. Once
the improved air-defense system is com-
plete, it will narrow Managua’s window of
vulnerability. So the intriguing question
now is whether the administration might be
tempted to take a swipe at the Sandinistas
sooner rather than later.
Hysteria: For the moment, cooler heads
seem to be prevailing. But the signals out of
Washington produced something close to
war hysteria in Managua. At the first hint of
crisis, the nine comandantes of the Sandinis-
ta National Liberation Front’s national di-
rectorate went into an emergency session
that didn’t break up until 4 in the morning.
Then at a press conference the following
afternoon, Foreign Minister Miguel D’Es-
coto charged that an unidentified U.S.
Navy vessel had entered Nicaraguan terri-
torial waters to shadow the Bakuriani as it
moved into port. The nervousness was com-
pounded when on three consecutive morn


weapons, and quickly led to a case of war jitters
ings Managua was startled by sonic booms,
caused, the Defense Ministry charged, by
an American SR-71 Blackbird spy plane
flying over a wide stretch of Nicaraguan
territory. D’Escoto later claimed that Nica-
ragua had detected an armada of some 40
American ships bearing tens of thousands
of troops, although he stopped short of say-
ing it was headed for Nicaraguan shores.
In fact, except for some scheduled ma-
neuvers, there were no signs of unusu-
al large-scale American ship
movements, and U.S. officials
denied any plans to launch
an invasion. But Nicaraguan
Agriculture Minister Jaime
Wheelock was taking no
chances. He canceled plans for
20,000 student volunteers to
help harvest the coffee crop
and urged them to mobilize in
the capital, where they would
each be issued rifles. “We pre-
fer the loss of the coffee to the
loss of the country,” Wheelock
declared. As a result, up to 25
percent of the crop will prob-
ably remain unharvested, and
Nicaragua will lose tens of mil-
lions of dollars of precious for-
eign exchange.
At the outset, neither Mos-
cow nor Managua had done
much to allay Washington’s

ning of something bigger.

suspicions. When the Bakuriani left port in
September, American officials considered
its voyage routine: since the first MiG-21
prototype was unveiled in 1956, the Soviets
have supplied the plane to 34 countries,
mostly in the Third World. The first real
tipoff that something was amiss was pro-
vided by the freighter’s route. Passing
through the Bosporus from the Black Sea,
the Bakuriani’s skipper told Turkish au-
thorities he was bound for Havana. Once in
the Atlantic Ocean, however, the ship
turned south, toward Cape Horn at the tip
of South America. Some U.S. intelligence
authorities suspected the Bakuriani was
bound for Peru, which had recently ordered
some MiG’s. Only when she passed the
Peruvian port of Callao did the American
officials realize that the freighter was bound
for Nicaragua. And the fact that the ship
avoided the Panama Canal, where its cargo
would have to be declared, only added to
Washington’s alarm.
Warning: As the Bakuriani approached
Corinto on Election Day, a midlevel crisis
team assembled in the White House base-
ment to discuss an American response.
They were in frequent telephone contact
with national-security adviser Robert
McFarlane, Secretary of State Shultz, De-
fense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and the
president himself, all of whom were in Cali-
fornia. Meanwhile, the nation’s third-rank-
ing diplomat, Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Michael Armacost, deliv-
ered a personal warning to Moscow. At a
crowded lunch-hour reception at the Soviet
Embassy, Armacost stepped aside with So-
viet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and
reiterated Washington’s position that the
introduction of advanced combat aircraft
into Nicaragua would seriously destabilize
Central America and could not be tolerated
by the United States. But Dobrynin simply
returned to the receiving line, seemingly as
jovial as ever.
The story of the freighter first broke dur-
ing the election-night coverage, and it was
then that the frantic leaks about a military
response began. However, asked about the
situation in his postelection press confer-
ence, Ronald Reagan chose to respond in
measured tones. “I can’t comment on any
plans of what we might do,” he replied. “We
ourselves have been alerted and have been
surveilling that ship, but we cannot definite-
ly identify that they have MiG’s on there, or
planes of any kind.” And from then on,
other administration officials began to tem-
Hauling away the cargo in Corinto: None of the boxes looked large enough to hold an airplane fuselage


per their tone, if not their language. Late in
the week a senior White House aide dis-
missed the notion that another Cuban mis-
sile crisis was brewing as “a pile of crap.”
For their part, the Sandinistas refused to
reveal what the Soviet ship was carrying.
“Whatever is on that boat is our problem,”
said D’Escoto, who argued that Managua
had the right and duty to acquire whatever
arms it needed to protect itself. Nicaraguan
authorities took special measures in han-
dling the Bakuriani’s hot cargo: an
official of the Corinto longshore-
men’s union alleged that port au-
thorities had supplemented regu-
lar stevedore crews with “people
of trust” dressed in green military
fatigue pants who were assigned to
handle a “delicate, secret cargo.”
Much of that cargo, however,
appeared to consist of small boxes,
similar to those used to store am-
munition, and it was unclear late
last week whether any larger crates were
still aboard the Bakuriani, and if so, what
they contained and whether they would
ever be unloaded.
The scare seemed to destroy the already
fading hope of an improvement in U.S.-Nic-
araguan relations. Just two days before the
American election, Nicaragua held an elec-
tion of its own in which the Sandinistas
received 67 percent of the popular vote. U.S.
officials promptly dismissed the election as

a “farce” and insisted that new elections
must be held before Nicaragua met the
democratic terms of the Contadora draft
peace treaty. In addition, President-elect
Daniel Ortega claimed last week that the
death toll in the CIA-backed “secret war”
against the Nicaraguan regime had sur-
passed 8,000, yet each new casualty only
seemed to reinforce the Sandinistas’ resolve
to fight. Nor were the Nicaraguans com-
forted by Ronald Reagan’s response to a
CIA manual that counseled the
contras to engage in kidnapping
and murder. Reagan merely con-
cluded that the incident reflected
“instances of poor judgment and
lapses at a lower level.” And now,
with the furor over the Bakuriani’s
mysterious cargo, Nicaraguans
seemed more convinced than ever
that, in the words of D’Esco-
to, Ronald Reagan had developed
a “pathological obsession” with
Peeking In on Managua
A U.S. SR-71 spy plane: Full-time snooping with an array of secret eyes and ears
U.S. AIR FORCE
For the Reagan administration, keeping an eye on the Sandi-
nistas has become a full-time job. The controversy over the
suspected delivery of MiG’s to the port of Corinto exposed two
sources of U.S. intelligence: the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes
sonic-booming in the skies above, and the stevedores offload-
ing ships down below on the docks. But Washington also has a
host of other intelligence-gathering capabilities, ranging from
predictable sources like the contras and the U.S. Embassy in
Managua to an array of secret eyes and ears peeking in on
Nicaragua.
From the U.S. Navy presencejust off Nicaraguan waters, and
from radar and listening posts on Honduran mountaintops and
on Tiger Island in the Gulf of Fonseca, Washington monitors sea
and air movements around and inside the country. The U.S.
Army and Air Force also fly Mohawk and AC-130 electronic
and infrared-surveillance planes from bases in Honduras and
Panama. The Pentagon denies these planes pass over Nicaragua,
but they certainly get close enough to look in from afar. Last
summer the Pentagon declassified videotape from a FLIR (for-
ward-looking infrared system) on an AC-130 that allegedly
showed weapons being ferried to Salvadoran guerrillas from a
Nicaraguan shrimp boat. The pictures were fuzzy, but photo
analysts believed they offered proof of an arms pipeline.
At a higher level, analysts at “the Puzzle Palace,” the National
Security Agency in Fort Meade, Md., tune in on Nicaragua’s
international, and perhaps internal, communications circuits.
Anyone with an antenna and the right
electronics equipment can listen in to
many phone conversations between
Managua and Washington, and the
NSA has several “Big Ear” receiving
stations tuned to internal telephone
satellites. The NSA has an additional
fleet of “elint,” or electronic intelli-
gence, satellites capable of monitor-
ing everything from ordinary internal
microwave telephone signals to back-
pack military-radio transmitters.
U.S. photo-reconnaissance satel-
lites can also snap pictures whenever
they pass over. Three months ago the
State and Defense departments published eight overhead photos
of military installations, ports and airfields, including Punta
Huete, the 13,000-foot military runway being completed outside
Managua. Only a technical expert could say whether they were
made from a satellite or a reconnaissance plane, but it was clear
they came from one or the other.
Risky Operation: Of course, the danger of operations like last
week’s spy flights is that they show the Nicaraguans how U.S.
snooping is done. It’s often claimed that American spy satellites
are accurate enough to read the license-plate numbers on Soviet
cars. But the fact that Washington is also using planes suggests
that the satellites are not enough to do the job by themselves. The
Blackbirds, and by some accounts older U-2s as well, have been
making periodic passes over Nicaragua for at least three years.
Officials won’t say where they come from —but journalists have
seen them at U.S. air bases in Panama. It’s a risky operation, but
necessary because the spy satellites can make only one quick pass
over Nicaragua each day.
Another problem with spy planes came out last week when a
U.S. official disclosed that an SR-71 flight failed because the pilot
had to take pictures from too sharp an angle. It is likely that the
pilot couldn’t pass directly over Corinto because of its antiair-
craft defenses. The Sandinistas are known to have acquired
hundreds of’7os-vintage SAM-7 heat-seeking missiles, and U.S.
officials worry that they may be about to get even more sophisti-
cated radar-directed SAM’s. If that happens, the U.S. intelli-
gence community may have to rely less on its eyes—and more on
its electronic ears —to find out what is happening in Nicaragua.

their country and was intent on destroying
the Nicaraguan revolution.
Regardless of what was aboard the Soviet
freighter, there is little doubt that Nicaragua
is assembling an enormous military ma-
chine for a country with a population of
just over 3 million. In part, that may be an
understandable response to the CIA-spon-
sored insurgency, but U.S. officials fear that
the buildup could seriously destabilize the
Central American region. American intelli-
gence estimates put the regular Nicaraguan
military at 50,000 men, and there are an-
other 50,000 in active and frequently mobi-
lized militia and reserve units. U.S. officials
insist that the buildup was assisted by about
3,000 Cuban military advisers and techni-
cians and a smaller number of Soviets and
East Germans. Washington also charges
that both Libya and the Palestine Libera-
tion Organization have provided pilots,
mechanics and training for light aircraft—
and that 50 or more Nicaraguan pilots have
been sent to Bulgaria to learn to fly jets.
A substantial amount of Nicaragua’s mil-
itary investment has gone into strengthen-
ing its ground forces. Among other things,
the Nicaraguan Army boasts at least 50
122-mm and 152-mm artillery pieces man-
ufactured in the Soviet bloc, two dozen
“Stalin Organ” 122-mm rocket launchers
and a force of 330 armored vehicles, more
than half of which arrived in a steady
stream aboard Soviet-bloc ships this
year. During a ceremony commemorating
Armed Forces Day last August, Western
observers were surprised to see 105-mm
cannons equipped with gas rounds and de-
fensive antigas devices. All that would be
troubling enough, considering that one of
Nicaragua’s two neighbors, Costa Rica,
has no army at all, while the other, Hondu-
ras, has only 15,500 troops.
Guns and Rockets: But what really wor-
ries Washington is the buildup of the Sandi-
nista Air Force. Starting with an obsolete
fleet of 14 American-made planes, Mana-
gua has acquired a fleet of 10 Soviet Mi-8
Hip helicopters, basically troop carriers
that can be armed with rocket pods and
door guns, and six Italian-made SF-260
“Warriors,” propeller-driven aircraft
equipped with machine guns, rocket pods
and enough fuel capacity to linger over a
battlefield for up to five hours. Three weeks
ago Nicaragua may have received its most
significant fighting machines of all. Accord-
ing to American officials, the Bulgarian
freighter Christo Batov pulled into El Bluff
on the Caribbean coast and unloaded crates
said to contain four Mi-24 Hind helicopter
gunships, described by one administration
expert as “the most effective counterin-
surgency platforms in the world.”
All of those weapons could be called de-
fensive weapons needed to fight the Ameri-
can-backed rebels. But the Sandinistas have
also made little secret of their desire to
acquire jet fighters, such as the MiG-21,
which have little ground-support capabil-
ity. Such planes, Managua argues, are ur-
gently needed to intercept the supply planes
that are the lifeline of the contras, and to
that end, Nicaragua is working on four
airfields capable of handling supersonic jets
and even large transport cargo planes. U.S.
officials fear that the new 13,000-foot strip
at Punta Huete, near Managua, might one

day be used by the Soviets’ long-range Bear
reconnaissance planes or even supersonic
Backfire bombers, the centerpiece of Soviet
land-based naval-attack aviation. A Back-
fire base in Nicaragua would not only bring
the entire Caribbean into Soviet range, but
would also threaten vital naval bases on
both coasts of the United States. “The air
base at Punta Huete will be able to receive
the Backfire or any other aircraft in the
Soviet inventory,” insists a senior adminis-
tration official. “There is not only a threat to
other countries in the area, but a strategic
threat to our own interests.”
Although the threat is hypothetical,
Washington is convinced that Nicaragua,
with Soviet help, is building a military
force that is out of proportion to any lo-
cal needs. The problem now is to get the
Soviets to back off". Some administration
aides suggested that the Bakuriani incident
was an elaborate ruse by the Soviets to test
American intelligence-gathering capacities
and Washington’s resolve to back its warn-
ings with force. “If the Soviets were testing
us,” says one senior official, “I think they
got the right answers.” The United States,
he adds, is willing to shoot first and ask
questions later, provided it has “conclu-
sive, incontrovertible evidence” that
MiG’s are really there. The administration
was pledging that its Central American po-
licy will not be held hostage by its overall
desire for an accommodation with the So-
viet Union —even though it could mean
scuttling Reagan’s hopes for an arms-con-
trol agreement in his second term.

HOW THE AGUSTA GROUP MAKES
The A 129 Mongoose pictured below is the most advanced
helicopter in its class in the world today. It is also the first
specialised defence helicopter produced in Europe. And it
was conceived, designed and built by Agusta Group tech-
nology.
Producing a helicopter like the A 129 demands immense
technological know-how. But the Agusta Group has some
impressive resources to call on. A vast organisation of scien-
tists and technicians devoted exclusively to research and
development. And a massive fund of expertise that covers
the whole field of aeronautics. From Agusta’s Helicopter
Division, through its Airplanes Division to its Systems Divi-
sion.

the first helicopter to use an Integrated Multiplexing
System. This monitors and controls the Al29’s mechanical,
electrical, electronic and warfare systems, managing auto-
matically all flight and mission functions.
In terms of new materials: the A 129 makes extensive use of
advanced composites, developed and produced by the
Agusta Group at its own new plant in Anagni.
In terms of survivability: because this factor is so vital for a
dedicated helicopter, advanced technology has been
applied to this end in key areas (rotors, transmission, fusel-
age, flight controls).
In terms of day/night capability: the A 129 incorporates ad-
vanced infra-red systems allowing round-the-clock combat
readiness even in bad weather or low visibility.
These are just a few examples of the advanced technology
that went into the making of the A 129. There are many
more. And the kind of technological breakthroughs that

Kohl on the Flick Griddle
Kohl facing the Bundestag committee: A stout denial that there was any wrongdoing in taking $53,000 in cash from a company executive
The chancellor’s testimony leaves Germans wondering how long he can hold on.
It was Helmut Kohl’s turn to face the
inquisitors last week. In front of a packed
house in room 1903 of the Bundestag Of-
fice Building, the West German chancellor
testified before the special parliamentary
committee investigating the metastasizing
Flick scandal. During his seven-hour grill-
ing, Kohl tried to refute charges that he
had accepted payments in exchange for
favors to the giant Flick industrial group.
But he acknowledged that from 1977 to
1979, as leader of the then-opposition
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he
received a total of $53,000 from an execu-
tive of the company. The admission was a
damaging development in what some are
calling West Germany’s Watergate—and
it has left many Germans wondering
how long the chancellor can hang on.
After two years, the “Flick affair,” the
biggest political scandal in West German
history, continues to spread. More than
2,000 individuals and corporations are un-
der investigation for tax evasion, laundering
money and influence buying. Already, two
high-ranking politicians—Economics Min-
ister Otto Lambsdorff and Bundestag
Speaker Rainer Barzel—have resigned un-
der pressure, though both have denied any
wrongdoing. The Flick affair has tarnished
the chancellor; a poll in Der Spiegel last
week indicated that his popularity rating
has now dipped below that of Finance Min-
ister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Still, reaction to
Kohl’s possible involvement in the Flick
affair has been muted, largely because the
scandal touches virtually every political
party in the country except the Greens. The
public seems to be waiting for further devel-
opments. Instead of rallies or calls to resign,
response so far has been limited to private
speculation and satire in the form of pointed
political cartoons and phony bank notes
featuring pictures of Barzel.
Kohl, who has charged that the Bundes-
tag investigation is partly politically moti-
vated, was clearly irritated at having to
testify before the committee. (As a Bundes-
tag member, he was obligated to appear.)
When he arrived at the hearing room, Kohl
immediately threatened to leave unless pho-
tographers were ejected. Later he refused a
request from some of the 11 committee
members for an intermission. All along, the
chancellor steadfastly maintained that he
had done nothing wrong in taking the mon-
ey from Eberhard von Brauchitsch, right-


J. H. DARCHINGER
hand man to company owner Friedrich
Karl Flick. Kohl said he passed the cash —
all in 1,000-Deutsche mark notes —to CDU
treasurer Uwe Liithje, who recorded it as a
“donation” to the party.
Kohl told the committee that von Brau-
chitsch asked for no favors in return for the
J. H. DARCHINGER
payments, and that none were given. “I was
the leader of the opposition,” said the chan-
cellor. “I had no influence on the govern-
ment.” Kohl characterized his close ties
with the Flick holding company as “nor-
mal” for any opposition leader trying to
develop strong relations with German in-
dustry. But several committee members,
particularly those from the Green Party,
took a more skeptical view. Green deputy
Willi Hoss compared the secret cash trans-
actions to “a black-market or drug-trade
operation.” “Didn’t it occur to you,” Hoss
asked Kohl, “that if all this was done in cash,
that something was rotten?” Kohl respond-
ed angrily: “I have no notion of what the
drug trade is like, so I can’t answer.”
Much of Kohl’s testimony was similarly
vague or combative. His response to many
questions from the committee was that he
had “keine Erinnerung” (no recollection) of
certain alleged payments or other incidents.
He offered no explanation for records kept
by von Brauchitsch, which, according to
press reports, indicate that Flick paid more
than $200,000 wegen Kohl (in the account of
Kohl) between 1974 and 1980. Kohl also
said he was unaware of any arrangement
between Flick and former Bundestag
Speaker Barzel, who is accused of taking
$565,000 in indirect payments from Flick in
exchange for stepping aside as CDU leader
in 1973 to make way for Kohl. Neither could
the chancellor account for company records
showing that Kohl offered to help solidify
his party’s support for a multimillion-dollar
tax break given to Flick, starting in 1976
by Helmut Schmidt’s Social Democratic
government.
Prosecutors contend that in its quest for
tax breaks and political influence, Flick
passed out more than $8 million from 1969
to 1980 to German politicians from virtual-
ly every major party. Last month former
Social Democratic Chancellor Willy
Brandt was called to testify before the com-
mittee, and a fortnight ago a German maga-
zine accused Schmidt of using his influence
to help Flick. (Both former leaders have
denied the allegations.) Last week the 34-
member Free Democratic Party, a key
member of Kohl’s coalition government,
acknowledged that it had received a $2 mil-
lion anonymous donation last year. Only

Friedrich Karl Flick: The growing scandal
has shaken confidence in the government
the Green Party, which was formed in 1980,
was not involved with Flick —a fact it will
undoubtedly try to exploit.
‘Accidents’: Kohl was not the only one
making news in the Flick affair last week.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
also testified before the committee. Gen-
scher denied receiving any money from
Flick. Like Kohl, he said he was unable to
explain Flick records linking him with the
tax break. The foreign minister said he did
no favors for Flick and found the company’s
account “totally unexplainable.” Mean-
while, the Greens complained that former
Economics Minister Lambsdorff had re-
ceived nearly $30,000 in public money to
help pay his legal fees, and that the funds
were diverted from various ministerial
budgets earmarked for “accidents” and
even “tuberculosis aid.” The Greens called
the payments “scandalous.” But a govern-
ment spokesman said it was standard proce-
dure for the government to help officials pay
legal expenses stemming from actions taken
during their terms in office.
The scandals have all but paralyzed the
government. According to Bonn insiders,
Kohl is now almost obsessed with clearing
his name and holding on to office. But politi-
cal observers say that his chances of keeping
his job may be no better than 50-50. Kohl’s
political future could rest on further testi-
mony by other politicians and businessmen;
the chancellor himself may be summoned
before the committee again as early as this
week. With an eye to minimizing the party
damage, some CDU members are quietly
promoting Stoltenberg as a possible replace-
ment if the chancellor is forced to resign.
Meantime, Kohl has attempted to quell
fears that Bonn is rife with corruption. “The
republic is not for sale,” he said last week.
But to many West Germans, that seemed a
hollow declaration from the man who came
into office two years ago promising a “spirit-
ual and moral revival” for the country.

to consolidate Jaruzelski’s
power against his hard-line
opponents in the government.
There are several theories
about how high up in the gov-
ernment the murder plot may
have gone. Few Poles believe
that the three security officers
engineered the priest’s slay-
ing by themselves. Ever since
Warsaw announced that the
kidnapped priest had been
killed, the Jaruzelski regime
has been implying that Popie-
luszko’s murder was a “politi-
cal provocation” perpetrated by hard-liners
trying to weaken the regime. The govern-
ment has repeatedly said that it would look
into connections between the priest’s mur-
der and what government spokesman Jerzy
Urban vaguely described as “other inci-
dents.” “The investigation [into Popielusz-
ko’s death] could already have been com-
pleted if we were not trying to identify other
people implicated in [the murder] and the
Popieluszko: Tortured
AP
possible instigators,” Minister of Internal
Affairs Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak told a par-
liamentary commission on internal affairs
and justice.
Another theory holds that the plot can be
traced all the way to Moscow, as part of a
scheme to discredit the Jaruzelski regime.
One senior Polish political observer dis-
counts this theory. “If the Russians wanted
to change the leadership in Poland, they
could have used economic, political and
even military means without risking public
upheaval,” this observer says. “They are not
idiots.” The speed with which
the Internal Affairs Ministry
is conducting its investiga-
tion, says another observer,
also argues against that the-
ory. But whatever the govern-
ment’s motive, the degree of
its openness with the public is
unprecedented for a commu-
nist country. “If a similar
situation occurred in Mos-
cow, one would never hear
about it,” said one Western
diplomat.
According to Kiszczak,
the Internal Affairs Ministry
has been going through a “self-purification”
process. Over the past two years, more than
2,000 officers have been dismissed from the
security service and civil militia after being
found guilty of various transgressions. And
in the first half of this year, Kiszczak says,
308 officers were dismissed and legal pro-
ceedings were begun against more than 200
others, including 75 accused of corruption.
Though the government had not released
the final autopsy report last week,
those who were permitted to see the
body said that Popieluszko was beat-
en before his body was dumped in the
Wloclawek reservoir. His body was
badly bruised, and he had apparently
been tied with a rope from neck to feet
so that if he tried to wriggle free he
would strangle. The three security
officers accused of the crime main-
tained that they had not intended to
murder the priest, but were only try-
ing to scare him. They killed Popie-
luszko, they said, when their plan
went awry. However, Urban said that
“it is more probable that they were
intent on killing the priest from the
beginning.”
The government said that a failed
attempt to abduct Popieluszko was
made in mid-October. At that time
the three now charged with his mur-
der are believed to have thrown stones
at the priest’s car as he traveled
between Warsaw and Gdansk, in an
attempt to stop him. But the car
sped ahead.
For all its apparent frankness, the
government shows no signs of adopting a
conciliatory attitude toward the opposition,
which still holds the government responsi-
ble for Popieluszko’s murder. “The kidnap-
ping and murder of Father Popieluszko is
an obvious political provocation designed to
provide politicizes of all kinds . . . with a
convenient pretext to step up their activi-
ties,” said Kiszczak. And the government
made it clear that it would not tolerate the
activities of human-rights groups that may
want to monitor the investigation.
Dissent: Though the government has ac-
knowledged the church’s calming influence
on the public, priests who have openly sup-
ported the outlawed Solidarity movement
have been soundly reprimanded in the offi-
cial press. Meanwhile, there is dissension
among Solidarity leaders. A rift seems to
have developed between Lech Walesa, who
has continued to appeal for social peace, and
others, such as Andrzej Gwiazda, who
called for a one-hour strike in the Gdansk
region last Friday.
In the meantime, Jaruzelski is presiding
over a thaw in diplomatic relations between
Poland and Western governments. Last
week British Under Secretary of State Mal-
colm Rifkind made the first British ministe-
rial-level visit to Poland since martial law
was imposed in 1981. And Hans-Jochen
Vogel, deputy chairman of West Germany’s
Social Democratic Party, also made an offi-
cial visit to Warsaw. The foreign ministers
of West Germany and Italy are scheduled to
meet with Polish leaders later this fall. These
overtures are welcome to the Jaruzelski re-
gime. But the renewed diplomatic activi-
ty has been overshadowed by the nation’s
grief and anger over the murder of a be-
loved priest.

EUROPE
SOVIET UNION
Svetlana’s Sad Odyssey
The only official announcement was a
brief item in the Soviet news agency Tass.
Svetlana Alliluyeva, Joseph Stalin’s daugh-
ter and one of the most famous Soviet defec-
tors, had returned to Russia after 17years
and been granted Soviet citizenship, along
with her daughter Olga, 13. In the following
week, Western press accounts depicted Svet-
lana, 58, as an aging housewife who had
grown disillusioned with the West and missed
her family. But in tracing her past,
News week’s Moscow bureau chief Robert
B. Cullen and London bureau chief Tony
Clifton uncovered a deeper story—of a Soviet
princess who failed to find happiness in either
of two worlds. Their report:
Svetlana’s odyssey began back in the
19405, when she was growing up in Mos-
cow as the pampered daughter of Joseph
Stalin. According to several longtime Mos-
cow residents, she had a reputation in those
days as an arrogant communist princess,
accustomed to indulging her appetites
among a population that lived in terror of
her father. She mixed with Moscow’s cul-
tural elite —writers, artists and dancers.
And she apparently went through dozens
of men, many of whom were afraid to
refuse her. It was a penchant that Stalin
indulged—until he arranged her marriage
to Yuri Zhdanov, the son of Andrei
With Stalin in the ’ 30s: A communist princess?
Zhdanov, a top Communist Party official,
Svetlana’s world changed abruptly in
1956, when Nikita Khrushchev denounced
Stalin in his famous secret speech before the
20th party congress. According to one re-
port, Svetlana was forced to stand up at a
party meeting and publicly endorse the
charges against her father. People who pre-
viously kowtowed to her became scornful,
and she was forced to stand in grocery
lines and submit to other daily humili-
ations of the average Soviet citizen. In
distress, Svetlana turned to the Rus-
sian Orthodox Church. Then, as her
unhappiness deepened, she began to
plot her escape to the West, where
she hoped once again to find fame
and honor.
For a while, she got what she
was looking for. She became an in-
stant celebrity when she defected in
1967 to the United States while on a
visit to India (she was briefly married
to an Indian). She wrote a best-selling
book, “Twenty Letters to a Friend,”
about her life in the Soviet Union, and
then another, “Only One Year,”
about her escape to the West. Togeth-
er, the books reportedly earned her
more than $1 million in royalties. In
1970 she married an American archi-
tect, William Wesley Peters, and bore
him a child, Olga. Later she moved to
Princeton, N.J., where she often met with
George F. Kennan and other Soviet experts.
Complaints: But it was not long before
Svetlana became disenchanted with her new
home too. After the publicity surrounding
her defection subsided, she began to drift.
Her marriage to Peters broke up. She moved
from one city to another —Scottsdale, Ariz.,
Oceanside, Calif., Princeton —
before settling in Cambridge,
England, in 1982 so Olga could
go to a British public school,
She began complaining that
publishers and lawyers were
cheating her out of money. And
she started to denounce the
West as no better than the Sovi-
et Union. “Remember,” she
told the Observer of London,
“that on the other shore there
are the same human beings—
and that includes people who
are imperfect, dull, incompe-
tent, treacherous, idiotic . . .
It is human nature that rules
the world, not governments or
regimes.”
Evidently intrigued by these
complaints, Soviet officials be-
gan allowing her to restore ties
with the family she had left be-
hind. After she moved to England, she was
allowed to hold long telephone conversa-
tions with her son, Yosif Morozov, 38, her
daughter, Yekaterina Zhdanova, 32, and
her grandchildren. In other phone calls the
authorities may have offered signals that she
would not be ill treated if she returned.
Finally the homesickness became too
much—and she decided to go home. Peter
Before leaving England: You can go home again
JANE BOWN—CAMERA PRESS-JEANETTE HARRIS
Mansfield, a neighbor who lived above their
apartment in Cambridge, reported that on
the night before their disappearance he
overheard Olga shout at her mother: “Why
didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t you discuss
it with me?” Her father later said he would
investigate whether Olga was taken against
her will—and possibly try to get her back.
What will become of Svetlana now is
unclear. Two months ago, when journalist
Oleg Bitov returned to the Soviet Union, he
held a press conference to claim that he did
not defect last year but was kidnapped by
British intelligence agents. Western diplo-
mats in Moscow expect nothing so dramatic
from Svetlana: at most, they believe, she
might appear in a taped interview with a
Soviet journalist or write an article chroni-
cling her disillusionment with the West. At
58, she is eligible for a pension, and she may
get back her old dacha or a similar one. A
Moscow source said she was negotiating
with the authorities about a job teaching
English at an institute.
Windfall: The Soviet government can be
expected to treat Svetlana well for one good
reason: her return represents a propaganda
windfall for them. It helps atone for the
embarrassment of her defection, and it of-
fers a welcome counterpoint to the many
Soviet defectors who have found freedom
and opportunity in the West. It may also
help solve a problem posed by next year’s
40th anniversary of VE Day, when Joseph
Stalin’s name will inevitably be in the fore-
front. For some Soviet citizens, his daugh-
ter’s defection was as great a stain on Stalin’s
memory as his bloody purges. But with
Svetlana’s return, the Kremlin may now go
ahead with the partial rehabilitation of Sta-
lin that began under Leonid Brezhnev.


U.S. AFFAIRS
Second-Term Tax Plans
Presenting Reagan Revolution II: Despite the president’s promises, tax simplification seems to be entangled with deficit reduction
The president’s men prepare a flat-tax proposal, but will Reagan buy it?
With the victorious cheers of his last
campaign still echoing in the Century
Plaza Hotel ballroom in Los Angeles, Ron-
ald Reagan spent last week savoring the
rustic comforts of Rancho del Cielo. The
achievements of his first term and the stun-
ning success of his re-election campaign
were all behind him; the great hope of his
second term —a historic breakthrough to-
ward nuclear-arms control with the Soviet
Union—lay somewhere in the unforesee-
able future. Meanwhile, there was the reali-
ty of practical governance: a Congress that
is still divided and perhaps even less man-
ageable than in the past and the onerous
chore of defending his economic program
against the army of skeptics who threaten to
undermine it.
Reagan could say—and did say, in a post-
election press conference—that the voters
had “approved of what we’re doing and
approved of the fact that the economy is
expanding.” He could also argue that the
essential purposes of his first-term revolu-
tion —cutting taxes, reducing the size of
government, nurturing “the opportunity
society”—remain intact. But he could not
say that he had tamed what Walter Mondale
called “those godawful deficits”—and in
postelection Washington, and even within
the administration itself, the deficit issue
had clearly re-emerged as a pre-eminent
cause for alarm. “On Mondays, Wednes-
days and Fridays, I think President Reagan
will wind up as Herbert Hoover —with a
total economic failure on his hands,” one
administration official joked darkly. “The
other days of the week, I think we’ll some-
how luck out or muddle through.”
New Offensive: Although White House
chief of staff James A. Baker 111 warned
repeatedly last week that the fight would not
be easy, many of the president’s men were
still proclaiming “Reagan Revolution II”
a bold new political offensive to consoli-
date and extend the gains of Revolution I.
Building on Reagan’s re-election mandate,
they aimed to push fundamental tax reform
through Congress, legislating the end of the
progressive income tax and replacing it with
a form of “flat rate” tax.
In principle, the flat-rate tax seemed like
an idea whose time had come: it would lower
tax rates for many taxpayers and radically
simplify the Gordian knot of deductions,
exemptions, write-olfs and loopholes of the
federal tax code. In practice, however, no
such reform would ever pass Congress with-
out overwhelming Republican support —
and the GOP’s failure to roll up significant
gains in the House on Nov. 6 didn’t help. In

it without hesitation: at the heart of
Europe.
Swissair, for its part, wasn’t going to
let matters rest there, but insisted on
adding to this already ideal location a
few more advantages for the traveller
(including, of course, the long-estab-
lished Swissair comfort in the First
Class, Business Class, and Economy
Class): for instance good connections
to and from 48 cities in 24 European
countries. And short connecting times
in Zurich and Geneva, so that the small
detour via Switzerland often actually
helps you'save time. There is always
time to succumb to the temptations of
our airports: jewellers and boutiques,
souvenir shops and delicatessens, bars
and restaurants, and the copious range
of goods in the tax-free shops.
But the transit areas at Zurich and
Geneva have other advantages too. At
the information desks you can get
advice in several languages. First Class
passengers can relax in a comfortable
lounge. And it’s only a short distance
to your connecting flight.
For Swissair, after all, everything
revolves around one central objective:
to make travelling as pleasant as pos-
sible for you in every way. And that’s
quite a point.

addition, there was ample evidence last
week that the goal of tax simplification had
become entangled with the problem of re-
ducing the deficit—and by extension, with
Mondale’s warning that Reagan would be
forced to raise taxes no matter what.
Reagan himself took pains to insist that
his intent was otherwise. “We’re not going
to try to deal with the deficit problem by
raising taxes,” he told reporters. And ad-
ministration spokesmen denied a News-
week report that there was indeed a secret
White House plan, to be presented to the
president after the election, that would re-
sult in higher taxes. (Newsweek’s report
did not say that the plan—part of “The
November Project”—called for traditional
tax hikes; the magazine stands by its story
that the “revenue neutral” tax simplifica-
tion proposed would almost certainly result
in some higher tax bills.) In Washington,
even friendly tax experts suggested that
Reagan had overlooked some crucial facts.
In truth, they said, a flat-rate tax would
mean higher taxes for many—in particular,
for upper-income taxpayers who now bene-
fit from the hodgepodge of tax preferences in
current law. Reagan “just misspoke on that
one,” said an aide to Republican Rep. Jack
Kemp. A Treasury official went further.
“Some individuals will pay more, and some
will pay less,” he said. “We sure hope that
someone who is making $l4 million and
avoiding most taxes ends up paying more.”
Contingencies: Reagan returns to Wash-
ington this week to map strategy for Revolu-
tion II —and no one, not even his closest
advisers, knows what the final game plan
will be. The political contingencies are
tough enough: given the Democrats’ contin-
ued control of the House, should Reagan
play hardball, or should he try to win con-
gressional support with a show of bipartisan
conciliation? The economic outlook is
murkier still—and in truth, the administra-
tion is just as divided over the deficit as it was
a year ago. The dispute pits supply-siders
like Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
against mainstreamers like budget director
David Stockman. Stockman and other mod-
erates believe the deficit will sooner or later
push interest rates up and force the economy
into recession. The supply-siders argue that
the deficit has had little or no effect on the
economy so far, and that it does not threaten
a recession in the foreseeable future.
The debate involves all the major com-
ponents of the administration’s second-
term economic game plan—the flat-rate tax
plan, the proposed constitutional amend-
ment to require a balanced budget and the
next round of budget cuts. The supply-sid-
ers want a flat tax that is revenue neutral,
which means that it would neither raise nor
lower the government’s tax receipts over all.
Stockman and presidential assistant Rich-
ard Darman have favored a flat tax that
raises federal revenues at least somewhat,
to reduce the deficit. Further budget cuts
can help reduce the deficit as well —but only
if Congress goes along, which now seems
Off to a break at the ranch: The voters, said Reagan, ‘approved of what we’re doing ’
problematic. And the balanced-budget
amendment, which would not take effect for
years even if passed, is regarded as a lost
cause. “We’ll keep it as part of the rhetoric,”
says one Reagan adviser, “but I don’t see a
chance in hell the Democrats would pass it.”
Stockman presents his list of possible
budget cuts to Reagan this week—and none
is easy. “We’ve been mauling this beast for
four years now, and the details are well
known,” says one budget official. “We don’t
need a bunch of option studies—we need
someone to decide what’s doable, or what
ought to be tried.’’Aides say the list includes
perennial favorites such as new cost-con-
tainment measures for Medicare and federal
pensions, further cutbacks in the federal
work force and a slowdown in Reagan’s
defense buildup. It also includes a few sa-
cred cows—farm subsidies and veterans’
health care, for example. Direct federal pay-
ments to the poor cannot be cut further
“without ripping the safety net, and that is
not contemplated,” one official says. “It’s
the turn of the middle class.” The bottom
line: every item on Stockman’s list is “politi-
cal dynamite.”
‘Bumps’: The flat-tax plan is equally likely
to encounter rough sledding in Congress—
for as one White House aide says, “It’s going
to be opposed by almost every special-inter-
est lobby in the country.” In fact, it is no
longer a flat-tax plan: after months of study,
the administration’s proposals now resem-
ble what one official calls a “flat tax with
bumps.” The “bumps” are roughly equiv


alent to the tax brackets of the current tax
code —but the “flatter” tax would replace
15 brackets with only three bumps. Under a
modified flat-tax plan proposed by Sen. Bill
Bradley and Rep. Dick Gephardt, for exam-
ple, there are four bumps: families earning
less than $11,200 would pay no tax at all;
families earning from $11,200 to $40,000
would pay a tax rate of 14 percent; families
earning up to $65,000 would pay 26 percent,
and families earning more than $65,000
would pay 30 percent. The prime concern
for many taxpayers, of course, is which
deductions would be allowed: administra-
tion planners at this point are committed to
preserving only the deductions for mort-
gage interest and charitable contributions.
Deadline: Taken together, the budget cuts
and the tax-reform plan would be a formida-
ble economic agenda for any administra-
tion —even one re-elected in a landslide of
historic proportions. Reagan’s men have
known all along, moreover, that time is of
the essence in Revolution II; by their esti-
mate, the president would have no more
than a year, and perhaps only nine months,
to push his new economic agenda through
Congress. The election returns in the House,
however, make even that estimate optimis-
tic—and the question now is whether there
will be a second Reagan revolution at all.

Mondale Says Goodbye
The runners-up, posing with family and friends: ‘Time to do something else ’
Walter Mondale faced the morning after with characteristic
grace. “Based on an incomplete analysis of the returns, I think
there’s a good chance I won’t win this election,” he joked to aides
and supporters at a final press conference in St. Paul. Then he
quietly announced that this campaign had been his last. “Just as
you have to know when to get into politics... it takes strength to
know when it’s time to do something else,” he said. After a family
vacation in the Virgin Islands and some hunting back home, he
planned to return to a law practice in Washington. “I think the
time has come to pursue certain economic necessities, among
other things,” Mondale said. “My family has given to me all these
years, and they’re entitled to something, too.”
Avoiding bitterness or harsh words, Mondale credited Ronald
Reagan’s victory to the president’s personal appeal, noting that
the landslide was not matched by commensurate GOP gains in
the Senate or the House. He also said he had no regrets about
promising to raise taxes —and predicted that Reagan’s pledge to
avoid tax hikes would haunt him in his second term. “One of the
biggest meals of crow this administration will eat —and there w’ill
be several —will be this one concerning revenues,” Mondale said.
“That problem is the equivalent of a domestic hydrogen bomb.”
‘Scared’: Mondale conceded that the bloody primary battle
“left scars” on his campaign. But he blamed his defeat largely on
his own inability to communicate his vision. “I thought my
message was a moderate, sound and solid one. It didn’t take,” he
said. “Modern politics requires a mastery of television,” he
added, admitting he had never warmed up to the medium —nor
had it warmed to him. “By instinct and tradition, I don’t like the
thing,” he said. “I like to look someone in
the eye.” While he advised future presi-
dential hopefuls to learn to use TV effec-
tively, Mondale said he was “scared”
that “American politics is losing its sub-
stance . . . We’ve got to find people who
can handle it at both levels.”
In a press conference of her own, run-
ning mate Geraldine Ferraro said she
wanted her candidacy remembered as
“the first step in opening doors for wom-
en in national politics.” She insisted
there was a gender gap in last week’s
voting, with 62 percent of men, and 54
percent of women, favoring Ronald Rea-
gan. “It’s not that we lost [the election],
but that he won it—won it handily,” she
said. Ferraro refused to see her loss as a
setback for women in politics, since the
campaign drew vast numbers of female
contributors and volunteers. Nor would
she admit being disappointed in how the
majority of women voted. Women “are
on the rise. We are not monolithic,” she
said. “We have perfectly independent minds.”
Many women’s leaders were not so optimistic. “I feel as if I
have no country,” mourned Gloria Steinem. “We’re going to
have to spend four years fighting very hard to keep from going
backwards.” The defeats of many other women candidates
darkened their mood further. Of 10 women running for the
Senate, only incumbent Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum
won her race. Madeleine Kunin was narrowly elected governor
in Vermont, and 20 incumbent women House members were re-
elected. But only two of 41 women seeking new House seats were
successful, with one race too close to call. Still, women’s leaders
joined Ferraro in predicting that more women would seek
office —successfully—in coming years. “A transition has to take
place . . . Americans are not ready for change overnight,” said
former New York Rep. Bella Abzug. Indeed, there were signs
that women are slowly filling up the pipelines at lower political
levels: 939 of 1,756 women running for state legislative seats won
election last week, compared with 911 in 1982.
Incognito: Asked how she would adjust to life without the
adoring crowds, Ferraro laughed that she had given instructions
to her children: “When I come down to breakfast, it’s ‘Gerr-ee!
Gerr-ee!’ ” Having occasionally donned a scarf and sunglasses to
go grocery shopping incognito in the last few months, Ferraro
may welcome the respite—at least until her next campaign. For
Mondale, who has spent two-thirds of his adult life in politics, the
transition may be harder. Returning to Washington from St.
Paul, his campaign plane, the Louisville Slugger, made a long,
slow pass over the Potomac for a panoramic view of the city he
will never again see from quite the same perspective.

You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet?
You ain’t seen nothing yet,” a victorious
Ronald Reagan crowed, and a future of
brisk economic growth may have been fore-
most on his mind. But the economy’s recent
performance hasn’t done much for expec-
tations: the slowdown in growth that be-
gan last summer has stretched into the
fall, lowering corporate profits, holding un-
employment even and nudging interest
rates steadily downward. Many econo-
mists are now trimming their forecasts
for the fourth quarter, and predicting
more lackluster times ahead. “We’re
going to have a wobbly economy in all
dimensions for at least the first half” of
Reagan’s second term, predicts Roger
Brinner, an economist at Data Re-
sources Inc., an econometric forecast-
ing firm.
Reagan administration officials vig-
orously dispute that view; one Treas-
ury official calls the current slowdown
merely “the pause that refreshes.” In
truth, the sluggishness is something of
a welcome relief. After two years of
recovery and expansion that exceeded
nearly all forecasts, a slower pace is
probably necessary to hold inflation in
check. But at the same time, sailing
through the current doldrums makes
charting the proper course for econom-
ic policy increasingly urgent. Unless
monetary growth is held steady and
budget deficits reduced, some econo-
mists warn, an even sharper slowdown
may be ahead.
Prime Dip: Analysts trace much of
the economy’s sluggishness to the Fed-
eral Reserve, which sought to moderate
the pace of expansion by tightening
money growth last spring. As a result,
the banking industry’s own “cost of
funds” rose, businesses’ short-term
borrowings fell and both short- and
long-term interest rates embarked on a
slow decline. Last week, for example,
most of the nation’s biggest banks
lowered their prime lending rate one-
quarter point, to 1134 percent, well
below its recent high of 13 percent
(chart). Now, with the nation’s basic
money supply growing at only a negli-
gible rate, chairman Paul Volcker and
his fellow Fed governors are believed to
have loosened the reins at last. That should
send interest rates still lower in the
months ahead: Allen Sinai, an economist
at Shearson Lehman/American Express,
thinks rates will fall at least another quarter
percentage point in the next few weeks.
Falling rates could provide a spur to get
the economy moving faster again. While
rates adjusted for inflation would still seem
steep, economist David Hale of Kemper
Financial Services predicts that they would
in fact be low enough to spark auto sales and
launch another boom in housing construc-
tion. Lower rates could also fuel the financial
markets and lead to a resurgence in business
investment for plant and equipment, which
has slowed in recent months. Most impor-
tant, a decline in interest rates could contin-
ue to push the strong U.S. dollar lower if
foreign investors reacted by withdrawing

their funds from dollar-denominated invest-
ments. That would be a godsend for Ameri-
can manufacturers, many of whom have
been clobbered at home by cheap imports or
shut out of export markets because of the
greenback’s strength. As a result, America’s
merchandise trade deficit grew at an aston-
ishing annual rate of $ 120 billion in the third
quarter, lopping about 3 percentage points
otf economic growth during the period.
Economist Gary Wenglowski of Goldman,
Sachs & Co., believes the damage has been so
great that it has nearly offset the stimulus to
the economy provided by tax cuts and mas-
sive government spending.
Even with a decline in rates, few econo-
mists are expecting the dollar to drop more
than 10 percent against major currencies in
the months ahead. A steadier dollar would
help the economy in one important respect:
if imports stay cheap, inflation should re-
main low, and the Fed will have less reason
in the future to keep the money supply tight.
But at the same time, the government’s
mammoth borrowing demands will contin-
ue to keep pressure on interest rates; last
week, for example, rates on govern-
ment securities rose temporarily as the
Treasury auctioned off $17.5 billion in
notes and bonds. If the economy does
heat up again, private-sector credit de-
mands could be “crowded out” by
those of the government in the kind of
dangerous competition for investors’
funds that many economists have been
predicting.
No More Boom? According to An-
drew Brimmer, a former Federal Re-
serve Board governor and now a pri-
vate economist, those pressures will
be great enough to drive the economy
into what is known as a “growth reces-
sion”—a rate of expansion too slow
to keep unemployment from rising.
“The boom is over,” Brimmer
says. “We’re facing a slowdown
on every front. ’ ’ Other economists
think the damage in the short run may
be even worse. Michael Drury, a senior
economist at A. Gary Shilling & Co. in
New York, predicts that high real in-
terest rates —and sluggish consumer
spending evident in slower Christmas
sales —will lead to little or no growth
for the first half of 1985. But Drury also
believes that such a mild “correction”
will serve to improve the economy’s
prospects in the longer run. If the sharp
slowdown he foresees drives rates low-
er, they could unlock a surge of con-
sumer spending that would set the
stage for a sharp economic rebound in
1986 and 1987.
Reagan’s key economic advisers are
more optimistic, predicting that the
gross national product will expand by 4
percent a year from 1985 through the
end of the decade. While that is clearly
more bullish than many private fore-
casts, it hardly amounts to a prediction
of exuberant growth. Above all, that
low a rate of expansion probably isn’t
enough to support Reagan’s belief that the
economy can grow its way out of federal
deficits. Further cuts in federal spending
and tax hikes seem certain to follow if the
economic expansion is to be kept on course.
When it comes to reining in fiscal policy,
what he ain’t seen yet may surprise even the
president.

The Most
Exotic Destination
From first arrival, Thailand
confronts the visitor with
a multitude of images both
splendid and startling.
The country is blessed
with fine gifts of nature:
lush jungles in the moun-
tains of the north, fertile
green plains in the heart-
land, shimmering beaches
and arcadian islands in the
south.
And for five thousand
years rich civilizations
have existed under
Thailand’s tropical sun.
Because of its location at
the crossroads of Asia, the
area has experienced a
flux of cultures from India,
China, Burma, Malaya and
Indo-China.
All have left their traces,
but by far the most impor-
tant are the Buddhist reli-
gion, and a naturally toler-
ant attitude in the people.
Around the beginning of
the twelfth century, a
group called the Thai Noi
moved down from Yun-
nan Province in China to
settle on the northern
plains. Based around a city
called Sukhothai, their cul-
ture developed a unique
character that became the
foundation of modern
Thailand.
The Thai people reflect
the traditions of their
exquisite, centuries-old
culture. Despite adopting
some Western dress styles
and technologies, they
proudly retain their own
ways, their own identity.
That’s just one of the
reasons why Thailand is
among the great travel
destinations of the world.
Visitors have always
been enchanted by the
beauty of the land, capti-
vated by the serene grace
of the people and their
friendliness.
Thai cultural achieve-
ments have a special attrac-
tion, from the spectacular
flowerings of architecture
and sculpture, through the
intricate beauty of Thai
music and dance, to the
accomplished splendour
of the weaving, carving,
metalwork and other
handicrafts.
The Warmest
Hospitality
Hospitality is a major fac-
tor in the success of any
holiday, and no people are
more warmly hospitable
than the Thai.
Two of the sayings
you’ll hear most frequent-
ly are “maipen rai” - it
doesn’t matter - and “sanuk”
- to enjoy or have fun.
This is how the Thai
people like visitors to
experience their land:
relax, enjoy, have fun.
And while you’re in
their country, they’ll do
everything they can to
make sure that your stay is
everything you want it to
be.
For example, whatever
your accomodation needs
and tastes, you’ll find
them well covered in vir-
tually every part of Thai-
land.
And although the Thais
are justifiably proud of
their own fine cuisine,
you’ll have no trouble
finding restaurants that
serve good Western food.
But be certain not to
miss the great tastes and
sensations of Thai cook-

ing. The seafood is at least
the equal to any in the
world, the fruits are a
mouthwatering delight,
and the spiced dishes offer
a vast spectrum of taste
surprises. If you like your
food hot, watch out for
the potent green and
yellow peppers!
With your every need
catered to by your friendly
hosts, you’re free to relax,
enjoy - and take in the
rich variety of experiences
this land has to offer.
Bangkok
As heir to the great heri-
tage of Thailand’s past, the
city contains many of the
finest achievements of
Thai culture.
Most outstanding is the
Grand Palace and the
adjoining Temple of the
Emerald Buddha, one of
the great architectural
wonders of Asia. It was
built by King Rama 1, and
completed in 1785.
Nearby is the National
Museum, a treasure-house
full of art and artefacts
from Thailand’s rich

history.
All around the city are
the beautiful temples -
called Wats - of Thailand’s
Buddhist religion. Places
of peace and serenity, vir-
tually all have something
to offer, be it fine architec-
ture, evocative paintings
and sculptures, fascinating
rituals or simply oases of
tranquillity.
Shopping Bargains
Shoppers always have a
great time in Bangkok.
Well known bargains are
Thai silk, precious stones
and jewellery, but you’ll
find good value in many
other items. Traditional
handicrafts like wood-
carvings, silverware, Thai
dolls and temple rub-
bings are excellent buys,
along with modern items
like tailormade clothing -
you can still get a good
suit or dress made up in
twenty four hours - and
fine leatherware.
Good shopping venues
abound, from traditional
markets to massive
modern complexes, and
in many places bargaining
is an accepted practice.
It’s well worth making a
special shopping expedi-
tion to the Weekend Mar-
ket, an enormous bazaar
where you’ll find every-
thing from cut-price cloth-
ing to tropical fish on
sale.
And don’t miss the
Floating Market, where
Thai water dwellers
do their buying, selling
and trading. It means an
early morning trip, but
this is one of the truly
unique experiences of
Thailand.
To fully appreciate Bang-
kok, it’s essential to save
some energy for when the
sun goes down. From
superb restaurants to
swinging bars and discos,
Bangkok offers a nightlife
to please and delight
everyone.
Around Bangkok
Bangkok is the centre of
an alluvial plain so rich
and fertile that the visiting
Europeans of the nine- |
teenth century referred to
it as “The Garden of Siam”'
A trip down any of the ’
myriad canals that run
through this area provides
the ideal way to experi-
ence the beauty of rural
Thailand, and may well be
the highlight of your
entire stay.
Also near Bangkok are
two complexes that pro-
vide a good insight into
the traditional culture and
way of life of the country.
The Rose Garden has daily
presentations of Thai
dances and ceremonies, as
well as staging demonstra-
tions of age-old work rou-
tines - including elephants
in action! The Ancient City
is a vast area of private
parkland with replicas,
many full size, of Thai-
land’s most historic monu-
ments.

Beaches and Islands
Stretching out along the
Gulf of Thailand on the
east coast, and lapped by
the crystal waters of the
Andaman Sea on the west
coast, are 3,000 miles of
glistening beaches.
Most famous is Pattaya,
a comprehensive interna-
tional resort complex a
short drive to the south of
Bangkok. Here are clear,
quiet waters, miles of
sand, waving palms,
hotels for all budgets -
and a nightlife to rival the
big city.
But if you really want
your own private paradise,
you’ll love the idyllic
southern islands of Phuket
and Koh Samui.
Ancient Cities
Remnants of Thailand’s
long and glorious past are
everywhere throughout
the country, but none are
more impressive than the
ruins of the old capitals
Sukhothai and Ayutthaya.
Sukhothai, deep in the
north-west, presided over
the birth of the first Thai
state in the twelfth centu-
ry. It was eclipsed by the
rise of Ayutthaya, but
Thais still nostalgically
regard its achievements as
the purest expression of
their culture.
Ayutthaya, near to Bang-
kok, was once a glittering
city that dominated the
whole region and awed
visitors from the courts of
Europe. When it was
sacked and burned by
invaders in 1762, much of
the priceless heritage of
the country was lost.

Chiang Mai
and The North
Chiang Mai is known as
“The Rose of The North
Situated in a cool valley
800 kms. north-west of
Bangkok, visitors come to
enjoy its mild climate,
relaxed pace and friendly
people.
Though distinctly Thai,
the area has its own cultur-
al character. Look for the
Burmese influence in the
beautiful old wats (notably
Wat Prasingh, founded in
1345), visit the local vil-
lages specializing in fine
craftwork, or shop in the
markets for artefacts from
the region’s hilltribe
people.
Above all, Chiang Mai
possesses a special ambi-
ence and exerts a subtle
charm that leaves an
indelible impression on
the visitor.
Jungle Adventures
Thailand’s jungles offer
special adventure opportu-
nities for those who like
outdoor action.
Best known are the treks
into the highlands north
of Chiang Mai to visit the
colourful ethnic minority
groups known as the Hill-
tribe People.
A more leisurely experi-
ence is drifting on a spe-
cially constructed raft
down the River Kwai in
Kanchanaburi Province.
Or witness the extra-
ordinary spectacle of the
elephant roundup in
Surin.
Whatever you have in
mind for a holiday, you’ll
find it in Thailand - and
so much more.

WORLD BUSINESS
The U.S.High-Tech Embargo
Intercepted cargo of Russia-bound computers: With the American crackdown, the Soviets have turned to smuggling
Blocking exports that could reach communist nations may do more harm than good.
Last January, Teltone, Inc., of Kirkland,
Wash., won a $250,000 order to supply
telephone-switching gear to the govern-
ment-run phone system in a NATO country
in northern Europe. As required by law, it
applied to the U.S. Commerce Department
for an export license, in the past a routine
matter. Teltone officials were stunned when
Commerce held up the application because
the system’s tone-to-pulse converter was on
a list of technologies considered vital to U.S.
security. “I can’t for the life of me
understand how they can classify
a 20-year-old technology as ‘high
technology’,” says Arne Midts-
kog, Teltone’s international sales
director. “I would understand if
these things had a shadow of mili-
tary or strategic use.” Six months
later, Teltone finally got its li-
cense—only to fight another long
battle for the right to ship a $750
order to the Far East. “We are
losing business because of this
nonsense,” says Midtskog.
Teltone officials are not alone in
their exasperation. In an effort
that began under Jimmy Carter
and intensified in the Reagan ad-
ministration, the United States is
trying to stop exports of American
technology that could contribute
to the military potential of the
Warsaw Pact. Administration hard-liners,
led by Richard Perle, the assistant secretary
of defense for international-security policy,
sought to go even further, not only restrict-
ing exports of such familiar equipment as
the Apple II computer, but also banning
foreign nationals from U.S. research labs
and limiting discussion of even unclassified
research at technical conferences. And
good fences make bad neighbors: last sum-
mer the United States enraged its allies by

seeking tighter regulation of computer ex-
ports from Europe and Japan as well,
There is little doubt that the Soviet Union
has benefited from Western technologies,
According to Stephen Bryen, Perle’s deputy
at the Pentagon, the Soviets during detente
built a dozen semiconductor factories with
Western equipment. And experts say that
many components of Soviet weapons sys-
terns are of Western origin or design. But
with the crackdown since the Export Ad-
ministration Act of 1979, the East
bloc has turned more to smug-
gling: in a highly publicized case
last year, authorities intercepted a
shipment of VAX minicomputers
bound for the Soviet Union that
had been smuggled through dum-
my corporations in South Africa.
Customs officials now routinely
search outgoing shipments for
proscribed equipment.
But critics believe that restric-
tions will ultimately do far more
damage to the United States than
to the Warsaw Pact. For one
thing, there is no U.S. commercial
monopoly on technology. “In
fact, about 75 percent of the high-
tech goods sold in Free World
markets in 1982 were made out-
side the United States,” says Gen-
eral Electric’s Boyd McKelvain,

vice chairman of the Industry Coalition on
Technology Transfer. Heavy restrictions
reward foreign competitors, with losses to
American firms perhaps running into bil-
lions of dollars.
More important in the long run, techno-
logical progress is threatened. In mid-1982,
the Pentagon forced researchers to with-
draw more than 100 technical papers from a
symposium of the Society of Photo-optical
Instrumentation Engineers, on the ground
that East bloc scientists were scheduled to
attend. In July 1983, the Pentagon forced
withdrawal from an Alaska conference on
permafrost of six unclassified papers on
pipeline construction and the maintenance
of roads and airfields in permafrost condi-
tions. Bryen justified the action by pointing
to disrepair in the Soviet military infrastruc-
ture; he did not think the Pentagon should
“brief the Russians on how to main-
tain their airfields in Siberia.”
Strength: The scientific communi-
ty finds such single-mindedness
alarming. “If we lock up our basic
research, we will do far greater dam-
age than if we allowed the leakage,”
says Michael Dertouzos, director of
the Laboratory for Computer Science
at MIT. “Free communication be-
tween science, technology and the
high-tech companies is what gives us
our strength.” Adds Wolfgang Pan-
ofsky, director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and a member of
a commission studying technology
transfer: “We found no discernible
impact on Soviet [capabilities] from
the acquisition of know-how through
scientific channels.”
The attempts to exclude non-U.S.
citizens from scientific meetings or to
consider discussions with them “ex-
ports” that are subject to license also
ignore fundamental realities. Today
nearly half the students receiving
Ph.D.’s in engineering in U.S. univer-
sities are foreigners, and many of the
strongest U.S. technology firms have
research labs and operations all over
the globe.
One of the biggest problems is the Penta-
gon’s 700-page Militarily Critical Technol-
ogies List, the MCTL. The Pentagon drew
up the classified list under the Export Ad-
ministration Act (since expired), but in a
case of bureaucratic overkill, the document
became a laundry list —not a careful catalog
of truly critical technologies. And the list
reportedly ignored the fact that many of the
so-called critical technologies are available
in commercial markets all over the world.
Thus, the administration tried to block
exports of some kinds of “embedded micro-
processors”—the computer chips now used
in thousands of commercial products—be-
cause the Soviets could convert them to
other uses. The Pentagon blocked sales of
digital-telephone-switching systems to the
Soviet bloc, on the ground that they would
allow the Soviet defense ministry to pre-
empt civilian users and convert the tele-
phone network over to a military command
and control system. And Pentagon officials
sought to tighten restrictions on aircraft
and jet-engine sales, inertial navigation
gear—and drydocks.
Some suspect that the government’s dog-
gedness reflects the inability of the Penta-
gon bureaucracy to keep up with the state of
the art in technology. The attempted ban on
the Apple 11, for instance, followed an
Army discovery that the machine could—
with special software —be used in place of
the huge “portable” command systems it
had been hauling around in trailer trucks.
But the Apple II is seven years old. “Thirty
years ago, military technology was vastly
superior to what you could find in
the marketplace,” says Brad Stoup, chief
spokesman for Data General. “Today com-
...and that
***ll kzm mp
contact with
Sworn enctnk*
A loyalty oath for high technology: Inhibiting the flow of scientific communication
mercial technology is five or 10 years ahead
of what the military has.”
The military’s lag was underlined two
years ago when the board of directors of the
American Electronics Association toured
NORAD, the North American Aerospace
Defense Command headquarters in Chey-
enne Mountain, Colo. “These are mostly
CEO’s of their companies, all very high-
tech oriented,” says Stoup. “They went in
joking and laughing. Two hours later they
came out pale and shaking. What they had
seen was junk, so old and obsolete —1970
vintage, literally—that they’d have been
embarrassed even to repair it.”
Technology-transfer policy now hinges
on the climate during Reagan’s second
term. When Congress adjourned without
re-enacting or replacing the Export Ad-
ministration Act, the president signed an
order extending the provisions of the old
bill. New legislative proposals are expected
soon after Congress convenes in January,
but the administration’s stance is unclear.
In the months before the election, a slight-
ly more relaxed policy emerged, thanks
apparently to Secretary of Commerce Mal-
colm Baldrige, who outmanuevered Perle
and the Pentagon. And in the Coordinat-
ing Committee (CoCom) negotiations with
U.S. allies in Paris in July, the United
States compromised on several key provi-
sions—such as excluding 8-bit personal
computers like the Apple II from export
controls.
Many expect renewed efforts at restric-
tion now that Reagan has been re-elected.
“There are regulatory proposals floating
around ... that could fundamentally alter
the way we have done business for dec-
ades,” says a Washington lawyer who rep-
resents a number of high-tech clients.
Some suspect the hard-liners of believing
that the Soviet regime will collapse if de-
nied Western technology. That may be a
vain hope. In 1565, King Sigismund of
Poland wrote a letter to Elizabeth I im-
ploring her to prevent British merchants
from trading with Russia: “We repeat once
more to your Majesty that the Tsar of
Moscow, enemy of all liberty, increases his
forces day by day through the advantages
of trade and by his relations with the
civilized nations of Europe ... Our only
hope rests in our superiority in the arts and
sciences, but soon he will know as much.”
Four centuries later, only the names have
changed.

Israel’s Inflationary Chaos
Removing dollar-denominated price signs: Creating a bureaucratic nightmare
Israel may be able to lick opponents on the
battlefield, but it has been far less suc-
cessful in conquering its enemy in the mar-
ketplace—inflation. To keep pace with
weekly price rises that run as high as 100
percent, many supermarkets are forced to
employ large stock crews whose main func-
tion is simply to update price tags. The
constant increases have created glaring
price discrepancies. In one recently report-
ed case, a store in the town of Ramat Ha-
Sharon was selling bags of soap for $6.60;
but at another shop in Beit Shean the same
bag was moving just as well at $ 17. Connois-
seurs of the absurd have also noted that it
now costs the Israeli government 10 shekels
to mint a one-shekel coin.
For years, Israelis have been sheltered
from the worst ravages of inflation by an
elaborate indexing system that covers ev-
erything from wages and rents to savings
plans and insurance policies. Recently,
however, that safety shield
has worn thin. As the annu-
al inflation rate has sky-
rocketed to 1,000 percent,
the real purchasing power
of the Israeli currency is
plunging by one percent a
day. A $1.2 billion transfu-
sion from Washington and a
pledge from President Rea-
gan not to stand by and let
the Israeli economy col-
lapse have provided a
much-needed boost in con-
fidence. But in part because
of the costly invasion and
occupation of Lebanon and
soaring government spend-
ing, the country still faces the prospect of
unprecedented economic chaos, labor un-
rest and production halts. To head off a
catastrophe, Prime Minister Shimon Peres
recently announced a three-month freeze
on all prices, wages, profits and taxes. Other
measures included a ban on dollar-denomi-
nated pricing, which some businessmen had
used to cushion the effects of inflation.
Nightmare: But there are already signs
that Peres’s emergency package may not do
everything he hoped it would. Among other
problems, the Peres plan has created a bu-
reaucratic nightmare. Retailers are sup-
posed to hold off on selling new products
until an official price has been set. But many
merchants say they cannot wait for the gov-
ernment to make such rulings. “Strictly
speaking, hundreds of us are already violat-
ing the regulations,” says Avraham Birn-
baum of the Merchants’ Association in Je-
rusalem, “and hundreds of other stores are
Peres after signing the economic package: Heading off a catastrophe?
SHLOMO ARAD
about to do so.” For their part, manufactur-
ers have warned that production may grind
to a standstill if they are not allowed some
price increases. “Our supplier has already
put us on notice that he will have no sheet
metal at the frozen prices after [this] Fri-
day,” says Avner Perez, whose company
makes air conditioners and electric heaters.
TizzleOut 5 : The prime minister has man-
dated stiff penalties for any violations of the
freeze. Even so, government analysts have
conceded that the measures will probably
do no more than cool inflation to about 10
percent a month. But many private econo-
mists have dismissed that projection as
overly optimistic. “The freeze will fizzle out
in a month,” says one economist, “or it will
create a huge black market and complete
stagnation.”
Whatever the case, the inflation crisis
poses a serious political threat to Peres by
intensifying the tensions between his own
Labor faction and its Likud partners in the
two-month-old national-unity government.
At least two key Likud leaders, Minister of
Commerce and Industry Ariel Sharon and
Deputy Prime Minister David Levy, are
believed to be expecting that the experiment
will fail. According to one scenario, Sharon
and Levy would exploit the collapse of the
economic reforms to oust Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who has loyally supported
the plan, from the leadership of the Likud.
The next step would be to bring down what
remained of the Peres government and call
for new elections.
The shrewd Peres, however, is not wait-
ing for that to happen. To build up his
support in the coalition, he has courted
some of the Likud’s more moderate mem-
bers. One leader of the liberal faction has
already called on his group to switch to the
Labor Party. The prime minister is also
working hard to drive a wedge between the
Likud and its major ally, the National Reli-
gious Party (NRP); Peres has offered two
portfolios to the NRP’s leader, Yosef Burg.
But the prime minister is also acutely
aware that he faces an uphill battle to win
public confidence in his policies. Although
79 percent of the Israelis interviewed for a
recent survey applauded his efforts, only
41 percent believed that the measures
would succeed in bringing
inflation under control.
And on a recent tour of a
Jerusalem supermarket for
a firsthand look at how the
freeze was working, Peres
found that many shoppers
were still puzzled by some
aspects of the plan. At the
end of the tour, Peres wanly
admitted that “these are not
going to be easy months
ahead.” Just how difficult
they are could determine
the fate of Jerusalem’s coali-
tion government.

Another Warrior in Court
Sharon in southern Lebanon in 1982: Was there a ‘blood libel’ after the massacre?
SHLOMO ARAD—WOODFIN CAMP
Gen. William C. Westmoreland isn’t the
only old soldier in court with a com-
plaint against the press. At a trial expected
to begin this week in New York, former
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon will
charge that Time magazine falsely accused
him of encouraging the 1982 massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians in Lebanese refu-
gee camps, following the assassination of
Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
The passage at issue was part of a T ime cover
story dated Feb. 21, 1983. It said that a
secret appendix to the official Israeli report
on the massacre referred to a condolence
call on the Gemayel family during which
Sharon discussed the need for Christian
Phalangists to “take revenge.” Sharon
terms the Time article a “blood libel”—an
emotionally charged phrase invoking the
anti-Semitic myth that Jews murder non-
Jews to obtain blood for the Passover and
other rituals. He is seeking $5O million in
damages.
Sharon’s lawyers will argue that Time is
guilty of “actual malice,” that the magazine
printed a “knowing falsehood,” and that
David Halevy, who reported the informa-
tion, was an unreliable correspondent who
substituted “guesswork” for actual sources.
They also charge that Time in
general has a “vicious bias”
against Israel, and plan to in-
troduce more than 150 exam-
ples that they say illustrate the
bias, including a 1977 story
about former Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin
noting that his name “rhymes
with Fagin”—a negative Jew-
ish stereotype in Dickens’s
“Oliver Twist.”
Time Inc., which is repre-
sented by Cravath, Swaine &
Time cover: Under fire
Moore (the same firm defending CBS in the
Westmoreland trial), will argue there is no
proof of actual malice or evidence of damage
done to Sharon, now Israel’s minister of
commerce and industry. Stuart W. Gold,
one of Time’s attorneys, says that after the
defense rests, “there won’t be much to the
notion that the story was fabricated.”
Price: The Israeli government is not neu-
tral in the case, Time claims. Most of Time’s
attempts to summon as witnesses senior Is-
raeli Army officers have been frustrated by
officials; and earlier this year the Israeli
government allowed Sharon to make a lu-
crative tax-free speaking tour of the United
States to aid him in financing his suit.
Some Israeli officials have criticized
Sharon for bringing the suit because it re-
vives the massacre issue. Others note that
Sharon has already paid a price in connec-
tion with the massacre. In its published
report, the Kahan Commission, named for
Yitzhak Kahan, president of Israel’s Su-
preme Court, charged him with “indirect
responsibility” for the massacre. He was
then forced to resign as defense minister.
Sharon has already brought a similar
suit against Time in Israel; it has yet to
come to trial. Friends say that he decided
to sue in the United States
because he believes that he
must clear his name among
American Jews if he is ever to
become Israel’s prime minis-
ter. With jury selection com-
pleted and a last-minute bid
for summary judgment de-
nied Time last week, the most
combative of Israeli war he-
roes will now get his chance.

Dental Tech: Healthier Teeth, Less Pain
Does hearing the whine of a dentist’s
drill make you cringe? If so, you’re
not alone. Surveys show that about 12
million Americans are so scared of den-
tal treatment that they skip regular pro-
fessional dental care altogether. Yet re-
cent advances in dental technology may
soon make a dental appointment no
more unpleasant than getting a haircut.
The best way to avoid drilling and
filling cavities is by preventing them in
the first place. Researchers at the Na-
tional Institute of Dental Research in
Bethesda, Md., are testing a “button”
that is worn in the mouth and delivers a
constant fluoride treatment to the teeth.
Fluoride is one of the best means of
reducing the incidence of
tooth decay. But fluoride in
toothpaste and water sup-
plies is not always enough.
Most people brush their
teeth improperly. And the
beneficial effects of fluori-
dated water can be boosted
with topical applications of
fluoride.
A Fluoride Bath
The button, about the
size of an aspirin tablet but
only half as thick, is bond-
ed to the outside of a mo-
lar with dental cement. The
core of the device contains a
blend of fluoride and plas-
tic. An outer coating con-
trols the release of the flu-
oride into the mouth. The
button can constantly bathe
the teeth in fluoride for about six
months, at which time it is replaced.
Tests with animals have shown that the
button reduces the incidence of cavities
by as much as 60 percent. In tests with
people, the button was occasionally dis-
lodged during eating; some volunteers
complained of a peculiar taste for the
first few days. But if a new test using
children goes well, the device could be on
the market within five years. The button
would probably be installed by a dentist
during a routine checkup and would cost
about $lO.
Neither the fluoride button nor any
other single device will prevent all cav-
ities. But a new method of dealing with
those cavities that do occur largely elimi-
nates the need for drilling. The Caridex
100 system, developed by National Pat-
ent Development Corp. of New Bruns-
wick, N. J., was recently approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The system is already successfully used
by dentists in Japan, where the Kuraray
Co. of Osaka calls the product Softclear.
To use Softclear the dentist sprays a
clear liquid through a narrow nozzle
onto a decaying tooth. The chemical
softens the decayed portion of the tooth
but leaves the healthy portion intact.
The dentist then simply scrapes away the
decayed matter. Because no anesthetic is
needed, the dentist can fill more cavities
during one sitting; dentists using an an-
esthetic generally work on only one side
Rebuilding with HA (from top left): Preserving the jawline
of the mouth at a time to reduce the risk
of a patient accidentally biting his
numbed cheek or tongue. Enough Soft-
clear to treat 10 cavities costs only $9; the
machine needed to mix the solution costs
$1,900. The procedure should be avail-
able in the United States by February of
next year.
Despite the best care, the occasional
diseased tooth does need to be pulled.
Extractions solve one problem and cause
another: jawbones with missing teeth
tend to shrink over time. In its advanced
stages, this condition makes it difficult
for patients to eat and speak and distorts
their facial appearance. Last May, Calci-
tek Inc. of San Diego, Calif., introduced
Calcitite Ridge Maintainers, wedge-
shaped implants made of a special ce-
ramie material called hydroxylapatite
(HA). After a tooth is extracted, the
socket is filled with a Ridge Maintainer
($8). Because the ceramic is chemically
similar to tooth enamel and bone, the
maintainer preserves the width and
height of the jawbone.
Rebuilding the Jawline
Calcitite, as well as other formulations
of HA, is also used to correct jawbones
that have already shrunk. In a two-hour
office procedure, an oral surgeon uses a
syringe to inject a solution of the materi-
al through an incision in the gum. After
six weeks, enough new tissue forms
around the implant to cre-
ate a firm, rejuvenated jaw-
line. With jaws that have
lost all of their teeth, the
bone can be rebuilt layer by
layer until it can accept im-
planted dentures. The HA
procedure is permanent
—unlike metal implants,
which must be refitted as
the jawbone continues to
shrink. Treating an entire
jaw can cost up to $3OO for
the HA alone.
Even as new procedures
are making it easier to treat
dental disorders, scientists
are pushing ahead with bas-
ic research that one day may
eliminate dental problems
entirely. Researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania
are working with a device
that can monitor several
functions of the mouth simultaneously.
Electrochemical sensors resembling
toothbrush bristles are placed in a vol-
unteer’s mouth. The sensors monitor
the level of acidity in the mouth (too
acid an environment encourages decay;
too alkaline an environment encourages
tartar). The device also checks calcium
interactions and swallowing frequency.
These data help researchers understand
the workings of the mouth. Eventually,
dentists may use mass-produced ver-
sions of these sensors to prescribe diets,
oral rinses and hygiene habits that can
head off periodontal disease —and make
visiting the dentist a good deal less
unsettling.

Australia’s
languishing
boat person
IT DOES not look as though
Michael David Flecker will be
voting for Bob Hawke on
December 1. Or for Andrew
Peacock.
Flecker, 23, was engineer
aboard the American-regis-
tered yacht So Fong, en route
from Thailand to Hong Kong,
when it was intercepted by a
patrol boat on July 22 on the
grounds that it had entered
Vietnamese waters.
The So Fong had an Am-
erican owner-skipper and a
crew comprising Flecker and
two French women with their
children.
The Vietnamese told am-
bassador Richard Broinowski
of their prize on August 2,
which the Australian Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs con-
sidered tardy. They let the
children go on September 8
and released the women on
September 20. But the men
have been cooling their heels
at Cantho at the southern tip
of Vietnam since, while their
intrusion is “investigated.”
Foreign Minister Bill Hay-
den at the United Nations last
year withdrew Australian co-
sponsorship of the annual
ASEAN resolution condemn-
ing Vietnam for invading
Kampuchea and had the
Vietnamese Foreign Minister
in as an official Australian
guest last March. Hayden
even talked of possible aid to
Vietnam. But it has not done
Flecker much good.
Hayden called ambassador
Hoang Bao Son in on Sep-
tember 20 but it was October 3
before the Vietnamese let
Broinowski send a consular
official to see Flecker and
October 23 before a second
visit was allowed.
Broinowski reports that
Flecker appears to be well
treated.
He is a constituent of Allan
Rocher, the Liberal member
for Curtin, whose Labor op-
ponent is Beth Schultz. Per-
haps someone can get Flecker
a postal vote.

WHOEVER runs the Voices
Off column in The Sydney
Morning Herald is obviously
being haunted by a packet of
Vincents. The column last
week carried an item about
“Vincent Smith, villain of

goes on to name Vincent
Smith as a horror movie actor
three more times in the space
of six lines.
Vincent Smith? The former
Sydney journalist and radio
star who is currently news
director of ATN7?
A bit haggard at times
maybe, or even unkempt, but
hardly renowned for his ap-
pearances in such classics as
Bloodbath at the House of
Death.
Wrong Vincent, of course.
Voices Off was groping for the
name of the even better-
known screen star, goose-
flesher Vincent Price.
Fidel’s a fan of Ernesto
IN A wide-ranging interview
just published in a Havana
literary magazine, Fidel
Castro speaks at length of his
love for the works of Ameri-
can Nobel literature prize
winner Ernest Hemingway,
who lived for many years in
Cojimar, a small fishing com-
munity on the outskirts of the
Cuban capital. “Hemingway’s
books have always been good
company for me,” says
Castro.
“It’s a truism that one
identifies with certain books.
My experience is that I identi-
fy instantly with the works of
Hemingway. He has always
been my favourite writer.”
Several important Latin
American writers sympathetic
to the Cuban revolution
most notably Castro’s close
friend the Colombian novelist
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, an-
other Nobel laureate have
long insisted that the Cuban
leader is a perceptive, indeed
passionate, reader of classical
and contemporary literature.
There is no reason to doubt
such claims though under-
standably they will be treated
with irony by Cuban writers
now living in other Latin Am-
erican countries, Europe and
the United States, having been
forced into exile after falling
foul of the regime, often fol-
lowing years of imprison-
ment.

How are the mighty fallen
THE influence of the mighty
Gough Whitlam appears to
have dwindled somewhat in
the Australian Labor Party in
the span of a mere decade.
Take the recent pre-selec-
tion fight for the seat of Fow-
ler which is being carved
partly out of Werriwa,
Gough’s former electorate.
The number of branch
members eligible to decide
pre-selection totalled around
120. Many were bemused
recently to receive a telephone
call from our Ambassador to
UNESCO in Paris, France.
Gough urged them (and
Intelligencer trusts that the
Australian government is not
being billed for these calls) to
instal 24-year-old Mark
Leatham as candidate.
But alas! Leatham ack-
nowledged as a bright young
man could still only man-
age about 15 votes and pre-
selection for what should be a
safe seat went to local aider-
man Ted Grace. Leatham did
not even run second.
It is not the first time
Gough has backed a loser in
his old stamping ground.
After his retirement, he tried
to ensure succession for Joe
Riordan, but he ran third in
the pre-selection ballot and
the nod went to John Kerin.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Micbael Lloyd
WHITE throws a 4-2; what is the
play? The favorite option pro-
bably would be to move as shown
by the solid arrows, capturing the
“bar” (or 7) point. This leaves a
blot on the 8 point but you may
discern that, to hit it, Black needs
a 5 (from W 3).
Black is, however, far more
likely to use a 5 to move from Wl2
to B 8 so the blot is not as
vulnerable as it may appear to be
initially. That reasoning, although
correct, is not sufficient justifica-
tion for the move.
Black’s position and game is
far superior to White’s at present.
The status quo is basically un-
altered if White captures his bar
point Black is still a long way in
front. If Black throws a 5-4, 5-3 or
4-3 on the next roll, he will
capture his own 3 point. He will
take the 8 point with any other 5.
In this position, the 3 point is
vital to both players; in White’s
case, the bar point is unimportant.
White needs a diversion, needs to
upset the balance of the game, to
throw a spanner in the works
the smoothness of this game is all
in Black’s favor.
White should attack on W 3 by
moving the man from W 9 the
whole six pips. Black is now on
the bar, so all options of making
his 3 point have vanished.
Furthermore, rolls of 6-5, 5-5, 4-5
all good before become
horror rolls for Black.
To appreciate the “state” of
the game is vital. And if you are
behind, as White is in this game,
moving safely is no use.
Hitting Black from W 9 is
upsetting the applecart but it is
taking the initiative and that is
precisely what White needs. To
“allow” Black the time and luxury
to capture B 8 or B 3 is to accept
defeat.

Opening lead five of clubs.
THIS DEAL occurred in the
Japan-Switzerland match during
the 1982 team-of-four world
championship.
Holding the North-South
cards, Japan got to three no trump
as shown. The Swiss West led the
five of clubs and declarer elected
to play the 10 from dummy.
East covered with the jack,
ducked by South, and returned the
seven of clubs declarer’s king
losing to the ace. West then led the
club four, on which East the
great Jean Besse discarded the
ace of diamonds!
It was a sensational discard
and the only card Besse could
have played to defeat the contract.
Had he retained the ace of
diamonds, the Japanese declarer
surely would have scored four
diamonds tricks and made the
contract.
Besse had concluded correctly
that three no trump could not be
defeated if declarer held the K-Q
of diamonds. He therefore arbi-
trarily credited his partner with
the queen of diamonds and
treated the diamond ace as an
albatross around his neck.
Declarer eventually went
down one, losing four club tricks
and a diamond.
At the second table, where a
Swiss pair held the North-South
cards, the final contract again was
three no trump.
West led the 10 of spades
certainly a reasonable alternative
to a club lead. Declarer won the
spade with the queen, played a
heart to the king and returned a
low diamond from dummy. He
could not now be stopped from
winning four diamond tricks and
ultimately made four no trump.
The Besse team thus gained 730
points on the deal.
