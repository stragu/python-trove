Chablis is to my mind a universally
acceptable wine style; delicate yet fruity,
complex yet austere.
I have made this wine from grapes picked
before full maturity to retain natural acidity
in order to give my Chablis its traditional
flinty finish, ivhilst having delicate fruit
flavour on the middle palate. The wine , after
fermentation, was stored in wood for a short
time to increase its complexity.
1 personally enjoy the elegant style of this
fine wine, and / trust you will also.

THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
The case for Mal...
Malcolm Fraser back in parliament?
We could do worse. Sculpted in granite
are the facts surrounding his ruthless
march to power. But, equally important
facts are his central role in the creation
of the state of Zimbabwe, and his coher-
ent stand on apartheid, which made him
unique in Canberra, then and now.
His consecration of cultural plural-
ism as the national matrix, and his
single-handed launch of Channel 0-28
against total opposition, are other
monuments to the detached foresight
and will of this loner.
Caricatured as a conservative, he en-
acted some of our most radical legisla-
tion. The parliamentary father of multi-
culturalism, he was to see the nascent
ethnic political consciousness coalesce
against him. Mainly because of an un-
fortunate born-to-rule, Anglo-Celtic de-
meanor, which make him appear unap-
proachable and “antipatico.”
An internationalist, like Whitlam,
but without the blague , he won Africa
and later, lost Australia.
Forests have been felled to record his
misdeeds. Our selective memories are
beginning to make us look absurd and
it’s time we recognised some of the de-
cent things this man did. A man who
was divisive, yes, but who didn’t have
an infantile need of blanket approval in
order to function.
Oh, and why wasn’t it alright for him
to cry?
R. A. BAGGIO
Werribee Vic
...and against
Hopefully the Liberal Party will hear as
rubbish the bleatings of Senator Chipp
re return of Mr Fraser to politics.
History has proved useful when try-
ing to predict the future but to try and
relive the past when choosing retired
electoral representatives will prove a
monumental disaster to the future good
of the Liberals.
Remember, Mr Fraser refused to
take election advice in 1982/83 and
after being defeated, soundly defeated,
“spat out his dummy,” took his marbles,
pension and bolted, weeping to Nareen.
Stay there Mai, and let the new brig-
ade of Macphee, Everingham, Hodg-
man and Co get on with the job of
taking the Liberals to power and don’t
listen to the ravings of your old mate
Chipp.

Aboriginal Act working
Pierpont recently drew attention (B,
September 11) to some so-called “de-
fects” in the Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Heritage (Interim Pro-
tection) Act 1984.
In reply let me make four things
clear.
First, the minister does have a dis-
cretion in dealing with applications for
the protection of areas and objects
under this legislation.
The Act provides that once the min-
ister is satisfied that a site or object is of
particular significance to Aboriginals in
“Anybody else doesn’t believe in concensus?”

“Oh, there are lots of advantages -for instance, the Jehovah’s Witnesses
never bother us.”
accordance with Aboriginal tradition,
and that it is under threat of injury or
desecration, he may make a declaration
in relation to it. If the minister had no
choice in the matter the Act would have
said he shall make a declaration.
Furthermore the Act sets out matters
which the minister must consider when
deciding whether to make a certain type
of declaration. Among these are the
effects a declaration may have on the
proprietary or pecuniary interests of
persons other than the Aboriginal appli-
cants.
If these effects could have no influ-
ence on the minister when he makes a
decision, they would not have been
written into the legislation. As well as
the matters specified, the Act allows the
minister to consider “such other matters
as he thinks relevant.” Experience to
date has shown that legitimate applica-
tions under the Act may be refused
when the competing interests are
weighed against each other.
Secondly, the definition of “Aborigi-
nal” is consistent with definitions used
in other Commonwealth legislation. It
is not and is not meant to be, limited to
people having an arbitrarily fixed pro-
portion of “Aboriginal blood.” It is de-
rived from 5.51 (xxvi) of the Constitu-
tion which gives the Commonwealth the
power to make special laws for the
people of any race. The scope of this
power was discussed by members of the
High Court in the Tasmanian dam case.
Thirdly, the definition of Aboriginal
tradition is similar to one used else-
where (the Aboriginal Land Rights
(Northern Territory) Act 1976). It is
meant to be flexible, to enable the Heri-
tage Act to be applied in a variety of
circumstances where there is a real
threat of injury or desecration to items
of Aboriginal heritage. While it is not
confined to a “religious or mystical
basis,” it is not totally open-ended in the
way Pierpont fears. Extreme examples
which can be drawn to illustrate how
some people might attempt to abuse the
Act do not show that the Act must be
made to operate in that way. Each ap-
plication is considered on its merits.
Frivolous or vexatious claims will be re-
jected.
Finally, the Act is not defective in
defining its aims, what it (rather than
whom ) is trying to protect and the
grounds upon which protection is to be
offered. In summary, the Act can be
used only where a significant Aboriginal
area or object is under threat of injury
or desecration and the local State or
Territory law does not provide effective
protection of it. Declarations can be
made as a last resort when the concilia-
tion process provided by the Act has not
resulted in a satisfactory solution and
all the circumstances of the case indi-
cate the need for the Minister to act in
this way.
Given that the Act is working, I will
not have to call on the sevices of the
legal brains at the stock exchange who
seem to cause Pierpont so much con-
cern on other matters.

Spelling it out
A little lateral thinking would solve the
flag problem raised by Ron Saw (B,
May 1) and A. P. Cullens (B, September
25).
A flag is, simply, an advertisement.
What’s the first essential in an ad? The
name.
So, spell it out (in little kangaroos or
platypuses or whatever you like; little
Southern Crosses for all I care): A-U-S-
T-R-A-L-I-A.
Or simpler, more accurate, and
therefore better still: O-Z-I-A.
Write large. And, of course, laterally.

Trashy TV makes video boom
The real reason for the video boom (B,
October 2) is the very poor standards of
programs on our TV stations. While
governments can legislate to increase
the local content of our programs, you
cannot legislate to make people watch
them if these programs are below stan-
dard.
Financially, the losers are the adver-
tisers who pay for the majority of the
programs. From the view of entertain-
ment, the losers are the viewers.
We have a rating system which only
tells us the percentage of viewers watch-
ing programs, but does not tell us the
percentage not watching TV or watch-
ing videos. Advertisers are definitely not
getting value for money during the non-
rating periods.

Heightened senses
It was interesting to read (B, August 28)
that Phillip Adams would join the Festi-
val of Light if “scratch and sniff’ por-
nography was introduced. Well, Phil,
you had better buy a blue suit and put a
rinse through your hair and make your
membership retrospective as a certain
US “gentlemen’s magazine” known for
its innovative format had a “scratch and
sniff’ pictorial more than seven years
ago.

No ‘legal maze’ for police
I write to correct an error in your Intel-
ligencer column in the October 2 issue.
It was stated there, in relation to the
alleged homicide aboard Hyundai 11,
that the Crimes at Sea Act “depends on
a separate agreement between Canberra
and the States allowing State police and
courts to take over investigations and
trials.”
The fact is that the operation of the
Act does not depend upon such ar-
rangements. It provides for agreements
which would allow consenting States to
take over some of the investigative and

Below is the pride of the fleet, the Rover Vanden Plas.
Behind the name is a tradition of excellence and elegance which has graced the
likes of Rolls-Royce, Daimler and Jaguar.
The Rover Vanden Plas sits well in this company.
The paint finish is outstanding, with a depth and lustre which draws the eye as
surely as a moth to a flame.
Equipment which would normally be available
only as an option is, of course, standard.
Automatic transmission, electrically operated sunroof, windows, door mirrors
(complete with electric demisters) and aerial.
Alloy wheels, headlamp power wash and rear window wash/wiper. Indeed, the
Rover Vanden Plas offers no options nor has need to.
Inside, the Vanden Plas influence becomes more apparent.
The seats are faced in Connolly leather, with door panels and fascia inserts
beautifully finished in burled walnut.
The appointments extend to shag pile footwell carpets, front and rear
headrests, a quality radio/cassette system, superb air-conditioning and a trip
computer.

For your peace of mind, the Rover Vanden Plas affords rare safety and security
of investment.
In the year of its launch, the Rover won the Don Safety Award for “the most

ADT out of step
John Cargher’s (B, September 25) la-
ment for the Australian Dance Theatre
losing their funding allocation from the
Victorian Ministry for the Arts was a
fascinating insight of this obviously tal-
ented company.
It must be pointed out, however, that
the funding withdrawal by Victoria was
not “without warning.”
The company had been involved in
meetings when they were exhorted to
meet their obligation under the grant
and actually visit Victoria. In 1982,
ADT’s interpretation of a country tour
was six performances in four towns “on
their way home from Sydney to Adel-
aide.”
The point had long been made, di-
rectly to the company and in the media,
that unless ADT gave Victorian tax-
payers value for money their funding
would be in jeopardy. They ignored all
warnings.
It is interesting to note that the West
Australian Ballet tour of Victoria in
1982 performed in 13 towns at almost
half the cost of the four towns visit by
ADT in the same year.
I strongly question that ADT ever
managed three seasons in Melbourne.
ADT and Victorians will only profit
when the company can offer value for
money and not begrudgingly minimal
appearances.

could clarify several aspects.
The Australian product number sym-

stripes which is scanned by a light
beam at the checkout, contains informa-
tion relating only to the identity of the
product.
The price of the item is not contained
in the symbol. The store’s computer, on
obtaining the number of the item from
the scanner at the checkout, “looks up”
the current price in the computer price
file and sends this back to the check-
out where it is recorded by the cash

fixed in its symbol, each retailer is free
to offer shoppers varying competitive
prices, so “specials” will still be as at-
tractive as ever.
In fact, price comparison surveys
such as those conducted by the Can-
berra Consumers Group, consistently
show scanstores as being low-priced.
And contrary to the allegations of
anti-business groups like the Knox
Prices Action Group, professional re-
search shows that scanstores are up to
10 times more accurate than conven-
tional supermarkets.
Further, the federal/state govern-
ment working party which investigated
scanning for three years found no link
between price consciousness and item
price-marking.
Why can’t the ideologues of the acti-
vist groups accept the judgment of the
400,000 Australians who happily shop
in scanstores each week?

Ms Holuigue’s other roles
Reading between the lines is one of the
handiest attributes of newspaper and
magazine readers, but I read in vain
among your 69-line eulogy of Diane
Holuigue (B, Sept 25) for any reference
to the 'fact that along with being this
country’s leading authority on French
cuisine, she personally rates highly her
roles as food editor for the homemaker
magazine Home Beautiful and the food
and wine magazine Epicurean.

Disgusting denials
I have just finished reading Phillip
Adams’ “A voice from the grave” (B,
September 25), and I think it is absol-
utely disgusting that people are trying to
deny the gassing and the Holocaust
existed in World War 11.
I am a 13!4-year-old schoolgirl, and
as yet, I may not know everything there
is to know about nazis, Hitler and the
Holocaust, but I am capable of realising
the idiocy of Butler and Bennett’s
claims.
The world (or most of the world) is
already ashamed of the genocide Hitler
attempted, and I hope Butler, Bennett
and the remainder of the League of
Rights never become so well-established
in our country as to convice us of their
rubbishy fairy tales.
Congratulations Phillip Adams. The
more I read your articles, the more in-
formed I am. Well done!

Baseless outburst
Phillip Adams’ article on the Holocaust
(B, September 25) is a convincing argu-
ment ... for the revisionist view. Mr
Adams has nothing on which to base his
outburst against John Bennett and the
revisionist historians, hence he resorts
to misinformation, abuse and a testi-
mony from an anonymous correspon-
dent.
The mysterious Bulletin reader
makes several confused statements: he
never explains why he is the only person
to suggest the Auschwitz gas chambers
were being used in 1945. Not even the
most credulous historians believe the
gas chambers were used there after late
1944.
His statistics for Auschwitz are also
very odd: gassing 30,000 people per day
for most of the year 1944 would result in
double the alleged casualties for the en-
tire period 1941-1945! He says that “not
many” blueprints for homicide gas
chambers have survived. In fact, none
survived (if they ever existed). This per-
sonal testimony seems no more reliable
than others of the “I went in the gas
chambers” type.

Great expectations.
Anticipation is a high point of any
culinary experience, but to satisfy even
modest expectations can require a
relatively high order of cuisine.
At Hilton, the subjects of prepara-
tion, presentation, taste and texture
are a matter of some ceremony, for
their role is not merely to satisfy but to
elevate the expectations of even the
most enlightened epicurean.
From the garnish on a humble
hamburger to the consistency of a
souffle or the delicate balance of a
sauce, we strive for perfection. And
although our standards may seem
obsessive, with a name like Hilton we
should not only be equal to great
expectations, but ready to surpass
them.
In our grand dining rooms, bust-
ling coffee shops or ever-ready room
service, there is only one standard-
Hilton standard. In every way, some
thing more than first class.

“Go home if you must, Sudberry, but you don’t look
all that sick to me!”
As for the picture taken at Belsen
concentration camp, no one has ever
suggested that the victims shown in such
photos were mythical. Neither does
anyone seriously suggest that these
people were gassed. They were certain-
ly, in the main, casualties of typhus and
starvation, a tragedy for which the nazi
bureaucracy cannot be held solely re-
sponsible. After all, starvation and ty-
phus are still with us, along with con-
centration camps and state terror, 40
years after a war which was to rid the
world of the “evils of nazism and fas-
cism.”
Mr Adams piously condemns the re-
visionists for their “blasphemous line,”
while assuring us that he isn’t religious
himself. Yet his misleading article
simply shows that the dominant secular
interests demand blind faith when their
version of history is threatened. After
reading Mr Adams’ exercise in obfusca-
tion, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see
him follow it up with an article entitled
“Credo quia absurdum est.”

A breath of politics
As one who does not necessarily hold
the view that we get the politicians we
deserve, I am constantly unimpressed
by the performance of many of our
elected representatives.
Self-preservation and ambition are
understandable, but social conscience,
whilst loudly proclaimed, often rates
low in priority after self-indulgence
(perks) and pursuit of personal wealth.
Particularly depressing is the per-
formance of many parliamentarians in
the face of media examination, which is
often ill-mannered, and occasionally of
a juvenile and contrived nature. The
more recent baring of emotions on tele-
vision in response to an attack which
was probably self-destructive, adds a
further dimension, hardly designed to
impress.
With an election forthcoming no
doubt we will be subjected to the recur-
ring spectacle of the candidate, “drink-
ing” in the working man’s bar, shaking
the hands of strangers, willing or other-
wise, and kissing the heads of
unsuspecting babes.
Hygiene apart, for heaven’s sake
spare us the latter. Presumably designed
to demonstrate a desirable form of hu-
manitarianism, anything less likely to
indicate one’s credentials for modern
parliamentary duties is hard to imagine
and an insult to the intelligence of the
voter.

Trans-Tasman vision needed
Although New Zealand has said that
political union with Australia will never
happen, it appears inevitable that some
sort of non-political trans-Tasman
merger will occur.
Both governments should have a
complete look at all the facts by es-
tablishing a joint Australia and New
Zealand commission with a wide
ranging brief to examine closer rela-
tions.
Our future is too important to be
avoided by present political parties who
lack vision and political will.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Peacock censure
IN A MAJOR federal parlia-
mentary debate, Opposition
leader Andrew Peacock failed
to produce convincing proof
in support of his earlier accu-
sations that the government
had downgraded its fight
against organised crime and
that Prime Minister Bob
Hawke was a “perverter of the
law” and an associate of
criminals. The House cen-
sured Peacock along party
lines on grounds that he had
made wilful and reckless alle-
gations against the Prime
Minister.
Drugs charge
POLICE informer Stephen
Bazley, a former business
partner of the late Terence
Clark (a chief of the “Mr
Asia” syndicate) charged on
the ABC’s Four Corners TV
program that seven NSW
police officers were involved
in heroin trafficking and con-
nected activities. Bazley said
the names of the seven had
been known to the Federal
Police since April 1983 but
little progress had been made
in investigation of the affair.
Subsequently, NSW Police
minister Peter Anderson told
a press conference that the
first job of a new Police Com-
missioner’s special task unit
would be to investigate
Bazley’s allegations “as a mat-
ter of urgency.”
• See page 32
Building pact
LEADERS of the Builders
Laborers Federation (BLF)
facing federal and Victorian
government action against
them and expulsion from the
ACTU if they continued to re-
fuse to agree to a two-year
peace treaty for the building
industry signed the docu-
ment at the last moment. BLF
general secretary Norm Gal-
lagher hailed the decision as a
victory for his organisation.
Victorian Premier John Cain
described it as a “total capitu-
lation” on the BLF’s part.
• See page 34
Interests fight
THE Opposition has decided
to fight the federal govern-
ment’s tough new rules which
would force members of par-
liament to declare their pe-
Opposition leader Peacock: failed to produce the proof
cuniary interests and those of
spouses and children “wholly
or mainly dependent on the
member for support.” Each
member would be required to
declare shareholdings, family
and business trusts, real es-
tate, directorships, liabilities,
bank accounts and assets
valued at more than $5OOO.
Students warned
THE Minister for Immigra-
tion, Stewart West, has
warned overseas students in
Australian schools and ter-
tiary institutions that they
may be expelled from the
country if they refuse to pay
the federal government’s
overseas student fees recently
increased by 15 percent. Stu-
dent organisers in Sydney
have decided to try to per-
suade 20,000 private overseas
students to delay as long as
possible the higher fees.
Daintree road open
QUEENSLAND’S Environ-
ment minister, Martin Tenni,
has opened the controversial
Daintree Road built through a
north Queensland rain forest.
THE WORLD
Scrap nuclear vote
THE British opposition Labor
Party’s annual conference at
Blackpool voted overwhelm-
ingly to scrap Britain’s nu-
clear arms and to remove all
American nuclear weapons
from British soil. Former
Labor Prime Minister James
Callaghan and former De-
fence minister Denis Healey
argued in vain against the
non-nuclear policy. The vote,
supported by the present
Labor leader Neil Kinnock,
still wants to keep Britain
in NATO but would restrict
the nation to playing a non-
nuclear role in the Western
Alliance.
FBI man charged
RICHARD Miller, an agent
in the FBl’s counter-espion-
age network in San Francisco,
was arrested and charged with
spying for the Soviet Union.
His Soviet contacts, Nikolai
and Svetlana Ogorodnikov,
also arrested, emigrated from
Russia to the United States in
1973. Miller, father of eight


children, is said to have had
an affair with Svetlana. He is
the first FBI agent to be
charged with espionage. If
convicted, all three could be
jailed for life.
Gromyko’s charge
SOVIET Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, addressing
an East Berlin celebration of
East Germany’s 35th birth-
day, charged the Reagan ad-
ministration with using “de-
ceptive manoeuvres.” He said
the US was determined to
“cram outer space with the
most advanced weaponry”
and that it had reacted nega-
tively to Soviet proposals
aimed at limitation of such
weapons.
Record space flight
THREE Soviet cosmonauts
Leonid Kizim, Vladimir Sol-
ovyev and Oleg Atkov re-
turned to Earth after spending
a record-breaking 237 days in
outer space in the Soyuz T-l 1
space capsule. They touched
down in the central Asian
province of Kazakhstan.
Promise on HK
CHINA’S Prime Minister Zao
Ziyang told a visiting Hong
Kong delegation invited to
Peking to China’s October 1
National Day celebration
that the accord guaranteeing
the colony’s capitalist system
for 50 years after 1997 would
be observed “to the letter”.
Taiwan’s ‘no’ to China
THE Chinese Nationalist
government in Taiwan has re-
jected Peking’s offer to re-
unite the island with main-
land China. In a counter-
move, the Nationalists have
announced they would help
Chinese in Hong Kong who
wished to settle in Taiwan be-
fore the communist takeover
of the city in 1997.
Bad nuclear news
ALAIN BUGAT, deputy di-
rector of the French Nuclear
Test Centre at Muroroa Atoll,
stated that French nuclear tes-
ting in the South Pacific
would continue for at least
another 15 years.
Tough Israeli line
FIGHTING a 400 percent in-
flation rate, dwindling foreign
currency reserves and a cata-
strophic foreign debt of $23
billion, the Israeli government
has decreed what amounts to
an economic state of emer-
gency. Measures introduced
include banning of luxury im-
ports ranging from chocolate
to motor cars and halving the
amount Israelis are allowed to
spend on foreign travel now
$l2OO a person.
BUSINESS
Telecom profit leap
STATUTORY bodies pro-
vided profit news with
Telecom Australia leading the
way with a profit tip 17.5 per-
cent from $263 to $309 mil-
lion in 1983-84. Operating
revenue was up 16 percent to
$4.2 billion. The Australian
Industry Development Cor-
poration will pay its first divi-
dend to the Commonwealth
after its seventh successive an-
nual profit increase. It will
pay a dividend of $7.5 million
following a 12 percent profit
rise to $l7 million.
Elders IXL up
THE HEAVY interest bill
which resulted from the pur-
chase of Carlton and United
Breweries Ltd failed to keep
Elders IXL Ltd from a
healthy profit rise and bonus
issue in the year to June 30.
Profit rose 12 percent to $72.1
million and directors declared
a one for two bonus issue. The
new shares qualify for the
eight cent final dividend
payout. Elders shares reacted
by putting on 25 cents.
Bid ‘inadequate’
THE BOARD of Mayne
Nickless Ltd branded a $lBO
million partial takeover offer
from paper and packaging
group APM Ltd as “entirely
inadequate.” After accumula-
ting 19.9 percent of the trans-
port group in heavy trading
late in the week, APM
launched a bid of $3.52 a
share or seven APM shares for
every five Nickless shares. The
bid, which was not exceeded
in the market, is for 51 percent
of Nickless’ capital.
Industrials surge
INDUSTRIAL stocks took
centre stage on stock ex-
changes with the All Indus-
trials index moving to a new
high of 1065.9 up 11.9
points on the week. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 9.1
points to 749.5.
Life Savers down
LIFE SAVERS (Australasia)
Ltd’s profit fell from $4.3 to
$3.4 million in the year to July
31 after the costs associated
with the closure of the com-
pany’s Hawaiian Prima juice
manufacturing and distribu-
tion plant.

COVER STORY/AUSTRALIA
Hawke’s biggest headache:
a record poll majority
With the prospects of a general election loss virtually disregarded, Labor’s federal
leaders are contemplating a quite different challenge how to cope with a record
majority. RICHARD FARMER examines what difficulties that could entail
FEDERAL parliament enters its last
days before a general election with the
Labor Party worried not about winning
but about the possible problems of man-
aging a record majority.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke is su-
premely confident, having last week
defused attacks on the government over
its attitude to organised crime. Labor’s
private polling confirms the findings of
recent Morgan Gallup Polls that the
government is likely to increase its ma-
jority substantially. Party officials see a
total of 100 of the 148 seats in the new
House of Representatives as a realistic
election goal. Winning a minimum of 90
is considered to be virtually certain.
Just as Labor politicians are brim-
ming over with confidence at the pros-
pect of an election win, the Liberal
Party opposition is resigned to an ig-
nominious defeat. Deputy leader John
Howard is already being spoken of by
parliamentary colleagues as the next
leader of the Opposition.
The past week brought rumblings
within the party that Opposition leader
Andrew Peacock should be sacked be-
fore the election and replaced with
Howard. Only the active encourage-
ment of Howard for such a move would
be needed for it to happen but he has no
desire to inherit the mantle by stabbing
Peacock. Howard is prepared to wait
until after the election, on the assump-
tion that Peacock will step aside in the
face of an inglorious defeat.
In traditional political terms, Hawke
is being very daring in giving so much
notice of election day. With the an-
nouncement of the date, Opposition
leaders achieve far more prominence in
the media than they normally enjoy.
They receive virtually equal time to the
government’s on radio and TV, com-
pared with less than 20 percent of the
exposure in the period between elec-
tions.
Part of Hawke’s reason for allowing
the equal time procedure to begin early
is, as he has suggested, to soften normal
public resentment about governments
which call elections early. But just as
Prime Minister Hawke: expecting Peacock to make more tactical mistakes
important in his thinking is a belief that
the more the electorate sees of Peacock
the less voters like him and, consequent-
ly, the greater Labor’s likely victory.
The decline in Peacock’s approval
rating following the publicity given to
his attack on Hawke as being “a little
crook” who associated with criminals
certainly came as no surprise to the
“victim.” The Prime Minister does not
expect Peacock to improve his standing
as the media spotlight becomes brighter
when the campaign proper begins.
Hawke’s confidence that Peacock is
his own worse enemy was reinforced by
Peacock’s dismal performance in par-
liament last week, when given the op-
portunity to substantiate his claims
about Hawke’s association with crimi-
nals. Rarely, if ever, has the speech of
an opposition leader been so univers-
ally condemned by the press.
Challenged to put up or shut up by the
government, Peacock made the mistake
of doing neither. Hawks expects him to
make similar tactical mistakes as the
campaign progresses.
Peacock obviously is hoping that
continually talking about crime and
corruption at a time when a Senate
committee is inquiring into allegations
of improper conduct about a farmer
Labor attorney-general and current
High Court Judge, Justice Lionel
Murphy, finally will make the matter a
vote winner for his party.
But on the evidence of the Labor
Party’s research, Hawke is completely
unconcerned. Even in NSW where the
conspiracy theories expounded by
Chief Magistrate Clarrie Briese are al-
leged to have taken place, there does not
appear to be any electoral rub-off on the
federal government. The state Labor
government of Neville Wran might now
be in bad odor, but Hawke has success-
fully made a distinction between him-
self and other Labor politicians. His
government is seen by the public to be a
Hawke government, not a Labor gov-
ernment. That is a hard distinction to
combat, especially in the few weeks re-
maining before the federal poll.
Peacock’s one remaining chance of


salvaging the opportunity to continue as
Liberal leader will come when he pre-
sents his party’s taxation policy. Details
have been a well-kept secret but it will
involve substantial reductions in in-
come tax and imposition of a broadly-
based indirect tax.
But the Liberals ought not rely too
much on the electoral popularity of a
scheme that will involve taxes on all
items except food that are bought at re-
tail level even with a reduction in in-
come taxes. New taxes frighten people
and the Hawke government will be go-
ing to the polls with a very simple mes-
sage about taxation: Income tax cuts
announced in the recent budget will ap-
ply from the beginning of November
and they will still be real and measur-
able on polling day.
The Liberal strategy will be to try to
create the fear that the income tax ben-
efits would prove illusory if and when
Labor were returned. There will be
much talk of a mini-budget next
March/April to take away what is given
in November. There will be attempts to
scare the electorate, as well, about al-
leged Labor plans to tax capital gains
and impose death and gift duties.
Hawke and his fellow party strat-
egists are feeling quite comfortable
about these expected attempts to create
fears in the community. Their research
shows that economic management is the
government’s strong point. Voters gen-
erally are satisfied with the state of the
economy and Hawke will happily run
on his record showing that interest rates
are down, unemployment is down, in-
flation is down and all this while growth
is up. His answer to the fears about fu-
ture action on taxation will be that
nothing will be done without extensive
consultation and that no firm plans exist
to do any such thing.
However, the Opposition’s scenario
on Labor’s tax plans has a certain truth
about it. The Treasury is looking at pos-
sible ways of reducing the importance
of income tax in total tax collections.
Treasurer Paul Keating does not
have the doctrinal objection to indirect
taxation that his party traditionally has
had enshrined in policy. Hence, some of
that Treasury work is designed to come
up with a form of tax on retail sales that
probably is not far different from what
the Liberals have in mind.
Keating has had considerable suc-
cess in the first term of this government
at having decisions made (such as the
floating of the dollar and de-regulation
of the financial system) that were con-
trary to his party’s ethos.
But a major factor in that success
was a desire on the part of federal cau-
cus not to rock the boat and embarrass
an electoral asset.
Right from the time Labor took
office, Hawke raised the possibility of
PUBLIC OPINION
Peacock goes
from bad
to worse
FEDERAL Opposition Leader Andrew
Peacock’s approval rating has fallen to
22 percent, the lowest level of support
recorded by the Morgan Gallup Poll for
any federal leader. His disapproval
rating has jumped to 64 percent the
highest registered.
The slump in Peacock’s fortunes was
measured on the weekend of September
29-30, after the Prime Minister’s wife,
Hazel Hawke, had told of her daughter
Rosslyn’s heroin problem.
The poll found that backing for the
ALP has leapt by five points to 55 per-
cent and if an election had been held at
the end of last month Labor would have
won with an increased majority.
Although the poll covered only one
weekend (compared to the more usual
practice of surveying voters over two
weekends) evidence of strongly rising
Labor support is provided by more ex-
tensive polling of people’s voting inten-
tion in the Senate election.
The Senate poll, conducted on Sep-
tember 15, 22 and 29, showed Labor’s
support had reached 52, a rise of 8 per-
cent. It is the first time that the Morgan
Poll had recorded Labor’s Senate back-
ing at more than 50 percent.

ELECTIONS
Dunkley is
the seat
to watch
By MALCOLM MACKERRAS
THE FINAL electoral redis-
tribution confirms that the
new Victorian electorate
Dunkley, taking in Frankston,
Mount Eliza and Mornington,
will be the litmus seat at the
forthcoming federal election.
The accompanying pendu-
lum shows the position with
the final maps of the electoral
redistribution in which only
two seats (Kooyong and
Northern Territory) are un-
changed in boundaries.
Dunkley needs a swing of
3.2 percent to fall to the Lib-
erals, so we can say that it
needs an overall swing of 3.2
percent to put Labor out. On
the old boundaries it required
2.3 percent.
On the pendulum, Labor
notionally has 89 seats, a ma-
jority of 30, compared to 25 in
the present House.
There are a huge number
of marginal seats.
So if, for example, there
were a swing of only l percent
to Labor, the majority held by
the Hawke government would
rise to 42.
Deakin, Petrie, Tangney
and Fadden are marked with
asterisks. The explanation is
that seats bearing those names
have Labor members in the
present House.
Only one of those members
will re-contest his old seat:
Deane Wells in Petrie. He
needs a 0.5 percent swing to
Labor to hold it.
Labor members for the
other seats with asterisks are
looking for seats with a better
Labor vote.
The designation “Lib” or
“NP” is a reflection of the
1983 vote, not a prediction.
Some such seats will in prac-
tice change hands between the
Opposition parties.
This pendulum supersedes
that published in The Bulletin,
September 11, 1984, which
was based on the provisional
maps. □

John Howard: reining back his leadership aspirations
Magistrate Clarrie Briese: no effect on the Federal government
an election within 18 months. That re-
inforced the desire of even the party’s
left wing not to take actions which
might weaken the government’s chances
of being returned.
However, with the prospect of a full
term ahead and the insulation which a
huge majority would give, the left’s atti-
tude is bound to change. Murmurings of
discontent will be replaced by noisy op-
position to departures from doctrinal
purity. The debate within the parlia-
mentary party about indirect taxation
would be far more vigorous and poten-
tially destructive than anything which
took place over banks and the currency.
Containing government spending
also would be difficult for a Labor ad-
ministration with a large majority.
Keating had trouble enough this year in
keeping the projected federal deficit
under $7 billion. Many of his minis-
terial colleagues resented having to
shelve pet projects which party policy
said the government would introduce.
Science and Technology Minister Barry
Jones even went so far as to speculate
that things would be different after the
election. If they are, Keating will be
hard-put to retain his ranking as
Finance Minister of the Year at the next
meeting of the International Monetary
Fund.
In Hawke’s and Keating’s favor is
the likely factional composition of new
members elected in a Labor landslide.
The biggest swings are expected to be in
NSW, South Australia and Tasmania
but it is from NSW that most new mem-
bers would come. That state has six
seats for which party pre-selection bal-
lots will be held that would on 1983 fig-
ures return new Labor members. Two
more would fall to Labor with a swing
of 1 percent or less. National Party lead-
er lan Sinclair would be defeated with a
swing of 2.8 percent in his seat of New
England and Cowper would fall to
Labor with a gain of 4.4 percent on last
year’s figures. Labor officials also give
themselves an outside chance of win-
ning the seat of Parkes, despite the 7
percent swing required.
Based on its current research, Labor
believes it could win 11 extra seats in
NSW. The right-wing branch control-
lers believe there is a good chance that
every candidate endorsed for those
seats will be a member of their faction
and that, at worst, the left will win in no
more than two of them. Provided Labor
won four of the seven Senate seats in
NSW, that would mean an extra two
right-wingers in the caucus as well
making perhaps a total addition to the
strength of the pro-Hawke faction of 10.
The left is faring little better in other
states.
The victor in Victoria’s pre-election
ballots was the independent group
centred on Senate leader John Button.
The Queensland socialist left might
emerge with one extra member, with the
same in South Australia and Western
Australia. In Tasmania, where Labor
expects to recover considerably from its
low two-party-preferred vote of 43 per-
cent at the latest election, the left may
gain one or two extra caucus members.
But the total likely gains by the left fall
far short of those the right wing is ex-
pected to deliver in NSW. Hawke’s pos


ition in caucus theoretically
will be stronger than it has
been for the past 18 months.
This would help the Prime
Minister and his Treasurer
contain radical changes such
as wealth taxes, gift and death
duties. But it also would add
to the pressures for parish-
pump spending toward the
end of Labor’s three-year
term, in the way that NSW
Premier Neville Wran felt
compelled to act when ruling
with a massive majority.
But any problems for a sec-
ond Hawke government from
a large majority would be as
nothing to those confronting
the Liberal and National par-
ties from such a development.
Never have the conserva-
tive parties federally faced a
majority which, on the face of
it, would take two general
elections to cut back.
The prospect at this poll
is that Labor will receive a
vote between 1 and 2 percent higher
than the 53.5 percent it gained, in two-
party-preferred terms, in 1983.
Getting a swing of 5 percent or more
at one poll is a daunting prospect in-
deed so daunting that it just might
provide the stimulus required to bring
about the amalgamation of the Liberal
and National parties into one opposi-
tion party. □
CRIME
Police poised
to pounce on
the corrupt
By BRUCE STANNARD
UP TO 25 police are expected to be
charged soon in a firm crackdown on
corruption in the New South Wales
force.
The police purge, the first operation
of the newly-formed Internal Security
Unit under Superintendent Ernie
Shepard, is the result of information
gathered over 12 months through Aus-
tralian Federal Police phone taps.
The charges, of conspiracy, relate to
alleged cash payments for favors for
such things as traffic accidents and li-
censing matters.
A well-known Sydney businessman
is alleged to have acted as a go-between
for those who sought to buy police
favors and the corrupt police. The 25
police, from stations throughout the
JOHN ELLIOTT
NSW police minister Peter Anderson and commissioner John Avery: press conference
Sydney metropolitan area, are believed
to have had a long and close association
with the man, known as “The Procurer.”
The man undertook to fix any crimi-
nal matter. Allegedly, it was simply a
matter of the client providing sufficient
cash for police. The go-between, who is
a very wealthy man, apparently did not
accept money for himself but was con-
tent simply to build up a network of in-
fluence among police and those for
whom he procured favors.
According to informed police
sources, there was hardly a station in
Sydney where he did not have some
contact willing to act for him.
For example, a traffic accident could
be “fixed” for $lOOO. Police details of
the accident were either altered or the
charges dropped altogether.
“The Procurer” paid some police
much higher sums as regular “monthly
retainers.”
According to police, the kick-backs
involved neither drugs nor politicians.
Although NSW police sources con-
firm that the Federal Police phone taps
go back over 12 months, much of the
information which relates to the
crackdown is contained in a single tele-
phone conversation monitored by fed-
eral officers about the middle of last
year. In mid-July this year, Federal
Police chief Major-General Grey finally
gave NSW police authority to use the
material.
Two police involved in the favors
racket are among the seven named by
former Mr Asia drug syndicate member
Stephen Bazley as being involved in
heroin trafficking in Sydney. Police are
poised to deal immediately with two
cases which involve eight police. Other
cases are expected to be dealt with over
the next two months.
Senior police within the Internal
Affairs branch were at pains to point out
that none of the federal taps were
placed on any police station in NSW.
However, several of the intercepted
calls were made to both city and sub-
urban stations, including Darlinghurst.
The purge comes just a few days after
NSW Police Commissioner John Avery
and Police minister Peter Anderson
faced a hostile and at times emotional
press conference on the Bazley allega-
tions. Many of the journalists who
asked angry questions seemed to have
decided already that the seven police
named by Bazley to federal police in-
vestigators in March last year were
guilty of drug trafficking. Avery and
Anderson looked uncomfortable as they
tried to fend off questions.
Later, Avery and Shepard gave The
Bulletin, in an exclusive interview, de-
tailed and carefully considered answers
to questions on the Bazley allegations.
Both men complained that Bazley’s
charges were rambling, non-specific and
completely devoid of the corroborating
evidence essential to their successful
prosecution in court.
“If allegations of this sort are going
to be made,” Avery said, “they have to
be backed up by evidence of sufficient
substance to establish a reasonable
case; otherwise this police force will
grind to a halt. People have to realise
that one of the primary industries in the
prisons of this state is the business of
constructing false allegations against
police. Bazley’s allegations are nothing
more than hearsay. They cast a slur on
every on£ of the ten-and-a-half thou-

sand men and women in the NSW
Police Force. All decent police and
that's the vast majority feel the very
deep need to eliminate from our ranks,
either into prison or out into the civilian
world, police who are involved in crimi-
nal activity or who associate in any det-
rimental way with criminals.”
Police from the Internal Affairs’
branch who have been investigating
the Bazley allegations for the past 15
months have been frustrated by the
rambling, garbled and often almost in-
comprehensible material in the 266-
page Federal Police record of the inter-
view which took place in a Cowra motel
in March 1983.
Bazley’s allegations were given to the
then Mr Asia royal commissioner, Mr
Justice Stewart, who interviewed Bazley
but decided to take no action.
“We cannot say Bazley is a complete
liar,” Shepard said, “and yet, at this
stage, we cannot say he has told the
whole truth either.”
Avery said: “What we do say is that
whatever useful information we can get
from Bazley we would be very happy to

use. But there will be no deals.
If Bazley wants to make
serious allegations like this, he
must be able to back them up.
It’s going to be expensive for
him if he can’t. If he is indeed
the concerned citizen he says
he is, then his charges are a
matter for the court. They
can’t be part of any deals.
And if that disappoints some
people who want maximum,
immediate publicity then I’m
sorry. These things don’t just
happen overnight. Court cases
take an enormous amount of
time.”
The Bulletin has obtained a
copy of a memorandum, writ-
ten by a senior officer of the
Joint Task Force on Drug
Trafficking and sent to the
NSW police Internal Affairs
branch in November last year,
which goes some way toward
explaining why it was that in-
vestigating police were less
than enthusiastic about pursu-
ing Bazley’s allegations.
The memorandum says:
“In the case of Stephen Bazley, it
should be noted that he is recognised in
drug law enforcement as a notorious in-
former. He has survived numerous
times by being prepared to inform on
associates and escaping justice by doing
so.
“He has over the years made numer-
ous allegations against members of vari-
ous police forces, of which few if any
have ever been substantiated.
“He is a self-confessed member of
the Mr Asia syndicate and he has given
evidence at drug royal commissions. He
is a cunning and professional criminal
specialising in the drug traffic scenario.
He is referred to within the criminal
scene by the nickname The Rat. It is
obvious that competent management of
such a dangerous and devious criminal
as Bazley will require an abundance of
experience and extreme caution against
treachery on the informant’s part or in-
volvement of others in illegal acts con-
trary to the proper law enforcement
procedures.”
Bazley and his solicitor, Paul
Eckstein, met Shepard in North Sydney
on Friday, October 5, and agreed to
meet again on Wednesday, October 10,
for what may be Bazley’s first serious
attempt at co-operation with the NSW
police.
Both Bazley and Eckstein attempted
to lay down a series of demands which I
understand will almost certainly be re-
jected by the police and the state gov-
ernment.
Bazley has confirmed to police that
he has been under psychiatric care for
the past 18 months. □

Big Norm: defeat or strategic retreat?
By DEBORAH HOPE
UNION stormtrooper Norm
Gallagher is safely back in his
BLF bunker this week after
two months of out-and-out
warfare from the trenches.
When he finally did a deal
to sign the infamous “memor-
andum of understanding”
only the Australian Council
of Trade Unions could come
up with such a name last
week, it was claimed as the
greatest defeat ever faced by
the Builders’ Laborers’ Feder-
ation. But is it?
Gallagher’s backdown
typically came at the point of
oblivion. Faced with a choice
of fighting it out to the death
on building sites or buying
time by signing the superan-
nuation deal, Gallagher took
the easier path and lives to
fight again.
Many, however, are deeply
disappointed at the opportu-
nity missed to get rid of the
BLF once and for all. Few
have illusions that it is more
than a holding arrangement.
“Just wait. In two months
they’ll be at it again,” is the
most familiar cry. In the
meantime, Gallagher and his
troops have time to check
their defences.
The Victorian and federal govern-
ments have a wad of legislation they can
introduce to outlaw the federation as
soon as it puts a toe out of line. But you
can be equally sure the BLF will fight
this through the courts.
One of those most disappointed is
NSW Labor Council secretary John
Macßean who believes there is no
longer any room in the Australian trade
union movement for the BLF. He says
ACTU officials have been too patient
with the recalcitrant union. “Based on
past experience of the federation it can
be guaranteed that in the not too distant
future Gallagher will tear up the agree-
ment,” he said. “That’s the time when
the union movement will really have to
come to grips with the federation.”
Macßean is also an ACTU executive
member and president of the NSW
ALP.
After 20 years of thuggery and in-
timidatory tactics by the BLF, Macßean
said, the building industry had become
a jungle where the rule was survival of
the fittest: “The federation has pro-
stituted the industry. Workers are now
paid for being on strike. Employers
have succumbed to the federation’s in-
timidation. They employ (BLF) stand-
over people on building sites and the
BLF has arrangements with some build-
ers which allow some of their workers to
be permanently off the job to picket the
sites of other employers.”
The NSW branch of the BLF was ex-
pelled from the NSW Labor Council
twice in 1981 but only re-admitted
once. The union has continued to thrive
despite this, thanks to the assistance of
contractors who want to see their build-
ings go up without too many problems.
Macßean regards this as regrettable:
“Unfortunately, contractors took the
short-term view some years ago that it
was better to pay up and shut up than
resist the tactics of the federation to a
point where other unions who are
opposed to the federation’s policies
have been forced on some occasions to
adopt similar tactics to survive.”
Normally a cool-headed man, Mac-
Bean is passionate about this
issue. He believes that it is a
question of the survival of re-
sponsible trade unionism. He
said: “This point has been
made by speakers from the
Communist Party, the Social-
ist Party, the left, the right,
whatever. The union move-
ment can’t afford to face
threats of violence and intimi-
dation. It’s a fight for the right
of decent unionists to go to
work without the fear of in-
timidation and violence.”
NSW building workers
had first-hand experience of
BLF tactics recently at the site
of the new police headquar-
ters in Sydney’s Goulburn
Street. Without discussion
with unions representing the
other 200 or so workers at the
site, the BLF began picketing
in support of a claim for strike
pay for a previous strike.
After the ACTU ruled the
picket unauthorised, the other
workers began crossing the
line to go to work attracting
the jeers and intimidation of
BLF members. Although they
allowed the workers through
the line, trucks delivering ma-
terials from the site were
barred by the BLF and many workers
were stood down or transferred from
the site as a result.
Said Macßean: “On the police site
we’ve got people getting phone calls at
night, their families being threatened at
home, people being spat on, their cars
kicked in, rocks thrown, intimidatory
language and a whole host of things.
“That’s not unionism. This is not
about Gallagher or Black (Steve Black,
the federation’s NSW secretary) or any-
one else; it’s about the right of people to
go to work.”
On the ACTU executive, Macßean is
one of Gallagher’s toughest opponents.
Gallagher’s greatest ally on the execu-
tive has been ACTU secretary Bill
Kelty. Kelty said of Gallagher last
week: “He’s an industrial mongrel but I
like him.” Kelty believes now, however,
that the ACTU has been “too reason-
able” with the BLF. It is prepared, he
says, to tell the BLF that it is on its own.
“We have been patient and we are
still very patient,” Kelty said. “But what
more can we do? When somebody gives


their word and then three weeks later
breaks it you just can’t do it. I have a
high personal regard for Gallagher and
his union but the unions have had
enough. There has been very significant
pressure from the Labor Council.”
According to Kelty, Gallagher gave
two reasons for his initial reneging on
the superannuation agreement. The first
was that builders were not doing
enough to get compliance with the
scheme. The second was that something
had to be done “to get him out of’ the
charges resulting from the Winneke
royal commission into the BLF. (Gal-
lagher is due to appear in the Mel-
bourne County Court next February on
charges of having received secret com-
missions.)
Kelty discounts the first reason:
“Part of the agreement is that builders
will sign up after the BLF signs. If there
is trouble getting compliance from the
builders, we can take collective action
then. This reason has no substance at
all.
“Gallagher is desperate. We got the
de-registration undertaking from him
on the basis that the ACTU could do
nothing about those charges, no matter
what the merits of his case. When the
de-registration charges were dropped he
understood this. I didn’t think he’d
come back with this now. It’s simply
wrong to try it again. It would be wrong
for the union movement to use its re-
sources for a personal matter. It
wouldn’t be a union movement. We
never said to him at any stage we’d get
him out of the charges.” (ACTU indus-
trial officer lan Court confirmed last
week that Gallagher had raised the mat-
ter of the charges twice last month the
first time at a meeting of ACTU and
building union representatives and on
the second occasion to Kelty and
Court.)
Victorian Master Builders’ Associa-
tion industrial relations manager John
Glasson concurs in this matter. He told
The Bulletin last week the delay in the
BLF’s signing the superannuation
agreement “all relates back to a claim
by Gallagher that we must fix up his
charges. We told him we were not in a
position to do anything about that and
would not if we were in that position.”
According to Glasson, the associa-
tion had no confidence that the BLF
would hold to the agreement if it finally
agreed to sign. However, he was echo-
ing the sentiments of many association
members when he added: “We would
prefer to see Gallagher brought into the
agreement than get caught up in a long
bloody confrontation.”
In Victoria, as in NSW, a number of
developers enjoy a good working rela-
tionship with the BLF. In return for
generous site agreements including
amenities that are luxurious by industry

Belgium to

System 12
telephone
exchanges.


For more than a year, Belgium's telephone administration had
our System 12'“ on the line—undergoing rigid tests to prove it could
handle telephone traffic for Brecht, a suburb of Antwerp.
Meanwhile, a second
System 12 was put through
its paces in Namur and
successfully cut over.
The farsighted Belgian
telephone administration
was convinced that
System 12 answered their
needs. Now and for the
future.
So they ordered
130,000 equivalent lines to
be installed by ITT’s
Belgian subsidiary, Bell
Telephone Manufacturing
Company, over the next
two years.
What convinced them?
Simply this.

After more than a year of trials,
Belgium ordered 130,000 equivalent lines
of System 12, the only telephone
system with fully distributed control.
I J
System 12 has fully distributed control, the result of $7OO million
in research and development by ITT engineers around the world.
With no central computer, control is distributed throughout
the system. So a problem in one place doesn’t bring the whole
system to a halt.
That's fail-safe.
System 12 is also fully digital. And digital is the fastest, most
accurate way to transmit data and voice simultaneously.
That’s important. Because over the next three years, Belgium’s
electronic data networks will grow tremendously
And with System 12 equipment, Belgium’s telephone adminis-
tration will easily keep up with advances in technology and
population.
We’re glad Belgium chose System 12. Because when it comes
to telephone exchanges, we can answer the call.

THIS ROOM COULD BE
THE BEST BUSINESS INVESTMENT
YOU EVER MADE
-
■HP
0.K., so you travel to Sydney a lot. And you want to stay somewhere
that’s comfortable. Obviously. All business executives do.
But you want it to be central so you save on time and taxi fares.
And you want the staff to take good care of you.
Naturally you’d like all these things to come at a price that doesn’t affect
your budget.
Then consider the following proposition.
The Southern Cross is Sydney’s newest hotel. It’s centrally located near
all public transport and en route to the airport, too.
Comfort? Australia’s foremost decorators, the guys who do a lot of
boardrooms for our major corporations took care of it, so they have a pretty
good idea of what a business executive wants.
Relaxed colour schemes, plush carpets, good lighting, comfortable
oversized beds. Large desks and phones at the ready.
Most visitors even go so far as to describe our rooms as luxurious but
we’ll leave that for you to decide.
Other Southern Cross touches that could be described as “luxuries,”
but we’d prefer to call them “little extras,” include a garden and heated
swimming pool on the roof, a first class restaurant and valet parking.
But as you’re a business executive we imagine that the thing that will
appeal most are our rates.
Staying at the new Southern Cross i n Syd ney may wel I seem I i ke a
luxury to you. But it will never look like that on your expense report.
We could promise you that when you stay with us you’ll be “cradled in
the lap of luxury.”
But, really, we’d prefer just to say that The Southern Cross
represents probably the best value for money of any hotel in town.
The Southern Cross in Sydney. It’s a great business proposition..

Builders laborers’ pickets at the trouble-plagued new police headquarters building site in Sydney
standards, they see their
buildings go up quickly.
An example of this is the
site agreement negotiated for
the Rialto project in Flinders
Lane. Melbourne, being built
by Grofam Pty Ltd, part of the
Grollo group.
This includes a 35-hour-
week for all workers on the
site, a $1.20 an hour site dis-
ability allowance, air-condi-
tioned lunch rooms and a
union office complete with
furniture and telephone.
Violence and brinkman-
ship have characterised the
BLF’s operations over the
past decade. Just a few of the
“highlights” have been its bit-
ter demarcation dispute with
the Federated Ironworkers’
Association (FIA) over the
building of the Omega naviga-
tion mast in Victoria in 1981,
Gallagher’s jailing in 1982 on
contempt charges and this
year’s violent confrontation at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground over a
demarcation dispute regarding the con-
struction of light towers.
In the last case the position was clear
the Arbitration Commission had
awarded the work to the FIA and the
Australian Workers’ Union but this was
not good enough for the BLF. Its
pickets continued, a black ban was ap-
plied to the metal company providing
materials for the job and the Victorian
government spent nearly $1 million
protecting those who had been given the
work. It was only after walk-outs from
the commission and threats to take the
matter to the High Court that the feder-
ation accepted defeat.
Melbourne’s Rialto project: luxurious amenities
“I suppose you could say, in one
sense, they (the FIA) had a victory but
one day you are a rooster and the next
day you are a feather duster,” said Gal-
lagher on this point.
Gallagher is hoping the BLF will be-
come the rooster in the next looming
battle with the FIA Alcoa’s alu-
minium smelter at Portland, Victoria.
Work is soon to recommence at the
smelter site and the BLF has staked its
claim for the work it covered before the
project came to a halt. In the interim,
however, the FIA has scored a victory in
the High Court over the building of
metal structures.
The FIA now believes it has the right
to construction work on metal
structures at Portland.
As expected, Gallagher
signed the superannuation
deal at the 11th hour saving
his union from annihilation,
and, according to newspaper
reports, saying he hoped that
the deal would help solve the
problems in the industry.
He has until Wednesday,
October 10 to lift all industrial
actions to make his signature
worth the paper it is written
on. This includes the NSW
police site ruckus.
If this is not sorted out by
the time the ACTU special
executive meeting commences
it will be too late for the BLF.
According to Macßean, sup-
port for the BLF from other
unions is “non-existent.”
“I’ve been an official for 20
years now and I’ve never been
involved in a dispute where
there’s so much depth of feel-
ing by the collective union
movement against another union,” he
said.
“My experience has been that union
officials have a deep commitment to
unionism and while they are prepared
to fight a good fight from time to time
on issues against employees and gov-
ernments they have nevertheless been
opposed to the intimidating violence
and thuggery which is part and parcel of
the federation’s policies.
“All the unions, including of the
Communist Party and of the left, see the
federation’s policies as divisive as pit-
ting worker against worker and being
against the traditional Australian
unionism in terms of principles. □


RELIGION
A woman’s fight
to satisfy her
priestly vocation
By WILLA MCDONALD
JULIA PERRY believes she has been
“called” to the Anglican priesthood. To
many in the Sydney Diocese, that is im-
possible priesthood is a role
forbidden to women by the Bible.
For a long time Perry, an intelligent,
down-to-earth 28-year-old, tried to ac-
cept that, too frightened to admit her
“vocation.” “You do doubt and say
‘What's wrong with me?’ You have been
believing these men all your life and
they say ‘No, He’s not calling you’ and
you say ‘I can’t help it He seems to
be’.”
Last week, the Sydney Diocese
effectively postponed the controversial
decision whether to allow the ordina-
tion of women but agreed to allow
women to become deacons, an ordained
ministry different from the office of dea-
coness. In 1977, the Anglican General
Synod (national) decided there were no
serious theological objections to the or-
dination of women as deacon,
priest, or bishop. In 1981, it
declared moves should be
made to put this into effect.
Until three-quarters of the
Australian dioceses agree, in-
cluding the major cities, Aus-
tralian women cannot become
priests. Sydney and Adelaide
are the centres of opposition.
Women are ordained in Af-
rica, New Zealand, Canada,
Hong Kong, the United States
and Brazil.
Perry is an active member
of the Movement for the Ordi-
nation of Women (MOW), a
group of men and women
(about one-fifth are male)
formed in Sydney a year ago
which now has about 500
members Australia-wide. Not
all female members want to
become priests. “They see the ordained
ministry (for women) as vital to the
Church’s continued existence,” she said.
“There is much to be gained by in-
troducing women’s perspective on
issues.”
Describing her tortuous path to her
vocation in a private questionnaire in
1983, she said: “I was now in the com-
plete doldrums. I felt utterly ineffective,
and alone. More often than not I wished
Julia Perry: “I wished God would buzz off..”
God would buzz off as well. It would be
so much easier to be a librarian, go
boozing on a Friday night and sleep in
on Sunday morning.”
When Perry could get no support
from the church in Sydney she was
forced to move to a diocese which was
not antagonistic. She enrolled in a div-
inity degree at St John's College,
Morpeth, in the NSW Hunter Valley. In
the usual course, a man who “gets the

call” approaches his bishop who ar-
ranges financial assistance for him to
study to be a priest. Perry couldn’t find
a bishop to support her.
She is in her first year at St John’s
where the principal, Reverend George
Garnsay, is sympathetic. Until a few
weeks ago she was paying her own way
with help from MOW and her old
parish at Cremorne. But support for the
movement is growing. The bishops of
Newcastle have agreed to finance her
studies with a view to her becoming a
lay worker. They will back Perry if and
when the church eventually allows
women to be priests.
“You get frustrated more than re-
sentful. When the rest of my year go and
get deaconed and then ordained and I
know I have done all the same training
and have had all the same commitment
to parishes over the years that might
be fairly difficult to take.”
A month ago, Perry saw her alterna-
tive as seeking ordination overseas
(many other women, she says, also con-
sider leaving the Anglican Church) but
now she has the backing of her bishops,
she feels an obligation to spend some
time in the Newcastle parish as a lay
worker.
“I have suffered some pain from the
church . . . it’s okay for men who have
been ordained to say ‘it’s inevitable
why fuss?’ It’s okay for me in my
twenties to wait. I can put up with it
just. But I have friends in their fifties
who want to be ordained.
“I don’t know why the clergy is so
frightened, nervous or threatened. I
don’t even know if they are the right
adjectives to apply to them.”
She sees the case against women as
spurious. “It’s all so tied up with tra-
dition and sexuality.” On the lighter
side of the fundamentalist reaction:
“You can imagine what it’s like going in
to buy robes and saying ‘I want an exact
size 34-23-36 with darts in it.’ People are
very worried about clergy dress. Once
women get into it they are expecting
plunging cleavages . . .”
One gets the feeling that Perry’s vo-
cation has been difficult for family and
strength needed to live the cloistered
existence of the nun with its particular
traditions and expectations. She has a
strong desire to help others and pass on
her Christianity, but her style is to reach
people on a common, human level
rather than to preach. “I would like a
ministry that works in a secular area like
a chaplaincy,” she said.
For many, Perry has become a sym-
bol for the movement to allow female
priests. Her piciure adorns pamphlets
and posters. She is acceptable for the
priesthood in every way but her sex.
“It’s your actual essence. It’s the way
God made you that’s stopping you fill-
ing that ministry for Him.” □
some friends to accept. But, she believes
her family will support her in whatever
she does. As for friends: “Most are fair-
ly supportive. Some think it’s fairly
strange but they haven’t stopped speak-
ing to me or anything. Some are going
through an adjustment period. They ex-
pected me to get holy.”
Despite her passionate commitment,
her vocation, says Perry, was a negative
one “all other options were unsatis-
factory.” She gave two reasons for not
wanting to be a nun marriage (it an-
noys her when people presume she
doesn’t want to marry) and the special
SHAR ADAMS
Nev Warburton: spreading the attack
QUEENSLAND
Warburton packs
down for his
toughest game
By DENIS REINHARDT
ALTHOUGH he doesn’t like to admit
it, Labor’s new Queensland leader Nev
Warburton, the seventh since losing
power in 1957, is an adherent to the
school of politics that argues govern-
ments lose elections rather than opposi-
tions win.
This more than anything else under-
pins the strategy the 52-year-old former
union secretary and rugby league sec-
ond rower is developing in the uphill
effort to win government.
“It’s a political philosophy that’s en-
trenched in all parties. All analysts have
said it it’s not only the Labor party,”
Warburton told The Bulletin last week,
“The errors that a government makes
don’t exactly help it. We’ve seen that in
numerous conservative governments
right throughout Australia. If they’re
shown to be going badly, well obviously
that has an effect on the electorate,
“It’s certainly happening here. I be-
lieve that additionally we have to show
ourselves to be a suitable alternative,
That’s part of the strategy.”
Warburton’s strategy began unfold-
ing last week in the Queens-
land parliament, freshly
resumed from a recess follow-
ing Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-
Petersen’s delivery of the state
budget.
Branding the budget as a
“document of deception . . .
dishonest and deceitful,”
Warburton drew yawns from
the government benches.
Later he told a television in-
terviewer that he couldn’t
understand the lack of cabinet
response. “Perhaps they were
trying to get away with it by
ignoring me,” Warburton
said.
Warburton, broke his leg at
the peak of his rugby league
days and never played foot-
ball again. On the field he was
a big rawboned man who, ac-
cording to a contemporary,
former Australian half back
Barry Muir, knew only one
rule “the quickest way to
the line was full speed ahead.
In defence it was hit ’em hard,
hit ’em low and hit ’em often.”
Warburton, who is now
more likely to be seen with a
lawn bowls ball in his hand is
an affable man, quick to gladhand and
eager not to offend. He is however a
little insecure outside his political circle
and under pressure tends to fudge his
vocabulary. Describing a caucus ele-
vation at the time of taking over the
leadership, Warburton described it as a
natural transgression.
The father of three daughters is a
graduate of the trade union school of
politics. He is a former assistant state
secretary of the Electrical Trades union
and former Brisbane City Council
alderman.
Warburton suffers from the political
affliction that has affected all his prede-
cessors except Keith Wright, who re-
signed on August 29 to enter the federal
arena he lacks a stature to seize pre-
eminence, even momentarily, from the
Queensland premier.
Perhaps recognising this, Warburton
will be concentrating on a cohesive


front bench profile to show Labor as a
unified political force.
The Warburton strategy of using his
front bench to spread the attack on the
cabinet appeared to bite by the end of
the week as Edmund Casey, one of the
three opposition leaders still in
Warburton’s caucus, probed Bjelke-
Petersen family pecuniary interests.
Shaking with anger and amid up-
roar, Bjelke-Petersen denied that a fam-
ily company stood to gain from prior
knowledge of a Weir development ad-
joining a family-owned property.
Warburton believes that Queensland
Labor will gain electoral credibility by
hammering away at the Sunshine State’s
continuing economic difficulties in
sugar and heavy engineering.
“If we continue to show that the
Queensland government is not the econ-
omic manager that it’s made itself out to
be, I believe that the story eventually
has to get across,” he said.
Despite Warburton’s Labor Unity
using its caucus numbers to make a
clean sweep of leadership positions
after Wright’s departure, Warburton is
keen to play down the ire of the centre.
Any potential challenger for
Warburton is likely to come from this
faction, which although it clearly lacked
the numbers, made the point of running
a candidate against former Opposition
leader Tom Burns for the deputy oppo-
sition leader’s post.
Warburton, in his slow, laconic
tones, is keen to talk of caucus unity.
“It’s no good putting up a false front.
What I’m talking about is a sensible
working relationship,” he said.
His detractors within the centre
membership of the caucus argue that he
has failed to show the equanimity of his
long-term leadership by actions rather
than words.
Leaving aside his factional detrac-
tors, Warburton, like the Labor leaders
before him, is taking odds on the depar-
ture of Bjelke-Petersen and the turmoil
it might bring within the National Party
government. This hope depends on the
thesis that Bjelke-Petersen, viewing
himself as a man of history, will prefer
to leave his party at its zenith rather
than groom a successor who will per-
haps overshadow him.
“Obviously there are a lot of people
in Queensland who think Joh Bjelke-
Petersen is a capable person. He’s a man
heading quickly towards his mid-70s
he is not going to be there forever. He’s
the sort of man who will not encourage
somebody to follow him.
“He’s a wild card and quite frankly I
can’t see that he’s got many aces up his
sleeve. He’s not going to encourage any-
body to be there to step into his shoes
because he’s quite concerned that they
might do that earlier than he’s decided,”
Warburton says. □

Helicopter bid
could boost
army mobility
The Bell-Boeing JVX demonstrator: a load, range and speed advantage
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
THE POWERFUL United States
aerospace partnership of Bell Helicop-
ters and Boeing has offered Australia an
airlift capability that would revolution-
ise deployment of our army.
Responding to the bid by the Royal
Australian Air Force for utility helicop-
ters, Bell-Boeing has offered its tilt-rotor
aircraft which is under development for
the US Marine Corps.
The aircraft uses huge propellers:
they are parallel to the ground, like heli-
copter rotors, for take-off. In flight, the
engines swivel through 90 degrees as
speed picks up. When the wings take the
lift, the propellers then provide thrust as
on conventional aircraft.
The RAAF’s utility helicopter tender
closed last month, with four reported
bidders: Bell-Boeing, Sikorsky, West-
land and France’s Aerospatiale. The
eventual order may total 70 but the ten-
der calls for phased procurement. The
first 12 would go into service about
1990.
The tilt-rotor aircraft is planned to
go into service with the marines in 1991.
To bridge the gap between that date and
when the RAAF Bell helicopters wear
out, the partners have proposed an
updated version of the present equip-
ment which would be traded in.
The tilt-rotor, designated the JVX
(for joint services vertical lift exper-
imental vehicle) is much bigger and
more expensive than RAAF specifica-
tions require. In its operational version,
it will be capable of carrying 24 fully-
armed troops over 700 km at speeds
around 500km/h. A conventional utility
helicopter will carry 10 to 14 troops
over about 150 km at a speed of some
220km/h.
Although the JVX can lift off and
land vertically, like a helicopter, it prob-
ably would try to use a take-off run of
about 50m to increase payload and
range and would land vertically.
The cabin, a box about 2m square, is
too small for armored vehicles but the
JVX will have a cargo hook capable of
lifting an external load of about 4500
kgs.
On present quotes, each JVX would
cost about $l4 million.
“That’s about two-and-a-half times
as much as helicopters now in service,”
Joe Moharich, who heads up Bell’s op-
erations in Australia, said in Brisbane.
“But it also has two-and-a-half times the
payload, four times the range and three
times the speed.”
The proposal is generating much in-
terest in the services. It raises new
operating and logistic concepts.
If, for instance, the army’s operation-
al deployment force were sent from
Townsville to the north of Western Aus-
tralia, the unit would require a lift by
the RAAF’s Hercules and Boeings from
Townsville to the nearest suitable air-
port and then have to use helicopters to
reach forward positions. The helicop-
ters also would have to be flown in by
Hercules. But the JVX would allow pla

What, you may ask, has a Chameleon got to do with
Toyota Tercel?
Quite a lot actually.
You see, the Chameleon is an amazingly versatile reptile
that has the remarkable ability to adapt to its environment.
So does the Tercel.
It's smart enough to be seen at some of the best places,
and tough enough to handle some of the worst roads.
With nifty front-wheel-drive that easily
changes to all-wheel-drive,while still moving
All combined with Toyota Suspension Tuning
Tercel has style and comfort, and is rugged and reliable.
With a surprising amount of passenger and luggage room.
To prove how versatile it is, Tercel has won praise from
around the world. From desert to snow.

But whilst the Chameleon is not the fastest reptile on

toons to fly from their parade ground to
their deployment area in a single air-
craft in about seven hours.
Hercules would still be needed to
ferry vehicles and some supplies but
considerably fewer could do it, the lift
accomplished much more quickly.
With that sort of capability, the JVX
also could be regarded as a 1990 s re-
placement for the RAAF’s piston-
engined Caribou tactical transports.
In its production version, the JVX is
a comparably-sized aircraft. It will
weigh some 22,700 kg, be about 17.25 m
long, have a wingspan of 14m. The
power will come from two General
Electric T 64 turbo-props and the pro-
peller-rotors will have a diameter of
about 11.6 m.
A technology demonstrator is in ser-
vice and being used for proving equip-
ment designed for the production air-
craft, scheduled to make its first flight in
1987.
The Australian services will be reluc-
tant to pin their hopes on such a radical
new technology until it has been tested
in service but they are interested in the
tactical flexibility which it would give
them.
For a government which has been
sweating on a comparatively simple
choice of a helicopter for the navy be-
tween a mere two contenders, the cost
would be staggering. But looked at in
terms of an overall system, with savings
in the purchase of transport aircraft and
prospects of more productive use of the
existing fleet, the JVX could emerge as
the key to Australia’s defence mobility
beyond 1995. □
PUBLIC OPINION
Majority says
tax levels
are unreasonable
FIFTY-NINE percent of Australians
eligible to vote believe that the general
level of taxes in Australia is unreason-
able, a Morgan Gallup Poll, conducted
soon after the August federal budget,
has found.
Forty percent said their first tax pref-
erence would be lower income tax and
higher sales tax, 13 percent said higher
income tax and lower sales tax while 38
percent said the present level of taxes
should be retained.
These results came from interviewing
an Australia-wide cross-section of 1719
electors in mid-September. Those sur-
veyed were asked, “As far as you per-
sonally are concerned, do you feel the

WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Dissident forces
flirt with a
return to unity
By ROSS LOUTHEAN
and
PETER ALFORD
BIDDING to reverse a tide of division
and decay in what was a heartland of
rural politics, lay members of Western
Australia’s National Country Party
(NCP) and its breakaway National
Party (NP) have begun to mend their
fences under the banner of the National
Party of Australia.
The crucial point is a by-election on
November 17 when the NPA tries to re-
capture a Central Province legislative
seat won by the Liberals last year while
the NCP and NP were at war.
The Country Party in WA boasted 14
state members of parliament, two sena-
tors and two members of the federal
House of Representatives before the
Sir Charles Court: sowed the seeds of split
election which ushered in the Liberals’
Sir Charles Court as Premier.
The two factions which sprang from
the Country Party have no senators, no
MHR and only seven state MPs barely a
decade later.
Seeds for the split were sown during
Court’s regime, with discontent over a
perceived lack of influence in
cabinet. Ray McPharlin and
his deputy, Matt Stephens, led
the NCP out of the coalition.
In consequent negotia-
tions, the NCP buckled and
returned to government with
Dick Old as leader and Peter
Jones as his deputy.
McPharlin and Stephens were
out in the cold.
The National Party was
formed after a further storm
in 1979.
Believing that they could
quickly plough it under, the
NCP and the Liberals waged
an extravagant campaign
against the offshoot in the
1980 state election. The key
emphasis was on unseating
dissident McPharlin. He
survived but returned to the
NCP for the 1983 poll. His
electorate apparently found
this one switch too many and
turned to the Liberals’ Bill
McNee, who had been a dis-
tant runner-up before.
That was a crippling blow
to rural politics: it had been
the “safest” of farming seats.
Lay members of both fac-
tions had begun talking pri-
vately about re-unification as
long as three years ago,
having seen that the maximum of “div-
ided they fall” as working only too well.
In the former Legislative Council
strongholds of Central, Lower Central,
Lower North and Upper West (two
seats per province), the combined NP-
NCP vote of 1983 was 40,889. The Lib-
erals had 20,529 and Labor 23,549. Yet,
the Liberals took six seats and the NP
and NCP only one each.
The turning point came with the
NCP executive announcement early this
year that it would field its own can-
didates for the next federal elections.
Formation of the National Party of
Australia may not end the rift; enmity
between the parliamentary factions is
still strong.
Old and Jones clearly are not happy
with the latest turn of events. This has
led to speculation that they could go in-
dependent or even join the Liberals.
However, the National Party of Aus-
tralia has given the politicians time to
make up: they have until August 31, the
deadline set for party nominations for
the next state poll, to declare their inten-
tions.
National Party of Australia general
president John Paterson (who was NCP
president) told The Bulletin that federal
election plans had not been finalised.
However, the NPA is likely to concen-
trate on one Senate spot and the seat of
O’Connor. □

An anti-abortion rally: their way of saying ‘thanks’
P. WEST/SYDNEY FREELANCE
By JIM CAMERON*
WHEN HUMAN life issues bob up in
parliament, picking your way through
them is harder than getting through a
paddock of bindi-eyes barefoot. Es-
pecially when there’s some chance of
losing it, life is a subject with the knack
of grabbing people’s minds. That there
are more questions about it than
answers always adds mystique.
Serious as it all is, the reactions of
different groups can have their lighter
side. Feminists are among those who
often loudly trumpet their attitudes to
life. Interesting people, but they’ve
never managed to be very feminine.
Like the lesbians, they’re not really
against life, but it seems would prefer
men not to be allowed to live it.
Other groups have given the subject
funny twists as well. Women who chant
“a woman’s right to choose” are full-on
for abortion. Yet they never pause to
remember their own mothers could
have aborted them.
Next come the pacifists. They argue
about the preciousness of life in a boots-
and-all way more like war than peace.
Nothing is important enough to them to

MP (first Liberal, later pro-life Independent)

recovering.
justify taking up arms. It’s
ironic that the contrary
view was put best by none
other than the great liber-
tarian, John Stuart Mill.
Conservatives not used to
agreeing with him will be
surprised to find them-
selves doing so. Mill said
that to him war was ugly,
but not the ugliest of
things. Some things were
worse uglier still was
“the decayed and degraded
state of moral and patriotic
feeling which thinks nothing worth a
war.” Another irony the pacifists don’t
mention: the young men at Oxford Uni-
versity who won Hitler’s favor by de-
bating strongly for pacifism just before
World War II were among the first to
volunteer for Spitfire squadrons when
their own country was attacked.
Humanists try to enlarge everything
they see as coming from man, and say
nothing comes from God. Yet mostly
they make man seem smaller, not big-
ger By trying to strip away his spiritual
dimension they make him like a com-
pass with a cardinal point missing
having an east, south and west but no
noith.
Miles apart in their responses are the
ockers and the intellectuals. “I’ll take
the ockers any day,” is the usual re-
sponse when they’re compared. Fortu-
nately there are some fairly gutsy pro-
grams put out by earthy souls in the de-
partments on the “Life, Be In It” theme,
aimed largely at the beer belly and
thongs brigade. Uncomplicated types
who just need a prod to leave the bar
and go out and smash a tennis ball, or
watch a game of footie, maybe do re-
spond to these programs. Or do they
Jim Cameron: pro life
just go on drinking their tinnies and
watching the tellie? More critical souls
see these programs as a case of govern-
ments using taxpayers’ money to per-
suade them to keep living because they
would lose their votes and taxes if they
didn’t.
But the ockers are small cheese as a
problem compared with the great in-
tellects living in their ivy-covered
towers. It was that old pessimist
Schopenhauer, for instance, who argued
that life wasn’t worth living. Just how
much boost can anyone get from that?
It’s about as helpful as a used bus ticket.
That other intellect, Bertrand Russell,
didn’t make us bubble with hope either.
His view was that it’s “only on the firm
foundation of unyielding despair” that
we can safely build. Firm or not, that’s a
foundation on which nobody should
hold their breath waiting for sky-
scrapers to go up.
The mental bigwigs can doubtfully
shake their mighty craniums as much as
they like to the tune of any
rattling sounds this causes.
While they ponder whether
life is worth the candle, the
less academic ones will live
it and make a fair fist of en-
joying themselves.
Could be there are a few
quirks in the attitudes of
Christians to life as well?
While they argue life only
comes together when their
leader is on it’s throne,
they often seem keen to
cling to a corner of the
throne cushion.
Christians have useful insights into
life and a knack for teaching others how
to apply them. But for learning them-
selves? Sometimes they’re not quite so
good at that.
“Christ’s attitudes to life have never
been disproven,” supporters claim.
“Yes,” agree the cynics, “but only be-
cause they’ve never been tried.” Here
we have a few echoes of Nietzsche an-
other genius without anything positive
to say who claimed the last Christian
died on the cross! It’s good Christians
aren’t as inconsistent as they’re painted.
If they were, you’d have expected Sir
Isaac Newton, a Christian, to have dis-
covered gravity by noting that apples
fall instead of rise from trees and then
to have stepped off a tree expecting him-
self to go up.
Forget the academic approach. Life
is meant to be lived with gusto, not
debated. Of all the good causes, human
life is still tops among them. Save the
seals, by all means. Spruce up the physi-
cal environment. Before you get too car-
ried away with all these, however, roll
out the red carpet for good old homo
sapiens. Living the life he’s got is still a
lot better than his other choice! □

THE LAW
The man to
whom reform is
second nature
By WILLA MCDONALD
JUSTICE Murray Wilcox sat in his
spruce blue suit and Pierre Cardin tie
uncharacteristically suave mufti for this
man to whom clothes are unimportant
and spoke of his three loves: the bush,
his family and the law.
Of the three, his love of nature and
determination to protect it probably has
had the greatest influence on his life. It
led to an expertise in environmental law
and a busy practice at the New South
Wales bar; the presidency of the Austra-
lian Conservation Foundation; a pos-
ition on the Federal Court bench and
now acting chairmanship of the Austra-
lian Law Reform Commission.
Wilcox, 47, succeeds Justice Michael
Kirby who resigned to take up
presidency of the NSW Court
of Appeal last week.
Unwilling to leave the
“rough and tumble” of the
courts completely, Wilcox will
assume the position part-time
for a maximum of 12 months
while continuing his judicial
activities.
A shy man, Wilcox’s style
in chairing the commission
will be very different from that
of the high-profile Kirby. “It
was an essential task for
(Kirby’s) term to create public
awareness of law reform and
the role the commission could
play. I think Kirby did that
admirably but one doesn’t do
that continuously. Times have
changed and it’s not so neces-
sary to devote so much energy
to the public promotion of the
cause of law reform or the
commission’s work,” said
Wilcox.
He sees his role as super-
visory and as a provider of
ideas, “simply as part of a
team.”
Kirby would like to see
Wilcox take on the position
full-time describing him as
industrious, productive, inde-
pendent and articulate. Kirby
has no advice for his suc-
cessor except to re-emphasise
his view that the commission
needs to maintain a close in-
volvement with the commu-
nity for information and ideas
and not “become a backroom
exercise with a few lawyers over a glass
of whisky at the end of the day.”
Wilcox was born on February 17,
1937 and spent his early years in NSW
country towns where his father served
as a Presbyterian minister. The son at-
tended high school as a boarder at Syd-
ney’s Scots College.
He gained his Law degree from the
University of Sydney before moving to
Cooma at the age of 22 with his new
wife, Christina. Cooma was a boom
town integral to the Snowy Mountains
Scheme and managing a branch office
there for four years for a city firm of
solicitors was a huge responsibility for a
recent graduate.
Wilcox joined the bar in 1963 and
read with Trevor Morling, now Justice
Morling of the Federal Court. Accord-
ing to Bulletin sources, Morling had a
great influence on Wilcox’s life and the
way in which he approached matters at
the bar. Morling had a strong practice
in local government law, from which
environmental law developed. The men
are still close friends.
Wilcox was appointed counsel assist-
Justice Murray Wilcox: colleagues describe him as fearless
KENT MEARS
ing the commission of inquiry into land
tenure which Prime Minister Gough
Whitlam set up under Justice Else-
Mitchell, another great influence on
Wilcox’s intellectual development.
Liberal Attorney-General Bob
Ellicott appointed him to be one of the
three original full-time commissioners
on the Australian Law Reform Com-
mission in 1976 and he led projects
which resulted in its reports on Unfair
Publication; Defamation and Privacy
and Lands Acquisition and Compensa-
tion. He also investigated the law of
standing and class actions and has writ-
ten texts on land law.
He worked on last year’s inquiry for
the Victorian Government which rec-
ommended that poker machines be kept
out of the state because of “criminal ac-
tivity which inevitably associates itself
with poker machines and .. . secondly,
they would be introduced to registered
clubs and it seemed totally unfair to the
hotels.”
Wilcox is a family man. His closest
friends, he says, are those he has made
with his family and tend to centre
around the leafy Sydney sub-
urb of Turramurra where he
has spent most of his married
life.
His love of the bush is
shared by his three children
and wife Chris, whose award-
winning natural history docu-
mentary A Voice For The Wil-
derness recently appeared on
television.
Bushwalking and camping
with the family is Wilcox’s
main relaxation.
More than half of his work
during 21 years at the bar
involved environmental dis-
putes and he developed a
reputation for being a tough
advocate with a keen legal
mind.
One of his appearances be-
fore the Land and Environ-
ment Court has been recorded
in environmentalists’ folklore.
Wilcox had received an ur-
gent brief on the. Friday after-
noon of a long weekend to
seek a temporary injunction
to prevent roads being built
through the Goonimbar State
Forest on the northern coast
of New South Wales “quite
obviously on the basis that all
damage would be done by the
end of the long weekend,” he
said.
To stymie the action, log-
gers demanded an undertak-
ing for damages from Wil-
cox’s client who was a 21-
year-old woman on the dole.
Enraged, Wilcox gave a per

sonal undertaking: “It was just an in-
stinctive thing to do.”
The matter was taken to the ethics
committee. Unable to act as counsel and
have a financial interest in the matter,
the undertaking was taken over from
Wilcox by three environmental groups.
Justice Jerry Cripps who presided in
that case admires Wilcox but dis-
approved of his action. Cripps cites it as
an aberration in Wilcox’s normally ob-
jective legal nature. According to
Cripps, Wilcox took many environ-
mental cases without payment but
usually kept emotional involvement out
of the courtroom.
He was a member of the Australian
Advisory Committee on the environ-
ment between 1974 and 1976 and in
1981 was asked to be first president of
the Environmental Law Association of
NSW.
Wilcox succeeded Dr H. C. (Nugget)
Coombs as president of the Australian
Conservation Foundation. The presi-
dency coincided with the brouhaha over
Tasmania’s Franklin dam issue (Wilcox
has a knack for joining organisations as
they become controversial) and spent
most of his time “trying to get some res-
olution out of it; talking to politicians,
trying to get Tasmanian politicians to
talk to federal politicians and federal
politicians to talk to Tasmanian politi-
cians at a time when no one was talking
to each other.”
He served as procurator (honorary
legal advisor) of the Presbyterian
Church in NSW from 1974 to 1977
when it was preparing to become part of
the Uniting Church a position which
he says he was asked to take up because
of his father’s background. Although a
man of strong principle, Justice Wilcox
is not religious.
Colleagues describe him as fearless
when speaking his mind, sometimes to
his detriment. He has fallen out with
politicians more than once because of
his outspokenness.
His involvement with environmental
causes has branded him occasionally as
sympathetic to the Left, depriving him
of briefs during his years as a Queen’s
Counse 1
Although now without party affilia-
tion, Wilcox once was a member of the
Liberal Party. He resigned, disil-
lusioned, in 1970. “There were a lot of
things I wanted them to take a more
progressive attitude toward but it was
just a waste of time,” he said.
Wilcox is well-respected by col-
leagues. Although quiet and self-
effacing, he is a charismatic figure. Even
when he was at the bar, “he had a
coterie of barristers who almost idolised
him,” said Cripps. “They would always
say, ‘Oh, Murray Wilcox advised the
council about this’ and say it like they
were quoting John: 2:27.” □

BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR
Strong mix of candidates for the title
Prime Minister Hawke will be a special guest at the presentation of the 1985 Bulletin /Qantas
Business Woman of the Year Award in Sydney on November 13. Nominations have now
closed, and GLENNYS BELL and PETER ALFORD profile some of the nominees.
BIRD’S COUNTRY Mill Bread Mixes,
the company run by Sue Morphet and
Barbara Wookey, started as a business
in a bucket from Morphet’s home.
Her father, John Bird, was a master
baker who ran a very successful bread
making school in South Melbourne.
When he died suddenly in 1981,
Morphet found that students were still
asking to buy the bread mix because
they could not duplicate it at home. To
meet demand, she continued to make it
in buckets.
Morphet worked from home during
1982. At the end of the year she asked
Wookey, a friend, who had been selling
the mix on a commission basis in Gee-
long, to join her as a partner.
The next step came when they put
the product on supermarket shelves.
Morphet says: “In the early days, we
used to get up early in the morning and
bake bread rolls and coffee scrolls and
take them fresh and steaming in baskets
around the supermarket buyers’
offices.” Both Coles and Foodlands
agreed to sell, on a trial basis, through a
few Victorian outlets. Morphet esti-
mates that thousands of supermarkets
and health food stores are selling the
mix now.
They were making up about four or
five tonnes of the mix each
month. Now they sell some
4000 tonnes, with turnover
averaging $400,000, a month.
As the business expanded,
they contracted production to
a flour company in Victoria
Bunge (Aust) Pty Ltd which
provided the ingredients.
They also had contractors to
package the product, and dis-
tribute it. They also decided to
appoint food brokers in each
state to represent them, rather
than appoint their own sales
managers. The brokers supply
sales representatives. It means
that Morphet and Wookey
have become a national or-
ganisation without the huge
personnel numbers usually
required. There are only six
people in their Melbourne
office.
As Bunge became more
involved in the company, the
flour miller offered pro-
Sue Morphet and Barbara Wookey (wearing red): from a bucket to a bonanza
motional financial support to the
women which enabled them to embark
on a national advertising campaign. In
exchange for the financial backing, they
have sold a majority holding in the
Lee Bird: cracking the US market
company to Bunge.
The deal with Bunge provides them
with a contract of employment for three
years, with royalties for the product,
plus an offer to buy the remaining share-
holding if the women agree.
However, Morphet says: “I’d be dis-
appointed to leave the company in three
years. After all, it’s my family name on
the pack.”
LEE BIRD has the sort of name that
looks good on a fashion label but she
little dreamed when she started in the
business that she would be selling her
label to the United States.
She had wanted to be a fashion de-
signer but left school at 14 because her
father thought that education for a
“sheila” was a waste of money. Instead
she took a job as a girl Friday in a cloth-
ing factory by day and studied fashion
design at the Royal Melbourne Institute
of Technology by night.
She remembers she earned a meagre
salary and learned enough to help her
make the perfect sleeve and work her
way into the fashion house of Norma
Tullo, one of the few designers working
in Australia in the 60s.
Bird went to London in the late 60s
and worked at Biba, an influential


Di Cullen in her vineyard at Margaret River: a wine pioneer
PETER ALFORD
fashion house in London. On returning
to Melbourne, she opened a shop in a
Bourke Street arcade and then a second
in South Yarra. “I was making wonder-
ful after-five chiffons the sort every-
one wore to 21st birthday parties,” she
says.
Then she went into the wholesale
business, designing what she now calls
“rich bitch” silk dresses. She might still
be making them, except she went on
holiday to Noosa in Queensland and
decided that it was the life for her.
She needs to keep her wits about her,
since, rather than opting out or retiring
into a quiet resort boutique business,
she has started a new career through ex-
porting to the US.
Bird was holidaying with her part-
ner, Charles Bradley, in Hawaii last
year when the idea of selling her clothes
in the US came up. “People would ask
me where my clothes came from and
said they would love to buy them.”
But, she says: “It’s jolly hard work
and a hard market to crack. It’s easy for
Americans to say ‘How cute’ about your
clothes but the bottom line is proving
yourself... All the details, like where is
it going to be warehoused, who is going
to represent you, who is going to distrib-
ute it and where.”
The chalienge reduced Bird to tears
before they made their first delivery.
The partners worked through the
California Apparel Mart in Los
Angeles, a building which has about
2000 fashion showrooms and does some
SUS2O billion a year in sales.
“We just wanted a little bit of that,”
says Bird. It meant doing a lot of
doorknocking and footslogging before
Bird and Bradley were able to find
space in a showroom, appoint a repre-
sentative and start making deliveries.
Back home in Noosa, it has meant
expanding the business, building a new
factory and providing employment for
local women to make the appliqued
sweaters and sports clothes that have
put Lee Bird’s label on many an Ameri-
can holidaymaker. The partners have 25
full-time employees and 35 part-time
knitters. It has been a bonus for the re-
sort.
BEVERLEY Buckley is immersed in
the business world. She works with
about 120 business firms throughout
Australia. She is constantly concerned
with the problems of business, from
finding supplies and finance to making
profits, yet she is not an orthodox execu-
tive.
Buckley is national co-ordinator for
Beverley Buckley: teaching children business skills
ANDRE MARTIN
Young Achievers Australia, a non-profit
organisation aimed at introducing
schoolchildren to the business world.
Her job is to liaise between the sponsor
businesses and the children.
Buckley may not, by ordinary cri-
teria, be in a profit-and-loss business
but, as another executive says: “It takes
a lot of marketing and financial skills to
run Young Achievers.”
Most essential are the skills required
to persuade some of Australia’s biggest
businesses to spend time and money on
an exercise which has no tangible re-
sults. Executives from the companies
give their time to helping groups of stu-
dents from Year 11 set up and run pro-
totype businesses.
Buckley has a small Sydney staff and
committees in other states to help co-or-
dinate the program.
She joined the organisation three
years ago when 48 groups with about
600 students were being co-ordinated
from Sydney. The number of groups has
grown to 120, with 2200 students, and is
operating in all mainland states.
Buckley says: “We convince com-
panies to get involved in the programs
because it not only gives young people
an idea of what the business world is
about but also helps the company
executives get a clearer idea of business
themselves. Everything is done on a vol-
untary basis. Executives from the spon-
sor companies give two hours a week,
outside business hours, while school-
children are invited to participate
also outside school hours.
“We train the students in the basic
principles of running an organisation,
making and selling a product and then
let them go.
“They form their own company, with
all the pseudo-legal require-
ments involved, then raise
capital a limit of $4OO by
selling shares of $2 each. They
buy their raw materials, set up
production lines, start inven-
tory controls, payroll regis-
ters, even security devices.
Then they have to market
their product. At the end of
the year, they write a report.
Then they liquidate the com-
pany and sell up their shares.
So far, 80 percent of the com-
panies have returned a
profit.”
It is not make-believe, nor
is it a game for the students.
Last year, for example, IBM
sponsored one group whose
company produced furry
hedgehogs, which they sold.
Buckley was an Economics
teacher at Ravenswood Sec-
ondary College in Sydney but
left because she was looking
for something broader. She

had done some advertising and public
relations with Mark Foys, as well as
working for the Department of Trade in
London in the early 60s. After she had
married and had three children, she
went into teaching from 1971 to 1980
and left because it was not satisfying
enough: “The kids were lacking in
goals. They were very passive and I felt
we were teaching them the wrong
things. That’s probably why I ended up
in Young Achievers.”
DI CULLEN remembers local farmers
laughing when she began planting vines
in 1971 on the 800-ha sheep and cattle
property she runs with her husband in
the Margaret River area of Western
Australia.
But there’s little sniggering these
days. Margaret River is a new premium
wine-growing region and Cullens
among its top-ranking wineries.
Di Cullen knew nothing of grape-
growing or wine-making when she
planted the first vines. She was also
supervising the farm’s day-to-day run-
ning husband Kevin is a full-time
general practitioner at Busselton rais-
ing their six children and practising
part-time as a physiotherapist.
Her long appreciation of wine was
spurred by a friend, Dr John Glad-
stones, an agricultural scientist who be-
lieved that Margaret River’s special
micro-climate wet winters with long,
warm but not overly-hot summers
was ideal for growing high-quality
grapes.
“I’ve always liked drinking wine, I
had wine-makers as friends, I read
books, attended seminars and travelled
I made several trips to France,” she
says.
Her first wines, about 100 dozen
bottles of cabernet sauvignon and rhine
riesling, were made in 1974. She since
has overseen much more extensive
planting, and had built a handsome
stone complex which hosts an average
70 visitors daily for cellar-door sales
and tastings.
She produces between 5000 and 7000
dozen bottles a year, depending on the
season, selling from the winery and di-
rectly to retailers.
In the early days, Cullen relied con-
siderably on the help of agricultural
scientist Dr Bruce Allen and wine-
maker Mike Peterkin. It was during the
association with Allen that Cullens won
its first major trophy, at the 1977 nation-
al wine show in Canberra, for a rhine
riesling.
She has established a reputation as
one of the premier makers of sauvignon
blanc, produced 1981 and 1982
cabernets which earned top points at the
Melbourne Show for any cabernet, any
class, and more recently two outstand-
ing chardonnays. □
CHESS
Game, net and match
by Terrey Shaw
MOST opponents display a singular
disinclination to being checkmated. To
win a game, one usually must first
whittle away at the enemy’s position by
winning material, before going for the
throat with the final coup de grace.
An important tactical device which
helps to win material is the net. A piece
is netted when it is threatened and can-
not avoid capture (checkmate is a
special type of net).
A common example of a net which
can occur right at the start of the game is
seen in the Sicilian Defence after the
moves 1. P-K4 P-QB4 2. N-KB3 N-QB3
3. B-N5 P-QR 3. If White now decides
not to capture the Knight but to retain
this option by 4. B-R4? then his Bishop
gets netted by 4 ... P-QN4! 5. B-N3 P-
85.
This particular motif of encircling
the unfortunate Bishop occurs quite
often in similar positions, and goes by
the rather quaint name of the Noah’s
Ark Trap.
So, be warned. Whenever you are
about to move a piece to a particular
square, it will often save embarrassment
if you take a second to check that if
attacked, it has an escape route.
Your Queen is particularly prone to
being netted. Being your most valuable
piece, when attacked she must find a
square which is not threatened by any
opposing unit (except for the enemy
Queen, if your Queen’s escape square is
protected by one of your pieces).
For this reason, tactical ploys to net
the Queen are a common feature of the
game. They will often involve a surprise
sacrifice as the booty is worth the
equivalent of nine pawns, she is worth a
little berley.
The following game from the final
round of the recent USSR v The Rest of
the World match is a good example.
Alexander Beliavsky made it game, net
and match for the Soviets when he
netted Bent Larsen’s Queen with a clev-
er combination starting from the dia-
gram position.

NOT ALL PEIIGEOTS WORK 9 TO 5.
The Peugeot STI is a
beautifully mannered Monday
to Friday car.
It’s luxurious, safe and very
comfortable.
But on Saturday, all it
needs is a set of race stickers.
And you could rally the
Simpson or the Snowy.
That’s because the STI is a
Peugeot.
And for decades Peugeots
have made cars so tough, the
name is legend.
YourSTl’s suspension
smoothes over Pitt Street
potholes because it’s
engineered to swallow Swahili
creek beds.
The steering won’t panic at
the sight of a wet expressway
because it's designed to control
skids in Moroccan mud.
When you’re in a hurry to
make a meeting the STl’s 2.2
litre engine will get you from the
lights to 100 in just 10.5
seconds.
When you have to brake in
a hurry to miss the neighbour’s
cat you’ll stop fast and true
because the four wheel disc
brakes were specified to avoid
the odd aardvark or armadillo.
If this ad makes you want
to leap into an STI and win the
African Rally Championship,
you’re a few months too late.
The STI is the current
African Rally Champion.
However, your local
Peugeot dealer will let you take
a brand new STI for a test drive.
And you won’t have to
drive far to find potholes, wet
expressways or traffic lights.
Call your nearest Peugeot
dealer. Or write for a free
brochure.

SPECIAL REPORT
Uganda after Amin -killing goes on
Anti-government troops show remains said to be those of people who died in mass killings
By WILLIAM PIKE
AT NIGHT, the Ugandan capital Kam-
pala is a frightening place. Gunfire rings
out from time to time in the darkness.
Few people venture on to the streets. As
a British expatriate told me: “Some-
times it sounds like a small war out
there.”
For five nights I waited for the con-
tacts I hoped would lead me out into the
bush to meet anti-government guerillas
and to investigate atrocities allegedly
carried out by government troops. It
was a nerve-wracking period. A police-
man flagged down a car I was in one
night, brandished a rifle and demanded
cigarettes and money before he allowed
us to drive on.
Our car was stopped at a police road
block as we attempted to leave the town
on another occasion. Three guerillas
with me were arrested, but were released
the next morning after payment of a
75,000 shilling bribe about $250.
Finally, it was decided that I should
walk out of Kampala.
In the moonlight, I was led by a
guide to a small camp Bkm outside the
suburbs. There we picked up an escort
of six armed men and began a swift
march through the desolate area north
of Kampala. Roads had returned to
bush and mud houses had gaping holes
where doors, shutters and tin roofs had
been stolen.
People still live in this wilderness but
they are hiding deep in the bush. Their
fields, which once provided matoke
(green banana) for Kampala and coffee
and cotton for export, remain unculti-
vated. Beneath the mango trees, the fruit
rots on the ground. This fertile farmland
was the richest area of Uganda.
In the morning, we arrived at a large
camp where hundreds of soldiers of the
National Resistance Army (NRA) are
based. Hidden deep in a forest luxuriant
with creepers and undergrowth, Task
Force, the front line zonal unit of the
NRA, is well concealed. Its only en-
trance is a tortuous, swampy path.
Despite my exhaustion, I was not al-
lowed into the camp until I had been
identified and searched. Here I found
my escort of 50 armed men.
Later on in my 10-day visit I saw
larger camps including one called
Eduardo Mondlane, near Semuto,
where there must have been 1000 people
many of them soldiers but also medi-
cal staff, civilian supporters, govern-
ment army prisoners and political offi-
cers of the National Resistance Council.
In all the camps I visited, military
discipline was strict.
Ragged soldiers stood often sharply
to attention in the presence of their su-
periors and well-camouflaged trenches
surrounded the camps. Basic hygiene
was maintained carefully and little
drinking or womanising took place.
Morale appeared to be high, both
among the officer class mostly young
intellectuals and former career soldiers
in the government army and among
the ranks who are mostly young
peasants from Buganda and Ankole.
A war of resistance has been pro-
ceeding in the Buganda area since elec-
tions in December 1980 returned Milton
Obote and his Uganda People’s Con-
gress to power. Leading the resistance is


The remains of a Ugandan couple shot after their house had been ransacked
Yoweri Museveni, once Minister of De-
feace in the coalition government that
succeeded Idi Amin. Museveni believed
that the elections were rigged and the
Democratic Party should have won. He
took to the bush two months later.
Museveni has become a mythical fig-
ure in Uganda. His name is never men-
tioned by the government and ordinary
people will talk only of “Sunday” or
“two-plus-five” code for Mu-seven-i.
Apocryphal stories circulate of how he
has eluded the army dressed as beggar
or businessman. Some peasants ascribe
miraculous powers to him.
But he is a real person. I met him in
an NRA camp concealed beneath the
scrub and thorn trees of the savannah
160 km north of Kampala. Now 40
years old, the once-skinny Museveni
has put on weight and hides his bald-
ness beneath an army cap. His parents,
members of the pastoralist Bahima clan
of the Ankole, belonged to a revivalist
church and Museveni still burns with an
almost missionary zeal for politics. He
neither smokes nor drinks and the
greatest compliment he can pay is to
call someone “serious.” Most African
leaders he dismisses as “not serious.”
He is not an adroit politician and is
apparently a poor orator. But he is a
gifted military commander who inspires
strong loyalty among his troops. He
fought with the liberation group
Frelimo in Mozambique but learned his
strategy from the textbooks of Mao Tse-
tung, Giap and Clausewitz. His greatest
admiration is reserved for the cautious
Montgomery.
“He was a scientific general,” says
Museveni.
He expresses confidence about the
war he is waging. “We have the capacity
to overthrow Obote. All we lack is
supplies,” he told me.
In particular, there is a shortage of
ammunition for a sustained offensive.
“Our movement has no outside sup-
port,” Museveni insisted. “If we had,
Obote would not be in power now.”
Uganda exiles have provided finan-
cial support and a Libyan training
scheme was wound up only late last
year.
The NRA wants peace talks and a
national government. Peasants still
back the guerillas, despite three years of
fighting which has devastated the re-
gion. Those we met consistently offered
water, fruit, information or greetings to
the guerillas when they passed.
Both the guerillas and peasants were
anxious to lead me to the sites of what
they said were army atrocities.
Estimates of killings alleged to have
taken place inside Uganda have varied
widely and it would be impossible to
put a firm figure on the total. From the
grisly evidence I saw during piy 10-day
journey, I can only confirm that horrific
massacres have occurred.
I was shown five dumping grounds
which held the remains of perhaps 2000
bodies. But that is a guess. How does
one count bleached bones and
decomposing bodies pulled apart by
animals and overgrown by bush? Half a
dozen times we passed human remains
on the roadside. Some had been there
for months; others were only weeks old.
More important, perhaps, than the
physical evidence was the testimony of
civilians and former government troops
members of the Uganda National
Liberation Army (UNLA). The small
town of Kapeka in Luwero district was
occupied for more than a year by
UNLA troops from Bomba barracks,
until an NRA attack on June 2 this year.
Several civilians and one UNLA de-
serter told me that the killings there
took place when the UNLA in-
terrogated the thousands of peasants
who were living in Kapeka on the food
aid distributed by the Red Cross.
The face of the enemy: a portrait of President


Obote in an NRA camp
Troops who escorted the author and photographer Frank Spooner during their visit to Uganda
Corporal Jackson Kekikomo, an
UNLA deserter, was stationed in
Kapeka for two months in 1983. “Intel-
ligence officers identified people in the
town thought to be NRA supporters,”
he said, “especially young boys and
men. On some days, 200 civilians were
questioned and only about 10 survived.
But killing did not continue at this rate.
I personally saw perhaps 500 killed be-
fore I ran back to barracks and hid
without going on parade.”
I visited the house where the killings
and interrogation allegedly took place.
It was covered with UNLA graffiti and
in one room I found blood and faeces
smeared on the walls. Outside were
poorly-laid-out defensive trenches and
a discarded army water carrier.
Kekikomo then led us to two
dumping grounds nearby. In a coffee
shamba (field) I saw the remains of per-
haps 100 bodies largely overgrown by
bush. Bones and decomposing bodies at
another site were scattered over an area
of almost a hectare. There might have
been the remains of 1000 bodies there. I
was told that another eight such sites
were around Kapeka.
I saw another three dumping
grounds in Mpigi district. Near Matuga
village, 30 bodies had recently been
executed by panga (machete) and near
Sanga many skulls and bones were vis-
ible in the tall elephant grass on two
sites. Close by, I found an old couple
who had been gunned down and their
home ransacked.
The worst killing grounds are sup-
posedly close to the field headquarters
of UNLA units. Besides Kapeka, the
most notorious of these places are
Masulita and Kakiri in Mpigi district,
Luwero and Kakogi in Luwero district,
and Kiboga in Mubende district.
Kaaya’s farm, 80km from Kampala on
the Bombo road, is reputed to have 3000
bodies but may have been bulldozed.
I also have an incomplete list of 35
sites where the guerillas say there are
many bodies. The government has re-
stricted access to these areas for diplo-
matic and aid workers.
Calculations can give a rough guide.
There were 1,600,000 people in
Luwero, Mpigi and Mubende in 1979.
Large portions of these districts are
virtually empty now. One guerilla esti-
mate is that in the Luwero triangle, a
third of the population is in hiding, a
third dead and a third has moved away.
Museveni says: “We estimate
300,000 people have died throughout
Uganda since 1981. People have died in
Masaka, Mbarara and West Nile al-
though there has been no war there.”
Published human rights organisation es-
timates of 100,000 to 200,000 now seem
plausible.
Some of these killings, such as a
massacre at Namugongo in May, have
been indiscriminate reprisals by the
army following guerilla attacks. But, ac-
cording to some informants, some are
part of a deliberate strategy.
Private Fastine Itadal, formerly in
the 15th battalion Masindi, was
captured by the NRA in February and
told me: “We have been given orders to
kill anything living human beings,
cows, dogs, hens. This is called scorched
earth.”
Private James Kwatampora of the
15th battalion Masindi said he had had
“express orders to kill all human beings
and loot all property” in a 1982 raid in
West Nile.
Museveni is assumed by the West to
be fighting to establish a Marxist state.
“I have never said Uganda should be
run as a socialist or communist
country,” he maintains. He believes in a
mixed economy based on production by
peasants and the middle classes. He says
he is not hostile to foreign interest and
adds: “What 1 quarrel with is terms.” □

ARCHITECTURE
Seidler’s marvel of technology
Grosvenor Place superimposed on the Sydney skyline: here, there and everywhere the view will be terrific
By JOHN STACKHOUSE
IN THE RUN-UP to the bi-centenary,
Sydney will watch the rapid growth of
one of Australia’s biggest city buildings,
the $l6O million Grosvenor Place tower.
Just as its architect, Harry Seidler,
draws controversy so will Grosvenor
Place attract superlatives.
The 44 storeys will each offer 2000
square metres of floor space, the largest
unpillared single-floor area in the city.
The location, fronting George Street
and just behind Grosvenor Street (hence
the name) makes it the landmark gate-
way to the re-development of the Rocks
on the western side of Circular Quay.
With this position and its height, it will
command some of the best views in
Sydney.
Furthermore, the tower will be Aus-
tralia’s most technologically advanced
office building. It also marks the begin-
ning of a new generation of high-rise
commercial centres which are beginning
to emerge in Tokyo, Hong Kong, the
United States and Toronto.
But above all, it seems set to be a
commercial winner. There is a good
chance virtually all of its space will be
committed to major tenants before
Grosvenor Place opens in March 1987.
Ken Morgan, of Richard Ellis, and
Brian Challon, of Baillieu Hardie
Gorman (two of the three agents hand-
ling the building) are confident that
even at this stage they each have two
major clients who will sign up for a
whole floor.
Both men say the best selling points
are the huge, single-floor areas and the
prestige location. “A touch of genius,”
Morgan says of the design. “I’m amazed
and pleased at the response we’re get-
ting,” Challon chips in.
“It’s an exceptional building,” agrees
Chris Brown, of Jones Lang Wooton,
the third agent for the project.
For Seidler, who gave Sydney two of
its most distinctive towers (Australia


MAX DUPAIN
How Grosvenor
Place’s sunshields
will make the best
use of the sun without
impairing the view
Square and the MLC
Centre) the commercial
success of his Grosvenor
Place project will be a wel-
come accolade after a re-
cent, bruising defeat in a
well-publicised defamation
case.
As he sees it, the el-
ements of the building
were the location and its two sweeps of
view; in the northerly quadrant the Har-
bor, from Seidler’s earlier Blues Point
apartment building west of the bridge to
the heads, with the Opera House on
centre stage on the other side, and to the
south-west, the cityscape across Darling
Harbor to Botany Bay. To this came the
commercial imperative of size and the
wish by the major investor, the Com-
monwealth Superannuation Fund In-
vestment Trust, for long-term owner-
ship. Another factor, because of the
huge sums of money involved, was to
design in a way which would allow for
Harry Seidler
DAVID MOORE
fast construction. The de-
sign concept Seidler came
up with is the shape of two
hands, cupped as in pray-
er. The curve of the fingers
forms the facades facing
the north-east and south-
west; the space between
the palms holds the central
service core. It is
stunningly simple and symbolises se-
curity.
Seidler described how the concept
grew in his mind: “You know you have
to get on that site a floor space of 2000
square metres and up to a set height
limit. You take into account that people
don’t want to see a great big hulk of a
building and certainly not two struc-
tures (the original concept of Sydney’s
Rocks Authority).
“Somebody’s still got the first sketch
I did on a small sheet of paper. It recog-
nises the feature of the site, the fantastic
view around. That way it’s terrific, it’s
terrific here again and behind it’s terrific
also. The sweep of view helped fit such a
huge building on to the site.
“The form means I can build fast,
unusually fast. A shape is useless unless
it lends itself to a repetitive solution.
“Knowing that vast sums of money
are involved, a cycle of four or five days
a floor is essential if the building is to be
economically viable.”
The combination of long-term own-
ership and the huge size of the building
allowed Seidler and his engineering as-
sociates to develop the technology of
the building.
It reflects concerns about energy
saving and the operating cost savings
that result from it.
Passively, Grosvenor Place is
shielded from the heat and glare of the
summer by double-glazed exteriors and
a system of sunshields that change angle
around the building. The shields are
pitched to block the hot midday sun but
at the same time not to intrude on the


view through the floor-to-ceiling glass
walls.
Seidler has also chosen a highly
efficient lighting system that cuts power
usage considerably and also lessens
internal temperatures.
And in the basement, he has chosen
an off-peak air-conditioning plant that
makes ice and chills water at low night
rates (the same scale some domestic hot-
water heaters use). Other heat ex-
changers, using in part energy from so-
lar collectors on the roof and the waste
heat from the building’s garages, its
computer installations and its inhabi-
ants, provide heating requirements such
as hot water.
The technology brings together the
passive energy saving factors of the
double-glazing and the sun-shields, the
active energy contribution of heat
which would normally go to waste and
the storage capabilities for hot and cold
services to achieve further benefits. One
is that the power load of Grosvenor
Place is smoothed down from the nor-
mal daytime peaks and night troughs,
which means not only a cost saving but
also that it becomes possible to provide
complete back-up emergency power
units at an economic cost.
Other technological innovations in-
clude provision for a roof satellite
antenna with feeds cabled through all
the office space and power systems
which allow at least one color video ter-
minal to every two inhabitants in the
building.
Both are features which excite the
major service industries such as finance,
accountancy and lawyers who are the
target market for a building of this type.
The agents see Grosvenor Place as a
natural for large national head offices,
which look for big floor areas and will
want the communications and the com-
puter facilities. The single-floor area
also allows efficient layouts for large
numbers of staff.
The technical features are costly. But
Seidler says a long-term investor is pre-
pared to pay the capital sums required
because of the long-term savings. Also,
in a big building, the services cost pro-
portionately less than they would in a
smaller one.
“This is a big building and it’s one
where the key to the investment is that
the client wanted a permanent com-
modity that he is going to keep and
own,” Seidler said. “That’s a criterion
that is almost never clearly spelled out.
A client who will make a commitment is
rare. And because they want to hold on
to it, the long-term effect of the major
investment such as this energy saving
plant or that device becomes feasible.”
He says the technology as such is not
new. “It’s known in the meat industry
and the food industry,” he said. “It
saves us re-inventing the wheel. It’s
proven and we’re extending it to the
building industry.”
To the members of the team, inclu-
ding the engineers and his site archi-
tects, Seidler is invariably referred to as
“The Architect.”
“Architecture is somehow not made
for committee decisions,” he agrees.
“The critical thing is to have a clear di-
rection and a clear methodology which
is fundamentally seated in reason.
There is a logical approach to things
and you arrive at that by a process of
elimination to the point where it be-
comes so obvious it is inevitable.
“You can then persuade the whole
team to pick up this thing and go with it
and also to take on creatively different
aspects of it.
“You need effective teamwork, a lot
of people pulling in the same direction,
convinced about the same aims which in
turn have to be clear cut and solvable
and incorporate obvious solutions.
“If they are ill-orientated, then it
flounders because people get into dead-

“Bill, we’ve got to start

end streets and start changing every-
thing.”
Seidler is nothing if not sure. When
he works out his solutions he is pre-
pared to fight to clear obstacles put in
his path.
His first Australian building, a home
for his parents, involved a battle with
the local council. And that was back in
1948 when Seidler came to Australia,
started practising and stayed.
Now 61, he is still the power-house
that he was when he came to Sydney for
a visit after completing an education
that began in Vienna, included univer-
sity in Canada and a period at Harvard
studying under Professor Walter
Gropius. It also included a spell at
Black Mountain College in North
Carolina, which was likened in the 40s
and 50s to “an artistic thinktank.” It in-
cluded noted writers, poets, musicians
and designers.
In many ways he seems indifferent to
Australia and attacks many of our
values. He says Australia remains geo-
graphically isolated. It lacks a “hot bed
of development” among the major
eductional institutions. As a result, Aus-
tralia’s attitudes are “far more rigid and
conservative” about institutional things.
“The average person lives in a late
19th century way visually,” he says.
“The things they have around them are
really quite fossilised, turn-of-the-cen-
tury models.”
Seidler’s architecture, not merely his
city buildings but also the Australian
Embassy in Paris and the new Hong
Kong Club building, he believes have
put us on the world’s cultural map.
His confidence to the point of ab-
rasiveness and his international style
have led to criticism in Australia. Some
he ignores as not being worthy; at other
times he goes to law.
Most recently was the celebrated
libel action against Sydney cartoonist
Patrick Cook, who in 1982 drew a sor-
did, boxy vision of units for the aged
and describing it as the “Harry Seidler
retirement park.”
He lost this action in the NSW
Supreme Court, in which he was
represented by his brother-in-law Clive
Evatt Jr.
Figuratively lined up behind Cook in
the court were Australian writers and
broadcasters. Cook said he drew his car-
toon because he believed Seidler build-
ings were ugly, induced claustrophobia
and were severely functional. Seidler
said the cartoon had sickened him.
Evatt told the court the cartoon had
been taken literally and had led to a
fall-off in Seidler’s home-design work.
Cook’s counsel Neil McPhee, QC, said
the issue was: “Do we want to stop or
inhibit the cartoonists in this commu-
nity?”
The legal clash and the line-up in
court exposed some major conflicts in
Australia culture. Cook said he was
condemning what he saw as big ugly
buildings replacing the traditional ones.
Seidler, who says he is appealing the
verdict, has always been bitterly critical
of what he refers to as Australia’s “19th
century values.”
In reality, Cook’s Australia and
Seidler’s Australia cannot be
reconciled. Ironically, nowhere will
they come closer than the new
Grosvenor Place tower, guarding the
gateway to the mish-mash of colonial
buildings that makes the Rocks district
one of Australia’s most colorful places.
The new tower will undoubtedly add
to Seidler’s reputation here and inter-
nationally. But, according to all the
agents now marketing Grosvenor Place,
Seidler’s name is not a strong point in
selling.
However his ideas and concepts are.
They have proved a commercial, techni-
cal and artistic success. For Seidler,
could there be better proof? □

Animal-fanciers tend to forget par-
ticularly at a time when they are urging
zoo-keepers to turn all their beasts out
to run free in the bush that zoos such
as Sydney’s Taronga Park involve fish,
too. Messrs John West Foods, the dis-
tinguished fish-canners, plan to help
Taronga Park develop a marine life pro-
tection zone on the shores of Sydney
Harbor and last week West’s managing
director Barry Browning sent the head
aquarium-keeper off to study 14 world-
famous aquariums. He was just the boy:
his name is John West.
Mike Agostini, the publisher, fresh-air
fiend and full-time hypochondriac he
has had roughly five heart attacks a
week for the past 20 years already has
a shop in Dee Why, NSW, selling take-
away West Indian curries and plans to
open others in Perth and Cairns. As
honorary consul for his native Trinidad
and for Tobago, Agostini would be
pretty slack if he did nothing to make
things comfortable for the West Indian
cricketers when they arrive this year. As
a hypochondriac he’s doing the right
thing, too: if one of those incandescent
West Indian curries doesn’t give the av-
erage Australian a heart attack, nothing
will.
In the Japanese language, “turuko”
means literally Turkey and colloquially
a Turkish bath; and Turkish bath means
about as much bath as “massage
parlor,” in English, usually means mas-
sage. Invited to Japan after winning a
Japanese speech contest, Turkish stu-
dent Nusret Sanjakli told Health Minis-
ter Kozo Watanabe this misuse of the
word was a slur on national honor. The
minister promised a campaign to
change use of the word tourists
should take note but not status of the
bathhouses, tolerated by police.
It had been years since people in NSW,
Victoria, SA or Queensland had heard
the term Eastern States used to describe
their location. Queenslanders referred
to the Southern States or Southerners
(in northern Queensland the latter
means anyone from south of Towns-
ville; in far northern Queensland it’s
anyone south of Weipa). But in the West
they like to cling to the rules. John Hall-
Freeman, opening The Space Merchants
and the Science Fiction and Fantasy
Hall of Fame in Perth, confessed that a
lot of his stuff came from not only the
United States and the United Kingdom
but also from as far away as the Eastern
States which means Sydney, Mel-
bourne or, indeed, anywhere else.


Elizabeth Escolme Schmidt met a lot of
scepticism when she first suggested
holding an annual lunch at which
women of achievement could meet.
There would be too many problems,
people said, including the problem of
preventing it becoming just another gos-
sipy society function. Undeterred, and
encouraged by the success of the
Women of the Year lunch successfully
held every year in Britain, Schmidt went
ahead and invited women of achieve-
ment to an Australian version. On
October 19, the 10th anniversary
Women of the Year Luncheon will be
held at Noah’s Lakeside Hotel in Can-
berra. Each year, hundreds of women
who have made a mark in their particu-
lar fields of endeavor have met in capi-
tals around Australia. Special anniver-
sary guests will include Professor Dame
Leonie Kramer, Dame Roma Mitchell
and Dr Anne Summers. Oh, and
Elizabeth Escolme Schmidt, a former
teacher and air hostess and now a gra-
zier’s wife and mother embarking on a
university degree and looking to start
another career in publishing soon.
In Vancouver, where he is making a
movie with Tom Selleck, Kiss guitarist
Gene Simmons described the difference
between filming and rocking: “In the
movies you’ve got to have much shorter
hair. This is the first time I’ve seen my
ears since 1969.”
Where on Earth will it all end? Is
there no limit to the possibilities of
journalism? Roger Covell is known best
as the big-deal music reviewer of The
Sydney Morning Herald but since 1973
he has been an associate professor of
Music at the University of NSW.
Donald Horne is, of course, the dis-
tinguished republican; but from Packer-
style journalism he moved to writing
books and he, too, in 1981, became an
asst prof in Political Science; then it
was chairman of the faculty of Arts and,
early this year, chairman-designate of
the Australia Council. Now, from the
Fairfax and Packer stables respectively,
they are both full-blown profs at the
same university.
There is no way the nursing home will
come the way of the irrepressible enter-
tainment baron Lord Lew Grade. In
Sydney last week for the launch of the
film Champions, the 77-year-old
declared between puffs of his havana:
“I’m never going. I’ve publicly declared
I’m not retiring until the year 2000 but
I’m considering a continuation of that.”
In the fashion of Mohammad Ali in his
heyday, Grade continued: “I’ve got a
miracle build like nobody else has got
and I've got the blood pressure of a
youth ... my blood rejects infection.”
The charleston champion of the 1920 s
proved the point at a function at the
Sheraton Wentworth after the gala
premiere. Stockbroker Rene Rivkin
ventured $lOOO to see Lord Lew dance.
His charleston was lively and the pro-
ceeds went to The Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children.
A couple of weeks ago it was Kamahl,
the singer, who was happy to acknowl-
edge that a buck was a buck no matter
where you earned it (his engagements
ranging from Carnegie Hall to Las
Vegas to the Epping, NSW, RSL club).
For some reason Kamahl has been sold
short by others in the biz. Possibly all
that will change. Googie Withers and
John McCallum, among the biggest
deals on the boards, return from Britain
next month to tour in the Ted Willis
play Stardust. The tour will be New-
castle (Civic Theatre), Tweed Heads
(Twin Towns Services Club) and
Kogarah (St George Leagues Club).
A little-known fact about Russia’s long-
serving Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko is that he rather fancies busty
American corrine Dolly Parton. He is
said to have a collection of her records
and tries to catch her performances
when he finds himself in the same city.
Which is why, possibly, Dolly hasn’t
had a gig in Washington recently.
The indefatigable sports broadcaster
Norman May got behind the campaign
of the Better Vision Institute at the
launch of the National Eyecare Cam-
paign in Sydney. That was fair enough,
too: May, who has been big in broad-

the way the audience sees it owes his
skill to having eyesight and vision prob-
lems detected and corrected properly.

They are definitely not married just

that Fawcett is pregnant with twins.
At the American Film Festival in
Deauville, France, she let the cameras
flash over her famous figure and then
put her equally-celebrated teeth to work
with an ivoried scoff. “Twins!” she said.
“I wouldn’t have twins with anyone.”

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
The other Marconi’s marvellous miracle
YOU MUST appreciate there are some
things which go deep into the Austra-
lian ethos Vegemite, eucalyptus oil
and goanna fat. Australians far from
home start to get nervous and frantic
when they can’t get these mysterious
elixirs and potions.
I am thinking right now of the
famous Iguana Brand Goanna Salve, an
incredible unguent which I have used
with remarkable success since I was a
small child. Footballers use it and every
year in Victoria we have an agonising
bicycling event similar to the Tour de
France called the Sun Tour. The
pedallists swear the only thing that
keeps the knees going is the famous
Iguana Brand Goanna Salve.
One is telling you all this because the
current owner of Iguana is a young
gentleman named Euan Murdoch.
Murdoch, who lives in Brisbane, calls
himself the Great Goanna and he even
sends out mail on notepaper which
says: “From the desk of the Great
Goanna.” Recently, I made a point of
seeking him out.
When I was a child every tin of
Goanna Salve carried a picture of a
goanna superimposed on a map of Aus-
tralia: “Two shillings and ninepence a
tin ... cures rheumatism, lumbago, sci-
atica, infantile paralysis, eczema, ca-
tarrh, ulcers, sore legs, piles, etc, etc.” I
was pleased to note that Murdoch
looked clear-eyed and fit without a trace
of rheumatism, eczema, catarrh, ulcers,
etc, etc.
Murdoch explained that Goanna
Salve was first produced by Joseph
Cornelius Marconi at Bulimba, Bris-
bane, in 1910. He said Marconi was a
marvellous, flamboyant figure who wore
a diamond-studded pin in the shape of
an iguana in his tie.
Of course I knew the story well. Back
in the old days every tin of salve would
come with an extraordinary pamphlet
which stated that J. C. Marconi learned
the ingredients for Goanna Salve from
the late Professor Morrisey, who spent
years in the bush among snake experts,
where he devised this mysterious com-
pound for combating the bites of
snakes.
A way was needed for introducing
this compound into the blood without
cutting the flesh, so Marconi found the
unbelievable power of goanna oil.
“According to legend,” said
Murdoch, “it could even ooze through
glass. We get letters now from people
claiming this is true. I had a letter from
Things uniquely Australian
a character who said he was quite ready
to accept that goanna oil would go
through a porcelain cup.”
J. C. Marconi died in 1922. Come
1982 Goanna Salve was still in the
hands of two of his four daughters, who
could no longer cope. So Murdoch, who
had a business which dealt in dental and
veterinary supplies, took over.
Ah, but did it really contain goanna
oil?.One had a feeling of sympathy for
all the poor innocent goannas. “Yes,”
said Euan, “in the old days it did.
Marconi got most of his oil from north-
ern NSW.
“Goannas all thrived best in dry
weather, in times of drought. They
would live off the carcasses of other ani-
mals. Marconi used to pay seven shil-
lings and sixpence a pint. A six foot
goanna would produce a pint and a
half.”
Thereupon he explained the scien-
tific method by which the bushies ob-
tained their oil.
“Take a piece of galvanised iron and
angle it at 45 degrees to the sun. Place
your goanna fat on the iron and*as it
melts in the heat it runs down into a
strategically placed billy.”
But as time went on, he said, there
was barely the whiff of a goanna’s tail in
the salve, then none at all.
Now it depended on its wonderful,
natural bush ingredients.
As anyone with even a
mild sense of smell could
guess, the top ingredient is
eucalyptus oil and when you
have just cured yourself of
nasal catarrh, dandruff, ath-
lete’s foot or even more sensi-
tive complaints, it is quite sur-
prising how people notice
your presence in the room.
Murdoch says Goanna
Salve is going famously. He
has a US firm very keen to
start marketing it. It will prob-
ably take another year to get
things organised. The Food &
Drug Administration will
have to be convinced of all its
therapeutic charms.
They are very excited
about it in Japan. The
Japanese, of course, are agog
about frilled lizards and they
find it hard to pick the differ-
ence.
He had a wonderful tele-
gram recently from the King
of Tonga. The king, who is a
large gentleman, fell down some stairs
and his knee swelled to grand propor-
tions. He was on the point of flying to
New Zealand for medical help when his
staff suggested applying Goanna Salve.
According to His Majesty, next morn-
ing his knee was back to normal. He
wired Brisbane for four dozen bottles.
I’m not entirely pleased with
Murdoch’s firm. The salve comes in the
traditional round red tin. That’s okay.
But the linament comes in a disgusting-
ly common white plastic bottle, utterly
out of keeping with its great bush tra-
dition. Perhaps they were having
trouble with the goanna oil oozing
through the glass.
Murdoch just hopes that should they
wish to give pseudonyms to any other
likely candidates in the Costigan Re-
port, well there is an infinite variety of
other Australian creatures echidna,
koala, lyre bird, emu, platypus, wombat.
D. H. Lawrence made great use, you
will remember, of Kangaroo. He was a
thin-faced fellow with glasses, whose
eyes were uncommonly close together.
Kangaroo saw himself as a superior be-
ing, the one who should apply a benev-
olent but firm dictatorship to the entire
country. In short he wanted to put Aus-
tralia in his pouch.
Have you noticed any Kangaroos
around? □


How to be a polished chairman
PHILLIP ADAMS
MEETINGS have been much on my
mind of late meetings that fill one’s
diary and one’s life. From womb to
tomb, from birth to earth, meetings,
meetings, meetings.
Mostly, I go to sleep in them. I try
my best to stay awake but, little by little,
the eyelids close. I can feign concentra-
tion for a while by resting forehead on
hands but it’s hard to pretend that you
are concentrating when you topple for-
ward and put your nose in your coffee.
Every month, I’m expected to attend
a board meeting of my company where
the finance director gives me a copy of
the balance sheet. Being innumerate, I
can’t make head nor tail of them. (Some
years ago, Bruce Petty told me how to
cope: “Simply hold the papers up and
frown, looking slowly from your left
thumb to your right thumb.”) Where-
upon I’m overwhelmed with ennui and
find myself stifling yawns.
So it has become my practice to col-
lapse on our boardroom couch, usually
retaining sufficient consciousness to
rouse myself should something really
important be discussed.
At our latest board meeting, I be-
came heavy-lidded around 2.30 and lay
on the couch for a few minutes while the
finance director intoned about the new
EDP system and its miraculous ability
to disgorge financial data. I awoke at
6pm. The boardroom was in total dark-
ness. My partners had completed the
agenda and, one by one, left the room. I
have no idea what was moved, sec-
onded, decided or rescinded. I was, for
all I know, victim of a palace revol-
ution.
MY FIRST big-time meetings were at
the Australia Council. Gough had ap-
pointed me foundation chairman of the
Film and TV Board, one of the council’s
seven constituent boards. We chairmen
were automatically council members,
along with illustrious generalists.
It was the duty of we chairmen to tell
the full council our House of Lords
what we had been up to; to seek ratifica-
tion, as it were. Well, the Film Board
was up to a lot of fairly radical things
and it did not seem right to worry the
council too much about it. For example,
much to Gough’s chagrin, I’d rushed off
and bought a cinema in Tasmania. I
wanted this to be the first in a chain of
government-owned cinemas around the
country which could be used to screen
the experimental films, documentaries
and low-budget features despised by the
cinema chains and shunned by our tele-
vision networks including the ABC.
But, in buying the cinema, I had
somewhat exceeded my powers. So,
rather than cause my distinguished as-
sociates anxiety, I didn’t really tell them
about it. Instead, I told a few jokes.
This technique worked so well that,
for the rest of my period as chairman, I
never told them anything. All the other
chairmen (sorry, chairpersons) would
report in tedious detail about their
boards’ activities, which provoked
equally tedious debate. But, when it
came to my turn, I’d shuffle my papers
and start making funnies. I still employ
the tactic.
The other thing which I learned at
the Australia Council about meetings
was how to insult people politely. There
was one member of the council with
whom I had a running battle, whose
contributions struck me as being asin-
ine. As soon as he opened his mouth, I
found myself torturing paper clips or
covering my blotter with obscene
doodles. And, as he went on and on, I
would become so enraged that I would
finish up trying to crawl over the board
table to strangle him.
One member of the council was a
legendary barrister. He took me aside
and explained that my rages were
counterproductive that I’d be well ad-
vised to learn a few courtroom tech-
niques. The first of these was to precede
any such attack with the words “with
respect.” This signalled that you had ab-
solutely no respect for the ratbag but
gave a good impression. And, if he
really got up your nose, to the point
where you wanted to stab him to death
with your ballpoint, you’d say “with the
greatest respect.” And, in the event of
wanting to put a drongo out of the 23rd
floor, you’d say “with the very greatest
respect.”
I have used that technique in meet-
ings ever since. It’s terribly civilised and
wonderfully lethal.
WHEN CHAIRING a meeting, one
feels a compulsion to amuse and enter-
tain one’s colleagues. I do this by acci-
dent from time to time.
I was recently chairing a meeting of
the Australian Film Commission whose
members are people of wit, intelligence,
talent and things like that.
Now, quite often, in the course of a
meeting, to stay alert I pull one of those
little face-wipers from my briefcase.
You know the sort of thing: They come
in foil envelopes which you tear open
and inside is a piece of folded paper
impregnated with eau de cologne.
Well, it had been a long day and I
was slowly going out of focus. So I
pulled out a little sachet that I had
found in my hotel room and applied it
to my visage. Seconds later, my face felt
very strange indeed as though
undergoing a Jekyll to Hyde transform-
ation ... Whereupon I looked down at
the little wrapper I had just torn open.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” I said,
“your beloved chairman wishes to min-
ute the fact that he’s just smeared his
face with boot polish.”
It was entirely coincidental that we
had just been discussing the AFC’s pos-
ition on Aboriginal film-making. But it
is such things which make me so sought-
after for government committees. □


'State of the art' fax
is here in two brilliant
new Ricoh machines
that are unsurpassed
for advanced facsimile
communication features.
At lost, every corporate or individual fax
requirement is catered for by one of these two
extraordinary machines.
There's the new Ricoh FX 5000 desk top - the
Ultimate fax machine. And the Ricoh FX 120 Ultra
Compact - the 'state of the art' mini that takes
the space of two telephone books, yet
outperforms others that take up half the office
and cost thousands more.
Incorporating the latest technology in their on-
board computers, these new Ricoh models
satisfy every corporate or individual fax
requirement superbly, giving you fax features
and quality that are quite simply the 'state of the
art’ in facsimile operation.
Read on.
And discover the features that make Ricoh the
the Redial function will automatically redial the
number twice at 5 minute intervals if the
receivers line is busy.
Naturally, no line charges are incurred until the
connection is made.
A 3 ability and Enlargement function
The FX 5000 can transmit originals up to A 3 size,
and can automatically reduce the transmitted
copy to a size requested by the receiving end.
"Send later" function
'State of the Art' Ricohfax can be programmed
for the unattended transmission of documents
when telephone charges are cheapest, creating
considerable savings on intra/inter state and
international transmissions.
And because staff don't have to wait back for
cheaper transmission times, the savings increase!
Sequential polling
Ricoh's advanced Sequential Polling Function
permits documents of up to 30 D 4 pages to be
received from up to 20 fax machine locations in
one programmed operation.
This programmed polling can be 'poll immedi-
ate', or on a 'poll later' basis to take advantage of
lower off peak telephone charges.
The master machine simply dials each location
number in sequence, triggering document
transmission.
Voice Request Key
The Voice Request Key activates the
conversation mode indicating that one party
wishes to speak to the other after sending the
document. Ideal for discussion of the transmitted
material without incurring the cost of a further
phone call.
Unattended Reception
Through a command from the transmitter, the
receiving side can be activated to accept
documents at any time, enabling the receipt of
important documents after hours.
TransmitterTerminai Identification (TTI)
The name, transmission time and date can be
automatically printed on the received copy,
enabling instant identification of the sender.

A joyful meeting with a true Friend...
RON SAW
A FEW months ago Dibbs Mather, the
actor-writer-broadcaster and one-time
delicatesseur, should there be such a
word, said to me, over a jug of malt:
“Would you like to do a book with
Donald Friend?”
“Eh?”
“A book. Would you like to do one
with Donald Friend?”
“How?”
“Oh, in the way it’s done mostly, I
suppose: you put words on paper, he
does illustrations. You put it all together
and a bloke called a publisher ...”
“Try not to be a howling
ass, there’s a good chap. What
makes you think Donald
Friend would want to do a
book with me?”
“He told me he would.”
“Eh!”
“Oh, for God’s sake, don’t
start that again. You sound
like a sheep.”
I suppose I must have. I
was feeling no less woolly.
After all, Donald Friend!
Bumbooziana, Hillendiana
and that thing about wildfowl
An Alphabet of Owls. He
seemed to work mostly with
people like Augustus John,
Cecil Rhodes, David McNicoll
people of that regal stripe. Good lord,
Bumbooziana had come out in a limited
edition at $9OO a copy and a few months
later was changing hands at $3OOO. (My
mind went spinning into limbo, into
Sybaris, and through translucent cloth
of gold I saw myself picking peeled
grapes from between the pink lips of
pouting houris, naked and feral, as
Lindsay used to paint them, pausing in
my dalliance only to fling handfuls of
maundy money to crowds of importu-
nate boors who were trying to sell me
Cadillacs, ivory and apes and pea-
cocks.)
Then I got hold of myself. The book,
I told myself, might make me no more
than a couple of hundred thousand, but
even that would do.
I remained insouciant, of course, but
quite by chance I found time, that after-
noon, to hurry to The Bulletin library
and make a slim collection of 30 or 40
pieces that Friend might find worth-
while should he indeed be determined
to quit the Rhodes and McNicoll set,
and come in under the umbrella of the
thinkers.
And, for a chap with nothing much
else to do at 9pm, it was only sensible
for me to urge a cab, post-haste, to his
little house in Paddington that very
night, as it happened.
He gave me a sherry and was both
charming and entertaining.
“Yes,” he said, “I used to get the
Bully sent to me in Bali. I remember you
once wrote a piece about the pigeons
and seagulls in Hyde Park. I thought at
the time that I could have a bit of fun
with that.”
“Oh, yes. Heh-heh, the pigeons.” The
pigeons? The seagulls? I had once done a
piece about a currawong in Belmore
Park. Could he mean that? Pigeons and
seagulls and currawongs had a lot in
common, after all: beaks and feathers
and wings and . .. and all that . . .
“Well,” he continued, “I think we
should get Richard Griffin to design and
publish it. He’s really very good, you
know. He did Bumbooziana for me
and ...”
Bumbooziana ! My plans soared up
again like fire.
Next morning, after a pause of no
more than three hours in the library I
had written a piece about randy pigeons
and greedy seagulls and I sent him a
photostat by priority-paid mail I went
for a holiday on the Gold Coast.
Exactly two weeks later Donald
called me in Surfers Paradise.
“I think I should illustrate about 20
of your pieces,” he said.
God almighty, he’d taken all this
time to decide that. Well, par for the
course, I told myself, was all we suffer-
ing intellectuals could expect.
“Fine. Whatever you’d like to do.”
“Yes, I’ve done 18 so far ...”
“You’ve WHAT? Holy JESUS!”
Later I was to learn that Donald, in a
lather of limning and creativity, had
spent two weeks in his studio, crouched
over his board like a tomcat over a fish-
head, snarling at intruders, ignoring the
telephone. This, his call to Surfers, was
his first voluntary contact with mankind
in two weeks.
I learned that when, on the following
Sunday, I met Richard Griffin.
“All I wanted,” he said ruefully,
“was to show him a few layouts. But he
wouldn’t talk to me. Annyway (Mr
Griffin is wonderfully Irish), I’ve had all
the printing done and I’ve got a dummy
of the book here ...”
“You’ve WHAT?”
“Yes, we want to get it out
by Christmas..
“You WHAT?” My con-
versation seemed to be getting
into a rut. “You mean THIS
Christmas?”
“Oh, yas. In fact I’ve got it
all planned and promised and
insured to be ready by
November 1.”
“You w ... ? Good lord, I
mean.”
The astonishment was no
mummery. Nor was it un-
reasonable. Six weeks earlier I
had finished a book which the
publishers admittedly a big-
ger, busier firm thought
they could have ready the Christmas
AFTER next.
I realised now that to think in terms
of mere hundreds of thousands was pes-
simistic indeed. With no great effort of
will I got back to the ivory and apes and
peacocks and the pouting houris. But
now something nagged my conscience:
Here I was, with an artist who had
eschewed food, friendship, indeed any
contact with mankind; and a publisher
who had moved mountains. And what
had I done?
I slunk home in a low state of mind.
As I arrived the telephone was ringing.
It was my son, Andrew. His wife, De-
borah, he said in the sort of voice that
goes with a dreamy smile and goo-goo
eyes, had just given birth to a daughter:
Amelia, I'fXb or 3kg if you must. And
now I realised that I hadn’t done so
badly:
Friend and Griffin could work like
drovers’ dogs and could become no
more than an artist and a publisher re-
spectively. Deborah could become a
mother but, God damn and blast it, it
had taken her nine whole months.
Whereas I, in about three seconds,
had become a grandfather. About to be
published, too. □


Fine Cotton -more shocks to come
DAVID M c NICOLL
IT’S HARD to keep pace with all the
inquiries going on at the present time.
But, on the grapevine, the hottest
rumors are about the Fine Cotton in-
quiry.
It seems a pretty low-key inquiry
but the word is that, in the wash-up,
many well-known faces will not be seen
again on Australian racecourses.
ARE WE drinking more wine than
beer? Apparently that’s what’s hap-
pened in England. A cutting I received
this week carries the story that wine
drinkers now outnumber beer drinkers
for the first time.
This has resulted from the tax
changes in the British budget, when
wine tax was cut and beer tax was
upped. But despite the in-
crease in wine drinking, the
consumption is low compared
with France and Italy. Ac-
cording to Guy Gordon
Clark, chairman of the Wine
and Spirit Association, the
British wine consumption is
less than three glasses per
head per week.
With beer in Australia
reaching previously un-
dreamed-of prices, we may
see increasing consumption of
hotel bar wine.
OPENINGS and Launchings:
In the course of a year anyone
in my line of business gets
sundry invitations to openings
and launchings. Openings of
hotels and art shows, launch-
ings of books. Recently there have been
so many book launchings the literary
marinas are practically chock-a-block.
The best openings are hotel open-
ings, and I sadly have had to knock
back two because of previous engage-
ments the new Sheraton, which has
changed the face of hospitality in Bris-
bane; and the Sheraton Ayers Rock Ho-
tel, which will be officially opened on
November 30.
The Ayers Rock hotel, illustrated
here, is part of the magnificent Yulara
Tourist Development, which has cost
more than $l6O million, and will revol-
utionise visitor comfort in The Centre.
For a start, air conditioning which
will mean summertime as well as win-
tertime guests.
The Yulara resort is 18km from
Ayers Rock, and all the second-rate
buildings which used to surround the
rock will be removed, and the area will
return to its natural beauty.
The Uluru National Park, which in-
cludes Ayers Rock and the Olgas, will
become one of the most popular attrac-
tions in Australia.
SO MUCH for openings now for
launchings; paintings and books. Un-
less the speaker is amusing, informed
and not verbose, these can be ordeals of
the worst type. As Mike Carlton pointed
out in a speech at a recent book launch-
ing, these gatherings have produced
what is practically a standard low in
food and drink.
“There is some vineyard,” said Carl-
ton, “where they grow grapes for the
wine used at book launchings. It is not
The Sheraton Ayers Rock hotel: visitor comfort in The Centre revolutionised
far from where they grow the grapes
used for communion wine ... some bar-
ren, blasted little vineyard out along the
Birdsville track, tended by Vietnamese
migrants who have brought with them
all their wine-making skills from the old
country ...
“The food, if anything, is even worse
- cubes of extruded fibreglass cheese
... you may be treated to a stick of wet
asparagus, copulating limply with a
soggy slice of white Tip-Top bread.”
I THOUGHT Phar Lap had produced
the most exciting racecourse scenes so
far seen on film.
But no. Champions has scenes which
beat Phar Lap to a frazzle.
The Grand National sequences are
some of the most thrilling I have seen
on the screen. They also, I must admit,
provide great fuel for those people who
are trying to have steeplechasing over
the punishing Grand National course
outlawed.
AN AMERICAN publication, the Insti-
tutional Investor, lists the world’s best
hotels for a special clientele those
who want, and can afford, the best.
The latest edition again gives the
Oriental, Bangkok, top billing. But, how
about this: the Regent, Sydney, Austra-
lia, is listed 12th out of the top 50. And
the Regent has been open only two
years.
It is a great feather in the cap of
Ted Wright, the man who has steered it
since opening day. It appears, inciden-
tally, one below the Hassler, Rome, and
one above the Ritz, Paris.
MY AJC quinella got up Tony All-
port and Arthur Fitzgerald though I
had them the wrong way round. With
Ray Alexander as the new secretary-
manager, and a strengthened commit-
tee, the AJC should soon be asserting its
rightful position as premier Australian
racing club.
IT’S A pity Premier Wran didn’t intro-
duce new gun laws instead of announc-
ing they were planned for the near fu-
ture.
Gunshops have been having a bon-
anza. A couple of weeks ago, I spent a
day blazing at the clays at the excellent
range of the NSW Field and Game As-
sociation. Many of the shooters are in
the gun business, and they reported big
sales in the past couple of weeks. Not
unusual for one person to buy a dozen
guns or more! □

Consider this.
The BMW 520 i offers you a level of
design and refinement quite simply
unavailable in other cars in its class. Yet it
remains eminently competitive in the price
arena. So what may have seemed a mere
flight of fancy is, in reality, well within
your grasp.
SIX-CYLINDER REFINEMENT.
The level of sophistication starts with
the engine - one of the few six-cylinder,
two-litre engines in the world. The laws of
engineering dictate that if an in-line, two-
litre engine is to be totally free of
secondary vibrations, it should never have
fewer than six cylinders. Anything less is a
compromise.
In the BMW 520 i, you’ll find a turbine-
smooth, electronically fuel-injected, six-
cylinder engine which revs effortlessly, yet
is tractable and responsive in traffic.
And now that a revolutionary, four-
speed automatic transmission is available,
you can experience the economy and
performance normally associated with a
five-speed manual.
TECHNOLOGY CREATES EFFICIENCY.
Advanced electronics are an integral
part of the design of every BMW, and the
520 i is no exception.
Certainly the engine is a prime
beneficiary of this technology. Instead of
conventional servicing by the book, a
computer monitors driving conditions and
your driving style, and indicates the precise
moment an oil change or service is due.
This is allowing BMW drivers to
extend their service intervals by up to
sixty percent.
A computer-controlled fuel-
consumption meter monitors the precise
fuel flow, compares it to road speed, and
tells you exactly how much fuel you
are using.
And when you lift your foot off the

accelerator at over 1200 r/min, the fuel
cuts off completely.
These advances in technology not
only typify BMW’s quest for greater fuel
efficiency but allow for the production of
2-litre engine that produces nearly as
much power (125bhp) as some engines
twice its size.
CONSISTENCY OF QUALITY.
Every BMW is built to the same
exacting standards of quality - regardless
of price. Standards which you would not
have considered possible in a car priced
below $30,000.
This committment to quality allows
BMW to offer a 6 year warranty against rust
perforation on its current models.
It’s not surprising then, that such a
relentless pursuit of excellence in design
and manufacture should pay such
handsome dividends when you finally
come to sell your BMW.
If you’re driven by a similar desire
for quality and refinement, then you’ll
recognise the need to test drive the
BMW 520 i.

Sophia Loren at 50, in the fourth
dimension of beauty
Actress Sophia Loren has just turned 50 and, rather than heading over the hill, novelist
ANTHONY BURGESS asserts, this has helped set her beauty “firmly in its fourth
dimension. ” He reports on her deprived background, achievements, style and future.
I SPOKE recently to the divine Sophia
Loren on the telephone. She was
making a film in Naples, where she
started, and in Rome where she got her
start. In the film, Aurora, she plays the
part of a 50-year-old woman with a
young son. The son is her own, her
youngest, Eduardo, and the story es-
chews the popular ingredients of sex
and violence. It is, in other words, a
characteristic Sophia Loren vehicle in
which conflict and suffering end in tri-
umph. At 50, Loren is still hard at work
in her chosen craft.
She is one of the heroines of our
time. That last phrase means,
I think, what it has always
meant a woman who has
achieved incredibly against
incredible odds but to be 50
years old is no longer what it
used to be.
To be 50 not so long ago
was to sigh resignedly at the
loss of youth, beauty, energy
and, far worse, hope. A
woman who has chalked up
the half-century today will
find that youth meaning
gawky immaturity is well
lost and that beauty has
arrived at its true meaning.
Physical beauty exists in
three dimensions only; total
beauty demands a fourth. This
fourth dimension is hard to
define but it is easily recog-
nisable. The ancients used
terms such as “soul” and “wis-
dom.” We, being cleverer than
the ancients, do not believe in
the soul and think wisdom is a
property of computers.
Loren’s beauty is now set
firmly in its fourth dimension
and this has much to do with
her reaching the age of 50.
There are many women
not really heroines who
have surmounted the ob-
stacles of a slum childhood, a
lack of formal education, the
devastation of a war and the stigma of
illegitimacy to arrive at wealth, high so-
cial status, universal respect. The
Greeks divided the rational or soul-car-
rying creation into gods, heroes and
men. A hero was not quite a god but he
was above mankind. Mankind might, in
its ignorance, confuse a god with a hero
seeing in him godlike qualities which
were really human qualities raised to a
higher power.
When I first met Sophia, I was in-
clined to grovel on the carpet but her
humanity forbade it. She is not a god-
dess but a woman raised to a higher
Loren: “totality of beauty...sprang suddenly” in teens
power. She demands admiration more
than worship. But admiration never
seems quite enough. How about love?
Love of a special kind, perhaps
public and universal, rather than per-
sonal and intimate. She has this first
love in large measure and it is accorded
primarily to an image on the cinema
screen. Other film stars have had it but
not quite in the same way as she.
We loved and still love Marilyn
Monroe but we did not dare let our feel-
ings spill over from the screen into the
dangerous well of her private life which
we knew was disastrous, though we
were shocked when it ended
in disaster.
There is, with most stars, a
parallelism we do not care to
think about too much. We
don’t want to know about the
star’s drinking, drug addic-
tion, multiple divorces, bad
temper; we are happier with
the image up there. But with
Sophia there has never been
much tension between the real
woman and the glamorised
screen icon. Her true person-
ality, in some measure, gets up
there. When we meet the real
woman we do not feel let
down, rather the opposite.
There is something of a unity,
confirmed in some of her
screen roles deriving from
phases of her life.
Because her vocation has
permitted her to present
woman raised to that higher
power, the drama of her pri-
vate life has become for many
women and not a few men a
set of poetic symbols sum-
ming up the pains and tri-
umphs of the unknown and
unglamorous.
Her father behaved abom-
inably, as many fathers do.
She fell in love with an older
man and has been far from
diffident in admitting that fil-

ial deprivation had something to do
with it.
Her marriage to Carlo Ponti who
was still, in the eyes of the Catholic
church and the Italian state, a married
man and hence a bigamist initiated a
melodrama whose intensity the whole
world felt. Here was a pair of lovers
against whom the brutal paternalism of
civic and ecclesiastical authority bat-
tered but battered in vain.
Married but not yet a mother, Sophia
was the battleground of a struggle be-
tween her deepest instincts and the limi-
tations of her biology. Again, she won
through.
There have been other struggles. She
and Ponti have been the victims of gross
and vulgar publicity, of expropriation,
of mad intruders and violent thieves.
Despair has always been countered by
the wisdom that only a deprived child-
hood can teach.
Sophia has never asked for much.
She cooks tasty meals out of scragend.
The destiny of too many women has
been that of the Roman housewife she
portrays in one of her best films, The
Special Day. When, in all her glamor,
she acknowledged the plaudits of those
who witnessed its premiere it was clear
that the glamor was a mere joke. A good
part of her heroinism lies there: She is
an ordinary woman who has fulfilled
more than is given to ordinary women.
It is probable that her best films have
been made with a fellow Neapolitan,
Marcello Mastroianni, and directed by
another - Vittorio de Sica. Although
she is universal woman, she is also a
daughter of Pozzuoli. One has to know
that deprived and lively part of
southern Italy to appreciate Sophia’s
special femininity. She is best when a
film allows this quality to come through:
de Sica encouraged it and Mastroianni
abetted it.
Like heroinism, it is not easy to de-
fine but the common view of it ex-
pressed in terms such as “tempestuous
fieriness tempered with a hard sense of
disillusion” probably comes near
enough.
Naples and its environs are very old:
a Greek city bred a people not at all like
the obscene pagan philosophical under-
dogs of the Roman capital or the suave
controlled citizens of Milan. Go to
Pozzuoli and you will be aware of an
unbroken line of poverty, of resignation
broken by occasional dramatic pleas to
heaven which goes all the way back to
the days when it was Puteoli. What
beauty you will find in the women is not
easy to paint or photograph: it depends
on movement, on facial animation.
There are beautiful girls enough but
very few are as beautiful as Sophia. It is
this beauty which makes her not quite
an ordinary woman.
Sophia is aware of its unanalysabil-
ity. She is bolder than her worst critics
in finding irregularities mouth too
wide, nose too long. She resisted the
Hollywood professional prettifiers who
wanted to reduce her to the starlet’s
symmetrical banalities: beauty is not
something imposed but something im-
manent.
When she says that her best feature is
her eyes, she is saying something about
a Pozzuoli endowment for there the eyes
learn to speak. But the totality of her
beauty, which sprang suddenly in her
teens after an ugly duckling girlhood
when the girls called her Sofia
Stuzzicadente (a stuzzicadente being a
toothpick), represents no stereotype.
The body of course, is beautifully
made but that is a generic gift. Though,
in the Neapolitan manner, she may
speak with her body, even in response
her face carries an eloquence very rare
and very disturbing.
Her beauty may be regarded as an
inheritance from her mother the fact
of that beauty, if not its particular qual-
ity since her mother won a national
contest that was looking for an Italian
Greta Garbo.
We do not know how far the acting
talent was also inherited: her mother’s
prize was a trip to Hollywood which she
never took, since her own mother was
full of dark warnings about Greta
Garbo’s probable jealousy and setting
of the Black Hand or American Mafia
on to her.
Sophia got into the film business,

through her winning of a less specific
beauty contest, with her mother’s en-
couragement: it was a vicarious way of
fulfilling a frustrated ambition. Her
beauty was but is no longer the one that
could strike straight at the appetite: the
beauty of the mature Sophia is of a
different, less edible, order.
It was soon recognised paradoxic-
ally after she had mouthed for Renata
Scotti in a film of Aida that Sophia
had a voice as well as a face and a body.
Not a singing voice, though she has one
and has* exploited it, but a speaking
voice which is allied to a fine ear. A
musical faculty has to be somewhere
around when we talk of the ear and it is
relevant to note that Sophia’s sister
Maria could have been a professional
singer of high quality and that their
mother was, as well as looking like
Greta Garbo, a fine pianist.
Sophia has mastered all the regional
varieties of Italian a truth you can
only know by seeing her Italian films
undubbed and her English is good.
I used to practise as a phonetician
and, on first meeting her, I listened care-
fully for italicisms in her speech: there
were none. She can pick up sounds
exactly. Carlo Ponti recalls that, when
she was filming in the Soviet Union, she
picked up enough Russian to give an
impromptu speech in it at a public din-
ner. This is another aspect of heroinism
the ability to cross borders, to affirm
the universality of a human appeal.
As for Sophia’s acting skills, I am
never sure how to take her affirmation
that she is essentially an amateur that
there is not one ounce of Olivierian pro-
fessionalism in her.
Working with de Sica, she was happy
to follow his gestures and mouthings
from behind the camera. With Chaplin,
in the disastrous A Countess from Hong
Kong, she begged the old master to con-
duct her literally like an orchestra. She
is certainly not one of those assertive
actresses who know better than the di-
rector and, for that matter, the scenarist.
She took lessons in her early days in
Pozzuoli from an old actor who, follow-
ing the technique of the silent films,
taught her bold facial gestures close to
caricature. The lack of stage experience
or training of the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art or Lee Strasberg type has
perhaps led her to denigrate what we
may call an instinctive professionalism.
But her confessed approach to a part
that of relating it to her life has
produced results perhaps impossible to
trained professionalism: they certainly
help to explain what I describe above as
the unity of her real life personality and
her filmed persona.
She has achieved much but I think
she still has to achieve more. She has
won her Oscar as well as high praise for
her work in films otherwise mediocre
At 50: celebrating her birthday at a dinner in Detroit last month
(Man Of La Mancha, for instance, and
the Chaplin disaster) but she still has to
make a great film.
In 1962, I published a novel entitled
The Wanting Seed. This is a fantasy set
in an imagined future when the world’s
preoccupation is not with the coming
nuclear holocaust but with the failure of
the global food supply to match the
growth of population. In my fantastic
future England, sterility is enforced by
law and sexual inversion is encouraged
(“It’s sapiens to be homo,” say the
posters). There is one female character
in the story who stands for the ancient
virtues of straight love and natural fer-
tility. Her name is Beatrice-Joanna and
she is all woman.
When I had finished writing the
book, I saw a film with Sophia Loren in
it and realised that, without properly
knowing it, she was the woman I had in
mind.
There have been various failed at-
tempts to get The Wanting Seed on the
screen. The possibility of success
dawned when Ponti professed his inter-
est. Here, whatever else the film would
have, was an outstanding part for his
wife. But the world of the cinema is
crammed with frustration; the theme of
the scfipt I wrote (it ends with organised
cannibalism) was considered too daring
by potential backers; the project came
to nothing.
I met Sophia Loren because of this
proposal. It was a meeting in which I
was charmed, overwhelmed because of
her star status, but this quickly mod-
ulated into a more personal attachment:
here was a fine woman of large humility.
The Special Day had just appeared:
she was as excited by the reviews as I
had been with the notices of my first
novel. I have not seen her since, though
I worked remotely for her when I
translated Lina Wertmuller’s Sicilian
blood feud film into English. I do not
know whether it was ever shown in
English: it was no great success in Ital-
ian or Sicilian though Sophia, passion-
ate and earthy, was as compelling as she
always is.
She is always around in my life in
television films, in the signed portrait
(which has the humor of a parodic
glamor) that hangs on my study wall.
She never feels distant and I think she
has that effect on all who know and
admire her work.
She is now at least in a statutory
sense middle-aged, while I decline
into genuine old age. She has portrayed
an 80-year-old in a film ( Lady L) and
has said: “When I am an old woman of
80 .. . I see myself surrounded by my
two sons, daughters-in-law and grand-
children and by my husband who will
just have turned 100.” I wish for that
consummation, which I shall not see,
and give my anticipatory blessing on 30
years of life in which she will continue
to shed the glow of her femininity and
the goodness of her Pozzouli heart. □

HUMOR
Living up to the
aim of being
unfair to all
THE WALL-to-wall suits present in The Age
gallery on October 1 attested to the general
clearing of senior and middle management at
the newspaper’s offices when Prime Minister
Bob Hawke launched Tandberg's Age of Con-
sensus, the latest anthology by Age cartoonist
Ron Tandberg.
Clearly not considering himself one of
those to whom he referred, Hawke said that
“politicians too often lacked an element of wit
and humor, particularly at a time when some
of them were bringing the standard of the
sewer into politics.” He added, “This book
leaves no doubt that Tandberg lives up to his
aim of being unfair to everyone.”
He didn’t burst into tears. But Tandberg al-
most did right at the end of his own remarks.
Tandberg said, “I’m grateful my little mate
Bob could launch the book.” And just in case
anyone got the wrong idea, he quickly re-
minded those present that his “little mate”
Andrew Peacock had launched the last one.

OPERA
The magic
of the Dream
is missing
By BRIAN HOAD
IN HIS earthy and humorous autobi-
ography, Twenty-Five Years of Austra-
lian Opera, published last year after his
sadly premature death in 1981, Neil
Warren-Smith recorded his intense dis-
like of the role of Bottom in
Britten’s A Midsummer
Night’s Dream. Yet it was one
of the most vivid of his many
memorable roles, hugely
warm and cheerful, delighting
in life as he found it, moving
with unshakeable equanimity
from his own world of “rude
mechanicals” (the kindly
Britten calls them “rustics”),
through the courtly life of
Athens into fairyland itself.
Warren-Smith may have
loathed playing the role but it
never showed. Growing up in
the rough and ready world of
Australian opera but 20 or 30
years ago, he learnt the basic
rules of showbusiness as well
as any Ethel Merman. So, let’s
get on with the show.
Elijah Moshinsky’s pro-
duction of The Dream, intel-
lectually crisp and gossamer-
free, a surreal blend of men-
ace, comedy and mysticism
set in a Freudian dream-
world, first startled audiences
at the Australian Opera in
1978 and went on enchanting
them for another two seasons.
Last seen in 1981, it’s back
again. But its magic is miss-
ing.
Too many of the cast now
seem either bored or dispiri-
ted. Perhaps that was some-
thing to do with the com-
pany’s on-going political
battle for survival. Whatever the
troubles back-stage, that’s where they
should be left.
There is also the problem of staging
the work without the original director.
Moshinsky was in town recently for his
production of Poulenc’s The Carmelites,
not for a revival of The Dream. That
particularly diaicult task was taken on
by resident producer Stuart Maunder.
He has lost control of both inherent
comedy of the courtly lovers and the
inherent maliciousness of the fairies.
The resulting caricatures defy the essen-
tial mood of enchantment.
The fairies pervade and control the
opera with highly ambiguous intentions.
But there’s nothing ambiguous about
Anthony Warlow’s Puck, a grotesque
sado-masochist not a knavish sprite.
Jennifer McGregor’s Tytania appears
outstandingly bored. No sense here that
she’s at the centre of a lover’s quarrel so
powerful that it threatens to disturb Na-
ture herself.
From perfromances past there is still
the bewitchng, other-worldly voice of
James Bowman as Oberon a creature
of huge but amoral power, sailing aloof
above everything on his flying machine.
And the 20 young lads who complete
Jennifer McGregor, Gregory Yurisich in The Dream
BRANCO GAICA
the fairy band are always somewhat be-
mused by the novelty of their new game
on opening night but usually settle
down quickly.
Moshinsky’s production chooses the
erotic adventures of the lovers as its fo-
cal point. Although night dominates
most of the action in any naturalistic
production, their confused antics are
played out in this Freudian dream-
world, in harsh, bright light. It is a cruel
light on this occasion.
Anson Austin’s Lysander seems par-
ticularly dispirited by some backstage
problem or other. Beryl Furlan’s Helena
is crudely frumpish. Jennifer Berming-
ham’s Hermia at least makes an ener-
getic attack on the comic business
and goes too far. Only John Fulford’s
Demetrius seems even vaguely aware
that this particular dream is verging on
a nightmare, that the lover’s comedy of
errors is underlayed with music or ro-
mantic anguish.
The rustics fare better. Gregory
Yurisich has the unenviable task of fol-
lowing in the path of Warren-Smith’s
original Bottom. It is a good enough
start; warm and cheerful but oddly shy
(or nervous), not yet expansive enough,
not yet unshakeable in his equanimity.
Christopher Dawes, as a com-
ically plaintive Snout, is an-
other newcomer to this neck
of the enchanted woods.
Otherwise, the old gang is still
all there: Alan Light, Graeme
Ewer, Robert Eddie and John
Germain should ensure that
the team soon settles down to
the earthy free-wheeling
humor it had.
The main pleasure of the
evening is Britten’s mag-
nificently rich and inventive
score.
Under the illuminating
baton of William Reid, it is as
bewitching as ever in its
brooding mysteries, passion-
ate in its romantic outbursts
and warmly witty in its comic
parodies.
But, as one of the finest
achievements in Australian
theatre in recent years, it’s
particularly lamentable that
the original magic of The
Dream has been allowed to
fade so badly. And, if back-
stage worries are partially to
blame, the management could
well try handing out the War-
ren-Smith memoirs to
younger members of the cast.
As he saw it, the operatic
tent shows on the road to
Gundagai back in the pion-
eering days were a far richer
experience than working in a
butcher’s shop.
In the rough and ready life of the
good old, bad old days (only the singing
was good), he found the equanimity to
take pleasure in life as it came. And that
is the basis of showbusiness. For, even if
the show might have to close tomorrow,
you should at least try to avert disaster
by putting it on as well as you can
tonight. In his words: “We were
there to do or die and, by God!, we
didn’t die.” □


THEATRE
Brave and
authentic
Brecht
Gerard Maguire (left) and Chris Connelly in The Threepenny Opera : thought-provoking
By JOHN CARGHER
THE UNION Theatre Repertory Com-
pany 25 years ago staged what was
probably the first professional Austra-
lian production of a work by Bertolt
Brecht, an author who has recently been
placed on perhaps a higher pedestal
than any other by the local theatre com-
munity.
The Melbourne Theatre Company
has revived The Threepenny Opera in
the new Playhouse, sticking remarkably
close to the author’s original intentions.
In spite of Mack, the Knife and the mu-
sic of Kurt Weill, The Threepenny Opera
is not a musical work but a play-cum-
cabaret assisted by interpolated musical
numbers. The text is the master of the
music, as it should be. There has never
been an opera for which the music was
written first and the words added.
The original Dreigroschenoper’s prin-
cipals in 1928 were great personalities
and major stars in German theatre and
films. Harald Paulsen, Lotte Lenya,
Erich Ponto, Rosa Valetti and the like
were actors, not singers Lenya was a
dancer who first sang on stage because,
as Weill’s wife, she was willing to sing
for nothing.
The Threepenny Opera is unique in
the brief (four years) association of
Brecht and Weill. It does not bear the
stamp of Brecht’s later fanaticism. The
poor complaining about the rich was
not a new political creed. The axe he
ground was universal and its applica-
tion governed by his subject.
It is not an original work but a re-
working of The Beggar’s Opera which
had just completed an immensely suc-
cessful four-year run in London. The
idea was to transplant it to Germany
and earlier productions as well as
Frederic Austin’s differed greatly from
John Gay’s 1728 original.
Brecht had ample pre-
cedent for treating the sub-
ject in any manner he
chose.
The storyline of the two
works is identical and (the
cheek of the man!) its first
sung item, Peachum's
Morning Hymn, actually
uses the music by Pepusch
written exactly 200 years
earlier for Gay’s produc-
tion!
The story of the licen-
tious highwayman was
transposed into the mis-
eries of post-World War I
Germany, even though
Brecht kept the London
setting. Berlin in 1928 was
David Atkins, as
Macheath: faultless
rough and director Graeme Blundell
makes his actors do things which might
have landed them in jail if Wal Cherry
had attempted them in 1959. Macheath
is obsessed with fornication in its
crudest form and the George Grosz il-
lustration in the program shows how
right he was. It is as well that Blundell
did not take it to the limits to which
Grosz went; Grosz was gross enough
for X-rated videotapes!
The designs by Richard Jeziorny are
in the same spirit and no praise can be
high enough for the way he blends the
make-up of the characters into the biz-
arre subterranean setting. By casting his
12 actors, nine musicians and umpteen
stage hands in many parts, Blundell
forms a huge mob of fascinating cre-
ations, an optical illusion which works
wonders.
His cast serves him well, though only
Frederick Parslow’s Peachum looks,
acts and sounds like the stars at Brecht’s
disposal in 1928. The Melbourne
Theatre Company simply cannot afford
Geraldine Turner AND Frank Thring
AND Jill Perryman AND Robyn Arch-
er AND Nancye Hayes you name the
others. The casting of pint-sized David
Atkins as a kind of Jimmy Cagney
Macheath works quite well and his per-
formance cannot be faulted. However,
it diminishes his stature as the central
figure both literally and figuratively.
In some respects, Polly Peachum
(Janet Andrewartha) steals the show
with her superbly smooth change from
puzzled innocence to the tough and
ruthless chairperson of the bank which
Macheath founds rather than robs “Is
there a difference?” asks Brecht.
But most of the principals are com-
pletely eclipsed by the many-faced gro-
tesques of John Murphy, Don Bridges,
Gerard Maguire and Tommy Dysart
who is the only cast member apart from
Parslow with an operatic voice.
The women are hampered by
Blundell’s attempt to take the Weill part
of The Threepenny Opera
seriously. If Polly sings so-
prano, it should at least be
a good soprano; it is not.
And, if Jenny is to con-
vince a la Lenya, she
should be able to belt like
Lenya; she does not.
Blundell flounders when it
comes to the music side of
the work but is saved by
Red Symons and his small
band who merge beautiful-
ly into the action.
I doubt whether a bet-
ter, more thought-pro-
voking, more authentic
Threepenny Opera will be
seen in Melbourne. No-
body is likely to attend it
for the singing, after all. □

Red feeling
blue finds
a rosier life
By SANDRA HALL
THE RUSSIAN HERO of Paul
Mazursky’s New Cold War comedy,
Moscow on the Hudson , makes his de-
cision to defect during a heady moment
between the Estee Lauder and Pierre
Cardin counters in Bloomingdale’s de-
partment store in New York.
Assailed by the concentrated scents
and colors of capitalism, he finally
rebels against half a lifetime queuing for
lavatory paper and shoes that don’t fit
and casts his vote for the land of How-
ard Johnson motels and designer jeans.
He does not get away with this without a
few pangs of remorse for those left be-
hind but the hangover comes much later
almost as an afterthought.
Mazursky, an old hand at celebrating
the delights of New York (most notably
in Next Stop Greenwich Village and An
Unmarried Woman), is never in any
doubt that his Russian has made the
right decision. Moscow on the Hudson is
a stridently energetic piece of propagan-
da for the American immigrant dream
arid the glories of free enterprise, with a
little Russian bear-baiting thrown in for
the hell of it.
And along with the energy and the
stridency there is a certain amount of
whimsicality lent by Robin Williams’
performance as Vlad, the defector. Only
rarely does Williams get the chance to
play a relatively ordinary human being.
More often, as in Popeye or Mork and
Mindy, he is in demand as a fantasy fig-
ure and his Vlad has elements of such
cuteness, so that he spends a lot of time
being wide-eyed and puppyish about
such New York sights as bag-ladies,
breakdancers and Columbia University
lecturers on Marxism met at cocktail
parties.
In Moscow, where the story starts, he
plays the saxophone in a circus and
lives in a tiny apartment with his family.
He has a boring girlfriend, a collection
of Duke Ellington records bought on
the black market and a close friendship
with a circus clown (memorably played
by a real Russian, Elya Baskin), who is
desperate to defect.
But, when the circus arrives in New
York on its long-awaited American
tour, it is Vlad who makes the break
during the expertly choreographed riot
in Bloomingdale’s which is the film’s
centrepiece and its wittiest sequence.
Two KGB agents, played for broad
comedy, fail to intimidate him into get-
ting back on the tour bus. He goes home
when all the shouting is done, with one
of Bloomingdale’s security guards, a
young black called Lionel (Cleavant
Derricks). Lionel’s parents take Vlad in
as one of the family; he acquires an Ital-
ian girlfriend and a Cuban lawyer and
prepares to enjoy a full life as a New
York ethnic. But certain things take get-
ting used to and he hyperventilates in a
supermarket his first day out, overcome
at the plethora of brands on display in
the coffee aisle. But soon he has a hot
dog stand by day, a job washing dishes
by night and aspirations like everyone
else.
Mazursky’s style as a director is
marked by a graceful way with cliches
and a concern with pre-occupations of
the sophisticated middle class. Divorce,
friendship, upward mobility, the mid-
life crisis these are his subjects and,
while he has had nothing original to say
about any of them, he has consistently
displayed a smooth knowingness that
has not been at all hard to take.
But he can also be very serious about
very little and in Moscow on the Hudson ,
beneath the slapstick and the wry jokes
about New York customs and the con-
sumer culture, lurks a deadly earnest-
ness and an evangelical patriotism.
He does have a good eye, though,
both for a film’s looks (here, he is work-
ing again with Australian cinematogra-
pher Don McAlpine) and its casting
and Moscow on the Hudson has many
little-known actors giving finely-judged
comic performances.
Derricks demonstrates great timing
and a superb sense of parody, as does
Maria Conchita Alonso as Vlad’s
girlfriend, Lucia, and there is an inven-
tive cameo from Alejandro Rey as his
Cuban lawyer who has built a very
healthy practice specialising in
defectors.
The script was written by Mazursky
in collaboration with Leon Capetanos
who worked with the director on Tem-
pest (in which John Cassavetes fled
fashionable New York to sit out his
mid-life crisis on a Greek island) and,
while their work here is a model of dis-
ciplined construction compared to the
excesses of that screenplay, a similar
sense of bathos is discernible.
Tempest was more interesting in be-
ing less predictable. Here, Vlad’s fate is
decided from the outset strictly along
well-worn lines: He will love America,
the romance will go sour but finally the
two will become reconciled in tolerant
recognition of one another’s failings
and, in the process after this ritual
recital of her faults America will once
more be confirmed as the land of all that
is worth having. □

BOOKS
The Japanese
occupation
of Australia
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
The Bush Soldiers, by John
Hooker. Collins, $17.95
JOHN HOOKER has had a bright idea
for a novel by bending history. He goes
back to the spring of 1943, to an Austra-
lia occupied by the Japanese. General
Macarthur and the Americans have un-
accountably ditched their allies and
scuttled off to New Zealand and only
the “Bush Soldiers” of the Volunteer
Defence Corps are fighting on. Their
war is only indirectly with the Japanese;
they are obeying the orders of a mysteri-
ous Colonel Madigan to “harass, deny
and destroy” and scorch the already
parched earth of the almost totally des-
erted outback. (Wild plans existed for
such policies, not to mention the infa-
mous “Brisbane Line” which would
have entailed abandonment of northern
Australia to the Japanese.)
Two Australian tough guys called
Geoffrey Sawtell and Frank Counihan,
join frightfully English gentleman
Major Francis St John Jackson and
Padre Sergius Donaldson and
O’Donohue, a yoting Australian, at
Bourke where the only other human be-
ings left are a few Aborigines. The Aus-
tralians heroically destroy the bore and
pump at the Aboriginal camp, and then
attack the deserted town itself.
The Englishmen were impressed
by the Australian ingenuity. At
the fuel dump, Counihan opened
the sludge valves and ignited the
tanks with oily waste; and at the
warehouse, Sawtell had slit and
poisoned the bags of flour with
linseed oil. O’Donohue pitched
sheeps’ carcasses down wells and
smashed the cylinder heads of
tractors. Counihan used his
sledgehammer and broke up
carts, buggies and sulkies: it was
an efficient inventory of destruc-
tion.
Those buggies and sulkies would cer-
tainly have been invaluable to the
Japanese if Sawtell had not already shot
all the spare horses.
A returned soldier from World War
I, Sawtell kills his first Australian on
page 12 even though he had already
been shot “dead centre in the right
John Hooker: an imaginative approach to the past
MILAN RODEN
shoulder blade” by Counihan. The boy
had vaguely threatened Sawtell with a
.22 rifle. When Counihan asks Sawtell
why he had blasted the boy in the chest
with a shotgun, Sawtell replies:
“I don’t know, he went for me
and I’m tired. And he called me
‘old man’. Only my friends can do
that ... Christ knows who he is,
the country’s full of hooligans
and riffraff. At my age, I’m not
going to be bushwhacked by some
illiterate young bastard. Let’s give
him to the crows.”
After this episode it is extremely
difficult to sympathise with Hooker’s
construction of Sawtell as a typical, de-
cent, tongue-tied Australian.
Hooker’s use, here and elsewhere, of
“bushwhack” as a verb meaning kill or
beat up is not otherwise recorded in
Australian literature as far as I know.
And those crows . . . One’s already
strained, suspended disbelief collapses
when one reads that “A thousand crows
screamed and flew from the branches.”
On other pages, they screech. Could
they be white crows with sulphur crests?
And then there are the “bushrats,” al-
ways “running by.” And, in a 1925 epi-
sode, we find “geese flying home over
the hills and far away” a few kilometres
out of Melbourne where there are also
“red stony plains” in the “endless Aus-
tralian hinterland.”
The presence of the Australian land-
scape and animals and birds which is
all-important to this book just does not
ring true any more than Sawtell, the
central character, is convincing as a
bushman. His various ineptitudes cul-
minate in leading his provisionless
party away from the safety of Coopers
Creek to set off to walk to
Alice Springs across the
Simpson Desert.
The narrative drive of the
book depends on the journey
of the bush soldiers (including
the padre) under Sawtell’s
command to blow up the
tower of the main mine at
Broken Hill which is occupied
by the Japanese. This ma-
noeuvre, involving Sawtell’s
climbing the tower and tying
dynamite to the pulleys, might
look well on film but one has
time to ask what is the point
of it all in a book. The damage
would be easily repaired by
the enterprising Japanese.
Hooker is a New
Zealander who has lived in
Australia since 1963 and has
worked as an editor with Pen-
guin and Fontana. He has ob-
viously wanted to write a
serious book about those two
mysteries, the Australian out-
back and the Australian
character. Both have eluded him. The
Bush Soldiers bears ominous signs of its
best-seller intentions including the
large-size, huge-type format which
produces the requisite more-than-400
pages. It is disabled by fashionable ran-
dom violence and by an out-of-date
mythologising, as if Sidney Nolan were
riding the bush tracks again (although
Nolan certainly has a sense of humor).
The country, unforgiving in art as in
life, takes its revenge. □

ALMOST EVERY day brings a news-
paper paragraph or two about the al-
most-civil war in Sri Lanka, the deadly
action between Tamil guerillas and the
Sinhalese security force. This sort of
thing must come as a surprise to those
who used to travel regularly to and from
Britain by P & O, stopping off at Col-
ombo, spending a day in the hills at
Kandy, dropping in for a drink at the
Galle Face Hotel, buying a souvenir
and returning tired but happy to the
ship.
This is a depressing, disappointing,
fairly usual picture of a small state that

NCR introduces
some high profit lines.
The quicker retailers operate
scanning equipment, the quicker their
profits rise.
Because put simply, NCR scanning
equipment linked to PO.S. terminals
avoids human error, which can account
for substantial loss of profit in supermarket
chains today.
And the customers like it because
scanning is fast, the queues are shorter
and move more quickly, they know there
are no mistakes, and they can instantly
check the price that’s brightly displayed.
More than that, they also get an
itemised print-out of their purchases and
the prices.
You can gain all these benefits now,
plus many others with or without an in-
store computer; and when you talk to us
you’ll realise that NCR scanning equip-
ment leads the world not only because
it’s the best, but also because
it’s surprisingly inexpensive.
More than that, NCR also
provides data processing centres and
Personal Business Computer Local Area
Networks.
NCR develops, manufactures,
markets, installs and services total business
information systems from small business
systems to the most powerful general
purpose processors and event driven trans-
action processors with the broadest range
of terminals, peripherals,
services and software in the
industry. That is NCR.

acquires independence but is the home
of two different peoples with different
ambitions. But, for a different view of
Sri Lanka and recollections of a time
when it was called Ceylon and its in-
habitants Cingalese, there is Running in
the Family.
Michael Ondaatje’s origins are
Dutch, Tamil and Singhalese. He
teaches at York University, Toronto,
and is a Canadian citizen but known in
Australia because he visited in 1979 as
an exchange writer. He was designated
then as a poet which he is when not
writing in luscious, sweeping prose.
He returned to Sri Lanka for parts of
1978 and 1981, after many years in Brit-
ain and Canada, to piece together the
story of his extraordinarily exotic and
eccentric family and its friends.
Ondaatje begins his book part
travel, part history, part biography and
autobiography with an aunt who
“plucked notorious incidents from her
brain” as he and his sister sat with her in
the huge living-room of the old gov-
ernor’s home in Jaffna (where killing
and burning is taking place). The house
was built around 1700 and is the prize
building in the northern region. He
studied the architecture as the aunt re-
lated how one evil Odnaatje was
“savaged to pieces by his own horse.”
A central figure in the book is the
author’s father Mervyn, an angel sober
but a devil drunk.
Mervyn, his wife and Doris and their
friends rocked from one end of the
island to the other in a 10-year splurge
of middle-class party-giving. It ended in
tears and separation. The children scat-
tered and now only one lives in Sri
Lanka.
The other principal figure is Lalla,
grandmother of the author. One would
like to have known her but from a dis-
tance.
COMING Through Slaughter is an
earlier book, first published in 1979. It is
about Buddy Bolden, a New Orleans
barber who played jazz trumpet and has
been called the true originator of jazz.
His great period was from 1900 to 1907
when he could draw huge crowds down
Canal Street in the daytime and play all
night in a bar.
Bolden goes by his own name in
Ondaatje’s book but the rest is fiction,
an account of his life and disappearance
as imagined by the author.
The Slaughter of the title is Slaughter
Street. It was through Slaughter,
Vachery and Sunshine streets that
Bolden’s body (fact, not fiction) was
brought back to New Orleans to be
buried in 1931.
It is hard to imagine, on the evidence
of these two such books, what Ondaatje
will do next. Whatever it is, it can’t
come too soon. □
BOOK BULLETIN
West beats the poll
by Patricia Rolfe
PENGUIN this time round are doing a
book which will be out well before the
federal election and which will try to
chart what the poll will or should
be about, rather than coming after the
event. Katharine West’s The Revolution
In Australian Politics will be published
on October 29, at $4.95. It will include a
reworking of some of the material
which appeared in The Bulletin in June.
Political scientist West has been the
analyst, sometimes scourge, of the Lib-
eral Party but she is more and more
turning her attention to Labor. This is
not surprising, as she regards the Hawke
government as a conservative one. She
believes that the Liberals lack “intellec-
tual content” and so, perhaps, are hard-
ly worth wasting much time on.
“Menzies Liberalism,” she points
out, “is now a quite different social
amalgam, with new members having
moved in from the ranks of the old
working class and old members con-
stantly moving out into the ranks of the
new poor.”
West picks holes in the idea that any
difference of opinion or conflict of prin-
ciple can be smoothed out by consen-
sus. One chapter calls for an “all-out,
systematic, co-ordinated program to
eliminate poverty” and another chapter
is on crime. Given the fluidity of that
situation, this chapter will not get to the
printer until the last minute.

QUEENSLAND University Press have
launched their own paperback imprint
and will produce four fiction titles a
month until Christmas. This will bring
some of their best writers, such as Peter
Carey, Elizabeth Jolley, Murray Bail,
Michael Wilding and Barry Oakley back
into print or keep them more securely in
print.
British publishers Weidenfeld and
Nicolson are launching their
Weidenfeld Paperbacks here in a month
or two. Titles include Kenneth Harris’s
Attlee, Elizabeth Longford’s The Royal
House Of Windsor and Ronald
Hayman’s Fassbinder Film-maker plus,
as an original, the book of David
Puttnam’s film about Cambodia: The
Killing Fields.
A COLLECTION of Sandra Hall’s re-
views of Australian films for The Bul-
letin will be published by Rigby early
next year as Critical Business: The New
Australian Cinema in Review. Hall, who
has been reviewing films for The Bul-
letin since 1971, has arranged the 130-
odd reviews under themes to underline
the preoccupations of local film-makers.
One which emerges is the business of
growing up and relating to a larger
world; here, she feels, the individual ex-
perience may sometimes parallel the na-
tional one.
PUBLISHERS tend to take
themselves seriously and
never more than when dis-
cussing the format of their
books. Houghton Mifflin of
the US, however, has on the
title page of its Science Made
Stupid! which is published this
month: “This book is set in
12-point Monotone Bimbo,
with chapter headings in Bas-
ketball Overextended. Both
faces were designed by the
great Adolf Pflupfl and are
characterised by noble, full-
bodied proportions with com-
plex, slightly fruity serifs. It
was printed by upset lithogra-
phy on 70-lb Tropicana Ivory
mislaid Cowabunga Slipshod
Overcoat. The ink come out of
a can. This paper is 100 per-
cent unrecycled. Whole for-
ests were levelled, thousands
of small furry animals left
homeless and vast virgin land-
scapes devastated to make this
book.” □

Crime and graft report
erupts in Papua New Guinea
Nine years into independence, an extensive survey of law and order in PNG has
validated the worst fears of authorities about the state of the nation and its
processes of justice, as STUARTINDER reports.
IN PAPUA New Guinea today it has be-
come impossible to separate incompe-
tence, negligence, mismanagement, mal-
practice and outright corruption in the
public sector, so unsupervised and laissez-
faire has the system become, so riddled
with neglect and opportunities for abuse,
so blatantly encouraging the venal and so
unfairly penalising the honest.
The lack of accountability is literally
stunning. . .
Prisons sometimes do not know how
many prisoners they have, or overlook
their release. . .
In some areas of government employ-
ment the exact number engaged is not
known ...
Files are so frequently lost that there
are no records at all of some transactions
that have been going on for several
years. ..
There is no check on statutory returns
meant to be made by companies to the
Registrar-General and audits are years
behind. . .
One liquor licensing board was found
to have not met in two years but in that
time 600 licences had been issued, all il-
legal and netting thousands of dollars of
which which there was no record. ..
The police have such a poor record of
investigation and prosecution and some
of the courts are so far behind with their
processing that offenders face little risk of
being arrested or, if they are, of being
convicted. . .
The inability of so many political lead-
ers to give an example of integrity and
dedication, the corruption in high places,
the questionable manipulation of “slush”
funds and the quite remarkable compla-
cency which persists in the face of a
breakdown of government accountability
... all contribute directly to the country’s
blatant insecurity .. .
THE preceding remarks are a mere
handful of direct quotations from an ex-
tensive report on the problems of graft,
law and order in Papua New Guinea
which has set that country thinking
deeply.
Crime and law and order are peren-
Riot police on standby in Papua New Guinea: fresh trouble brewing
nial topics of conversation in PNG,
which has just celebrated its ninth year
of independence. But never before has
the country seen a report on the prob-
lem that rings so true, that puts on paper
so clearly and dispassionately what
everybody suspected - that, notwith-
standing the occasional paranoia, there
is real reason for deep concern about
the impact of graft and lawlessness on
the process of PNG’s social and econ-
omic change.
The Clifford report was prepared by
William Clifford, just retired as director
of the Australian Institute of Crimi-
nology, by Judge Barry Stuart who is
now Chief Justice of the Yukon Ter-
ritories of Canada and had worked in
PNG and by PNG sociologist Dr
Louise Morauta. It was a joint study by
the PNG Institute of National Affairs
and the Institute of Applied Social and
Economic Research, with private enter-
prise and government support.
Both Prime Minister Michael
Somare and PNG Chief Justice Sir Buri
Kidu encouraged the survey as a means
of getting more facts for the burgeoning
debate in the country on law and order.
The report examines a variety of as-
pects of the problem government in-
competence and/or graft being only
one.
On the high-profile matter of tribal


war in the PNG highlands, it is encoura-
ging. The report points out that occa-
sional fighting is restricted to five high-
lands provinces where only one-fifth of
PNG’s population lives and that deaths
due to tribal fighting are an infinitesimal
portion of all deaths in PNG or even all
deaths in the highlands.
Tribal fighting should be seen as
“disputes that give rise to tribal fight-
ing” rather than simply tribal fighting.
They are branded the result of state ap-
paratus failing to resolve disputes be-
fore they go too far.
But the report pulls no punches
about the sort of breakdown in law and
order which makes it necessary for
wages to be carried into the highlands
by helicopter rather than by car, be-
cause of the activities of highway rob-
Volume 1 of
the Clifford report
bers and hijackers, and about the
money lost because businesses and tour-
ists hesitate to use certain roads.
The report says that a great deal of
property in Port Moresby owned by
affluent nationals is virtually unrentable
because of location in areas of crime.
“And the miscreants are no re-
specters of dignity,” it points out. “The
Governor-General, the Chief Justice,
the Prime Minister, ministers, ambassa-
dors, even senior police officers have all
been victims of crime.”
So bad has the situation become in
Port Moresby that various embassies
have had to supplement the local police
protection to which they are entitled
with expensive private security arrange-
ments, “one foreign mission having in-
vested over three-quarters of a million
kina (about $960,000) in security equip-
Private security guards in Port Moresby: special precautions are taken
ment and assuming a burden of over
151,000 kina a year to keep it effective.
Another has moved its staff out from
houses and left them empty.”
The report says that this situation
merely “highlights the failure of
government policies to protect dip-
lomatic personnel and naturally
i alarms others who are more vulner-
able because they are less entitled to
such protection.”
The report treats most
PNG crime statistics with
contempt because of the way
they have been recorded but
estimates that inefficient con-
trol of crime costs the govern-
ment at least 132 million kina
a year and, if a thorough study
could be made, probably
double that figure. This, it
points out, is more than Aus-
tralia’s annual grant to PNG.
It estimates that at least 50 percent
and a maximum of 70 percent of all
crimes are not reported to or detected
by police.
On the courts, the report says that the
criminal justice system cannot cope
with existing crime and that the situa-
tion is deteriorating. The more funds in-
vested in formal services, the less
efficient they become.
The situation, the report says, is criti-
cal and it points out that the real danger
is that the justice system while not
collapsing will go on working more
and more inefficiently while appearing
to function normally. The feeling that it
works will lead to undue reliance on it
to solve law and order problems it is
unable to solve.
It is not working because trained
personnel are lacking, supervision is de-
fective, systematic recording is
neglected, counsel are inexperienced,
unsupervised and grossly overworked.
There is no one with the time, ability or
experience to teach young national
counsel how to become competent bar-
risters.
The magnitude of the increases in de-
lays for court cases are described as
“staggering,” with the average time now
taken to process all crimes through the
National Court (the primary trial court)
being 344 days from committal to com-
pletion.
The rate of cases being struck out,
including murder and rape, is 22 per-
cent and rising. Deficiencies in bail,
police investigation and the public pros-
ecutor’s office are a chronic cause of
this.
“Once you get bail,” said a lawyer,
“the case can easily be delayed until it is
either forgotten or too difficult to pros-
ecute.” Many offenders released on bail
can never be found by police and, in
time, the case is dropped.
Nevertheless, says the report, “in
PNG petty criminals face a far greater
risk of being arrested, prosecuted and
convicted than anyone involved in
serious corporate or commercial fraud.
Fraud is rarely processed through the
system for conviction.”
The reports adds, tellingly: “Despite
valiant and conscientious work by
many policemen . . . their success rate in
the face of increasingly sophisticated
crimes and criminals will deteriorate
from bad to worse. Presently, the
deficiencies affecting all aspects of in-
vestigations principally explain why the
judicial system is rapidly falling behind


in coping with existing crime rates and
is beginning to manifest an inability to
prosecute or deter serious crimes of
property and violence. Woefully de-
ficient investigative abilities shift law
and order resources from serious crimes
to petty crimes, from hardened crimi-
nals to first offenders. The full force of
the law thereby increasingly falls upon
shoplifters, highway traffic violations
and drunks, while rapists, streetwise
and hardened criminals enjoy increas-
ing immunity from justice.”
But amid the gloom is hope.
Of a population of more than 3 mil-
lion, more than 2,600,000 Papua New
Guineans live in rural areas which have
informal village controls and in many
cases village courts and where the ineffi-
cient state aparatus is little seen.
The village courts particularly are a
success, says Clifford, and the courts
and village elders appear to have a
growing influence for good probably
doing more than they are legally
entitled to do. But it is working.
The report recommends that the
PNG government recognise the import-
ance.of informal and community insti-
tutions in the maintenance of order and
use its official resources, including the
police, to complement and support
them. □
NEW ZEALAND
Lange moves
towards
broader horizons
By IAN TEMPLETON
NEW ZEALAND Prime Minister
David Lange, in a swing around some
of the world’s capitals, has invested his
first venture into global diplomacy with
the exuberance which has become his
political trademark. Despite a coolness
in the United States arising from his ban
on visits of nuclear warships, Lange was
warmly received when he addressed the
United Nations General Assembly. In
Britain where New Zealand’s former
prime minister Sir Robert Muldoon
liked to think he had established a
special relationship Margaret
Thatcher gave Lange a convivial lunch
at Chequers. An even more hospitable
welcome awaited him in New Delhi. He
had previously signalled that he
planned to reopen the New Zealand
high commission which had been closed
by the previous government.
Though the Muldoon administration
had argued that the withdrawal of its
mission in New Delhi was a cost-saving
measure, observers had interpreted it as
a characteristic Muldoon response to
criticism of some of New Zealand’s
policies, particularly in allowing the
Springbok rugby tour in 1981. Lange
announced in New Delhi that his gov-
ernment was appointing the conqueror
of Mt Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary, as
its new high commissioner in India and
Nepal. Hillary, now a benign 65, has
not yet blunted his sense of adventure
and had been planning a fresh exploit
but has turned instead with enthusiasm
to the prospect of building a new bridge
between the people of India and of New
Zealand.
Hillary, in the decades since he
climbed Everest, has returned again and
again to the Himalayas, building
schools and hospitals. He says he is no
diplomat and certainly he is unlikely to
be starring on the diplomatic cocktail
circuit. Yet in selecting Sir Edmund,
arguably New Zealand’s most famous
citizen internationally, Lange is seeking
to break the pattern of foreign relations
established during the Muldoon era,
when the country became locked into
an increasingly introverted attitude.
Lange wants to balance the traditional
orientation towards Britain and the US
with a fresh awareness of New Zea-
land’s place on the Pacific rim, where
the big growth markets of the future lie.
In pursuing his campaign for nuclear
disarmament he sees Indira Gandhi as a
natural ally who might give him an
entree to the leaders of the non-aligned
nations.
Not that Lange intends to neglect re-
lationships with the US and Britain.
That is evident from his nomination of
former prime minister Sir Wallace
Rowling as ambassador to Washington
and of Joe Walding, who was minister
for trade in the Kirk-Rowling govern-
ment, to be high commissioner in Lon-
don. For the Canberra post he has ap-
pointed Graham Ansell, a career diplo-
mat who has been deputy secretary of
foreign affairs after serving as ambassa-
dor in Japan. With easy, informal, al-
most day-to-day contacts with the
Hawke government at ministerial level,
Lange sees the need for a professional
diplomat to keep a finger on the pulse of
the Canberra bureaucracy.
Lange’s enthusiasm to carve out a
larger role for New Zealand on the
world stage is reflected in his decision to
detour on his way home, to Noumea.
That follows discussions he had with
French Foreign Minister Claude Cheys-
son in New York on the situation in
New Caledonia. New Zealand is al-
ready involved in this, the remaining
decolonisation problem in the Pacific,
as a member of the group of five in the
South Pacific Forum chosen to discuss
New Caledonian independence with the
French and with the Independence
Front. Since the August meeting of the
Independence Front it has been re-
formed into the Kanak Socialist Na-
tional Liberation Front and there have
been reports that the new group has es-
tablished links with Libya. It appears
the front plans to be moving faster than
the metropolitan government in Paris,
has conceded. □

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
David Block -the man at the
eye of the corporate storm
The $2OO million partial bid for Mayne Nickless brings takeover strategist
David Block and his team into the ring as defenders. DA VID HASELHURST
profiles the master merchant banker.
MERCHANT BANKER David Block
has an easy familiarity with mega-
money he airily estimated last week
that his firm had been involved in take-
over bids worth probably at least $3
billion.
By the end of the week, that estimate
had increased another $2OO million or
so. Shortly after 2pm last Friday, the
loud-speaker announced to the floor of
the stock exchange that Australian
Paper Manufacturers was bidding $3.52
a share for 51 percent of transport giant
Mayne Nickless Ltd. The bid values
Mayne Nickless at $4OO million.
For months beforehand, however,
Mayne Nickless had been conferring
with Block and his team at Lloyds Inter-
national to prepare contin-
gency plans against a possible
raider.
APM got a head-up start
by plunging into the market
ahead of the announcement
and snapping up 20 percent of
Mayne Nickless at a cost of
$65 million. But, since it is a
bid for only 51 percent, it will
be opposed as being in the in-
terest of none of the share-
holders.
Block and his team have a
reputation for both successful
attack and defence in the
takeover arena and, as fellow
director Arthur Charles con-
fided last week: “Apart from
Mayne Nickless, another four
quite substantial matters burst
on us this morning which will
become news in the next few
weeks.”
Block and company take
this in their stride. They are
involved in takeovers, either
as advisers to the protagonists
or as the arbiters who supply
reports and valuations for
shareholders in companies
under siege.
Block is looking forward
to extending his horizons be-
yond the familiar corporate
scene into the public arena where he ex-
pects to have a say during the next few
years in the spending of perhaps a bil-
lion dollars in public funds.
In August, Block was appointed
chairman of the Darling Harbor Auth-
ority which will spend $2OO million on
the primary re-development of the
docks on the City of Sydney’s western
fringe into a cultural complex to be the
focal point of the bicentary celebrations
in 1988.
In his other major public role, as
chairman of the Sydney Opera House
Trust, he will be involved in the spend-
ing of further multi-millions of dollars
in refurbishments ahead of the
bicentenary.
Associates (l to r) Peter Mason, Tony Parkes and Arthur Charles
Block’s dark brown eyes focused
further into tomorrow, beyond the
bicentenary, as he estimated that “over
the next decade I will have participation
in huge public expenditures with Dar-
ling Harbor and the Opera House
maybe as much as a billion dollars.”
All that work in front of someone
else might be daunting.
But Block describes it as “an extra-
ordinary privilege, having been born
elsewhere, to have the chance to do
something and participate in the beauti-
fying of Sydney.”
Block’s progress has been chronicled
many times in the press, for he is no
shrinking violet about his opinions or
achievements.
He is a director of Lloyds
International Ltd and heads
up that group’s corporate ad-
visory services division,
having sold his own operation
into the British-based banking
group three years ago.
Twenty years ago in Sep-
tember, 1964 he arrived in
Australia at the age of 28 as a
migrant from South Africa.
He landed in Melbourne and,
as he has said before: “I didn’t
have tuppence.”
Block had left behind a
partnership in a legal practice
in Johannesburg after de-
ciding that in the long-term
South Africa would be an un-
tenable place for him to live
and raise a family. He knew
when he came to Australia his
honors Law degree from the
University of Witwatersrand
would not be recognised.
For 13 of his 20 days in
Melbourne it rained so he
followed the sun to Sydney.
He had a few introductions
but was becoming frustrated
and worried after walking the
traps for two months.
“Then suddenly I got three
job offers on one day,” he re-
called. One was with the fledg-


David Block: attacker and defender extraordinaire
ling merchant banker Darling and Co.
Darlings offered a starting salary of $5O
a week the lowest of the three offers.
“I don’t know what intuitively swung
me to Darlings,” he said, “but merchant
banking was a very new industry in
Australia and I didn’t know anything
about it. I hadn’t been trained in econ-
omics or commerce I’d never
analysed a balance sheet before.
“In that first year, I worked harder
than I’ve ever had to work in my whole
life. Every day I thought I would be
sacked; I didn’t understand what
people were talking about.
“So I began reading non-stop for the
next 12 months. I borrowed the lecture
notes from the MBA courses at Harvard
and Columbia and went through entire
courses. I consumed dozens of text
books on accounting, finance and econ-
omics.”
Within a few years Block became a
director of Darling and Co (now
Schroder Darling) and of all companies
in the group.
When Block joined Darling and Co,
it had a staff of 11. By 1972 the establish-
ment had risen to 115 employees and
Block decided to go out on his own with
a smaller operation specialising in cor-
porate advice and fund raising. Having
made a tidy pile in a real estate venture
(to be described later), he had some in-
dependence.
On Friday evening, June 30, 1972,
Block cleared out his desk at Darlings
and moved to open business the follow-
ing Monday as David Block and Associ-
ates Pty Ltd.
“I thought business would be slow,”
recalled Block, “and that afternoon I
had bought an armchair and reading
lamp for the office, expecting to catch
up on some novels.”
But on Monday morning he scored
his first business as an independent.
Cork Investments called him to assist
with its takeover bid for Nationwide
Finance. Within three months he had
three major retainers “then business
just cascaded by word of mouth.”
By the time David Block and Associ-
ates Pty Ltd merged into Lloyds Inter-
national on January 1, 1982, the firm
had been involved in takeover battles
involving about $1.5 billion. The biggest
had been advising CSR in its takeover
of Thiess Holdings ($4OO million) and
advising the Bank of NSW on the $7OO
million merger with the Commercial
Bank of Australia that resulted in
Westpac.
At the time of the merger into Lloyds
International, David Block and Associ-
ates was comprised of four equal share-
holders and directors. Apart from
Block, they were:
■ Peter Mason, a Bachelor of Com-
merce with first-class honors in Econ-
omics and the holder of a Master of
Business Administration (MBA) degree.
He came from Darlings.
■ Tony Parkes, with a PhD in organ-
ic chemistry and a certificate in Business
Administration from the London
School of Economics.
■ Arthur Charles, a chartered ac-
countant and former director of corpor-
ate advisory services at Schroder Dar-
ling who joined in 1978.
All four still form the core of the cor-
porate advisory services team at Lloyds
where they operate on a completely sep-
arate floor with their own electronic
card keys so that no other staff of the
Lloyds merchant banking group can en-
ter their domain of sensitive commercial
secrets.
They have been joined by two asso-
ciate directors Will Jephcott (an ex-
Sydney Oil Company executive who
started as a cadet treasury officer at
CSR) and Tim Burroughs (who joined a
month ago from a senior position at
Schroder Darling). The division has five
other corporate advisers in Sydney, two
in Melbourne, the corporate finance ex-
perts, administration manager Bob
Seddon and six secretaries.
“That’s as big as we wish to grow,”
said Block. “We can then be very selec-
tive about what work we do.”
Lloyds’ corporate advisory business
is based on continuing advice to 30 or
35 client companies which pay annual
retainers plus fees for work done. In the
past year, the firm has also undertaken
some 60 assignments for non-retainer
clients.
The retainer client list includes such
names as CSR, James Hardie, OPSM,
the MLC, Westpac and ACI Inter-
national.
Block believes he must go to great
pains to avoid any conflicts of interests.
He publicly proclaimed when he hung
out his shingle that he would eschew
public company directorships.
He made what he described as “the
unique exception” in 1977, however,
when he was invited to join the board of
CSR Ltd. “I regard that really as a civic
duty,” he said.
“It is one of Australia’s most import-
ant companies and I was honored and
privileged when they wanted me to join
the board. But I don’t make a living out
of it with director’s fees of $13,000


and tax at 60c in the dollar, there’s ab-
solutely nothing left.”
Two months ago, Block permitted
himself another exception when Trinity
Properties Ltd listed with him as chair-
man.
Trinity combines an old team with
whom Block made his first real money
in a coup in 1972. His other directors in
Trinity are property developer Lyndsay
Shaddock and solicitor Tony Carroll. If
it does as well as their earlier perform-
ance it will be sensational.
In the late 19605, David Block Hold-
ing Pty Ltd (a company in which Block
and others held shares) took a minority
interest in a company called Apprecia-
ting Assets Pty Ltd. It had as its main
asset a 1500 square metre site on
Clarence-Margaret and Kent Streets,
Sydney. Shaddock and Carroll were
shareholders, along with accountant
Warren Wearne.
In 1970, Appreciating Assets was
taken over by the listed ICD Ltd and
they joined forces with the likes of Fred
Millar, Charles Berg and Sir Peter
Abeles. David Block Holdings had
149,000 ICD shares.
In March, 1972, ICD made a stun-
ning capital return of 49c in every 50c
share, re-consolidated the remaining lc
paid shares into fully-paids, followed
that with a 49-for-l bonus share issue
and the result was that the shareholders
held the same number of shares as pre-
viously but had in their hands most of
the money back in a tax-free capital re-
turn. A few months later, St James
Properties Ltd made a successful take-
over bid at $1.70 a share for ICD. □

CREDIT CARDS
Advisers may
be paid
by plastic
By MICHAEL MEAGHER
WHEN BILLED by their investment
adviser, Australians may soon be able to
numb any pain at least temporarily by
paying with a credit card. American Ex-
press is talking to some of the leading
investment advisers with national repre-
sentation about the possibility of a link-
up with its card.
Such a joint venture arrangement is
one of the projects at which Amex is
looking in the financial services area
where its general manager for Australia,
New Zealand and the Pacific Bob
Gilman sees the card as being a
“facilitator for many things.”
Gilman sees great growth potential
in the corporate area. Some 75 percent
of Amex turnover comes from the busi-
ness sector. Amex plans to stay the
dominant force in the top end of the
credit card market which has become
markedly more competitive over the
past year with the fast growth of Visa
International and Mastercard.
Amex card-holder numbers have
grown steadily to 500,000 in its 10th
year which, at an average annual expen-
diture of $2OOO by members, means
commissionable revenue of about $1
billion.
Many observers of the plastic card
industry believe that it is close to satura-
tion point. Amex’s penetration in Aus-
tralia, measured by cards per thousand
of population, rates third only to that in
the United States and Canada. This ap-
pears to back up the saturation argu-
ment but Gilman says that “a lot of
people were saying in 1980-81 that Aus-
tralia had reached a peak penetration-
wise but, since 1982, card-holders have
in fact doubled.”
Amex has stayed on top by project-
ing exclusivity snob appeal. Gilman
proudly states that 35 percent of appli-
cations for the card are turned down.
And Amex has been choosy with its
merchants. It has 1 million signed on
world-wide and some 50,000 in Austra-
lia while the closest competitor (ex-
cluding Bankcard which is a runaway
leader with some 4.5 million card-hold-
ers), Visa International, has 295,000
members and 65,000 merchants in Aus-
tralia.
In competing, Amex can be expected
to promote the services and world-wide
network which have backgrounded its
growth.
The corporate area is a prime target.
Gilman says that 60,000 of the 425,000
green cards are corporate cards. The
selling point of these is that they allow
companies to keep a check on exactly
what employees are spending while on
excursions. Gilman says that the cor-
porate card-holder, often also carrying
a personal card, spends about 50 per-
cent more than the private green card-
holder.
The move to secure a marriage with a
financial adviser is in line with others by
Amex to provide personal, tailor-made
financial services to its high-profile sub-
scribers. Amex generates revenue of
about $lO million (on which its profit
margins are very healthy) from activities
including its Health Insurance Extra
Cover which is competing successfully
against private health funds and also
offers life insurance for travellers. □

WILDCAT
Bone-pointing over NT casinos
ASSOCIATES of Northern Territory
Chief Minister Paul Everingham last
week drew journalists’ attention to an
advertisement in the public notices sec-
tion of The Advertiser newspaper in
Adelaide. The advance notice was of an
application in the Supreme Court of
South Australia to wind up Eslea Hold-
ings Ltd, formerly Ipec Holdings Ltd.
The mover was Fenchurch Insurance
Brokers Ltd. When approached,
Fenchurch would not comment.
Ipec, was the holding company for
Federal Hotels and other Gordon Bar-
ton and Greg Farrell interests, now con-
solidated into TAL Holdings Ltd in
which Farrell is the major shareholder.
Federal proclaimed itself to be the
victim last week when, after passing
special legislation, Everingham’s gov-
ernment sacked it at 3am on Monday
from running the casinos in Alice
Springs and Mindil Beach, Darwin.
Everingham proposed to hand over
management to Diamond Leisure Pty
Ltd, a venture between Pratt Hotels, of
the United States and Aspinalls of Lon-
don.
Ownership will go to a property trust
in which a big Japanese construction
company, Kumagai Gumi, will have a
substantial interest. The rest will belong
to an NT property trust comprised,
hopefully, of local investors.
Everingham has employed an influ-
ential Brisbane public relations com-
pany with Liberal Party connections to
try to head off the bad vibes attached to
his sacking an Australian company in
favor of overseas interests. He would
like the controversy to die down before
he contests the next general election.
In debates in the NT House of As-
sembly, Everingham hinted strongly
that Federal was in a serious financial
position and he had to move before the
casinos were placed under receivership.
Accordingly, the proposed SA action
was put forward as indicating
Everingham’s fortunate timing.
Federal Hotels managing director
John Haddad (also a TAL director)
refuted the allegations. He said the
Fenchurch claim went back to IPEC’s
Southland Insurance debacle. It
amounted to about $125,000 and the
matter was disputed, although the
money had been paid into court pend-
ing adjudication.
“With casino interests in Tasmania
and bidding for further casinos in South
Australia and Western Australia, we
have had to be seen to be upright and go
far beybnd what would be normal busi-
ness practice,” Haddad snapped during
an interview in Melbourne on Friday.
He said Federal was trading profit-
ably and had come out of its squeeze
caused by a major building program
and high interest rates.
Although Haddad said Federal
“couldn’t fight” a government, it is
claiming $55.1 million compensation
more than Everingham has offered
and has issued writs against him person-
ally for statements he has
made outside parliament.
What really irks Federal
is that, while it was mana-
ging the casinos, it paid a 25
percent tax on gambling rev-
enue; the new management
is to pay only 8 percent.
In the pipeline
WILDCAT has discovered
another brokerage firm in
the pipeline: Bond Street Se-
curities Pty Ltd, whose direc-
tors are Colin Brown and
Jesse Bishop and company
secretary lan Herron. The
Bishop is Jesse junior, not
senior (he has been in retire-
ment from broking for al-
most 20 years, on the Gold
Coast). Jesse Bishop junior
is making a move back into
broking after a brief stint in
futures with BT Australia.
Brown is an institutional
dealer who has spent time at
A. C. Goode & Co, Bain &
Co and Ross McFadyen &
Finding value
RESOURCES analyst Dr lan Storey
has prepared a comparative rating of oil
and gas stocks with established reserves
and concludes that BHP is by far the
cheapest entry into that resource sector.
All the stocks in the accompanying
table have been compared on the basis
of the net present value of their oil and
gas reserves and their other assets
against share prices on September 26.
Few of the prices have changed sig-
nificantly since. In the case of BHP, the
share price had edged up late last week
from $10.15 on September 26 to $10.35.
That compares with Storey’s estimate of
a net worth for each BHP share of
$16.25 made up of $9.75 for oil and
gas assets and the balance for other
assets. This was calculated on BHP
having to back its 452 million shares
with reserves of 940 million barrels of
oil (valued at $3440 million) and gas re-
OIL AND GAS
ASSET VALUE ANALYSIS
serves with a net present value of $lOl5
million. On that basis, BHP is selling at
a discount on assets of 36.3 percent.
Although the study was released only
last week, Bridge Oil and Bell Resources
share prices have firmed since it was
undertaken to reduced their present dis-
count on assets.
Based on figures late last week, the
cheapest seven stocks on a comparative
basis of share price to assets were:
Assets Shares Discount
Stock $/share at Oct 3 on assets %
BHP $16.25 $10.35 -36.3
Bridge $3.55 $2.75 -22.5
Moonie Oil $4.05 $3.15 -22.2
Hartogen $2.84 $2.25 -20.7
Santos $8.29 $6.60 -20.3
Bligh Oil $l.OB .88 -18.7
Bell Resources $5.85 $4.85 -17.1
Prices of the other stocks have not
changed greatly since the study was
undertaken. □

Salary scales
THE MASSIVE shake-up under way
throughout the broking industry has re-
vealed extraordinary ranges in the sal-
ary scales for people doing similar jobs.
Putting his staff together has given
Rene Rivkin an insight into the “tur-
moil the industry is in at the moment.”
He told Wildcat that he is “terribly
surprised at the divergence of salaries
paid to people.” Rivkin says some insti-
tutional fund managers command
$lOO,OOO and more a year while others
make less than $50,000.
He says that salaries for floor oper-
ators range between $lB,OOO and
$75,000 and for research analysts be-
tween $25,000 and $125,000.
There is no doubt, though, about
who is calling the shots in broking fol-
lowing de-regulation. Rivkin says: “The
institutions tell you what the rates are.
Rates are in the 0.5 to 1 percent range
with many deals as low as 0.2 percent
and at least one instance of a 0.1 percent
rate.” Rivkin says rates have not
changed much, although “some dis-
counts” are being offered to private cli-
ents. Like most brokers, Rivkin has
scrapped the $5 order fee.
THE CHARTIST
Peko shakes off downtrend
by Russell Lander
IN COMMON with other leading
mining stocks, Peko Wallsend Ltd has
performed very badly on both an 18-
month and a four-year view. The ac-
companying charts, however, suggest
that Peko may now be close to a major
trend reversal.
The Bridge Data monthly bar shows
that in the bull market of 1982/1983
Peko reached a peak of $8.06, a far cry
indeed from the record high of $l3 es-
tablished in 1980. The chart also bears
out that the latest primary downtrend
has been broken over the past two
months. This is brought into finer focus
by the weekly range chart which carries
a 20-week moving average overlay.
It is also interesting to observe that
this moving average line has been
pierced for the first time since Sep-
tember 1983. Another point worth
making is that the year-on-year
Coppock Indicator on Peko is starting
to round out, having fallen deep into
negative territory. This pattern is remi-
niscent of the major reversal signalled
by the Coppock in 1982 when Peko was
in the same price range as it is today.
It could be that, in the absence of a
fireworks display in the major metals
market, the big mining houses will go
into a lateral base pattern rather than
embark on another switchback assault
on the heights. Either way the Coppock
Indicator would begin snaking its way
up the page.
Cautious traders will of course wait
for a clear buy signal on the Coppock
before jumping into the water. Such a
signal would be accomplished if there is
a rise in the value of the Coppock in any
given month over the level of the pre-
vious month.
Peko is a diversified mining group
producing copper, gold, sheelite (ore of
tungsten), beach sands, coal and ura-
nium (via its 32 percent stake in Energy
Resources of Australia Limited). Tung-
sten is the only one of these materials
currently showing any promise on the
charts but here again the signs are still
only tentative.

A speedster that ran flat out for 24
hours recently at the Surfers Paradise
International Raceway
To its credit the car established no
less than 36 best-in-its-class records.
These being 23 for Australia and 11
for the world.
While you might have been look-
ing at other makes of cars on April 24th
and 23th, the 360 GLT was blistering
the track with very quick '/ 4 mile and l /i
km times.
It coaxed records of endurance
out of distances of 300,1000 and 2000
kilometres.
The 360 GLT also returned 2646.6
kilometres for the 24-hour run.
So it’s a car not just with speed, but
heart.
Of course, this isn’t just a cleverly
engineered Volvo ploy to impress you.
The judges of Australia’s motor
sport controlling body, CAMS, super-
vised this trial.
They clicked the stopwatches and
remained impartial.

A sojourn in the real world
by Bert Kelly
A FEW weeks ago I said that I was go-
ing out into the wilderness to cry with
the former head of Treasury, John
Stone, and other hardy souls in an effort
to alter our wage fixing system to make
it more flexible and more suitable to our
present circumstances. Well, I have
talked things over with Mavis and she
has agreed to let me go now that she
knows that “that nice Mr Stone will be
there to look after you, dear.” I could
not help smiling at the thought of Stone
shielding me from trouble but I had
sense enough not to say so. Mavis
packed me up a lot of rough clothes and
thick sandwiches and sent me out into
the wilderness saying, as I went out the
door, that she supposed I would be back
on the weekend to get my clothes
washed. I think she is sick of my hang-
ing around the place.
Fred came too. Since reading Stone’s
Shann Memorial Lecture, Fred has read
Orwell’s Animal Farm and he is ob-
sessed with the fear that he might meet
the same sad fate as Boxer, the big,
faithful work-horse which was over-
worked by Napoleon, the pig dictator in
the book, and died. The picture of Fred
killing himself with overwork is a trib-
ute to his imagination which often
startles me. I think his real motive for
coming was to be close to Stone.
Eccles wanted to come with us when
he found that he would not be alone.
Eccles is always nervous when away
from his ivory tower in Canberra and
hates being in the bush. I remember
once, when I persuaded him to leave the
bitumen with me, he was sleeping on his
swag on the Birdsville track and I used
to see him reach out to nervously touch
the wheel nuts on the Landrover to
make sure he was not marooned. But he
was happy to come with us, particularly
with Fred; he has more confidence in
Fred than in me. He had two big new
suitcases of gear.
It was a long walk to the wilderness
headquarters of our group. When we
got there, I was surprised to find how
many people were there before us. I had
thought that there would only be John
Stone, Professors Blandy and Niland,
Messrs Brown and Rowe, those two
stout hearts from Western Australia,
with Fred and me to do the rough work.
But evidently there are a lot of other
people who are as concerned as we are.
The first man I saw was lan McLachlan,
the president of the National Farmers’
Federation, who looked thin lipped,
angry and determined. There was also a
tent for unemployed people and this
was crowded.
Our headquarters had already been
named “The Rough Cruel World”
(RCW for short). We tried to put up a
sign saying this but the environ-
mentalists, who had arrived there al-
most as soon as Stone, had already put
up a lot of signs forbidding the erection
of signs.
Away in the distance we could see
the city, surrounded by its tariff wall,
where its citizens live in the past, so we
called it the city of the LIPs. We were
particularly interested in this tariff wall
which is beginning to crumble in parts.
It is much more important from an in-
dustrial relations point of view than you
might think. Up till now, many em-
ployers, particularly the metal manufac-
turers, have given in easily to pressure
from their powerful unions for wage in-
creases because they know that, if their
costs are so increased, they only have to
go to the government and get a tariff
increase to make it better. And because
our wages system is so centralised and
inflexible, wage increases won by this
kind of blackmail are quickly passed on
in the name of comparative wage justice
to other industries which just cannot
afford to pay them. This has been the
cause of much of our unemployment
and explains the presence of many of
the unemployed in their tent.
The condition of the tariff wall
around the LIP city is a matter of great
concern to us. And I am sure it has been
something of a revelation to Eccles. Up
till now he has concentrated on lec-
turing me, and anyone else who would
listen, about the damage tariffs do to ex-
porters by increasing the cost of the
goods they buy and the effect of this on
the CPI and so on. But now he is begin-
ning to realise that perhaps even worse
damage is done by the way tariffs allow,
even encourage, protected employers to
give in to excessive wage demands, and
these get passed on to unprotected in-
dustries, particularly exporters.
So the state of the tariff wall that pro-
tects the LIPs is a matter of great im-
portance to us who live in the RCW.
You may be wondering why this gov-
ernment seems now to see so clearly that
it would be irresponsible for it to in-
crease tariffs to enable protected indus-
tries to recover increased wage costs
wrung out of them by industrial action,
when the previous government did not
seem to worry. We will come back to
this next week. □

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A long shot with form on the board
THE BEST chance in the “spec” market
in the next few weeks still must be found
among the active “cheapie” oil ex-
plorers.
My pick this week is a rank long shot
but I like the confidence prevailing
among shareholders.
Canada North West Australia Oil NL
has been in and out of the portfolio with
varying success. Its last run here was in
November 1983 when I bought CNW
options for 4c and sold them in January
at 14c while the Turtle No 1 well was
going down on the Bonaparte Gulf off
the far northern coast of Western Aus-
tralia.
The well produced oil shows but was
no bonanza. Nevertheless, the move-
ment in the stock then endorses the view
that it is a good one to buy ahead of a
spud-in. (During the time we held the
options, the shares ranged between 23c
and 35c and they have traded between
19c and 90c this year.)
The company is well cashed up
again. Its parent, Canada North West
Land Ltd, held 44 million of the 68 mil-
lion 25c fully-paid shares on issue and
an equal number of options exercisable
at 25c each and due for expiry on Sep-
tember 30, 1984.
The Canadian parent exercised the
balance of its options some weeks ago
putting $8.5 million into CNW’s coffers
and the results of the public options
exercise will be known in a week or two.
But I’m told that around $1 million cash
was in by the end of last month and
directors are hopeful of a near full con-
version.
That would lift shares on issue to 136
million which, at the current price of
27c, values the company at $36 million;
not too bad if the options exercise adds
$14.5 million to the bank when es-
timated working capital ahead of the ex-
ercise was understood to be about $6
million.
The company is to participate late
this month in what can be described
only as a rank wildcat but it may cap-
ture the market’s imagination.
The Duyken No 1 will be the first
well to spud in the offshore Carpentaria
Basin which, I see, Sydney brokers Ord
Minnett are describing as analogous to
the Eromanga. The prospect is a four-
way dip closed structure, with no
known faulting through which any con-
ceivable hydrocarbon reservoir could
have leaked.
The primary objective is the Gilbert
River formation which is laterally
equivalent to the productive Namur
sandstone far to the south in the
Eromonga Basin. A secondary target is
in fractured cavernous limestone.
Participants include CNW (27.5 per-
cent), Ampol Exploration (27.5), Weeks
Australia, Kratos, Kimberley Oil (each
10), Cultus Pacific and York Resources
(each 5).
We have an interest through our
Kratos holding but I like the increased
leverage available for a punt through
CNW.
Another well portfolio on which to
keep an eye this week is the Lynwood
No 1 on ATP27OP on the Queensland
portion of the Cooper Eromanga Basins
80 km NNE from the Bodalla South
discovery well. Abrolhos has a 15 per-
cent equity.
Apart from that, two other stocks in
the portfolio reported encouraging
news last week:
■ Kalgoorlie Southern Gold Mines,
which we tipped in early August to have
a big turnaround, reported an even bet-
ter result than expected. Net profit from
its talc mining operations was up 156
percent to $1.68 million.
■ Offshore Oil also staged a turnaround,
with a net operating profit of $1,575 mil-
lion previously a loss. The Bridge-Off-
shore partnership will open its liquids
recovery scheme on the Boxleigh-Silver
Springs fields in November with a fur-
ther benefit to revenues this year.

EUROPE
An Informer
Betrays the Mafia
A member of the family breaks its code of silence
and triggers a worldwide manhunt for other mafiosi.
In best gangland tradition, the operation
was dubbed the “St. Michael’s Day
Blitz.” Early in the morning, nearly 3,000
Italian police officers blocked off the streets
of the Sicilian capital of Palermo. They
burst into houses, apartments and office
buildings, arresting dozens of suspects and
detaining relatives and associates as well.
Police search: More arrests are expected
ANSA PHOTOS
Meanwhile, a special Alitalia DC-9 stood at
the Palermo airport to fly 28 prisoners to
Pisa, where armored vans waited to rush
them to jails in Florence, Livorno and the
island of Pianosa. By nightfall, the Italian
Mafia had received its worst blow since
Mussolini cracked down on the mob: police
had arrested 66 suspected mafiosi in Paler-
mo and other Italian cities —and they had
arrest warrants for another 140 who re-
mained at large. “Those arrested are impor-
tant Mafia leaders,” said sociologist Pino
Arlacchi, an expert on organized crime.
“They touched the cornerstone of the Mafia
in Palermo.”
The dragnet followed the extraordinarily
detailed testimony of a single man: 56-year-
old Tommaso Buscetta, the first major fig-
ure in the Sicilian Mafia to break the code of
omerta, the traditional vow of silence. Ap-
parently embittered by a series of recent mob
wars in which his family was virtually exter-
minated, Buscetta provided Italian investi-
gators with a comprehensive description of
the Mafia’s internal structure and precise
information on 122 recent murders, com-
plete with a long roster of names. Much of
that testimony has been leaked to the press,
along with previously unknown informa-
tion that Buscetta has provided about mob
operations in the United States. Among his
more important revelations were new details
about a shadowy, Sicilian-run criminal or-
ganization that operates independently of
the U.S. Mafia. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, compared the parallel organiza-
tions to “two corporations that for 20 years
were doing business with each other.”
There was no real Italian precedent for
what Buscetta had done. Some officials
compared the testimony to the sensational
charges made by American mobster Joseph
M. Valachi in 1963, but Italian investigators
believe that Buscetta is better informed than
Valachi was. “We are at a turning point,”
declared Palermo’s chief prosecutor, Vin-
cenzo Panjo. “For the first time, we have
entered the Mafia structure.” While offi-
cials cautioned that the Mafia’s grip was not
broken, they were hopeful that other mob
figures might be encouraged to follow Bus-
cetta’s example. Visiting the southern Ital-
ian town of Paola at the weekend, Pope
John Paul II also called on Italians to break
“the tragic chain of vendettas” and “to have
the courage to wipe out omerta.”
Drug War: So why did Buscetta decide to
sing? The answer lies in the bloody heroin
battles that have transformed the Sicilian
mob since the mid-19705. Until then, about
100 top Mafia families—often interrelated
by marriage—focused most of their ener-
gies on traditional areas such as construc-
tion, agriculture, extortion, prostitution
and some drug smuggling. While overro-
manticized by many Sicilians today, the old
Buscetta arrives in Italy: The most significant blow to the mob since the days of Mussolini
Mafia did have its own set of twisted scru-
ples: politicians and police were to be “culti-
vated,” not murdered; women and children
were considered off-limits as targets, and
heroin was to be delivered only to the U.S.
market, where American mobsters assured
the Sicilians, as one investigator puts it, that
“it was only going to blacks and Puerto
Ricans, not to your grandsons.”
All that changed, however, when Ameri-
can and French officials succeeded in
breaking the so-called French Connection
in the early 19705, and Sicily succeeded
Marseilles as the world’s heroin capital.
With several laboratories each turning out
as much as 40 kilograms of heroin a week,
the traffic soon became too big for the old
families; new groups began fighting for an
increasing share of the action, and the old
unwritten rules were largely forgotten.
Wives died in ambushes along with their
Mafia husbands; so did their children.
Troublesome public officials were gunned
down with increasing frequency—and the
Mafia even began selling heroin in the Ital-
ian market, wresting it away from the Syr-
ians, Lebanese and Turks who had con-
trolled it until then. In 1982 and 1983, a


blow to the mob since the days of Mussolini
total of 253 persons were killed in mob
warfare in Palermo alone. “I no longer rec-
ognize this Mafia,” Buscetta told investiga-
tors. “It’s not the organization in which I
spent my life. I now believe injustice and that
is what I want to lend myself to.” That
account, however, seems a trifle self-serving.
A better explanation may be that Buscetta
simply found himself on the losing side of the
war between the godfathers.
Buscetta’s career parallels the rise of the
Sicilian drug business. He was first arrested
in 1959 for bootlegging cigarettes, an im-
portant Mafia activity at the time. Soon,
however, he began traveling to Brazil and
the United States. At one point he opened a
chain of pizza parlors in New York’s Little
Italy that reportedly served as a cover for
drug dealing. Arrested in New York in 1970
as an illegal alien, Buscetta jumped his
$75,000 bail and fled to Brazil, where he
allegedly continued his drug operations.
Two years later he was arrested there and
extradited to Italy to serve a jail sentence for
conspiracy and kidnapping. Returning to
Brazil in 1980, Buscetta assumed the name
“Jose Roberto Escobar” and served as a
“consul” for both the Sicilian and Ameri-
can Mafias. Italian authorities believe that
he was also involved in trafficking heroin
and cocaine.
Rubouts: But Buscetta had made the
mistake of allying himself with Gaetano
Badalamenti, who, according to Buscetta’s
testimony, served as chief of the Sicilian
Mafia’s supreme “commission” from 1971
to 1978. According to Buscetta’s account,
however, Badalamenti was ousted by the
rival Greco and Corleone Mafia clans,
which then attempted to consolidate their
power by ruthlessly wiping out anyone
that they considered an opponent. In Sep-
tember 1982, while Buscetta was still in
Brazil, two of his sons disappeared, appar-
ently the victims of a Mafia hit. The same
month, Buscetta’s brother and nephew
were gunned down while they were work-
ing in a glass factory. By some accounts,
Buscetta secretly returned to Palermo to
see if he could somehow end the warfare,
but soon realized that it was futile. In all,
at least 14 members of his family were slain
by what Buscetta described in his testimo-
ny as “bloodthirsty criminals.”
On Oct. 25, 1983, Buscetta was arrested
in Brazil on charges of carrying a false
passport. According to reports in Italy, he
told the arresting officers: “OK, I’m Tom-
maso Buscetta. Tell me how much I’ve got
to pay. My freedom is priceless.” But the
Brazilians were not impressed; instead of
releasing Buscetta, they kept him in custo-
dy and contacted the Italian police. The
following June, Italian magistrate Gio-
vanni Falcone and assistant prosecutor
Vincenzo Geraci flew to Sao Paulo. They
questioned Buscetta through intermediar-
ies for one week, receiving the first indi-
cation that he might be willing to open
up. But Buscetta was in considerable emo-
tional turmoil. On July 3, the day Brazil
approved his extradition, he attempted to
Luciano Liggio: A heavy burden of blame
ANSA
commit suicide. Then, on his flight back to
Italy, he sought assurance that he would
receive adequate security, for he was cer-
tain to be a marked man once he began to
talk. Nonetheless, his testimony began in
earnest almost the moment he stepped off
the plane. “Buscetta is perfectly conscious
ROBERTO KOCH—CONTRASTO, ANSA
Anti-Mafia demonstration, General Dalla Chiesa’s coffin: Despite growing revulsion, the mob still rules through intimidation


of the step he has taken,” says Geraci.
How credible is his account? Buscetta
himself was at pains to downplay his role in
the Mafia, claiming that his advancement
had been blocked by the fact that he had been
married four times. (Divorce is considered
to be a mark against those aspiring to top
positions in the Sicilian Mafia, although
mistresses seldom pose any problem—at
least to one’s career.) “I am only a soldier,
certainly not a general,” Buscetta testified.
“Women ruined me. For this reason I was
not promoted in the [Mafia].” Nor was he
terribly eager to discuss his personal activi-
ties, claiming that his primary occupation in
Brazil was looking after a fleet of taxis. Still,
investigators insist that Buscetta played a
vital role in the Sicilian mob. “He was a man
who was ascendant and had personal au-
thority,” says Geraci. “Independent of his
rank, [he] had enormous power in the Mafia.
He was a big capo and a fundamental pivot in
the Mafia organization. ”
Buscetta’s influence within the organi-
zation is best illustrated by the extent of
the information he conveyed. He offered a
complete rundown on the Mafia’s com-
mand structure, explaining how each clan
has its own territorial base. He even drew
the outline of each territory on a map of
Sicily. Each clan works relatively autono-
mously, he testified, but the supreme com-
mission, composed of representatives of
about 10 major families, makes all deci-
sions on major crimes and investments and
attempts to arbitrate intra-Mafia disputes.
Buscetta also described how the recent
mob wars reached right up to the commis-
sion itself. In one instance, Buscetta de-
scribed how commission member Salva-
tore Inzerillo ordered the 1980 murder of
prosecutor Gaetano Costa because Inze-
rillo “wanted to demonstrate that he was
An American Connection
It is called “the pizza connection” —a miniature Sicilian
Mafia operating alongside the old families of the American
godfathers. Now Tommaso Buscetta’s testimony has shed new
light on this mini-Mafia, and U.S. lawmen are well on the way to
cracking it.
According to Rudolph W. Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York, the
network is made up of Sicilians who
began arriving in America 15 to 20
years ago. Instead of enlisting in the
domestic Mafia, most of them alleg-
edly continued to report to a Sicilian
godfather, Gaetano Badalamenti.
Among the principal agents, said
Giuliani, were five of Badalamenti’s
relatives—Samuel Evola, Emanuele
Palazzolo, Giuseppe Trupiano, Giu-
seppe Vitale and Pietro Alfano. All
five men had inconspicuous looks—
“not like flashy ’3os-style gangsters,”
observed Giuliani. They also avoided
the traditional crime centers of New
York and Chicago, moving instead to
five small towns in the Midwest—
Temperance, Mich.; Milton, Wis.,
and the Illinois towns of Olney, Paris
and Oregon.
Using pizza parlors as fronts, they
allegedly established a multimillion-
dollar undercover operation, mostly
in heroin. According to U.S. authori-
ties, they got their supplies from Ba-
dalamenti, who in 1981 fled Sicily for
Brazil after a power struggle with
rival Italian godfathers. Lawmen say
that when the operatives talked long-
distance to “Uncle,” as Badalamenti
was called, they used a Sicilian dialect
specific to Palermo —and they reportedly spoke in code, placing
their orders in quantities of cheese, tomato paste and pizza
dough. To distribute the heroin, Giuliani says, they enlisted the
help of Salvatore Catalano, one of the reputed leaders of the
Bonanno clan, the New York Mafia family with the strongest
ties to Sicily. Giuliani speculates that money was rarely handled
up front in these drug deals, but was usually transferred indirect-
ly, often through Swiss bank accounts.
U.S. authorities began to uncover the pizza connection
about three years ago. U.S. Customs officials became suspi-
cious of Catalano, who was moving far more money out of the

country than he could have earned in his Greenwich Village
bakery. At first they suspected a simple money-laundering
operation. But when FBI agents were enlisted to tap Cata-
lano’s phones, they discovered he was making frequent calls to
the Midwest. The trail led to Badalamenti’s relatives, then to
Badalamenti himself in Brazil. Last April an indictment was
handed up against 38 defendants, including Catalano and the
five Midwest operatives. More arrests are expected when
Badalamenti is extradited to the United States from Spain.
How much the crackdown on the
Sicilians will help in the battle against
their American counterparts is an
open question. The Sicilians appar-
ently had direct links only to the
Bonanno family. The domestic Ma-
fia, meanwhile, remains extremely
hard to penetrate: it consists of only
24 families (including the notorious
five in New York), with 2,000 to
4,000 “made” (fully initiated) mem-
bers, and no more than 20,000 as-
sociate members. It still has the
same tightly knit structure it had in
the days of Joe Valachi. And while
it continues to earn most of its
money from illegal activities—gam-
bling, extortion, loan-sharking, pros-
titution, labor racketeering and
drugs—it has also diversified into
new businesses that allow it to
launder funds and occasionally even
turn a straight profit. Among the
fronts: restaurants, bars, real estate,
vending machines and private gar-
bage collection.
Troubles: Still, the Mafia is far
more vulnerable than it used to be.
Before the 19505, law-enforcement
officials weren’t certain that the
domestic Mafia existed. Since then,
three decades of investigations, ar-
rests and trials have taken their toll. In the past three years alone,
16 of the 24 family heads have been arrested, on charges ranging
from extortion to murder. The Mafia’s leadership is aging fast,
and it is having trouble recruiting new members. It is also facing
growing competition from other crime organizations, particu-
larly in the drug trade. So far its strongest defense has been the
code of silence. But U.S. authorities are hoping that Tommaso
Buscetta’s example will encourage more malcontents within the
American Mafia to come forth and tell their stories. Only if
omerta crumbles will the Mafia crack with it.
MARK WHITAKER with ANNE UNDERWOOD in New York


Victim of Mafia slaying: As times have changed, the old scruples have often been abandoned
very powerful.” The demonstration may
have succeeded all too well, for Inzerillo
was himself murdered in 1981.
Buscetta also offered a clue to the vicious
assassination of Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla
Chiesa, Italy’s top anti-Mafia police offi-
cial, in September 1982. The killing, he said,
bore all the hallmarks of a Corleone-style
hit, although the actual assassins were re-
cruited from the eastern Sicilian town of
Catania because “new faces were needed.”
Buscetta took pains to lay a particularly
heavy burden of blame on Luciano Liggio,
the imprisoned boss of the Corleone family.
He claimed that he was “a spectator” at the
1971 murder of prosecutor Pietro Scaglione
and saw Liggio personally participate in the
shooting. He also blamed Liggio for the
1979 murder of Judge Cesare Terranova, a
crime for which Liggio was tried last year
and acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence.
Buscetta’s most intriguing testimony
may also have been his weakest. The Mafia,
he said, is connected with Italian politicians
through “thousands of channels,” although
he claimed not to know whether
any politicians were directly em-
ployed by the mob. Buscetta’s
disclosures were sufficient to
prompt investigators to warn
former Palermo Mayor Vito
Ciancimino that he was under
investigation and to lift his pass-
port; Ciancimino called the
charges against him “incredible
and delirious.” In addition, Bus-
cetta testified, “one politician
wanted to get rid of [General]
Dalla Chiesa because he was be-
coming too much of a nuisance,”
but Antonio Caponnetto, the
head of the investigating division
in Palermo, says that Buscetta
seemed to have no specific infor-
mation to back up the charge.
The Sicilian Mafia may be the most pow-
erful mob in Italy, but it is not the only
one. Just about every city has an indig-
enous contingent of organized gangsters.
Some are merely local splinter groups of
the larger Sicilian bands, but a few run
independent operations that rival the Sicil-
ians in their scope—and in their violence.
The largest of these is the Camorra of
Naples, which for the last six years has
been split by a bitter war between its two
leading factions, the Nuova Famiglia and
the Nuova Camorra Organizzata. More
than 800 people have been killed in the
fighting, which has been brutal even by
Mafia standards. Victims have been
stabbed, burned, shot, strangled and some-
times hacked to pieces or disemboweled.
Entire families have been wiped out, and at
peak moments the war claimed a dead man
a day.
The killings were triggered by the ambi-
tions of one boss, Don Raffaele Cutolo,
head of the Nuova Camorra, who hoped to
extend his sway to territories controlled by
Sicilian drug factory: Heroin riches lead to bloody battles
CAVALLI —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
other families—despite the fact that he has
spent the last 21 years in jail. The Camorra
split into pro-Cutolo and anti-Cutolo fac-
tions, and though the fighting weakened
both sides, the factions have managed to
penetrate well into northern Italy. Milan,
Turin, Genoa and Bologna have all become
centers for Camorra drug running and illicit
business dealings.
The Animal: Like its Sicilian rivals, the
Neapolitan Camorra has been hurt by in-
formers. In 1982, Cutolo’s most vicious
killer, Pasquale (The Animal) Barra, broke
the family’s code of silence. Some 15 pentiti,
or squealers, followed him, and last year the
Italian police arrested or issued warrants
for 860 gangsters. This summer another 150
were put behind bars, moving a Naples
police prefect, Riccardo Boccia, to declare
jubilantly: “Cutolo is finished.”
Not everyone is so sure, however. The
killing has abated since the arrests, but it has
not ended. Many officials believe that as
long as there is money to be made in drugs
and other illegal activities, there will always
be gangsters. “If you destroy one clan, an-
other will rise,” says Fulvio Milone, an
Italian police reporter. And the Naples po-
lice face another complication in handling
the Camorra. As the testimony of Tommaso
Buscetta makes clear, many Neapolitan
gangs have recently allied themselves with
the Sicilian Mafia.
Even before Buscetta began to sing, the
mob was clearly on the defensive. Shocked
by the brutal murder of Dalla Chiesa,
Italian legislators rushed through a new
law giving magistrates sweeping new pow-
ers to haul in suspected mobsters, inspect
their businesses and bank accounts and
freeze their assets. In addition, the United
States and Italy have signed a mutual-
assistance treaty calling for a greater ex-
change of information on organized crime
and the drug trade, and the two nations
recently ratified a new, simplified extradi-
tion treaty that will make it easier to trans-
fer suspected mafiosi to the jurisdiction in
which they are in the greatest legal jeop-
ardy—and where, presumably, they are
more likely to talk. As a result, says Judge
Isnardi, “the contacts between
Milan and the United States are
probably better than those be-
tween Milan and Rome.”
The stepped-up enforcement
efforts have clearly had their ef-
fect. Following the discovery of
several heroin refineries, Italian
authorities last year won the
conviction of 59 mafiosi for in-
volvement in the American drug
trade. Those convictions may
have intensified the mob’s inter-
nal feuding as rival factions
moved in on the families most
weakened by arrests. And as it
becomes more dangerous to
maintain refining operations in
Sicily, mobsters have either
moved them to other places in


Italy or, increasingly, begun to
purchase pure heroin directly
from Southeast Asia. But that
tactic has dangers of its own.
Some suppliers are now by-
passing the Mafia middlemen
and shipping their product di-
rectly to the United States. By
one estimate, the Mafia still
con t rols about 60 percent of the
American heroin trade, but
Arlacchi predicts that the heat
created by Buscetta’s testimo-
ny “may accelerate the de-
struction of the direct con-
nection between Sicily and
the East Coast” of the Unit-
ed States.
According to American offi-
cials, yet another wave of ar-
rests is expected on both sides
of the Atlantic within the next
few months. Additional break-
throughs may arise out of
the so-called pizza-connection
case, in which 38 individuals, mostly Ital-
ian-born, were charged last April with
smuggling $1.65 billion worth of heroin into
the United States. The chief supplier was
said to be Buscetta’s former protector, Gae-
tano Badalamenti, who will soon be extra-
dited to the United States from Spain. Last
A historical depiction of the Mafia: 'Bloodthirsty criminals’
week Italian magistrate Falcone was also
making plans to travel to Brazil to interview
some of Buscetta’s associates. If both they
and Badalamenti open up, the information
they provide could prove invaluable.
The most immediate problem for the Ital-
ian authorities will be to ensure that Buscet-
ta’s charges stick. Prosecutors
have not forgotten the trial last
year of three gang members
charged with the 1980 murder
of Emanuele Basile, a police
captain in Monreale, near Pa-
lermo. After repeated threats,
the jurors finally ruled that
there was insufficient evidence
for a conviction. Two months
later, gunmen mowed down
Basile’s successor and two oth-
er officers —and, as usual, no
witnesses were willing to come
forward. The Basile case is re-
garded as particularly impor-
tant because it demonstrates
the Mafia’s power of intimida-
tion. Just last week police re-
covered the bodies of three
men —Salvatore Pisciotta, Le-
onardo Rimi and Calogero Ca-
ruso —outside Palermo. Rimi,
in particular, was a known
drug trafficker with links to
the Badalamenti clan. These
were the 42nd, 43rd and 44th
mob-related deaths in the Palermo area this
year, and they served as a reminder that the
Mafia will use every means at its disposal to
fight back.

ELAINE SHANNON in Washington
'I'm Outside. I'm Only a Soldier '
In the aftermath of the Mafia dragnet,
bits and pieces of Tommaso Buscetta’s
testimony were leaked to the Italian press.
Investigators would not confirm specific
statements from the leaked testimony,
but they did say it was a generally accu-
rate rendition. Excerpts:
On the Mafia Organization
At the base there is the “family” rigid-
ly anchored to its territory, in which they
divide themselves into “the men of hon-
or” or “soldiers.” [There are] the “small
group heads” and then at the top “the
head of the family” or “the representa-
tive” who uses his power with the help of
one or more advisers. . . . One only be-
comes a “man of honor” if you swear to
it. The “man of honor” must never ask
for any explanations. Detention in pris-
on does not produce any loosening of
those bonds. No murder can be commit-
ted without the consent of the family
representative. Executions are carried
out by the “men of honor.”
On the Mafia Leadership
The Mafia has always been directed by
a commission formed by the powerful
families. The number of members may
change, depending on the rise or fall of
this or that family. Some family groups,
however, have always had their repre-
sentatives on the commission: the
Grecos and the Corleones. For 10 years,
there was also Don Tano (Gaetano) Ba -
dalamenti, up until there was the deep
split which led to the Mafia war. The
commission has sovereign power over all
the illicit businesses in Palermo. It de-
cides on the investments and the big
crimes, judges the controversies between
the Mafia groups and defines the con-
fines of the territories within which each
group can operate autonomously.
On Relations With Politicians
The Mafia is an autonomous power
which deals with the politicians through
thousands of channels. I don’t know of
any politicians who are in direct service
of the Mafia groups. I only know that
[ex-Palermo Mayor] Vito Ciancimino
had some kind of relationship with the
Corleones.
On the Mafia in America
“Cosa Nostra” is not the only Mafia
which exists in America. There are other
crime organizations, some of which have
surpassed “Cosa Nostra.” For years the
relationship between the Sicilian Mafia
and “Cosa Nostra” was based on drug
trafficking. Now this traffic is in crisis
for two reasons: first, because “Cosa
Nostra” has decided that there are other
illicit activities which are more reward-
ing and less dangerous than the business
of drugs—the big business of the elimi-
nation of industrial waste, for example.
Secondly, the drug traffic is going
through a difficult moment in Palermo.
The Mafia groups do not have enough
money to buy morphine base or pure
heroin in big enough quantities to satisfy
the demand of the market. For these
reasons, the Mafia groups from Palermo
are recycling, hoping to invest their
enormous resources into construction.
On His Own ‘Mafioso’ Role
I’m outside of all those activities. I
went to Brazil to look after my own
businesses. 1 looked after my 250 taxis.
And in any case, I am only "a soldier” —
certainly not a general.
On Why He Talked
I did not speak because I wanted to
vindicate myself. 1 did it because “they”
broke the [Mafia’s] agreements, the in-
ternal rules. They are a bunch of blood-
thirsty criminals.


GREAT BRITAIN
A Party Against Itself
NEWSPIX INTERNATIONAL
Labor leader Kinnock, confrontation between picketers and police: An unpopular coal strike divides the party and the country
Labor’s conference turns into the Blackpool Follies.
Over the years, the genius of Britain’s
Labor Party has been to speak for the
working class in tones that appealed as
well to the sympathies of intellectuals and
suburbanites. Under its recent leaders, that
has become a lost art; increasingly militant
socialists have pulled the party so far to the
left that it risks permanent minority status.
And at last week’s party conference at the
seaside resort of Blackpool, the lemming-
like march continued: ignoring the moder-
ates’ warnings, the 1,300 delegates veered
ever farther left—perhaps out of sight of
the British electorate.
Most party leaders had hoped the Black-
pool conference might reunite their frac-
tured party during one of its most trying
periods in decades. The seven-month-old
strike by coal miners seems only slightly
closer to a settlement than it did in March,
and violence by pickets and police continues
to dismay—and alienate —the public. The
meeting was also the biggest test of leader-
ship yet for Labor chief Neil Kinnock, who
took command of the party last year follow-
ing its thrashing by Conservatives in the
general election. Kinnock’s support for the
miners has been perceived by some mem-
bers as lukewarm, and both he and his party
have lost ground in recent public-approval
polls. Still, he had managed to re-
tain a certain semblence of authority
through it all. There was, after all, one
thing everyone in Blackpool could agree on:
their dissatisfaction with the performance
of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
But it was the miners’ strike and the
violence surrounding it that dominated the
conference. Arthur Scargill, the battling
head of the National LTnion of Mine-
workers, pressed hard and won passage of
a resolution blaming the strike on the gov-
ernment-controlled National Coal Board,
and maintaining that the violence—which
has left two dead and hundreds on both
sides injured—was wholly the fault of the
police. Kinnock had hoped to steer the
conference away from the conflict, but
once the vote had been taken, he sought to
moderate the party’s position by declaring
himself opposed to violent acts by both
strikers and police.
The dispute has been costly to Labor ever
since Scargill issued the strike order. At
issue was a proposal by the Coal Board to
close 20 unprofitable mines and lay off as
many as 20,000 of the country’s
184,000 miners. But Scargill
neglected to put the strike to a
vote, leading a judge to declare
it illegal. And about one-fourth
of the miners themselves re-
fused to walk out and have
stayed in the pits. Although
most British unions have ex-
pressed solidarity with the
striking miners, a few have
not. Polls show that the British
public largely supports the po-
lice, who have been shown on
television being pelted by
stone-throwing miners. An an-
Scargill: Tough talk
CHERRUAULT— CAMERA PRESS-JEANETTE HARRIS
gered chairman of the Police Federation
warned last week that some officers may not
wish to serve under an antagonistic Labor
government that has gone on record in sup-
port of the violence.
Lording It: Kinnock’s dilemma helped
Scargill and the left set the tone of the entire
conference. Delegates turned down a Kin-
nock proposal that would have reformed
the renomination procedure for Labor
members of Parliament by opening it to a
vote of all local party members instead of
leaving it in the hands of the leftist-dominat-
ed local constituency committees. But a
leftist motion supporting the illegal acts of
local governmental councils in exceeding
the Thatcher government's spending ceil-
ings passed easily. Scargill continued to en-
joy his measure of celebrity during the
week. Miners appealing for financial sup-
port sold Arthur Scargill T shirts. And the
46-year-old union chief defiantly ignored a
summons to appear in a London courtroom
to face possible contempt-of-court charges
after the strike was declared illegal. Scargill
called the judge’s ruling “utter nonsense,”
and vowed to go to jail before “betraying
one's class.”
Kinnock's only significant
victory of the week was seen by
some as a death knell for the
party. The delegates over-
whelmingly approved a resolu-
tion committing Labor to a
policy of unilateral nuclear dis-
armament and the closing of
U.S. nuclear bases on British
soil. Kinnock, who sides with
the antinuclear left wing of the
party on defense policy, was
committed to reaffirming the
position, despite the fact that it
is extremely unpopular and


widely blamed for the severity of La-
bor’s 1983 election loss. A stronger
resolution, calling for the closure of
nonnuclear U.S. bases as well and the
expulsion of the 25,000 American
troops in Britain, lost by a 2-to-1 mar-
gin. Party moderates criticized the
nuclear disarmament decision as po-
litically suicidal and militarily un-
wise. “I cannot support taking unilat-
eral decisions that will have a
profound effect upon our allies and
also upon the Warsaw Pact,” former
Prime Minister James Callaghan told
the delegates.
Left Turn: Though Labor leaders
blustered that the conference had
taken the party “an extra step toward
victory in the next general election,”
their opponents surely couldn’t help
but grin at the goings on in Blackpool.
By the end of the week, the Labor
Party had done little to erase the no-
tion that the militant left was in firm-
er control than ever. And party lead-
ers had jettisoned none of last year’s
political stances, even though they
were soundly rejected by British vot-
ers. Social Democratic Party leader
Antinuclear demonstration: A policy of disarmament
JOHN REARDON— BLACK STAR
David Owen chastised the party’s
delegates for what he called “Scargill-
ism.” Long-time Liberal Party chief
David Steel was even more critical.
“The Labor Party has been totally
taken over by the hard left and its
electoral credibility is shot to pieces,”
he said. “The conference marked the
end of Labor’s pretensions to be an
alternative government.”
British voters will, of course, have
the final say on that, although elec-
tions are not required until 1988.
Thatcher, who saw her own popular-
ity fall in the weeks just after the coal
strike began, has since made up some
of the lost ground. She also is in sure
control of her own party, whose an-
nual conference begins this week in
Brighton. None of the news for Kin-
nock and his fellow Labor leaders is
so promising. The delegates at Black-
pool may feel better for having assert-
ed their will, but few seem to have
bothered to take measure of the mood
of the British public. That is the defi-
nition of political folly.
WILLIAM BURGER with DONNA FOOTE
in London
Magician—Or Puppet?
He was called the “Welsh Wizard,” an orator so charismatic
he could charm a terrier off a meat counter —and raise the
British Labor Party from the slag heaps. Those, at least, were the
wishes of Laborites who elevated Neil Kinnock to the chairman-
ship of their party a year ago. At first, he did dazzle the public.
After he took charge, Labor’s approval rating climbed steadily
from an abysmal low of 28 percent in one survey after Margaret
Thatcher’s landslide in June 1983 to a draw at 39 percent each
with the Tories a year later. But as Britain’s violent miners’ strike
has dragged on, the polls have slumped again—and with them
Kinnock’s image as a magician and a party healer. Some
conservatives now deride him as a puppet of Labor’s far left
and have tagged him with a new nickname: “Kinnochio.”
Despite the setback, Kinnock, 42, may
yet be Labor’s best hope. His predecessor
was Michael Foot, a professorial Socialist
who seemed lacking in vigor. Kinnock, by
contrast, is mediagenic and knows it. The
day of his election, he took the obligatory
John Kennedy beach walk in Brighton
with his attractive wife, Glenys—and a
gaggle of photographers. Perhaps omi-
nously, he slipped and fell in the water.
Undaunted, he has since allowed himself
to be photographed doing a soft-shoe rou-
tine, appearing with a rock group and, at
last week’s party conference, performing
in a comedy revue. Conservative Party
Chairman John Selwyn Gummer accused
Kinnock of “razzmatazz and gimmick-
ry.” But polls judging his personal popu-
larity showed that, for a while at least, the
public bought the act.
Eventually hard politics interrupted
Kinnock’sjolly show. Ideologically, he is a
Kinnock revue performance: Confident
UPI
little hard to pin down, which may have accounted for his initial
popularity with both the far left and the moderate wings of his
party. His heart may be with the leftists; he joined Labor at 15
after hearing a rousing speech against Britain’s Suez intervention
by his local M.P., Nye Bevan. But he is pragmatic by nature and
willing to compromise with the centrists. His flexibility served
him and the party well enough—until the coal strike forced him
to take a stand. In July he joined Arthur Scargill on the platform
at a miners’ rally in Durham. The move put him solidly behind the
miners—and it undoubtedly cost him in the polls.
Rebuke: Since then, he has tried walking a tightrope between
strikers’ demands and their methods. He says that he approves of
the miners’ goals, but feels uncomfortable with their penchant for
stone-throwing at the picket lines. At the party conference in
Blackpool last week, he reminded his comrades of the socialist
commitment to the principles of democracy, respect for the law
and nonviolence. His remarks were an in-
direct rebuke of a party resolution passed a
day earlier that denounced police brutality
while ignoring the miners’ own violent
activities. Given the increasing militancy
of party regulars, Kinnock ran the risk of
being booed. Not so. Instead, he received a
two-minute standing ovation.
That, at least, was a reassuring sign that
many in the party would still back Kin-
nock’s brand of pragmatic socialism. But
the fact that the chairman was reduced to
struggling constantly to heal rifts within
the party didn’t say much for Labor’s long-
term prospects. With his exuberant man-
ner and fiery rhetoric, Kinnock may look
like a potential prime minister. But it seems
unlikely that he will ever actually become
one as long as so many of his cohorts
remain out of touch with the sentiments of
most British voters.

IRELAND
The IRA Loses an Arsenal
The Marita Ann under guard: An arms cache large enough to start a small war
PRESS ASSOCIATION
The three Irish naval corvettes took up
positions around the Skellig Rocks off
Ireland’s desolate southwestern coast.
Their prey was the Marita Ann, a 56-foot
trawler suspected of running guns to the
Provisional Irish Republican Army. As the
trawler hove into view the Navy vessels
challenged it, then fired tracer bullets across
its bow when it refused to stop. The five men
on board gave up without a fight. A search
of the Marita Ann turned up more than
seven tons of arms, ammunition and explo-
sives. One Irish detective said the arsenal
was “more than enough to start a small
war.” It was the largest confiscation of arms
bound for the IRA in more
than a decade.
The interception of the
Marita Ann may have pre-
vented a violent escalation
of IRA terrorism. Among
the 200-odd weapons found
aboard the trawler were two
sophisticated Browning ma-
chine guns capable of shoot-
ing down helicopters that the
British Army uses to patrol
the border between Ireland
and Ulster and set down
mobile army checkpoints.
The armaments also includ-
ed American-made M-15
and M-16 rifles, pump-ac-
tion shotguns, Korean-made
hand grenades and about
100,000 rounds of ammuni-
tion. The seizure seemed to
bear out warnings by North-
ern Ireland security forces of
an impending IRA offensive,
possibly timed to coincide with a British-
Irish summit meeting scheduled for No-
vember. But while the seizure of the arms
is bound to hamper the IRA, British and
Irish officials are not about to rest easy.
“The IRA is alive and killing,” said Irish
Justice Minister Michael Noonan. “Even
though this has been damaging to them,
they will continue.”
According to Irish police sources, the
United States notified Irish officials five
days before the seizure of the trawler that a
Canadian-registered ship had taken on a
cargo of weapons at a port on the American
East Coast. The ship’s progress across the
Two suspected gunrunners: Was there an American link?
PHOTOS BY PRESS ASSOCIATION
Atlantic may have been monitored by a U.S.
spy satellite. That could account for the
effective interception of the Marita Ann so
soon after it took on the arms cache from the
larger ship. One remaining mystery is what
happened to the ship after it offloaded its
weapons onto the Marita Ann. Sources in
Dublin say the vessel may have been carry-
ing arms for other terrorist groups. The
same sources speculate that the ship may
still be under surveillance —though at the
end of last week there was no official word of
its whereabouts.
Officials in Dublin charged that Ameri-
can supporters of the IRA provided the
arms. “There are still people in the United
States who . . . are willing to give aid to
purchase and send arms to murder Irish
people,” said Irish Prime Minister Garret
FitzGerald. Some Irish officials charged
that the weapons were bought with money
collected by the New York-based Irish
Northern Aid Fund (Noraid). That was
denied by Noraid. “This is all part of a
propaganda campaign,” said Noraid lead-
er Michael Flannery. “[The U.S. govern-
ment] has a pretty good intelligence opera-
tion and if it had evidence that Noraid was
involved we would all be in jail right now.”
The Irish investigation is still only in its
early stages. Whatever the investigators
learn, it is certain that the arms seizure will
not halt the flow of weapons from the
United States —or put an end to the IRA’s
activities.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA
Bonn’s Cool Welcome
To Uninvited Guests
For most tourists, Prague’s elegant 18th-
century Lobkowitz Palace is a historic land-
mark. But visitors from East Germany
sometimes seem more interested in the
building’s contemporary use. It houses
Bonn’s embassy in Czechoslovakia, and last
week nearly 100 East Germans jammed into
the mission seeking political asylum and
safe passage to West Germany.
The would-be emigres were an embar-
rassment for both German states. Bonn is
reluctant to rile East Berlin and spoil pains-
taking efforts at detente between the two
Germanys by offering the refugees asylum.
It took the unusual step of closing the em-
bassy to forestall another slew of uninvited
guests. For East Germany, the attempted
exodus surely dampened last weekend’s fes-
tivities marking the 35th anniversary of the
German Democratic Republic.

Donovan in the Dock
Booked in the Bronx: What did New York prosecutors find that the Feds did not?
NIK KLEINBERG
New allegations of fraud haunt the labor secretary.
The horde of reporters, cameramen and
sound technicians literally stampeded
Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan as he
made his way to the Bronx Criminal Court
building. Inside, he was booked, fingerprint-
ed and made to wait for hours during a
compulsory check of his prints against
known criminal records in Albany. Mean-
while, in a tense courtroom a motley parade
of characters —including a 19-year-old
chain snatcher—came before the judge.
Then, Donovan, seven of his former col-
leagues at the Schiavone Construction Co., a
New York state senator and reputed mob-
ster William Masselli
were charged with de-
frauding the New York
City Transit Authority
of nearly $8 million.
With that, Donovan
became the first sitting
cabinet official ever in-
dicted for a crime. The
labor secretary, who ar-
ranged to take an unpaid
leave of absence, im-
mediately pleaded not
guilty, as did his code-
fendants. Outside the
courtroom, he called the
indictment a politically
motivated “inquisition”
by Bronx District Attor-
ney Mario Merola. Cam-
paigning in Texas, Presi-
dent Reagan expressed
confidence in Dono-
van—and anger at “the
lynch atmosphere” facing the growing list of
his appointees dogged by charges of wrong-
doing. “The only ‘sleaze factor’... is on the
other side,” he said, “with their baseless
accusations that have all been proven false.”
Walter Mondale called Reagan’s comments
“not nearly good enough”; he urged him to
launch his own investigation and if neces-
sary, demand Donovan’s resignation.
In fact, Donovan has been the subject of
investigations ever since his confirmation,
Special prosecutor Leon Silverman, ap-
pointed to look into Donovan’s alleged mob
ties, twice determined there was “insuffi-
A growing list: The only ‘sleaze factor,' Reagan said, ‘is on the other side’
cient credible evidence” to prosecute the
labor secretary for any federal crimes. What
did Merola find that federal prosecutors had
not? Was the indictment, coming just five
weeks before the general election, politically
motivated—or was it long overdue?
Hit: The 137-count document itself of-
fered few clues. Merola explained that
Bronx prosecutors had “backed into” the
Schiavone case while investigating the 1978
murder of Salvatore Frascone. A partner in a
Bronx trucking company working for Schia-
vone, Frascone reportedly had refused to
accept a mob-sanctioned decision allowing
Masselli to take over the firm. His fatal
shooting in the Bronx remained unsolved
until Michael Orlando, a federal informant
serving time in prison, told authorities that
he had pulled the trigger while Masselli had
watched from a car. Masselli was the target
of extensive FBI wiretaps in 1979, and plead-
ed guilty to a cocaine and hijacking conspir-
acy. Brought in from a federal prison, Mas-
selli was also indicted for Frascone’s murder
last week along with an associate who alleg-
edly fingered Frascone for the hit. Both
pleaded not guilty.
Merola stressed that while Donovan was
not implicated in the murder, “those who
were [responsible] had a financial interest in
doing business with Schiavone.” As pros-
ecutors told it, Masselli formed his own firm,
Jopel Construction and Trucking Corp.,
with black New York state Sen. Joseph
Galiber in order to win Schiavone subway
subcontracts, 10 percent of which had to go
to minority-owned businesses. Digging a
subway tunnel under the East River, Schia-
vone and Jopel allegedly embarked on a
scheme of inflating Jopel’s expenses in re-
ports to the transit authority. Exactly how
the alleged bilking occurred was unclear
from the indictment, which charged Dono-
van, Masselli, Galiber and others with 1
count of grand larceny, 125 counts of keep-
ing false records and 11 counts of filing false
statements. Merola charged that Donovan
“knew all about the il-
legal transactions,” and
that the Jopel-Schiavone
relationship began when
Donovan himself signed
a $200,000 no-interest
loantoJopelin 1979.
Donovan’s attorney,
William Bittman, denied
that Donovan knew any
details of the billing ar-
rangements, or of the
minority reporting forms
Schiavone filed with the
NYCTA. Bittman also
complained that Bronx
prosecutors never told
Donovan he was a target
of the grand jury, merely
that he was wanted as
a witness. Armed with
preliminary information
about the probe, Dono-
van voluntarily took a


lie-detector test last month, and a private
polygraph examiner said he answered truth-
fully when he denied any knowledge that
Schiavone had submitted false reports. Ac-
cording to Bittman, however, the grand jury
never raised such matters during Donovan’s
testimony on Sept. 24. Bittman called the
indictment, dated that sameday, “a bunch of
crap,” and said he would move for dismissal
on the ground that there was insufficient
evidence to indict his client.
Silverman had come to much the same
conclusion in 1982. Though he was charged
with investigating possible federal —not
state —crimes, Silverman did scrutinize
Schiavone’s dealings with Jopel, including
the billing arrangements and the $200,000
loan. In his 1,025-page report, he noted that
one Schiavone official explained that “the
net effect was to increase the amount of work
attributable to a minority business enter-
prise.” Silverman declined to comment. But
one former investigator on the case said that
the arrangement was never hidden. “I don’t
understand how the TA lost money,” he
said. “On paper, this case is very thin.”
Silverman also interviewed Orlando but did
not know about the Frascone murder. Still,
it was unclear how that information had led
Merola to the Donovan investigation. Six
Silverman investigators listened to the FBl’s
857 tapes on Masselli for two full months,
but found no trace of Donovan’s voice and
only six innocuous mentions of his name.
Intent: What additional evidence Merola
may have remained a mystery. The Bronx
Democrat denied any political motives, in-
sisting that he had to beat the statute of
limitations, set to run out Oct. 1 on some of
the alleged crimes. Merola also said he was
not accusing the FBI of withholding evi-
dence in the case. Last week Attorney Gen-
eral William French Smith defended the
FBl’s investigation as “entirely thorough
and proper.” The federal Organized Strike
Force in Brooklyn, meanwhile, is conduct-
ing its own investigation into Schiavone’s
business dealings, and FBI and Justice offi-
cials planned to review the Bronx case for
anything federal prosecutors might have
missed. But without seeing more of Merola’s
hand, they predicted it would be hard to
prove that Donovan was personally in-
volved in transactions, many of which oc-
curred after he left Schiavone, let alone
prove criminal intent on his part.
Donovan and his codefendants were
scheduled to appear in court again on Nov.
12. Labor Under Secretary Ford B. Ford,
meanwhile, took over his duties —and some
department insiders said Donovan would
not be missed, since he had done little in
office but defend himself and antagonize
labor leaders. At the White House, chief of
staff James A. Baker 111 ordered Reagan
aides not to comment on the matter, but
most seemed unconcerned about the poten-
tial impact on the presidential race; some
Reagan campaign strategists called the case
a “dead issue” for the electorate. Voters
might be more interested in the fate of the
subway tunnel itself. Plagued by cost over-
runs, the $BOO million project, financed
largely by federal funds, will have just four
stops when it opens next spring, and serve
only about 2,000 riders at peak hours.

The Street-Smart D.A.
Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola stopped speaking to
the press shortly after he won Raymond Donovan’s indictment.
To those who know him, Merola’s silence was almost as surpris-
ing as the indictment itself. For
12 years the Democratic pros-
ecutor has frequently conduct-
ed bis business in New York’s
crime-infested borough before
reporters’ scratching pens and
the glare of television lights.
Through his most notable
cases —the 1978 “Son of Sam”
mass-murder trial and last
summer’s alleged Bronx day-
care sex scandal —Merola has
earned a reputation as a sophis-
ticated D.A. with plenty of
street smarts. He is also flam-
boyant—and his critics suggest
that Merola is more interested
in publicity and in his political
career than injustice. But now,
facing his riskiest case, Merola
has suddenly decided to play
close-lipped. “We had a job to do,” he said curtly after Donovan
was indicted, “and we had to do it.”
Donovan’s claim that Merola is conducting an “inquisition”
is nothing the 62-year-old prosecutor hasn’t heard before. In
1973 he reopened a 14-year-old investigation of Rep. Mario
Biaggi, who was then a New York mayoral candidate. Biaggi,
who as a young policeman killed a holdup man, accused Merola
of “responding to persuasion” in a “political attempt to destroy”
his campaign. The D.A. backed off, and no indictment was
returned. Later, Merola publicly identified a prominent surgeon
as a “primary suspect” in an attempted murder case; the surgeon
was never indicted. Merola was reprimanded by two judges for
announcing to the press that defendants in another of his cases
Merola: Battling Bronx thugs, sex criminals and ‘Son of Sam ’
DAVID HANDSCHUH— AP
were linked to the Mafia; the link was never proved.
The D. A. received his most resounding public slap last sum-
mer when he allowed a 62-year-old woman accused of molest-
ing children at a Bronx day-care center to be arrested in front
of whirring cameras and an angry mob. The woman was never
indicted, and Merola remained unrepentant. “It’s part of the
system,” he said. “We’re not
perfect.” New York City May-
or Ed Koch also chastised
the prosecutor for suggesting
that a city agency’s report
on the Bronx day-care scandal
was a “whitewash.” Merola
was equally unrepentant.
Gruff: Despite such contro-
versies, the barber’s son who
came up through Democratic
ward politics and the New
York City Council has the firm
respect of his colleagues. Mer-
ola “wouldn’t go after anyone
without good reason,” con-
tends Manhattan District At-
torney Robert Morgenthau,
who adds: “He’s a first-rate
D.A.” His reputation as an in-
novative prosecutor remains
intact, and his staff considers their gruff, baggy-eyed boss as
easily approachable. Even some Republicans are impressed by
Merola’s style. Says state Republican chairman George Clark,
“He’s tough on law and order, he runs a tough shop, he’s
conservative politically and he’s a family man.’’
Should Merola ever decide to run for mayor, Clark suggests,
he might even win the Republican endorsement. Merola himself
has been denying any such ambition for years. His term as D. A.
expires in 1987, and his prospects for re-election are as strong as
ever. Even if he loses his case against a Washington cabinet
member, chances are that criminals in the Bronx will have to
contend with Mario Merola for a long time to come.

An FBI ‘Rotten Apple’
The ranch home: A counterintelligence man with personal problems—and too many bills
SCOTT LINNETT— AP
The KGB sets a honeytrap for an agent on the skids.
She was an outspoken, 34-year-old Rus-
sian emigre with a model’s figure and
Greta Garbo’s chiseled blond looks. He was
a debt-ridden, 47-year-old FBI agent, repri-
manded by his bosses for poor performance
and a slovenly, overweight appearance.
Richard Miller, a 20-year veteran assigned
Agent Miller
AP
to the FBl’s counterin-
telligence squad in Los
Angeles, was supposed
to be monitoring suspi-
cious immigrants like
Svetlana Ogorodnikova.
Instead, he poured out
his myriad troubles to
her, falling into the
oldest spy snare of all —
thehoneytrap. In August
he reportedly offered
to sell classified FBI
documents to Ogorodni-
kova and her estranged
husband, Nikolay, for
$65,000. But last week
his fellow FBI men arrested Miller and the
two Russians —then absorbed the embar-
rassment of unraveling the case of the first
FBI agent ever charged with espionage.
“It’s a very sad day for us,” said FBI
Director William Webster. But it may turn
out to be little more than that. The bureau
assessed real damage as possibly minimal.
Miller apparently passed just one significant
document to the Russians —a classified, 24-
page manual entitled “Reporting Guidance:
Foreign Intelligence Information.” While
an FBI affidavit said the document “would
give the KGB a detailed picture of FBI and
U.S. intelligence activities, techniques and
requirements,” the manual contained no
agent names, sources or assignments. “He
was caught in a stage where the Soviets were
still assessing what they had in him,” said a
top FBI official. “The timing suggests that
the damage is not great. ”
‘MoneyMan’: Still, the FBI was obviously
mortified by Miller’s bumbling betrayal. At
a press conference in Los Angeles, tight-
lipped FBI spokesmen refused to detail what
the agency gingerly termed the “personal
relationship” between Miller and the wom-
an and would only concede that Miller’s
financial burdens—eight children, two
homes, an unsuccessful avocado ranch—
had probably “motivated him somewhat.”
As the FBI detailed the story, Miller’s
relationship with Ogorodnikova began in
May, but it wasn’t until August that
she described her role as a “major” in
Soviet intelligence and asked him to
work for the KGB, “for which he
would be well paid.” She introduced
him to her “money man,” Nikolay
Wolfson; Miller searched through
FBI records to discover that “Wolf-
son” was an alias used by Svetlana’s
husband. At their second meeting,
Miller insisted that he didn’t want
a long-term relationship with the
KGB; he would turn over secret FBI
documents in Mexico City in return
for $50,000 in gold placed in safety-
deposit boxes in Los Angeles and
$ 15,000 cash on delivery in Mexico.
On Aug. 24 Miller accompanied
Svetlana to San Francisco. While he
waited in a nearby restaurant, she
went to make a “drop” at the Soviet
Consulate. She took with her Miller’s
FBI credentials and badge, which she
said she needed for authentication.
On their drive back to Los Angeles the
next day, Svetlana told Miller that
they had been followed and photo-
graphed by the KGB.
‘Vacation’: If true, the KGB was not
alone. The FBI also had the couple
under surveillance. Svetlana with her
pro-Soviet views was hardly an incon-
spicuous figure in L.A.’s anti-Soviet
Russian community. Nor was Niko-
lay, who infuriated co-workers at a
meat-packing plant by singing Rus-
sian songs and haranguing them
about the virtues of the Soviet Union.
The couple distributed Soviet news-
papers, rented movie theaters to show
Soviet films, socialized with Soviet
consular officials and entertained lav-
ishly at Mischa’s, a popular Russian
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Last
year, they openly photographed dem-
onstrators at an American-Soviet Cultural
Society show. “We couldn’t believe it was
real spying because it was so obvious,” says
Alexander Polovets, editor of a Russian-
lan § ua § e weekl y “ Th ey weren’t smart
enough to be real spies.”
When routine surveillance of Svetlana
revealed her frequent meetings with Miller,
the FBI ordered a wiretap on her phone,
Agents began shadowing the couple to meet-
ings in parks, Malibu restaurants and a
French cafe in Santa Monica called The
Casino. Meanwhile, the tap was paying divi-
dends. An unidentified caller, speaking in
Russian, asked Svetlana when she and her
“friend” were going on “vacation.” Before
hanging up, he reminded her, “Have him
bringall the baggage with him.”
Svetlana booked flights to Vienna and
took Miller shopping for traveling clothes
at men’s stores in fashionable Westwood,
She instructed him to apply for a passport
indicating travel plans for Mexico. But the
day after Miller picked up his passport,
the FBI picked him up. At his home, they
found original FBI documents stamped “se-
Webster (left) and Smith: ‘A very sad day for us’


cret.” While the FBI was interrogating Mil-
ler, Svetlana was in a panic, calling his home
15 times in 7 hours. At her apartment, they
found Nikolay peering through the curtains
armed with a semiautomatic handgun. In-
side, they found spy paraphernalia such as
secret writing implements, code books and
microdots and a stack of Soviet propaganda.
Miller, who is expected to plead not guilty
this week, managed a wink and a smile for his
wife and oldest son in court. But last week’s
charges were the culmination of a series of
personal problems. His excommunication
from the Mormon Church last summer —
for reasons that were not clear —followed
reprimands from the FBI. His salary of
about $40,000 could not keep up with his
financial obligations. For a time he sold
Amway products out of a government car.
Then his alleged get-rich deal with the
Russians ended up resembling something
closer to the Pink Panther than le Carre.
Attorney General William French Smith
insisted that the Miller case exposed no
institutional failure —just a human one. Said
Smith: “Every now and then, a rotten apple
is bound to show up.” Perhaps most damag-
ing was the precedent: the FBI may not be
able to tell new agents that never has it had a
traitor in its ranks.

A Magazine’s Scoop
Leads to Spy Charges
Last August, when Jane’s Defence Week-
ly published three aerial photos of the Soviet
Union’s first big-deck aircraft carrier under
construction, it was an impressive scoop for
the new magazine published by the British
chronicler of warships, airplanes and weap-
ons systems. But the photos alarmed Penta-
gon officials —notably Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger—who thought the pic-
tures revealed too much about U.S. satellite
photography capabilities. Last week the
FBI arrested Samuel Loring Morison, a ci-
vilian intelligence analyst and grandson of
the late naval historian Samuel Eliot Mori-
son. The charge was espionage—for selling
the photos to Jane’s.
Morison, it turned out, was working both
for the Navy and for Jane’s —and he left
investigators a wide trail. His Navy supervi-
sor recognized the photos. FBI agents found
his fingerprints on the originals retrieved
from Jane’s. And by analyzing the ribbon in
Morison’s typewriter, investigators re-cre-
ated his letters to Jane’s editors warning
them that his office phone might be bugged
and asking for a full-time job. A spokesman
for Jane’s said the photos were unsolicited
and confirmed only that Morison was a
contributor to Jane’s Fighting Ships. Arrest-
ed near Washington and held in lieu of
$500,000 bond, Morison denied that he had
sent the photos to the Defence Weekly.
Black Veterans: A New War
U.S. soldier on patrol in Vietnam: ‘I believed in America ’cause I was an American ’
PHILIP JONES GRIFFITHS— MAGNUM
Black power was barely a theory when
Reginald Edwards enlisted in the Ma-
rines in 1963. “As a black person, there
wasn’t no problem fightin’ the enemy,” he
explains in “Bloods,’’Wallace Terry’s newly
published oral history, which explores the
black experience in Vietnam.* “I knew
Americans were prejudiced,” Edwards con-
tinues, “but. . . I believed in America’cause
I was an American.” Nearly seven years
later, radicalized in thejungle and tainted by
bad discharge papers, Edwards went home.
His story, the first of 20 in Terry’s book, is
emblematic. “I had left one war,” he says,
“and came back and got into another one. ”
Edwards’s new war—coping with battle
trauma, getting a job, settling down —has
been fought by many returning veterans.
But for the 350,000 blacks who came back
from Vietnam, the problems have proven
doubly hard. During the war’s early stages,
blacks, who made up about 11 percent of the
national population, accounted for 16 per-
cent of the American combat troops and 23
percent of the fatalities. Back home, howev-
er, black vets soon learned that the skills
learned in combat were useless in getting a
job. The effect, says Husher Harris, regional
manager of 20 Vietnam-veter-
an counseling centers, is obvi-
ous. “[The black vets] come
back and there is still no job. . .
no piece of the pie. So what you
have is a 38-year-old guy who
acts like an 18-year-old.”
Tens of thousands of blacks
who left Vietnam with less-
than-honorable discharges re-
main haunted by their military
records. Estimates show that
blacks received about half of the
“bad paper” discharges given
*3ll pages. Random House. $17.95.
The book: Militants
during the war era. That, says Terry, can be
partly explained by a new breed of black
soldier who came to Vietnam in the late ’6os.
“They were the ‘bloods,’ the ones who ex-
pressed a new self-assertiveness. They didn’t
want to hear a sergeant call them ‘boy. ’ They
got into difficulties over little things—giving
a black-power salute, or decorating their
hooches with pictures of Malcolm X.”
Amnesty: Veterans’ groups are taking no-
tice. The Veterans Administration is ex-
panding its five-year-old Vietnam-veteran
mental-health “outreach” program to in-
ner-city areas and may soon start leafletting
churches, bars and bus stations in search of
troubled minority veterans. The Milwau-
kee-based National Association for Black
Veterans is campaigning for amnesty for
Vietnam vets who received less-than-honor-
able discharges. “They pardoned Lieuten-
ant Calley,” says leader Thomas Wynn,
“they pardoned the draft dodgers. But no
president has done anything for those veter-
ans . . . who served their country during
Vietnam and received bad papers.”
Terry, a black journalist who covered
Vietnam for Time, hopes his book will be
interpreted as more than just a collection
of black war tales —rather, as
“a human story.” Harold Bry-
ant, one of the chronicled, has
other goals. “I hope it gives
our families an explanation of
why we are the way we are,”
he says. “We came home and
didn’t talk to our mothers and
wives. They just sat around
and saw us suffer. This book
will explain some of the things
we have gone through.”

Rolling Out the Big Guns
Enter the dragons: A celebration of successes that range from bumper crops to a rich harvest of Olympic medals
ERIC BRISSAUD—GAMMA-LIAISON
For the 35th anniversary of China’s revolution, Deng puts reform on parade.
For one brief shining moment, Peking’s
Tiananmen Square took on a Disney-
land atmosphere last week. Over here a
16-foot robot waving a bouquet, over there
the parade of the Chinese paper dragons
and almost everywhere dancers and bal-
loons and exuberant celebrants from “the
masses.” Peking was celebrating 35 years
of Communist rule.
On one level, the extravaganza seemed
designed to celebrate China’s recent suc-
cesses, which range from the fourth bump-
er crop in a row to the harvest of 15 gold
medals at the Los Angeles Olympics. It
also seemed a chance to have some fun. At
the end of the procession thousands of
children festooned with the bright scarlet
bandannas of the Young Pioneers marched
in formation, blowing bugles, banging
drums and waving crepe-paper wreaths.
Later on, authorities opened the square for
an evening of dancing and a spectacular
fireworks show.
But the floats and the fun were mainly
decorations for the real show —a huge pub-
lic display of China’s military hardware. It
was the first time in 25 years that Peking
had put its most advanced weapons on
Deng: ‘We have given China a new face’
view. Standing in a Red Flag limousine,
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping reviewed
ranks of missiles and more than 6,000
goose-stepping troops. As armored vehi-
cles clattered through the square, waves of
jet fighters roared overhead. To dramatize
his intention to reform China’s economy,
WU JIGUO— XINHUA
its military and its very approach to Marx-
ism, Deng mounted the Gate of Heavenly
Peace for the first time for a major public
address. Peering over a portrait of Mao
Tse-tung, he indicated to the crowds that
his pragmatic way, not the chairman’s
dream of permanent revolution, was the
country’s best hope for the future. “We
have given China a new face,” he said.
The parade was also meant to show that
Deng intends to put more starch and iron
into the world’s largest—but in some ways
lamest —army. One of his prime areas of
concern is the military’s woeful backward-
ness in both advanced technology and
training. Deng and his chief aides are also
skeptical about the military’s political loy-
alty. Their fear is that the top brass still
long for the “good old days” of Mao.
During the recent political “rectification”
campaign to purge the party’s ultraradical
elements, Deng often ran into stiff resist-
ance from the officer corps. In an effort to
keep control of the Army, Deng has con-
spicuously retained the top military posts
in the party and government, even though
he has officially retired from his other
political duties. “Our Army is the pillar of
the people’s democratic leadership [be-
cause] it controls the gun,” says Army


Peking’s first display of missiles in 25 years: A political message—and an intriguing glimpse of a modern arsenal
commissar Yu Qiuli. “Whether or not the
gun is grasped in the hands of Marxists
affects the nation’s safety.”
Whatever the political significance of
last week’s gala, the display offered an
intriguing glimpse into China’s arsenal.
There were three formations of self-pro-
pelled guns and howitzers, 32 surface-to-
air missiles and 108 tanks, displaying at
least 10 pieces of Chinese-made hardware
that no outsider had scrutinized before.
Western military analysts were particular-
ly interested in a sea-launched cruise mis-
sile and a tank gun that appeared to be
adapted from Israeli arms. Three trucks
carried segments of CSS-X-4 interconti-
nental ballistic missiles, capable of carry-
ing a five-megaton warhead far enough to
reach all parts of the Soviet Union and the
West Coast of the United States. “It was
a very impressive display of equipment,”
said one Western military analyst based
in Peking. “It demonstrates a pretty
good capacity in terms of manufacturing
standards.”
Last Place: That “impressive display”
was also designed to improve morale and
stem inefficiency and backwardness in the
military. Aside from their occasional po-
litical heresies, the aging generals have
been grumbling about the low budget
priority of the People’s Liberation Army.
When Deng unveiled his Four Moderniza-
tions drive more than five years ago, de-
ERIC BRISSAUD—GAMMA-LIAISON
fense finished in last place, trailing agricul-
ture, industry and science and technology.
Under the current Five Year Plan, military
spending is a relatively paltry $9 billion —
only about 14 percent of the total current
budget. Many military leaders are also
opposed to Deng’s rather conciliatory ap-
proach on the issue of reunification with
Taiwan. In an apparent effort to set them
straight on that point, Deng went out of his
way to allay any fears that the show of
military might was intended to intimidate
Taipei. “We stand for peaceful reunifica-
tion with Taiwan,” he declared. “Our poli-
cy in this regard is known to all and will
not change.”
In his speech, Deng emphasized the
theme of strengthening national defense
and urged the 4.2 million troops of the
PLA to “constantly improve their military
and political qualities and strive to gain
knowledge and ability for modern war-
fare.” Such reforms are sorely needed. The
Army’s higher echelons are filled most-
ly with aging peasant revolutionaries
schooled in the antiquated “people’s war”
techniques favored by Mao. It was the
Great Helmsman, after all, who once told
the Army that “revolution does not need
book learning.”
Hopelessly Disorganized: The military’s
devotion to Maoist tradition can seem a bit
odd at times. Among other things, many
top officers consider the use of military
ranks to be “bourgeois.” Deng’s pragmatic
backers believe that reform in this area is
essential if the military is to avoid repeat-
ing its 1979 fiasco. Chinese troops be-

came hopelessly disorgan-
ized during a series of skir-
mishes on the Vietnamese
border, in part because en-
listed men had trouble tell-
ing who was in command.
After several false starts,
military officials in Peking
now say they hope to intro-
duce a formal system of
ranks by the end of next
year. Both Deng’s cadre of
pragmatic supporters and
the Maoists appear to agree
that change will not come
all that easily to the Peo-
ple’s Liberation Army.
“There are many things
within the Army that need
to be reformed,” says Yang
Shangkun, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission. “But the Army has
its own characteristics, and the scope and
method of reform should take those char-

acteristics into account.”
There are some signs
that Deng’s efforts are suc-
ceeding, despite foot-drag-
ging among the old guard.
Under orders from the
Communist Party, China’s
soldiers are now marching
back to school. Those over
the age of 40 are expected
to obtain at least junior-
high-school-level certifi-
cates; mindful of the im-
portance of classroom
instruction for a modern
army, the government has
established military acade-
mies across the country to
give cadets and officers spe-
cialized training. Manda-
tory retirement ages are be-
ing enforced. The new
military uniforms cut a more professional
figure than the baggy padded jackets of
Mao’s day. And the display of whip anten-
nas on many of the vehicles in last week’s
parade signaled an improvement in the
PLA’s outdated communications technol-
ogy. (During China’s brief punitive incur-
sion into Vietnam in 1979, some messages
had to be relayed between combat units by
hand signals.)
Even so, Western analysts warned
against making any assumptions that Pe-
king had dramatically enhanced its combat
capability. One diplomat speculated that it
would take at least six months to evaluate
the weaponry that the government put on
show. Other defense experts pointed out
that even shiny new hardware doesn’t al-
ways work properly, to say nothing of the
difficulty of equipping an entire army with
mass-produced models. “It’s not right to
pin your assessment of the entire Chinese
Army on the basis of one parade,” said one
Western diplomat. There was no denying
that judgment. It will take a good deal
more time and work to bring the PLA up
to the class of the Soviet Red Army—or,
for that matter, the United States Army.

Surgery for Mt. Fuji’s Scar
A symbol of Japan: ‘No one likes to see it crumbling away’
For thousands of years Japan’s graceful, snowcapped Mount
Fuji has been celebrated in poems and delicate woodblock
prints. But behind the mountain’s near-perfect cone, the 12,388-
foot dormant volcano has a problem. Stretching down one side is
a steep-walled valley—as deep as 150 yards in some places—that
many fear could eventually gnaw away at the mountain’s crater.
In an attempt to block the course of nature, the Japanese
government has embarked on a project to shore up the moun-
tain. “Mount Fuji is the symbol of Japan, ” says Kazuhiro Tabe
of Japan’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “No one
likes to see it crumbling away.”
Erosion: There is no reason to worry that Mount Fuji will
crumble any time soon. Any major damage to the mountain
could take centuries. But even now, about 200,000 cubic meters
of soil wash down the gully each year, battering the outskirts of
Fujinomiya City at the mountain’s base. Sometimes boulders as
large as 15 feet in diameter tumble down the gorge. In a previous
effort to stop the erosion, the Ministry of Construction has
completed a 50-foot dam near the mouth of the gorge to
supplement a string of smaller dams farther down the slopes.
Now, work has begun on an experimental concrete retaining
wall. Engineers will literally pave a 150-foot stretch midway up
the mountain to protect one side of the valley.
Surprisingly, ecologists have few objections to paving Mount

Fuji. “If you think of the possible danger to climbers, it really
can’t be helped,” says Fubomichi Kudo, a senior researcher at
the Nature Conservation Society of Japan. “Of course, we won’t
keep silent if it means marring the mountain.” Government
agencies say they will try to keep the esthetic damage to a
minimum. “We have discussed covering the walls with volcanic
rock or painting them to blend in with the mountainside,” says
the EPA’s Tabe. “A huge sheet of plain concrete is plainly
unacceptable.” It will take four or five years to complete tests to
determine the proper material to pave the gorge. Until then the
only danger to Mount Fuji’s symmetrical appearance is a volcan-
ic eruption. But the countless admirers of this graceful mountain
can take heart: the last time that happened was in 1707.

The Act of Creation.
There are two kinds of photography.
That which is created by electronic devi-
ces, and that which is created by a photo-
grapher.
Most cameras today bristle with electro-
nic wizardry that takes over the photogra-
pher’s thinking and judgment. All he needs
to know is how to push a button.
The Hasselblad is not one of them. Its
advanced technology has one purpose only:
to enhance, not replace, the relationship
between the photographer and his vision.
We believe that photography is an art.
True to that belief, the Hasselblad is
built essentially by hand. It takes a full year
from the time the raw materials enter the
factory until the finished Hasselblad is re-
leased.
This dedication to Art and Quality has
made it the choice of most great photogra-
phers in the world today. Not to mention
the astronauts who rely on the Hasselblad
for space photography.
Whatever trends may sweep camera
technology, Hasselblad will never try to re-
duce the act of creation to the act of push-
ing a button.

The Deficit’s Siren Song
1984-89 figures are estimates.
BOB CONRAD
Could it be that the supply-side theorists have been on to something all along?
Ever since George Bush labeled Ronald
Reagan’s proposals for massive tax cuts
“voodoo economics,” Reaganomics has
been widely classified as a branch of wishful
thinking. The supply-side economists who
provided its theoretical underpinnings have
been dismissed by many as merely the one
lunatic fringe in the nation with the highest
proportion of Ph.D.’s. So far, though, Presi-
dent Reagan’s economic dreams have to a
remarkable degree come true. Now, econo-
mists of many stripes are factoring in a new
variable: the key supply-side tenet that a
steadily growing economy coupled with
spending restraint may be able to erase much
of the budget deficit without tax increases.
In short, the supply siders may be right.
More is at stake than economic theory.
The way in which the deficit is approached
will help determine the quality of American
life for years to come. “If we allow the
deficits to really get out of hand,” says
economist Alan Greenspan, “then trying to
squelch them three or five years from now is
going to be extremely difficult and very
costly to the social fabric of the country.”
Democrat Walter Mondale has already put
forth his program to raise taxes and cut
spending to bring the deficit under control.
It is not so clear what a re-elected President
Reagan would do. He is committed to at-
tacking the deficit with spending cuts and
might even accept the tax hikes Congress
would demand in return. Yet there are signs
that he just might embrace the notion that a
growing economy will provide enough add-
ed tax revenues to close the budget gap by
itself. “It’s a siren song to a receptive ear,”
says one administration economic official.
“The president more than half believes that
the deficits will succumb to growth.”
Projections: Some of Reagan’s most influ-
ential advisers are trying to fan that sen-
timent into wholehearted commitment.
White House counselor Edwin Meese 111
has been transmitting to the president the
views of supply siders Jude Wanniski and
Paul Craig Roberts. Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan insists that the deficit can be
slashed without raising taxes. The true be-
lievers even managed to force Office of
Management and Budget Director David
Stockman, who has repeatedly called for tax
increases to attack the deficit, to allow for the
possibility that Reaganomics will work as
planned. In its mid-August report, the OMB
forecast a deficit for 1989 of $139 billion
(chart). But at the same time, the OMB also
issued a more optimistic alternate projec-
tion. Using a higher estimated growth rate, it
predicted a deficit of only $2l billion in 1989.
A growing number of influential business
people and economists also seem willing to
embrace the power of positive thinking. The
Chamber of Commerce has long been con-
vinced supply-side theory would prove ac-
curate —and now another trade group, the
American Business Conference, also en-
dorses the approach. “The supply siders
have a great shot at being right,” says Jack
Albertine of the ABC, which represents
mainly midsize high-tech firms. “And a lot
of people are slowly beginning to realize it.”
Those two groups, along with the National
Federation of Independent Business and
the Business Roundtable, refused to join
former Commerce Secretary Peter Peter-
son’s recently formed Bipartisan Budget
Appeal, which advocates cutting middle-
income entitlements and defense spending
and raising taxes to narrow the budget gap.
Even the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office has begun, grudgingly, to
give the supply-side proposition an outside


chance of succeeding. “If getting the budget
deficit down to around 2 percent of GNP is
getting out of the problem, you can’t say
with certainty that that could not happen,”
says CBO Director Rudolph Penner, with a
defensive flourish of double negatives. A
sustained period of very rapid growth with
low inflation could lead to a deficit of about
$125 billion in 1989. “And by then, with a
six-trillion-plus economy,” he says, “some
might think the deficit might not matter.”
As it is, though, the CBO is officially pre-
dicting a budget gap of $263 billion by 1989.
The strongest argument supply siders
have is the economy’s performance. Defying
conventional wisdom, it has achieved sus-
tained expansion without increases in infla-
tion. And estimated budget deficits have
come down. In the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, the actual deficit was $173 billion,
considerably lower than the $231 billion
forecast by the OMB early last year. The
supply siders are saying that this trend can
continue. “People who are saying this can’t
happen are the same who said we couldn’t
have a recovery at all, then that it couldn’t be
rapid and then that we’d have a big burst of
inflation,” says Richard Rahn, chief econo-
mist oftheU.S. Chamber of Commerce.
‘Fear of Hying*: Rahn, however, does not
expect the growth cure to get a fair test. He
believes that the Federal Reserve Board will
not permit the money supply to expand
rapidly enough to sustain the level of expan-
sion needed to erase the deficits. “But we
believe a high-growth scenario is thoroughly
possible and even likely if it weren’t for the
Fed’s fear of flying,” he says. The Fed, of
course, is afraid of a resurgence of inflation.
The pivotal question is, “Can high growth
be sustained?” The most immediate threat is
that the deficits will devour the economy—
by keeping interest rates high—before the
economy devours them. So far, though, the
economy has achieved spectacular growth
in the face of some of the highest real interest
rates on record. The supply siders say they
aren’t asking for any miracles. “There is
nothing inherently impossible about strong
economic growth, a stable currency and low
unemployment,” says Alan Reynolds of
Polyconomics. Adds Rahn: “All we’re say-
ing is that output from 1980
to 1989 can increase by 47.8
percent—high, but that’s al-
most exactly the actual rate
of increase from 1960 to
1969. ” One skeptical Fed of-
ficial believes that such a
performance would require
annual productivity gains of
3.5 percent or even more
for the rest of the decade,
something that has never
occurred.
Doubters: Some econo-
mists, in fact, do not even
agree that growth is the
main reason that deficits
have declined. “Growth
does help,” says Penner,
“but there is not a magic
wand in action. It is the
change of policies that is
doing most of the work.”
Penner says the tax hikes
and spending cuts in this
year’s Deficit Reduction
Act alone will reduce the
deficit by $7O billion in
1989. “That’s a whole lot of
money,” he notes.
And there remain many
who dismiss supply-side
theory out of hand. Ex-
pressing a popular view,
Steven Malin, an economist
at the Conference Board,
believes the economy has
performed strictly according to convention-
al theories —and that Fed chairman Paul
Volcker is the hero. To prevent an outbreak
of inflation after the Reagan tax cuts,
Volcker kept the money supply tight, induc-
ing a recession. The recession put down-
ward pressure on oil and commodity prices
as well as wages. It also forced many busi-
nesses to streamline. When the Fed began
increasing the money supply again in 1982,
the economy was in fighting trim. The
strong dollar, meanwhile, led to a flood of
cheap imports. The only credit Malin will
give to the supply siders is that “it was their
program that forced the Fed to take those

draconian measures that drove the econo-
my olf the cliff.”
Another person who has no trouble
resisting the siren song is Walter Mondale.
He has promised to make a “down pay-
ment” on the deficit with a package of $25
billion in defense cuts and $B7 billion in
tax increases. For him, a walk on the
supply side is out of the question. Says a
Mondale economic aide, “You can’t plan
government policies on a one-in-a-hundred
chance of lucking out.”
Luck, though, has been the hallmark of
the Reagan economic era. And the presi-
dent has taken special delight in defying the
“doomsayers”—those who
have claimed his record
budget deficits would in-
evitably crumple the eco-
nomy. If Reagan receives
the electoral mandate that
many polls now promise, he
may be inclined to let his
luck ride and give growth a
chance to balance the budg-
et. It’s still a risky long shot,
but if he is proven right, he
just might establish supply-
side theory as a new eco-
nomic model of how the
world works.

EUROPE
Coping With a Cash Crunch
French milk producers protesting earlier this year: ‘Accelerating a rural exodus’?
MICHEL LAMBERT—GAMMA-LIAISON
The European Economic Commmunity
often seems on the verge of coming
unglued. Last week the quarrelsome Ten
once again launched a last-minute scramble
to keep themselves solvent. They grudging-
ly chipped in $1.4 billion to tide the Com-
munity over for the rest of this year. And
they framed a $l9 billion budget for next
year—leaving for later the pesky question of
where the money will come from. Casting
the patchwork agreements in the best possi-
ble light, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher called the meeting
“a significant step forward for the Commu-
nity.” But others were less optimistic. The
EEC remains deadlocked on the touchy
issue of Britain’s $545 million rebate, and
little progress was made on curbing the
farm subsidies that have pushed the Com-
munity to the point of bankruptcy.
For Europeans accustomed to Common
Market donnybrooks, last week’s sem-
blance of unity, however slight, was a wel-
come change. But the assembled ministers
departed from the standard script in an-
other, perhaps more important, respect.
The squabbles that did break out occurred
mainly among ministers of the same delega-
tion, and not between countries, as is usual-
ly the case.
Wreathed in Smiles: Nowhere were the
intramural hostilities more intense than in
the French delegation. At one point, Fi-
nance Minister Pierre Beregovoy emerged
from a conclave wreathed in smiles and
talking about “a good agreement” on limit-
ing the farm subsidies that now eat up more
than half of the Community’s funds. The
EEC has been at loggerheads over the issue
for years, and any concord would have been
a major breakthrough. Beregovoy argued
that his formula for setting ceilings on the
subsidies was fair to French farmers, the
main beneficiaries of the support program.
But that didn’t keep his colleague,
Agriculture Minister Michel Rocard,
from erupting in fury. Such ceilings, he
said, would trample the prerogatives
of the EEC’s agriculture ministers, who
are responsible for the Community’s farm
policies. To boot, he
charged that the
agreement would sell
out French interests.
Sitting symbolically
behind a pitcher of
milk —Europe’s most
heavily subsidized
farm product—Ro-
card launched into a
diatribe against the fi-
nance minister’s pro-
posal. “If we want to
accelerate the rural
exodus and make it
nearly impossible for
young farmers to set
up, then let’s say so,”
he fumed. Predict-
ably, the issue was
shelved until France
could restore order in
its house.
An equally explo-
sive problem, Bri-
tain’s demand for a
rebate on its contribu-
tions to the EEC
budget, met a similar
fate. The government
of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has vowed to oppose
any new spending until the Community
comes up with a permanent solution for
trimming Britain’s disproportionately large
payments into the EEC treasury. No

mechanism has come close to winning
Thatcher’s approval, at least until last week.
Responding to the intense pressure for
“budgetary discipline,” the conferees cob-
bled up a plan that would keep spending
below the value added tax (VAT) revenues
that finance EEC operations.
Plan: The proposal won widespread sup-
port. British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson called it “an effective disci-
pline over expenditures,” and West Ger-
man Finance Minister Gerhard Stolten-
berg, Thatcher’s chief budget-cutting ally,
also hailed the plan. That should have guar-
anteed a solution, but Stoltenberg failed to
reckon with his colleagues from Bonn.
Flying in from a Euro-Latin conference in
Costa Rica, Germany’s Genscher professed
himself satisfied with the Community’s
progress on its intricate budget problems,
but fliply dismissed the finance ministers’
accord as an “anti-disciplinary compromise
that won’t limit increases in spending.”
With that blast, all progress ended. Eur-
ope’s foreign ministers are due to take up the
thorny spending issues when they meet two
weeks from now in Luxembourg. In the
meantime, the key question is whether
French President Franqois Mitterrand and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl can
push their warring ministers toward an ac-
ceptable compromise. Until then, other is-
sues will languish. Spain and Portugal have
had no word on when they might finally be
admitted to the Community, and their pa-
tience is wearing thin.
The ministers also
took time last week to
criticize a trade bill
being considered by
the U.S. Congress.
Their salvo encour-
aged the lawmakers
to temper the protec-
tionist tone of the leg-
islation, but U.S.-
EEC trade tensions
still need tending.
Whatever course
the Common Market
takes, it is clearly
pressed for time.
Some ministers fear a
loss of momentum
that would jeopardize
the tentative compro-
mises reached —and
almost reached —last
week. Others caution
that any decisions
must still be approved
by the European Par-
liament, which may
not be a sure thing.
Until these issues are
resolved, the larger
questions of European unity and industrial
recovery will stay on the back burner.

First Chicago’s Sour Loans
Ever since the bailout of Continental
Illinois, economists have feared more
bad news in the U.S. banking system. Last
week brought a newcomer to notoriety:
First Chicago Corp., parent of the First
National Bank of Chicago, revealed that a
number of huge loans had gone sour —and
that $279 million in resulting charge-offs
would help produce a third-quarter loss of
at least $7O million. News that the eighth
largest bank in the United States would
suffer its first loss in history took the finan-
cial community by surprise. What made the
announcement still more dramatic was that
the bad loans included credits to companies
Bank chairman Sullivan: ‘One-time deal’
controlled by two of the bank’s more eccen-
tric customers —Texas billionaires W. Her-
bert and Nelson Bunker Hunt.
First Chicago’s problems, coming just
months after the near-collapse of Continen-
tal Illinois, its neighbor on nearby LaSalle
Street, sent a shiver through financial cen-
ters. Share prices of big bank stocks
slumped, and bond prices fell as “flight to
quality” temporarily boosted rates on
Treasury bills. Regulators called the panic
needless; unlike Continental, First Chicago
seemed to be having no problem either at-
tracting large deposits or keeping them in
the bank. First Chicago chairman Barry
Sullivan insisted that the losses were a “one-
time deal” and that the bank’s profits would
rebound in the fourth quarter. But given
signs that other banks also had a stake in the
same loans, more trouble in the banking
system seemed possible in the weeks ahead.
In one respect, the developments at First
Chicago were linked to those at Continental
Illinois: since the bailout, the Comptroller
of the Currency, which regulates national
banks, has stepped up the frequency of its
bank examinations in an effort to forestall
further crises. A recent so-called “target
review” of First Chicago turned up unex-
pected weakness in loans that had long since
been identified as problems. Regulators
came up with their own estimate of needed
write-offs, but the bank decided to go them
about $ 100 million better. First
Chicago also classified a num-
ber of other loans as “nonper-
forming,” forcing it to add a
total of $3OB million to its loan-
loss reserves.
Shaky Credits: Much of that
reserve fund was set aside to
cover possible future losses on
loans to Third World debtors
and the bank’s growing credit-
card business. Among the loans
charged off were credits to agri-
cultural and shipping concerns
and energy companies—appar-
ently including Apex Oil Co., a financially
troubled refiner and marketer based in St.
Louis. There were also tens of millions of
dollars in shaky loans to a Saudi Arabian
group, Ali & Fahd Shobokshi, whose con-
struction and contracting unit has foun-
dered in the recession under way in OPEC
nations.
Among the bank’s most intriguing prob-
lems were its loans to three companies con-
trolled by the Hunts, longstanding custom-
ers of the Chicago bank. According to
documents filed at the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, the companies—all in-
volved in the sugar industry—have been in
default for almost a year on $2lO million in
loans from several banks. Their parent com-
pany, Hunt International Resources Corp.,
has been selling off company assets to raise
cash for most of the last year, but apparently
to little avail: First Chicago was forced to
classify $6O million of the loans as nonper-
forming last week. Bank sources said the
decision to do so followed an intensive study
of the weak sugar industry—after which the
bank concluded that low profit margins in
sugar processing and tough competition
from abroad made investing in the business
far too risky.
Analysts said that verdict seemed sensible
enough, but wondered whether First Chica-
go should not have taken the sweeping ac-
tion sooner. It remained unclear, for exam-
ple, whether other money-center banks had
already written off portions of the troubled
Bunker Hunt: Losses
DAVID LEESON— DALLAS MORNING NEWS
loans they shared with First Chicago—or
whether more charges against earnings were
yet to come. “The question is whether First
Chicago is ahead of the pack in recognizing
problems or just catching up with the oth-
ers,” said one analyst, who asked not to be
named. Analysts also think declining farm-
land prices may have made the outlook for
collecting on agricultural loans far worse
than the bank realized. Sullivan admitted
last week that the bank hadn’t done a very
good job of “managing” loans once it be-
came clear they were deteriorating. The
bank hoped to rectify that in the future, he
said, adding that it had also drawn up stricter
lending procedures.
Perhaps an even bigger concern was
whether all of First Chicago’s problems
were truly behind it. Many believed they
were: “They’ve scoured the hell out of the
loan portfolio and now it’s business as usu-
al,” said James Wooden, an an-
alyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith. The bank’s
capital base is already consid-
ered strong, and First Chicago
plans to increase it still further;
Richard Bove, an analyst with
Shearson Lehman/American
Express, thinks that the bank
may soon put some of its ven-
ture-capital operations on the
auction block in order to raise
cash. Others took pains last
week to stress that First Chica-
go has more stable retail depos-
its and is far less dependent on short-term
loans from other banks than Continental
was before its downfall. Until recently,
banking-industry sources say, First Chicago
officials were wont to gloat over these differ-
ences between their bank and its longstand-
ing competitor. But last week, the disparities

Call it OPEC’s all-new “Let’s
Make a Deal.” Despite a soft petro-
leum market, oil producers are loath
to cut the official $29 price of oil —so
instead they have been bartering it
down. Two months ago, the Saudi
state airline swapped more than 30
million barrels of crude for 10
Boeing Co. jumbo jets worth $1 bil-
lion—and the United Arab Emirates
is reportedly on the verge of trading
15 million barrels of oil for 18
French jet fighters. Those deals may
mean that even benchmark Saudi
crude is selling for well under $29.
Assuming the oil glut will continue,
the haggling figures to grow.

LIFE/STYLE
Danger on the Rocks
John Bachar ascending with no protective rope in Yosemite: Hanging one finger tip away from eternity
PHILIP A. BARD
An unprecedented drive to scale new heights.
If you take rock climbing seriously, sooner
or later you will have that religious experi-
ence. You are going to be looking at God
saying, ‘‘ We ’re going to be lucky if we get out
of here. ” Your life is going to be in front
of you and then you are going to realize that
you ’d rather be grocery shopping.
-—Ed Barry, rock climber
The moment of transcendence came ear-
ly this summer for Ed Barry. The slight but
Free soloing: The ultimate in danger
GALEN ROWELL
stone-hard guide at Yosemite Mountain-
eering School had long dreamed of climbing
Bachar-Yerian, a fiendishly difficult route
snaking 500 feet up the sheer granite face of
Medlicott Dome in Yosemite National
Park. An attempt last spring ended in
failure. On his next try, Barry was
inching up the hazardous second
pitch of the climb when his foot
slipped off a peanut-size nub of rock
and he plummeted 30 feet to a gut-
wrenching halt at the end of his rope.
Dangling 100 feet above Yosemite’s
green Tuolumne Meadow, the 32-
year-old Barry had seen God. “I
won’t go back up there,” he gasped to
partner Kurt Smith. But moments
later, he forced himself back onto the
rock wall and suddenly broke
through the tangle of fear and frustra-
tion. “I cranked out those moves
like I had done them one hundred
times,” Barry marvels. “It was like
walking to the store. I had the power.”
Perhaps because of its stark elemental
challenge, the chance to stare fear and phys-
ical limitation squarely in the face and “test
your will to live,” as instructor Richard
Gottlieb puts it, rock climbing is enjoying an
unprecedented surge of popularity. By some
estimates, there are more than 60,000 seri-
ous climbers in the United States. Summer
and fall classes in Yosemite this year will
attract some 2,700 students, up 10 percent
over last season, says mountaineering-
school director Bruce Brossman, and more
are expected next year. During crisp fall
weekends, the Shawangunks in
New York’s Hudson River Val-
ley are so crowded with climb-
ers that bright purple and gold
ropes drape languidly over vir-
tually every gray cliff, and
the air rings with shouts
of “Ropef’and “On belay!”*
“Climbing is a glamour sport,”
explains Gottlieb. “People get
into it because they think it
takes guts but not a lot of skill.”
Balletic Grace: They are
wrong, of course. Conquering
difficult routes like Bachar-
Yerian or Perilous Journey in
Colorado’s Eldorado Can-
yon, requires a combination
of balletic grace, weight-lift-
ing strength and chess-playing
strategy that only comes from
years of training and practice.
“To be good, you have little
choice,” says Brossman. “You
will have to move here and
climb for three or four months
each year for several years be-
fore you can do hard climbs.”
Such monastic demands have turned the
sport into a way of life for a whole communi-
ty of climbing “bums.” From a semiperma-
nent base at Camp Four in Yosemite, these
top climbers, dubbed “hardmen,” occasion-
ally wander to other climbing hotspots—the
Shawangunks, Colorado’s Eldorado Can-
yon, Joshua Tree National Monument on
the edge of the Mojave Desert, Wisconsin’s
Devil’s Lake, to name a few —in search of
new challenges. Eking out meager exis-

tences by guiding, teaching or doing other
odd jobs, they contrast sharply with the
often well-to-do types that join them on
weekends. And except for rare opportuni-
ties to endorse climbing gear, the only re-
wards for climbing bums are personal satis-
faction and the respect, admiration and envy
of their peers. “I love to climb,” says John
Bachar, hardman par excellence, “but I also
need to climb, which is even better, because it
gives you something in return.”
Climbing itself has changed profoundly
*“On belay” means that one climber is holding a rope
that will stop another’s fall.

in the last dozen years. “There are more
hardmen now,” explains Yosemite veteran
Lloyd Price. “It used to be that there would
be four or five people pushing the outer
limits of climbing; now there are probably
100 on any one day in Yosemite.” Once it
was enough to simply scale a cliff, tower or
peak; climbers had no compunctions about
hammering in pitons or shinnying up ropes
if necessary. To make the pioneering first
ascent of Yosemite’s El Capitan in 1958, for
example, a team led by Warren Harding
drilled holes in the rock in order to pound in
the bolts from which they hung for more
than 30 grueling days of actual climbing.
But during the mid-19705, after all the ma-
jor rock faces had been tamed, rock climb-
ing took a radical leap. How you got there
became as —or more—important than
reaching the top.
Endless Debates: The new ethic, stimulat-
ed partly by technological changes in equip-
ment, calls for ascents that are both “clean”
and “free.” Instead of damaging the rock by
driving in pitons or drilling bolt holes, clean
climbers wedge cubic metal “stoppers,” nut-
shaped “hexes” and scissorlike “friends”
into cracks to provide handholds, belay
points and protection against falls. Free
climbers go a step further, relying on ropes
and hardware only to stop falls, not to make
ascents easier. The distinctions —and the
fierce competition among climbers —have
led to endless debates about allowable tech-
niques (sample question: can an ascent be
truly “free” if a climber first scouted the
route while hanging from a rope?) and not a
little acrimony. Bachar, for example, has
been known to disgustedly yank bolts out of
mountain rock, and other climbers
complain bitterly that routes have be-
come marked with chalk (used to keep
sweaty hands from slipping). Still,
climbing provides an attractive es-
cape from reality precisely because its
basic rules are simple. “Climbing is
so straightforward,” says Gottlieb,
“ You either did it right or you cheated
like hell.”
The relentless drive for purity in
climbing has led a handful of hard-
men to toss aside their protection
completely and go up the rock alone.
“In terms of satisfaction and style,
free soloing is the ultimate,” says
Boulder’s Charlie Fowler, 30. It is
also the ultimate in danger, exposing
climbers to what Pat Ament calls
“the sharp end of emptiness” as they
hang one finger tip away from eternity.
Even in the eyes of many hardmen, free
soloists bear the stigmata of lunacy.
After one major breakthrough in solo
climbing, an unroped ascent by Bachar of a
400-foot Yosemite acid test called New
Dimensions in 1976, a notice appeared on
the Camp Four bulletin board. It read:
“Tell Webster’s to change the meaning of
insanity to ‘John Bachar free soloed New
Dimensions’.”
For the addicted solo climber, however,
Eying the next move in Eldorado Canyon
ROSIE ANDREWS
the raw danger sharpens mind and senses far
better than any drug. “Death is so close,”
says Jeff Achey, 25. “You could let go and
make the decision to die. It feels so good.”
Yet Achey firmly denies that he is tempting
fate. “You are probably pretty confident
that you could walk from here to the door
without tripping,” he explains. “Climbing is
the same for me. It’s an ordinary feeling to be
supported by finger tips, hanging on a rock
wall. The possibility of falling feels very
Bachar practicing on a boulder in Yosemite: Sinuous brilliance honed by years of training
remote —like being struck by lightning.”
Unfortunately, lightning has a nasty habit
of striking somewhere, and many climbers
are worried. “We’ve been saying all summer
in Yosemite that someone’s going to pop,”
says Dimitri Barton. “Someone’s going to
die.” It has already happened. A hold gave
way on a moderately difficult stretch of rock
in Colorado’s Black Canyon earlier this
summer and Lauren Husted, 22, plunged
200 feet to become the most recent fatality
of solo climbing. As Bachar says, “Soloing
is serious business, because you can be seri-
ously dead.”
Free soloing has almost become a legiti-
mate branch of the sport despite its obvious
danger, largely because of the virtuosity of
the 27-year-old Bachar. A lean, muscled
California blond,“Johnny Rock,” as he is
known in Yosemite, dropped out of college
during his freshman year at UCLA 10 years
ago and has been climbing full time ever
since. On a typical morning in Yosemite last
month, Bachar hiked up to the foot of a
bulging granite wall named Low Profile
Dome and soloed Darth Vader’s Revenge
and two other routes, all rated 5.9 or 5.10.
(Ratings in the so-called Yosemite Decimal
System range from 5.0 for the easiest free
climbs to 5.13 for the most difficult.) Then
he declared his warm-up complete. Where
would he go next?. “Someplace hard,” he
said with a smile.
Wooden Blocks: The nonchalant bril-
liance and sinuous grace that has propelled
Bachar to the top of the climbing world has
not come easily. “I can’t believe that there
are climbers as dedicated as he is,” says his
wife, Brenda. When not hustling by startled
roped climbers on Darth Vader’s Revenge
or adding such terrifying new routes as
Bachar-Yerian to the climbing guidebooks,
Bachar often can be found in a stand of
ponderosa pine near his Yosemite cottage
hanging by his finger tips from the narrow
wooden blocks of a home-built gymnasium.
Most climbers have neither the ability
nor the desire to follow in Bachar’s foot-
holds. But the thrill of climbing, which
Camp Four resident “The Fish” (real name
Russ Walling) jubilantly describes as “full-
on-sick, full-on-hell,” is accessible to any-
one who shoulders a rope and signs up at the
nearest mountaineering school. Halfway up
a rock wall, they will learn how to wedge a
stopper and traverse a crack. They will
learn to trust their partner and the slender
lifeline that binds them together. But most
of all they will learn about their own poten-
tial —and they may even see God.

MEDICINE
Mental State of the Union
Taking a reading of an entire nation’s
psyche seems a formidable task, but the
U.S. government has decided to try. The
first published results of what is almost
certainly the largest mental-health survey
ever conducted provide disturbing evidence
that these are indeed troubled times: nearly
20 percent of American adults, a team of
researchers from the National Institute of
Mental Health reported last week, current-
ly suffer psychiatric disorders ranging from
disabling anxiety to schizophrenia. But de-
spite the high incidence of mental illness,
the NIMH researchers report that only one
BOB CONRAD
in five of those afflicted sought help.
The findings are part of an ongoing survey
0f20,000 Americans in five communities. In
individual interviews lasting up to two
hours, each subject responded to a list of 200
questions about specific symptoms, such as
loss of interest in normally pleasant activi-
ties or panicky feelings. The symptoms cov-
ered by the questionnaire correspond to 15
specific disorders described in the American
Psychiatric Association’s somewhat con-
troversial 1980 revision of its Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Known as DSM-111, the guide has drawn
criticism for some of its seemingly arbitrary
categorizations. But its thorough codifica-
tion does provide a framework for a broad
study and a baseline for future comparisons.
The NIMH data were analyzed by computer
and then used to project statistics for the
population as a whole. Some subjects, of
course, had more than one disorder. Among
the most significant projections:
Trouble: An estimated 13.1 million
Americans suffer from anxiety disorders,
including phobias, obsessive-compulsive
behavior and panic attacks. About 10 mil-
lion citizens are abusers of alcohol or other
drugs, with four-fifths of these cases specifi-
cally related to alcohol. Approximately 9.4
million people are afflicted with “affective”
(the term refers to the observable expression
of emotion) disorders, which include both
chronic depression and
manic depression.
About 4.5 million Ameri-
cans suffer from either
schizophrenia, severe cog-
nitive impairment (disor-
dered thinking) or a cate-
gory DSM-111 labels
“antisocial personality”—a
set of traits including low
frustration tolerance, lack
of remorse for wrongdoing
and often violent and crimi-
nal behavior.
Men are as likely as wom-
en to have mental disorders.
“But the types of illness each
characteristically develops
are different,” explains proj-
ect director Dr. Darrel Re-
gier. Depression and anxi-
ety are more common in
womea—and because many
earlier surveys focused on
these problems, women
were unfairly stigmatized as
more unstable. The NIMH
study evened the score by
including categories in
which men predominate:
substance abuse and antiso-
cial personality disorders.
However, troubled women
were twice as likely as men to seek help. In
both sexes, the incidence of psychiatric
problems dropped by about 50 percent after
the age of 45. The lowest rate of emotional
disturbance was found in people over 65.
A second round of interviews, the re-
seachers hope, will provide useful informa-
tion about which conditions seem to benefit
most from treatment. Also included in the
survey were questions about major “life
events” like moving, marriage, job change
and death in the family. This data, says
Regier, may help pinpoint certain events
that trigger or contribute to specific mental
disorders —and that knowledge could, in
turn, be a critical step toward prevention.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Making Computers Talk—And Listen
To the raconteur who complains that
the art of conversation is dead, the
computer scientist can counter that a
new kind of conversation is being born—
between man and machine. Over the past
10 years researchers have made substan-
tial strides in the ability of computers to
understand the human voice and to
mimic it. Now developers have paired
these formerly separate technologies and
placed them on microchip-laden cards
that can be plugged into many popular
brands of personal computer. The result-
ing machine may not be able to chat
casually with its human boss. But this
voice input/output technology can al-
low a worker to ask his computer a ques-
tion —and expect it to answer.
Talk Can Be Cheap
Several technology firms have intro-
duced voice input/output cards that rep-
resent the state of the art at relatively
low cost. The VPC 2000 Voice Card
($2,450), manufactured by Votan of Fre-
mont, Calif., plugs into an auxiliary slot
in the IBM Personal Computer. Like all
voice systems, the Voice Card works by
converting the human voice—unintelli-
gible in its natural state to a computer —
into a series of on- or off-digital pulses.
To accomplish this, the user must speak
into a microphone the words he wants to
use to command the computer. Guided
by special Voice Key software, the cir-
cuitry samples this “training” speech
roughly 8,000 times a second and re-
cords it in memory as a digital pattern.
Only about three percent of this data is
kept, just enough to allow the computer
to recognize the pattern of a command
word the next time it is spoken.
To reproduce speech, the computer
reverses the process, tapping a prere-
corded bank of words, combining them
as needed, and converting them into a
voice that has meaning for a person.
The Voice Card allows the user simply
to utter a one-word command instead of
performing a lengthy sequence of key-
strokes for a spread sheet or other appli-
cations program. (Such capability is
particularly helpful to handicapped
workers.) The Speech Command System
($2,600), made by Texas Instruments of
Dallas, Texas, gives the firm’s Profes-
sional Computer a similar capability.
Both the Votan and the TI systems
can turn a computer into a telephone-
management machine. In Cleveland,
Ohio, for example, a Voice Card-
equipped computer at a clothing manu-
facturer answers requests for inventory
information right over the phone.
Where Words Can Fail
Still, voice technology will have to
overcome major challenges before every
desk top can boast a chatty computer.
Only the most expensive voice-genera-
tion systems can actually synthesize
Communicating through a headset: Speech instead of keystrokes
speech—build words from bits of sound
rather than merely recombine prere-
corded words. What is more, nearly
every voice-input system recognizes the
voice patterns only of the person who
trained it. Even the trainer himself may
bewilder the system if a bad cold has
affected his voice. Systems that could
recognize anyone saying “Please calcu-
late this invoice” would require a hu-
manlike intelligence that could account
for accents, inflections and other vaga-
ries of diction.
Researchers are working to achieve
such technology. Scott Instruments
Corp. of Denton, Texas, has put voice
input and output capabilities on a single
chip that is modeled after the human
auditory system. The CORETECHS
chip ($3O) separates words into phonetic
elements, the shortest recognizable
sounds. By matching the patterns of
these sounds rather than entire words,
the CORETECHS chip is more tolerant
of slurred or distorted speech.
Such a chip might be a component in
the ultimate voice input/output device,
the speech-driven typewriter. Such a
machine could take dictation as rapidly
as a court reporter and perhaps ask aloud
how many copies of the letter ought to be
made. The so-called Fifth Generation
computer research project in Japan is
working toward a speech-typewriter
with a 10,000-word vocabulary. And in
Britain, Plessey Co. of Ilford, Essex, is
developing its own device in conjunction
with Shell UK, the universities of Edin-
burgh and Loughborough and Imperial
College. Experts agree that it will be at
least five years before these devices are
close to mass production. But when that
time comes, many workers who are used
to manipulating keyboards may find
themselves able to type letters, sort files
and tally figures—all with their hands
folded.

FACT: TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
"Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity., but all of mouth-
watering configuration.” The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning." The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact.
SR engines
feature fuel
efficiency in-
novations, ad-
vanced elec-
tronics, new
mechanisms,
and sophisti -
cated engine
analysis tech-
niques.

riction and reduced inertia. With design innova-

In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!
Oh what a feeling!

Who’s what?
THE GOOD citizens of Dar-
win, Eve Atkinson has
hastened to assure us, were as-
tounded to discover that The
Bulletin called the wife of the
Chief Minister, Marie.
Ms Atkinson wrote that
Marie Everingham was in re-
ality Denise.
The name Marie was in-
serted into David McNicoll’s
piece (B, September 25) by a
sub-editor who had referred
to the trusty 1983 edition of
Who's Who.
A check on our Library
files showed that Who's Who
might have been wrong. A
phone call to Paul Ever-
ingham’s press secretary
Paul Murphy, confirmed that
Denise was indeed Denise.
However, the mystery
deepened when the editor of
Who’s Who Bill Draper, said
that the office of the Chief
Minister on October 11, 1982,
returned a signed proof of the
proposed insertion in which
the name Marie was given.
Flush of victory?
LEADERS of Britain’s
miners are leaving no stone
unturned in their efforts to
make their strike bite. They
have asked for every Briton to
try to flush their lavatories
after 6pm. They explain:
“This helps to activate sewer-
age pumps which are high
users of peak-rate electricity.”

ported recently: “Eighty per-

said if she were offered her
choice of chocolate chip
cookies or Robert Redford,
‘l’d take the cookies, thank

Academic arouses emotions
THE Azaria Chamberlain
case seems to create a momen-
tum of its own, as Dr Paul
Gerber, a law lecturer in the
Medical Faculty at Queens-
land University, has dis-
covered. Disclaiming any in-
terest other than academic
“I’m certanly not part of the
Chamberlain bandwagon”
Dr Gerber wrote an article on
the blood evidence in the
Chamberlain trial. He con-
cluded that “each side
adduced evidence of a killing
so baroque that either view
stretches credulity.”
The article was first sub-
mitted to the Australian Law
Journal, which decided
against publishing it, so Dr
Gerber then tried the Medical
Journal of Australia, of whose
editorial advisory panel he is
a member. It was published
and has since been reprinted
in a new paper aimed at the
dental profession, Australian
Dentistry News.
For his part, Dr Gerber has
received several abusive let-
ters and is beginning to won-
der whether he should have
written the article at all.

things. In London he told a

Press Association why he had
banned nuclear-armed vessels

place, you expect them to

‘Jungle’ juice is no miracle
AUSTRALIA has a new mir-
acle fruit or haven’t you
heard? Found in the “Austra-
lian jungle,” it prevents tooth
decay, lengthens your life,
adds lustre to your com-
plexion, clears up skin irrita-
tions and relieves arthritis. It
contains huge amounts of
vitamin C.
So Americans have been
told in a string of syndicated
magazine articles.
According to the articles:
“(The fruit) is the main item in
the diets of certain tribes of
Australian bushmen, most of
whom are over seven feet tall,
weigh 250 pounds and live to
be over 100 years old.”
The only claim which is
true, however, is that the fruit
is very rich in vitamin C.
The fruit referred to, Ter-
minalia Ferdinandiana , or
green plum, is found in north-
ern Australia. Researchers at
the Human Nutrition Unit at
the University of Sydney, Dr
Jennie Brand and Vic
Cherikoff, found in 1982 that
it was the world’s most con-
centrated source of vitamin C.
They and their professor,
Stewart Truswell, have been
deluged by letters from the US
requesting seeds and sample
of the fruit. One came from
Senator Roscoe Dean, Jnr, of
Georgia. Some have a sad ring
to them: “Where can I get
some juice to ease some of my
arthritic pains?”; “I want to
help my husband’s blood
pressure.” All are eager for a
miracle cure which doesn’t
exist.
The requests are addressed
to “Wesley Hargreave,” a
non-existent nutritionist
quoted in the articles, whose
address was given as that of
the Sydney University unit.
The university team, who
are studying Aboriginal
bushfoods, are somewhat
amused by the articles but are
also angry that their time is
being taken up with media in-
quiries and letters from gull-
ible people. Research money
for the project has only a year
to run, with further funds in
doubt.
Their work shows scientifi-
cally how Australian Aborigi-
nes managed to survive one of
the world’s harshest physical
environments sustained by
wild fruits, yams, seeds and
animals such as kangaroos
and snakes.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Lloyd
GARY ELKS took out the Com-
bidor SA Backgammon Cham-
pionships, held in Adelaide a
couple of weeks back. He won the
hard way via the last chance
tournament, beating Alex Athens,
John O’Grady and Terry
Effthimiou along the way.
It’s a long time since I’ve
talked about “overestimated value
of certain points.” Many rolls, es-
pecially at the beginning of the
game, looked upon as good are no
more than “convenient.” A roll of
5-3, for example, will secure the 3-
point, but at the start of the game
the 3-point is of little use.
Probably the most over-
estimated point is the 7 or bar
point, due perhaps to the fact that
for beginners it’s the most import-
ant. A beginner playing another
beginner is a long way in front if
he secures his 7-point, but as the
expertise of the players increases
then the importance of the 7-point
diminishes. Barclay Cooke, in my
view the finest writer on Backgam-
mon, suggests that you play a
series of games with an opponent
where every alternate game you
give him an opening roll of 6-1
and every other game he gives you
a 4-2. You’ll find out that the 4-2 is
the better deal!
Look at the illustration. Black
already has captured the most
valuable point the 5. White rolls
a 6-2. The bar point dotted line
play certainly looks attractive, it
seems to “fit” but it strips the 12-
point of any spare men. An alter-
native 6-2 would be to capture the
4-point and in this situation it’s a
superior play (WlO to W 4 and W 6
to W 4). White now retains flexibil-
ity on the mid point (Black’s 12-
point) and, by taking the 4-point,
issues a strong warning to Black
that if he (Black) gets hit, then his
re-entry could cause problems!

Opening lead king of
diamonds.
THERE ARE plays that look ab-
surd and yet make sense because
they provide the only answer to a
difficult problem. For an extreme
example, consider this deal where
West leads a diamond.
It looks as though declarer
must lose two hearts and three
clubs and go down two. But
bridge is a mighty strange game,
and, if South handles the situation
perfectly, he makes four spades.
He wins the diamond with the
ace, plays the 10 of spades which
wins, and continues with the
queen. Let’s say West covers with
the king. Declarer takes the ace,
cashes the ace of clubs, and re-
turns the four of spades to his own
deuce and West’s seven!
West now plays the Q-10 of
diamonds, South discarding two
hearts from dummy and two clubs
from his hand, producing this pos-
ition:

mond, declarer ruffs in dummy,

discarding his last club, but East is
stuck for a discard on this trick.
If he discards a heart, South
cashes the ace of hearts, ruffs a
club, ruffs a heart, and claims the
rest. If East discards a club in-
stead, South ruffs a club, plays a
heart to the ace, and ruffs another
club to score the rest.
