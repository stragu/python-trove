THAT’S WHAT YOU SAY
Adams and McNicoll
As an ex-Newsweek subscriber
transferred to The Bulletin, I was not
used to David McNicoll’s one-sided
view on southern Africa. I am relieved
to read Phillip Adams’ feature on
“Zimbabwe keeps its goal in sight” (B,
November 13). I will be a Bulletin
subscriber.
ALLEN NG
North Ryde NSW
Basis of freedom
No doubt argument can be entered into
as to the validity of Edward Rock’s
contention (B, Letters November 13)
that the United Nations will lead to
a loss of personal and national
sovereignty and, equally, intelligent dis-
cussion could also be held on his
statement that personal and national
sovereignty are the foundation stones of
freedom.
However, I am completely at a loss
to understand how personal and
national sovereignty can be the founda-
tion stones of truth.
THOMAS P. BYRNE
Lalor Vic
The Costigan approach
Regarding “The New McCarthyism”
(B, November 13), if we can assume Mr
Costigan has not suddenly taken leave
of his senses entirely and thereby lost
the experience, skills and qualifications
which merited him for selection for the
position of royal commissioner in the
first place, why has he seen fit to name
Mr Packer and not the dozens of other
more or less famous, wealthy, intelligent
and successful business people in
Australia as being implicated in or-
ganised crime? I can’t think of a single
reason.
The “reasons” you advance in your
article seem to be “he (Packer) is not a
plaster saint;” “personal factors should
not be overlooked;” “intuition;” “social
factor.” Are these enough to justify Mr
Costigan’s findings on Mr Packer,
rather than other names who fulfill the
“wealthy, intelligent” criteria?
JOHN A. BAKER
Davidson NSW
Black achievers
lan Templeton’s excellent news story on
the final destruction of the New
Zealand myth of racial equality between
pakeha (whites) and Maori (B,
November 13) contains, by implication,
some sobering thoughts about
Australia’s own white-Aboriginal situa-
tion.
Templeton’s catalogue of the Maori
“Pity about that, Miss Farquhar. He had'the makings of a great act
there. ”

The Mitsubishi Starion Turbo is rated as the best-
performing sports car under $25,000.
The proof! On Australian road-racing circuits, Starion
Turbo out-performs the best that Europe or Japan have to
offer in Group E production races. The score to date is
impressive 27 wins out of 33 starts.
Wheels Magazine September 1984
"Take a bow, Mitsubishi Starion, in the $20,000-
$30,000 coupe market there's none better."
So why change anything? Simply because we want
Starion to stay the best.
We're always questioning, always improving.We found
that a new low profile hood improved Starion's aerodynamics.
We knew that an optional limited slip differential would
maximise road adhesion. We also added a streamlined front
bumper with integrated halogen driving lamps, and an
appealing option of a two-tone metallic finish to enhance
Starion's striking sports design.
Turboelectronics. Under the hood Mitsubishi's legendary
turbo-charged power pack gives the kind of stunning
performance that makes Starion Turbo probably the fastest
Japaneseproduction caravailable in Australia. The lightest
and most advanced turbo unit and turbine impeller optimise
power and minimise lag.
The electronic fuel injection system is one of the most
sophisticated in the world. Ultrasonic sound waves measure
intake airflow digitally. Optimum air/fuel ratio is
masterminded by computer.

disadvantage in a primarily white
society (there are about 12 whites to
every Maori in the NZ racial mix)
crime, joblessness, lack of social status,
low educational achievement, land-
lessness and, he should have mentioned
but didn’t, poor health and low life
expectancy pales by comparison with
Australia’s black-white dichotomy. (No
complex pun intended!)
At least, in New Zealand, Maoris
may aspire to and frequently achieve
positions of high importance and mana
(loosely interpreted: reputation, good-
will, social standing, moral leadership)
in the society at large.
At the conference which Templeton
reports, there was a Maori minister of
the crown, a Maori psychologist, a
knighted Maori elder statesman, a
Maori professor of Finance.
And, I have no doubt, based on my
New Zealand experience, there were
also at that conference Maori doctors,
lawyers, senior services officers, MPs,
top-ranking civil servants, artists, poets,
writers, architects, plumbers, car-
penters, butchers, bakers and cabinet
makers indeed, Maori representatives
of the whole diapason of white social,
economic, political and other forms of
“achievement.”
Compare this with the occupations
and “achievements” a conference of
Aboriginals might represent.
At least there is a fair chance that in
New Zealand the Maoris are “making
it” in white terms and will do so
eventually without losing their Maori
tangata their pride in being Maori.
Australia? Aboriginals?
What aspirations, let alone achieve-
ments?
The Aboriginals’ fault? Hardly.
The whites’ fault? Certainly.
When are we going to do something
about it?

HENRY MOORE
Broken Hill NSW
Ferntree Gully High
“The horror story of Ferntree Gully
High” (B, November 6) exposed many
of the imperative myths of educational
modernism. Four of these which the
article touched on are:
1. “Participation” by teachers,
students, parents and the amorphous
“wider community” in all levels of
educational decision-making is a
theoretical “must.”
2. “Relevance” to the student’s “self’
of all subjects, materials and skills
which teachers pass on to their “clients”
is an actual “must.”
3. “Non-competitive assessment” is a
“teacher must” because it puts the
student at ease, allows him to “lay
back” and absorb his education in a
non-threatening environment. (Besides,
the mere numbers of an HSC or TES can
never adequately describe the actual
and potential abilities of a human per-
sonality) and
4. “The exponential rate of change”
which envelops us all makes curricular
flexibility an urgent “must.” The rigidity
inherent in tertiary-ratified courses and
externally set exams condemns both to
the trashcan of human development.
Taken in sum or singly, these im-
peratives are assertions of an in-
tellectual and moral nihilism in which
nothing has intrinsic worth or inherent
value. Whatever value education has is
ascribed to it by the student. There is no
knowledge, no truth, no ideal which is
worth pursuing for its own sake.
It is hardly surprising that some of
today’s schoolchildren are questioning
the very foundations of our culture.

On most long business flights
your legs go to sleep.
QPH 3616/L


That happy knack of being
able to sleep on long flights isn’t a
knack anymore.
We’ve introduced leg-rests to
all our Business Class chairs.
And if you’ve ever put your
feet up and settled back into a
deep, comfortable recliner, you’ll
know just how conducive to sleep
leg-rests can be.
Of course, they’re the kind of
thing you can rely on with Qantas.
We were, after all, the first
airline in the world to give Business
a special class of it’s own.
And our exclusive new leg-
rests are just one more example of
the way we’re continuing to support
you.
So when you go overseas on
business, go with the airline that
helps you arrive relaxed.
You might not be going there
for a holiday, but at least in Qantas
Business Class, you can put your
feet up on the way.

But with the leg-rests on Qantas’
Business Class, all of you gets to sleep.
QPH 3616/R


They are made to seek the true and the
good. For them, the cynical approach
the nihilist just doesn’t wash.
Nor is it surprising that others of
them lapse into the, at times, otiose and
the, at times, destructive patterns of the
truant and vandal.
Parents over 30 to 35 cannot
understand what is going on in the
schools. There is one major reason for
this. Virtually every new teacher and
educational administrator who has been
trained or appointed in the past 10 to 15
years has been trained to believe in the
so-called “progressive” theories of edu-
cation. This is true of both government
and Catholic teachers and admin-
istrators.
What further exacerbates the pro-
blem is that most ministers of Education
(state and federal) and members of the
Catholic hierarchy have either
tolerated, actively promoted or just
“approved” the adoption of “pro-
gressive” education.
Tim Duncan’s article has shown that
parents have the solution in their own
hands. (They are described as the first
and principal educators of their own
children in United Nations and papal
declarations.)
By taking their children out of
unsuitable schools, as they do by the
busload every day in Ferntree
Gully, they are merely exercising their
human and given rights.
If they are made to suffer for doing
so (eg, in Canberra, the ACT Schools
Authority has just adopted a policy
which will effectively remove busfare
subsidies for children who elect to go to
other than the nearest government
school), then, so be it.
In today’s educational milieu, it is
surely worth paying something for
something. After all, nothing will come
from nothing and don’t we want our
children to at least have the chance to
become something?
DON MOORE

Personal effort
I was amused but also annoyed by
Elizabeth Byrne’s complaint about the
“pampered” Aborigines (B, Letters,
October 30).
It seems to be the usual thing
nowadays in this country for people to
sit on their butts and wait for someone
else to do everything for them.
Why can’t the Aborigines at
Milingimbie get to work themselves and
dig a few cesspits or drains to divert the
sewage away, instead of expecting the
Northern Territory Government always
to do it? No one seems to have any
initiative any more or energy and
I’m sure there’s a bottom to all the
barrels of “goodies.”

A learning experience
Tim Duncan’s revealing article on Fern-
tree Gully High prompts one to re-
examine the school leaver/employer
interview scenario ...
Employer: (Talking to prospective
employee who is about to leave school):
Tell me how good you are at figures.
How well can you add?
School leaver: I have explored addi-
tion for several years in different
number bases and in different algebraic
structures. I have ...
Employer: (Interjecting) That hardly
answers my question.
School leaver: Well, I know that
addition is commutative and as-
sociative. For example, I know that
5 + 7 is the same as 7 + 5 and that this
property does not apply to all binary
operators.
Employer: (Wondering what goes on
in school these days.) Do you know the
result of adding 5 and 7?
School leaver: (Pensively.) No, it’s
not important. I could work it out. The
principle is the same for all addition.
My teacher, who recently left college,
told us that techniques did not matter

and that we should only bother with
ideas.
Employer: (Wondering what to say
next.) Did anyone in your class learn to
add?
School leaver: A few. Some boys did
it as a special project but not everyone.
We could choose anything that in-
terested us. We were encouraged to
develop as individuals. Some decided to
do no mathematics at all, others made
patterns or played cards. The important
thing is to be flexible and to understand
what you are doing. It’s bad to force
anyone to do anything; it crushes their
personality.
Employer: (Having decided that, al-
though the candidate is not quite what
he requires, he may as well find out
more.) When I was at school, we didn’t
make patterns. We used to do geometry
with proofs, we had to learn by heart
about 40 theorems. (With feeling.) We
had to work jolly hard; there was
trouble if we didn’t. In comparison, you
seem to have been to a sort of holiday
camp. Didn’t you do any real geometry?
School leaver: I did a little work on
the isometrics of plane figures things
like reflections, rotations and
translations. We looked at the sym-
metries of flowers and wallpaper
patterns.
Employer: (By now visibly shaken
and putting questions with the utmost
caution.) Sounds a bit different to the
geometry I did. Didn’t you even prove
Pythagoras?
School leaver: My teacher said you
could prove it with notations but she
didn’t remember how it went but, in any
case, the important thing is the ex-
perience of playing with shapes. She
often .said that we ought always to
remember the saying “I do and I
understand” and so we always did
practical work. We discovered for
ourselves and it was considered cheat-
ing to use any facts that we hadn’t
discovered ourselves.
Employer: Does that mean you
didn’t read much or do written exer-
cises?
School leaver: Yes. Books are old-
fashioned. We used television, overhead
projectors, teaching machines, Bmm
cine loops, tape recorders, cameras,
35mm slide projectors, structural appar-
atus, expanded polystyrene tiles and
lots of other equipment. You soon get
tired of books; they’re so limited. The
acquisition of techniques is bad. It
clutters up the mind. Mathematics must
be on-going and purposeful, not
fossilised in books.
Employer: (Wistfully.) We used to do
algebra, too. I enjoyed manipulating
symbols and solving quadratic equa-
tion. I’m sure it also gave me a better
understanding of arithmetic.
School leaver: (Condescendingly.)

individuals that will help them
reach their full potential.
This is when the strength
of our company, the force of
our technology and the steadying
hand of our support fulfill their
promise.
We put the awesome power
of the computer gently, but
firmly, at the fingertips of
millions of people around the

Fair taxation
The Hawke government could transfer
its assets test investigation to the Taxa-
tion Office, where help is needed. Extra
staff could turn up enough new files to
make up for the shortfall we pensioners
are to be slugged with.
A recent release by the Com-
missioner of Taxation stated that, as a
result of the prescribed payments legis-
lation, thousands of new files had been
opened giving a lift in income tax
receipts. This was nothing to crow about
because those tax avoiders would have
been brought to book much sooner had
the Taxation Office been doing its job
properly. (Don’t tell me those new
taxpayers had not been employed be-
fore the new regulations came in.)
And what about the thousands of
others not yet covered by prescribed
payments? Are they getting away
without making returns?
In my long experience dealing with
tax matters and working in a public
place, I have met only one tax investi-
gator. The department needs more in-
vestigators in the field well-paid,
highly-skilled operators with “know-
how” and muscle to bring all tax
avoiders into line. I know it will cost us
but it has to be done in fairness to
honest taxpayers.
If the Taxation Office cannot cope
with the situation, the Income Tax
Assessment Act should be scrapped and
“It’s the Robinsons, dear-can they borrow the cat for half an hour?”
value added tax brought into force.
That will catch everybody.

New Zealand stance
New Zealanders are again proving to
the world that they can press on regard-
less, even in the face of imminent
danger.
I, like most Australians, have met
thousands of them in my neighborhood
and to a man and woman they agree
with NZ’s Nuclear Arms Policy and
surprisingly are not afraid to say so.
The amazing part is that they are brave
enough to walk the streets of Australia
unafraid of any consequence.
This fearless attitude is a tribute to
the other half of their countrymen that
stayed at home to hold the fort while
these brave souls rowed off for assist-
ance.
It must be a worry for those at home
as they wait in safety for their loved
ones to return from the Aussie beach-
head.
Don’t despair, you few who stayed
behind. And please, keep those home
fires burning.

Engineers’ salaries
The only crossed wires over engineers’
salaries were in The Bulletin newsroom
(Intelligencer, B, October 30). The point
of the Engineers Australia salary report
was that engineers’ salaries had risen
17.5 percent over the two years 1982-84
while average weekly male earnings had
risen 21.2 percent in the same period. It
was the smallest two-year increase for
engineers since the study started in
1976. No attempt was made to compare
engineers’ salaries with other pro-
fessions, as was done in the Harricks
address.
By the way, it is the Instut/on of
Engineers, Australia not Institute
and has been since it was set up in 1919.

Recognition due
The least that the producers of The Last
Bastion could decently do is lay a
wreath on the grave it has dug for the
18th Australian Infantry Brigade. So
MacArthur was looking for a victory.
So it was provided by this brigade at
Milne Bay, in July 1942, when it in-
flicted on the Japanese their first defeat
in land battle a defeat of tremendous
psychological importance.
The brigade continued its forward
drive to play by far the major part in the
capture of Buna. Had these facts been
presented in The Last Bastion, the
validity of Blarney’s complaints to
MacArthur would have been far more
evident.
It seems that the feats of this brigade
will always be sacrificed on the altar of
sales to America. It was almost like
watching a rerun of the American televi-
sion series MacArthur.

DRIVE A LEGEND.
The legend began in 1885.
With two brothers and a
bicycle.
By jl B9l, the brothers
Peugeot had turned the bicycle
into the first motor car ever sold
A Peugeot won the very
first car race. Paris to Rouen.
And ever since Peugeots
have won a reputation that's
legend.
At Le Mans and
Indianapolis. And rallies from
Redex to the East African
Safari.
This latest Peugeot is the
STI. And the legend lives.
The STI will do 0-100 in
just 10.5 seconds. (It’s fuel
injected.)
It takes corners as if on
rails. (Its tyres are MichelinTßX
on alloy rims.)
And it looks like it’s flying
even when it’s standing still.
(Pininfarina styled it.)
Yet it has all the manners
that make Peugeot drivers take
the long way home.
Power steering. Fully
independent suspension.
And seats rated the most
comfortable in the world.
The air conditioning has
a split cycle to keep your face
cool but your feet warm.
The Pioneer FM/AM
stereo radio/cassette is
standard.
So is the central locking
system. And the hydraulically
adjustable headlights. And tine
electrically operated front
windows.
No wonder the STI has
become something of a legend
in just a few months.

values which guarantee the continua-
tion of our free and tolerant society.
It is alarming that I have
encountered a threat to these values in a
recent coast-to-coast visit to your
country.
What threat? Starting with smoking
but extending to other areas of personal
lifestyle such as drinking, Australia
faces an army of aggressive health-
nagging campaigners who are con-
vinced they have the right to interfere
with the decisions of adult men and
women on how they live their lives.
Ignoring warnings from the eminent
surgeon Dr Christian Barnard, they are
issuing too many “thou shalt nots.”
These professional wowsers, usually
funded by taxpayers, are working to
curb the freedom to smoke tobacco.
How? By singling out the smoker for
unfair, discriminatory taxes. By impos-
ing more and more bans on where a
man or woman may smoke. By censor-
ing information about cigarettes. And,
worst of all, by a subtle program of
conditioning and moulding of our at-
titudes to smoking through extravagant
media programs.
And the effect? To create, in their
own words, a no-smoking society by the
year 2000.
Significantly, in 1984, we have been
warned. The difference between a no-
smoking state and a totalitarian state is
merely a matter of time.
When will somebody stand up and
counter those professional anti-
smokers?
In Britain, FOREST (Freedom Or-
ganisation for the Right to Enjoy
Smoking Tobacco) was formed to fill
the gap in public debate and to ensure
that the two sides of the smoking story
were heard.
How long will it be before Australia’s
four million smokers join in to send this
simple message to the busybodies: “You
are entitled to your non-smoking
lifestyle, of course, but you must accept
that others will be free to disagree.
Please, ever so politely, mind your own
business.”

Alternatives to alcohol
Alcohol’s place in Australia’s scheme of
things is such that it has become our
major drug of abuse, costing the com-
munity thousands of millions of dollars
a year in health, welfare, industrial and
judicial costs. Christopher Boyle’s im-
passioned defence (B, Letters
November 13) of the alcohol industry’s
right to direct its messages to all sections
of our community including minors
is therefore misplaced, to say the
least.
What regulatory bodies such as the
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal could
do, along with providing some protec-
tion from exhortations to freely imbibe
alcoholic beverages, is to insist that
equal time be given to health promotion
and the presentation of non-alcoholic
alternatives in all situations were
alcohol is available.

Raison d'étection
It is high time that Mr Hawke states his
reasons for calling an early election at a
time when there is no apparent reason
to do so. I have been under the im-
pression that he has spoken in favor of
longer parliamentary terms and has
been most critical of similar term-
shortening tactics from the Liberals.
Perhaps he fears that the risk of his
government being overthrown is much
higher if he delays for another year, and
this thought leads one to speculate on
what factors are causing him anxiety.
Could the proposed revision of the tax-
ation system be the main one?

How a man who’s owned
the same suit for the last
thirty years has changed
the way the world dresses.
Your name’s Pierre Cardin.
You’ve just bought Maxim’s in Paris,
possibly the world’s most famous and
exclusive restaurant.
A thought strikes you.
Why not open a cheaper sister-
restaurant to Maxim’s?
Brilliant.
But what will you call this sister
restaurant... Max’s? Maxine’s? Maxelle’s?
As you ponder, you might let your
mind wander back over your career.
How you started at Christian Dior’s
then set up your own design firm in 1950.
How your bubble dresses triumphed
all over the world.
You smile as you remember the
shock you caused in haute couture circles
when you became the first top designer
to launch a ready-to-wear collection.
And then you had the nerve to open
ready-to-wear departments for both men
and women, bringing style and elegance
to people without limitless money,
particularly the young.
(Just as you hope to do with this
restaurant you’re trying to name.)
Then came those wonderful ’6o’s.
Your simple geometric shapes dom
inated even that dazzlingly flamboyant
age.
And your idea of exaggerated
shoulders was one of the few landmarks
in the anonymous ’7o’s.
It amuses you to know that you’ve
given the world some of its most
adventurous fashions, yet you have long
preferred immaculate suits.
You’ve been wearing one of them
for over 30 years.
They suit you. You know they’re
right for you in the same way that your
designer’s eye knows what’s right for
millions of other people.
Yes, you’ve been at the top of the
fashion world for 40 years and have
won every award it offers.
Yet you can’t think of a name for
Maxim’s cheaper sister-restaurant.
But wait... of course, Minim’s.
So deceptively simple, so obviously
right. So like every item that bears your
name. And so typical of you if your
name’s Pierre Cardin.

THE WEEK’S ACTION
AUSTRALIA
Campaign: official
PRIME Minister Bob Hawke
and Opposition leader An-
drew Peacock formally
launched their respective
campaigns for the December
1 federal parliamentary elec-
tions after a month of
electioneering. Hawke pre-
sented Labor’s program to a
mass meeting at the Sydney
Opera House and Peacock
enumerated Liberal intentions
to a big open-air gathering in
Melbourne.
Disarming statements
HAWKE appealed to the
electorate not to “waste”
Senate votes on the Nuclear
Disarmament Party and Lib-
eral deputy leader John How-
ard argued that, while his
party had no desire to see the
world blow itself apart, Lib-
erals believe in multilateral
disarmament.
Space gun help
PRIME Minister Hawke
admitted that Australian
scientists had contributed to
United States research on an
electro-magnetic rail gun to
destroy enemy ballistic mis-
siles in space. But, said
Hawke: “There will be no
involvement of Australian
research workers in this area
beyond the conventional
defence concepts.”
Costigan criticised
THE NSW Bar Association
has criticised Frank Costigan
QC’s handling of the Royal
Commission into the Fed-
erated Ship Painters and
Dockers Union. Association
president Murray Gleeson QC
said Costigan’s attitude that
he could ignore the rules of
natural justice was wrong.
War on AIDS
AUSTRALIA’S Health min-
isters and 40 other top-
ranking officials held an
emergency meeting in
Melbourne for talks on or-
ganising to combat the
spreading of the virus disease
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) which has
killed nine of 26 confirmed
victims in Australia. A prime
concern was the matter of
blood donations, through
which homosexual males par-
ticularly can transmit the dis-
ease.
Unhealthy turn
THE NSW doctors’ dispute
took a turn for the worse last
week when orthopaedic sur-
geons and general surgeons
formally broke away from the
NSW branch of the Aus-
tralian Medical Association.
The surgeons consider their
fight as being against nation-
alised medicine and believe
the AMA sees nationalisation
as inevitable.
THE WORLD
Astronauts Dale Gardner and Joe Allen with recaptured satellite
Super power salutes
THE Kremlin congratulatory
message to President Reagan
on his re-election and
Reagan’s answer have raised
careful hopes for improved
relations between the two
superpowers. Soviet number
one, Konstantin Chernenko,
declared that “we have no
alternative but to live
together” and said the Soviets
wanted to reach agreement
with the US “on a whole
range of issues.” Reagan
shared the Soviet hope that
“the coming years will be
marked by improved relations
between our two countries.”
Space rescue work
AMERICAN space shuttle
Discovery crew succeeded in
salvaging two communica-
tions satellites from “useless
orbits.” Their total loss would
have cost about $lBO million
to insurers who may now
recover $5O million by re-
furbishing and reselling them.
Indian elections
INDIA’S Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi has announced
national elections for 515
seats of the 542-seat Lok
Sabha (House of Represen-
tatives). Because of civil
unrest, the people of two
States — Punjab (home of the
Sikhs) and Assam — who send
27 deputies to the parliament,
will vote later. Gandhi’s Con-
gress (I) Party which had been
losing ground before the as-
sassination of his mother Mrs
Indira Gandhi is likely to be
swept back to power on a
wave of sympathy following
her murder.
Long-term plans
SINGAPORE’S Prime Min-
ister Lee Kuan Yew, 61, told a
television interviewer that he
wanted to retire from politics
in “four or five years.” “An
ideal reitrement age,” he
said,” is 65 — if I am still
healthy.” He made the an-
nouncement now because
“this will enable the younger
generation to consider how to
arrange their work.”
Back-to-work violence
SOME of the worst acts of
violence erupted on south
Yorkshire picket lines in the
36-week-old coal miners’ dis-
pute over pit closures. The
pickets, trying to stem the
mounting pace of a drift back
to work, hurled petrol bombs,


PATRICK RIVIERE/SYDNEY FREELANCE
Roberto Moreno on his way to victory in the Australian grand prix
besieged a police station, and
threw glass on roads leading
to pits. A National Coal
Board spokesman said 56,000
miners were now at work of a
total workforce of about
180,000.
Korean truce talks
A HIGH-LEVEL delegation
from each of North and South
Korea met at the truce town
of Panmunjom to discuss
economic co-operation be-
tween the two parts of the
country which has been
divided since 1948. The 2/ 2 -
hour meeting produced some
proposals for the exchange of
goods and, for the first time,
ended “in a good atmos-
phere.”
Moroccan walk-out
MOROCCO walked out of an
Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) summit conference in
Addis Ababa after the other
participants invited the
Polisario Front to take a seat
at the gathering. Polisario is
the independence movement
of the Western Sahara. It has
been fighting Morocco
which claims sovereignty over
the former Spanish colony
since 1976. Morocco had
threatened to leave the OAU
if Polisario’s self-styled
Saharan Arab Democratic
Republic was admitted.
Kanak boycott
PRELIMINARY figures on
the New Caledonian elections
for a 42-member Territorial
Assembly indicated that
about 56 percent of the elig-
ible voters (mostly Kanaks)
boycotted the polls in protest
against French plans to in-
troduce gradual independ-
ence for the islands. The pro-
test campaign was led by
those in favor of immediate
independence. As a result of
the boycott, the anti-indepen-
dence Republican Congress
Party seemed to have won 34
of the 42 seats and the right to
form a government.
BUSINESS
Deficit leap
THE latest balance of pay-
ments figures showed
Australia’s current account
deficit hit $lOB2 million in
October a monthly record.
The deficit, almost twice as
high as that of October last
year and $677 million higher
than in September, was a
direct result of a steep slide in
Australia’s trading perform-
ance and a continued net out-
flow of funds to meet the cost
of so-called invisibles (such as
shipping insurance and in-
terest payments).
Bank’s bonanza
WESTPAC Banking Corpor-
ation posted a banking in-
dustry record profit with
earnings up 37.7 percent to
$306 million for the year to
September 30. The bank an-
nounced plans for a one-for-
four shares issue offered at
$2.50 against a closing price
of $4.02 for the week.
ACP appointment
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated
Press has announced the ap-
pointment of Sue Wannan as
electronic publishing editor.
Wannan has worked for
Australian Consolidated Press
for 12 years in senior editorial
positions. She has also held a
Churchill Fellowship to study
electronic editing in Europe
and America.
Markets buoyant
STOCK markets continued
on their merry way with the
All Ordinaries Index finishing
the week at 782.5.
SPORT
Windies whipped
THE West Indies were beaten
by 71 runs in their match
against New South Wales.
Highlight was the perform-
ance of NSW spin bowlers
Robert Holland and Murray
Bennett who took 15 wickets
between them. The tourists
made a second-innings 133.
Horse racing
SOUTH Australian colt
National Gallery (2-1) won a
three-state finish of the West
Australian Derby (2400 m) at
Ascot. Local star Importune,
sent out favorite at 6-4, was
runner-up three lengths back
and Sydney’s On Stage (20-1)
a further six lengths away
third. The winner’s trainer,
Colin Hayes, also turned out
Brave Salute (7-4 favorite) for
Hayes’ fourth Sandown
Guineas (1600 m) success in
the past eight years in
Melbourne. He provided the
quinella, with Delightful Belle
(13-2) finishing second. Rich
Brother (12-1) took out the
Sandown Cup (2400 m) from
Melbourne Cup minor
placegetters Mapperley
Heights (7-2) and Chagemar
(3-1).
Car racing
BRAZIL’S Roberto Moreno
won his third Australian
grand prix at Calder Park
raceway in Melbourne. World
Formula One stars Keke
Rosberg (Finland) and
Andrea de Cesaris (Italy)
were second and third,
respectively. Alfredo Costan-
zo of Victoria was the first
local driver home, finishing
fourth.
Golf
TOM WATSON, of the
United States, won the
$200,000 Australia Open at
Royal Melbourne course with
a seven-under-par 72-hole
tally of 281. Only one stroke
behind was Bob Stanton, a
former golden boy of
Australian golf who is on the
comeback trail after domestic
troubles and a break from
competition.

AUSTRALIA
Exclusive: govt plans changes
to the royal commissions Act
Sweeping changes planned for the federal royal commissions Act will rid future
commissions of a star chamber atmosphere. RICHARD FARMER details the
proposed changes.
CHANGES TO THE royal commis-
sions Act to spell out principles of nat-
ural justice for witnesses will be made
by a new Labor government. The legis-
lation being planned will also allow
governments to set up other forms of
inquiry with more limited powers than
those of a royal commission. Strict
curbs to limit the area of inquiries and
spending by royal commissioners are
also planned.
Support for the revision of the royal
commissions Act is coming from all fac-
tions of the Labor Party. The Costigan
royal commission report has provoked
widespread concern within the caucus
that the present law does not offer
witnesses sufficient protection. Further,
the cost of other royal commissions still
in progress has convinced Finance min-
ister John Dawkins that a tightening up
is needed.
The existing federal legislation does
not contain detailed rules of procedure.
This absence allowed Frank Costigan to
deny people appearing before him, in-
cluding Consolidated Press chairman
Kerry Packer, the right to know what
allegations had been made about them.
This position will definitely be
changed. Government ministers are
taking as their starting point in de-
termining what the law should be, a
1976 report into Australian Govern-
ment Administration by the Coombs
royal commission. In an appendix to
that report, Professor Enid Campbell
said the absence of detailed rules of pro-
cedure did not mean that a royal com-
mission was free to conduct its proceed-
ings in any manner it thought fit. In
some circumstances, Campbell argued,
there might be an implied legal duty on
a commission to comply with the rules
of natural justice.
“If, for example,” she wrote, “a royal
commission were set up to inquire into
and report on allegations of misconduct
against named persons, or if allegations
of misconduct were made in the course
of evidence, a commission might well be
in breach of natural justice if it failed to
give the ‘accused’ an adequate opportu-
Finance minister John Dawkins: concerned about the costs of royal commissions
nity of answering the charges.” Camp-
bell quoted as legal authority the case of
the Ontario Crime Commission ex parte
Feeby & McDermott.
Given the varied purposes for which
royal commissions are used in Austra-
lia, statutory rules of procedure appro-
priate for all cases would be difficult to
frame. But general principles are easier
to determine and these are likely to be
those laid down by the United Kingdom
Royal Commission on Tribunals of In-
quiry which reported in 1966.
Those guidelines, essentially the
principles of natural justice, were
summarised by the British royal com-
mission as follows:
■ Before any person becomes
involved in an inquiry the tribunal must
be satisfied that there are circumstances
which affect him and which the tribunal
proposes to investigate.
■ Before any person who is involved
in an inquiry is called as a witness, he
should be informed of any allegations
which are made against him and the
substance of the evidence in support of
them.
■ He should be given an adequate
opportunity of preparing his case and of
being assisted by legal advisers and that
legal expenses should normally be met
out of public funds.
■ He should have the opportunity of
being examined by his own solicitor or
counsel and of stating his case in public
at the inquiry.
■ Any material witness he wishes
called at the inquiry should, if reason-
ably practicable, he heard.
■ He should have the opportunity of
testing by cross-examination conducted
by his own solicitor or counsel.
While it is the Costigan royal com-
mission’s activities which have pro-
voked the review of the royal commis-
sions Act, it is not seen by the govern-
ment as the only reason for such a re-
view. Campbell in her report drew at-
tention to the difficulties caused by the


PUBLIC OPINION
A small swing
back to the
coalition emerges
THE MORGAN Gallup Poll recorded
a clear swing to the Opposition last
weekend, the weekend following the
party leaders’ policy speeches.
Support for the Liberal and National
parties jumped 3 percent on the level of
the previous weekend (November
10/11) to reach 41 percent.
This is the most up-to-date polling
available. Normally, only the results for
the weekend of November 3/4 would
have been available this week. But
Morgan Gallup Poll staff worked until
4.30 am on Monday to compile and
analyse the results of last weekend’s
interviews.
By producing the results so quickly
Morgan Gallup has become the first
poll to detect a Liberal-National Party
fightback in the campaign.
According to the poll, published
exclusively in The Bulletin, Labor would
have been returned with an increased
majority if an election had been held
last weekend. The ALP received 49.5
percent of the vote in the 1983 election.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s ap-
proval rating dropped back to 67 per-
cent (a fall of 4 points) while Opposi-
tion leader Andrew Peacock’s approval
recovered to 31 percent (up two points).
Labor’s support also fell in polling
for the Senate election, dropping back
two points to 44 percent. Liberal Party
backing rose two points, to 30 percent.
The National Party remained stable at
9 percent. The Nuclear Disarmament
Party registered 5 percent support, a rise
of 1 on the level of the previous
weekend but 3 down on its high point
recorded on November 3/4.
Labor’s 9 point lead over the coali-
tion in the race for the House of
Representatives is similar to the posi-
tion two weeks before last year’s elec-
tion when the ALP led by 10.
Labor’s winning margin last year
was 5.9 percent.
Analysis of Morgan Gallup Poll
figures shows that the coalition gained
support over the final two weeks of the
campaign both last year and in 1980
when it turned a 6 percent deficit into a
0.8 percent lead.
In 1980 and 1983, Morgan Gallup
was the only poll to forecast the election
results correctly. The poll estimates for
the major parties last year were within
0.5 percent of eventual election figures.
The results of the latest poll come
from asking 1211 electors on the
weekend of November 17/18 which
party would receive their first pre-
ference “at the election for the House of
Representatives on Saturday week,
December 1.” Of those surveyed, only 4
percent did not state a preference for
the House of Representatives.

undecided. Of ALP voters, 17 percent
(down 2) approved, 73 (up 2) dis-
approved and 10 were undecided.
The poll shows that the Australian
Democrats and the Tasmanian-based
Brian Harradine Group will hold the
balance of power in the Senate.
The Nuclear Disarmament Party will
be struggling to win a seat. Its best
chance is in Victoria where support for
candidate Jean Melzer was 8 percent.
The party’s New South Wales can-
didate, rock singer Peter Garrett, polled
only 6 percent.
Senator Don Chipp’s Australian
Democrats are likely to pick up seats in
NSW, Victoria and South Australia.
On the poll figures for last weekend
the likely results are: Queensland
ALP 3 seats, Nationals 2, Liberal 1 (with
the Liberals ahead of the Democrats for
the seventh seat); NSW ALP 3, L-NP
3, Democrats 1; Victoria ALP 3, L-
NP 2, Democrats 1 (with the coalition
and the NDP fighting for the seventh
seat); Tasmania ALP 3, L-NP 3,
Brian Harradine Group 1); South

PICKERING’S ELECTION


federal government not having any way
short of a full scale royal commission to
establish a body of inquiry with power
to coerce the giving and production of
evidence.
Some public inquiries have, of
course, been conducted quite effectively
without any statutory backing or power.
The inquiry earlier this year into the
Commonwealth Superannuation In-
vestment Trust was one of them. But in
that case it was clear from reading the
report of John Monaghan, who conduc-
ted it, that he was aware that he had no
protection against legal liability for a
defamation. Some of his conclusions
were thus stated in a very vague fashion.
Dawkins wants new legislation to
provide for inquiries short of full royal
commissions to have legal protection,
the power to compel the giving and pro-
duction of evidence, and to attach legal
sanctions to the giving of false testi-
mony and conduct impeding the in-
quiry. Campbell’s suggestion that legis-
lation might be enacted to subject the
investigators to rules of “due process”
in the interest of fairness to witnesses
and persons whose activities are being
investigated is also supported. □
Hawke and the dawn of an era
JOHN EDWARDS, just returned from Washington, reports on a charged
Australia and the style of the man who is leading it.
AT 11.15 in the morning a few
Wednesdays ago before the federal
election campaign officially opened but
weeks after it had unofficially begun
Prime Minister Bob Hawke arrived at
the Sydney Opera House for a
ceremony introducing new postage
stamps. What we print on our stamps
and coins is qs close to an official art as
we go and generally does say something
about how our officials see themselves
and us. This sequence was designed for
the coming bicentennial of European
settlement in Australia. To offset the
implication of celebrating a conquest,
Australia Post thinks it politic to
reproduce Aboriginal designs.
Hawke was dressed in a light grey
suit, with a white shirt and grey tie. He
said that Aboriginal art was a “vital
part” of our heritage and that the
bicentennial prospect compelled us to
reflect on where we were going as a
nation.
In this campaign, the first thing that
we think about when we reflect on this
theme is Hawke himself. We have Labor
governments in four states and we are
about to re-elect by a landslide Hawke’s
federal Labor government. The Labor
Party campaign song fires out the words
“Unstoppable, invincible, incredible,
unbeatable, undeniable.”
Opening Labor’s federal New South
Wales campaign, Premier Neville Wran
spoke of the “natural governing party”
in Australia and of the December 1 poll
as “an unprecedented opportunity to
remould the political map of Australia.”
These are big things to say about an
election in which not many people are
interested but, in a way, it is true.
Changes occurring which are import-
ant, which will produce by the
bicentennial year an Australia very
different from the one so many people
had grown used to.
The most important evidence of the
profundity of this change is that it slips
on without difficulty, like a new shoe
Prime Minister Hawke launching Australia Post’s latest stamp issue
that fits straight away. The change has
already occurred, and it was that Labor
in Australia ceased to be the kind of
party that it was a decade ago. What is
happening is that we are beginning to
perceive the change.
ON THE DAY Hawke went to the
Opera House for the stamps, Opposi-
tion leader Andrew Peacock visited
Bondi Junction shopping mall in
Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
Peacock was having a miserable
time.
In Burnie, Tasmania, the day before,
no one had called in to a talkback radio
show on which he was the guest. A little
before that, a rally in Sydney had been
called off. That morning, another talk
show host was surprised when Peacock
turned up claiming that he had not
been invited.
The Australian Financial Review’s
Greg Hywood, an accurate and well-
informed reporter, had written that
Peacock’s Liberal Party would release a
statement on economic policy but the
leader knew nothing about this state-
ment. People said that his face looked
odd after his eye operation this year.
His television ads were said to be bad.
The public opinion polls showed his
personal approval under 20 percent,
which is very low indeed. He was
smoking a lot.
For all this, Peacock was cheerful
and seemed relaxed much more so
than I have seen him in the past.
He was as relaxed as a man is when
his fate has been irretrievably decided,
when events are no longer under his
control.
Peacock walked quickly through the
mall, entering shops, shaking hands
with people who stood still long enough
for him to catch them. There were no
crowds to greet him, no great sign of
advance work. His longest and most
effusive meetings were with reporters he
had not seen for a while. When he left,


we could hear people saying “We want
Bob, we want Bob” though we could not
see who was saying it. It was like the
stage whisper from the wings that is
accompanying Peacock through this
election.
With the reporters, whom he joined
in their press bus, Peacock was candid
and friendly. This is his natural manner,
his real personality.
When he becomes authoritative,
when he asserts leadership, it somehow
does not sound right: It seems a depar-
ture from his real self.
“I do the policy,” he was telling
Hywood in the bus. Peacock put the
emphasis on “I.” He repeated: “If it’s
policy, you ask me about it not
Melbourne.” Next day, he was reported
as telling other journalists in Queens-
land that “I do the policy.”
IN GOULBURN the following day, the
Prime Minister campaigned in a shop-
ping arcade. Two women one
blonded, the other grey and both in late
middle age paced along behind
Hawke and the group surrounding him.
“Human being, isn’t he?” said one.
“Just one of the boys; yes,” said the
other.
“He’s not a tall man,” the first
observed, clinically.
“No, no, he’s not a tall man.”
Their comments ceased to be a con-
versation ...
“Got time for the kiddies, too.”
“I’m so excited, I could die.”
“Menzies would not have done that.”
One of the women slipped forward
and lightly clutched Hawke’s elbow.
Both women then disappeared back
into the crowd.
When he walks along like this,
people say “Good on you, Bob” in a
way which they think is bold, so they are
shy afterward. Parents want to have
their children touched by Hawke.
The Prime Minister ran into a group
of schoolchildren. He said: “Good day,
kids. How are you? Alright?”
Some of boys had pieces of
paper, which they asked him to
autograph. Others, who did not have
paper, turned to me.
“Can I get a bit of paper off you?”
one asked, then another, then another.
Each piece of paper was cut three ways.
As we progressed through the arcade,
my notebook filled up at the front and
disappeared from the back.
An elderly woman asked: “How are
you going, Bob?” She then dipped her
head in pretended embarrassment. A
man presented a child wearing a yellow
visored cap with “Terrigal” printed on
it. Hawke asked what the child’s name
was. Told that it was Brett, Hawke
asked whether that was with one “t” or
two. He then wrote: “To Brett. Best
Wishes, Bob Hawke” on the visor. A
man said: “Thank you and God bless
you.” A woman said: “Glad to meet you
and God bless you .. .”
IN A SPEECH in Goulburn later that
day, according to a count by reporters,
Hawke used the term “path” 16 times.
He warned that the Opposition was
inviting Australia to go back down the
path of confrontation, the path of social
antagonism and so on. He asked the
audience why they would wish to return
to this path when they had tried an
alternative path of national reconcilia-
tion. We would continue to walk that
path in the next term of his government.
The lunch group he addressed was
sponsored jointly by the Chamber of
Commerce and the Labor Council, so it
represented the idea of consensus upon
which Hawke has built both his per-
sonal success and that of his govern-
ment. He told the audience that it was a
“mini-summit” and that he would
“report” to it on the way . his govern-
ment had carried out its job over the
past 18 months. He referred, as he often
does, to the “great tragedy of our
country that labor and business have
seen their interests as mutually ex-
clusive” and that this had changed

The Bulletin’s Washington corres-
pondent John Edwards has
returned to Australia. Edwards,

on politics and economics, im-

trail with Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and Opposition leader
Andrew Peacock. In coming

with the wages and prices accord and
the “spirit” of last year’s economic
summit.
Hawke said that the level of in-
dustrial disputes was the lowest in 16
years, that interest rates had come
down, that growth rate of prices had
slowed and more jobs became available.
He warned that the Liberal Party would
bring back the bad days, “the greatest
degree of social divisiveness in your
memory,” would scrap the accord, the
Economic Planning Council . . . and so
forth.
In Goulburn that day, Hawke
frequently used the following words:
relevant, irrevelant (often “totally” ir-
relevant), realistic, empty rhetoric, total
dishonesty, totally inappropriate, empty
talk, clear indictment, state of chaos,
cheap and easy resort to slogans, very
basis, wanton and reckless.
Hawke likes to say that he and the
Australian people are working together
on the great issues and that he has been
open and straightforward with the
electorate. Very often he is not. On the
day that Ronald Reagan was sweep-
ingly re-elected in the US, Hawke called
a press conference at Kirribilli House in
Sydney. It was a grey, stormy day. Boats
in the harbor keeled in the wind. Across
the water, you could clearly hear the
clash of a metal hammer on ship’s steel.
After some time, the Prime Minister
emerged and sat on an iron garden
trestle, across from a dozen tape
recorders on a marble-topped table.
Hawke spoke monotonically, as if
performing a duty. He said that he had
sent his congratulations to President
Reagan on what appeared to be the
most decisive victory in US history.
Hawke expressed confidence that
Reagan would devote considerable at-
tention to disarmament and would act
to reduce the deficit. Hawke said that he
had been in contact with the President
and with Secretary of State George
Shultz and was gratified that the US
welcomed our interest in these issues.
How seriously does Hawke take this
kind of thing?
Over that week and others he was to
talk about disarmament on various oc-
casions. He said in his campaign-
launching speech that Australia would
work to remove the threat of nuclear
destruction hanging over all of us.
These are things, like his commitment to
keeping inflation under 5 percent or
that Australia will not have further
recessions (expected or unexpected),
which make the depth of the change
which Hawke believes he has brought to
Australian politics difficult to judge.

The Sydney Liberal rally that wasn’t a rally
ROBERT MORT
They are things he wants but cannot
control and, therefore, cannot make
rational promises about.
The important issues facing his
government over the next three years
are that the US deficit will not be
reduced, that disarmament of any kind
will not occur, that a growth pause or a
recession probably will occur in the
ordinary course of things by 1986 or
1987, that inflation is likely to exceed 5
percent throughout the period.
These are things well understood by
ordinary people. It would be difficult to
find too many ordinary Australian
voters who believe that Hawke can stop
recessions or keep inflation under 5
percent or that Australia can have any
important influence on disarmament
negotiations between the Soviet Union
and the US. But political leaders, in-
cluding Hawke, cannot talk sensibly
about the issues.
THIS ELECTION is so much a
walkover for the Prime Minister that
some of the bigger issues of government
over the next three years are not getting
an airing.
In late June, I asked Hawke in
Canberra about the priorities of his
government after the next election. He
said: “It will involve consolidating the
apparatus we have been putting in place
and which has been so successful. A
government doesn’t need an incomes
policy in a recession because the market
does the job. What’s important for the
future is that we have established the
commitment of the trade union move-
ment to those processes. I want to see
that consolidated. That’s fundamentally
important and I think we are well along
the road to doing that.
“The second thing I would say is that
we will be giving significant priority to
restructuring our industry and trading
relationships in a way that maximises
our opportunity to develop our
resources. It involves the government
restructuring itself. We need to make all
the decisions in the area of training and
re-training and education in a co-
ordinated way to ensure that the struc-
ture of the economy and the workforce
will be compatible and will maximise
opportunities. That will be mirrored in
our approach to trade, to build up
relations with countries of the region
and especially China.
“Within Australia, we want to move
to a more equable society by ensuring
greater equality of opportunity within
the education system. We want to lift up
retention rates, which are appallingly
low.
“In the area of social welfare, we
want to do more to help those who
really need help. And in the in-
ternational area we want to play a
bigger role in international forums and
increase opportunities for effective dis-
armament. These are the objectives
going into the next term.”
I asked Hawke then about the size of
the budget deficit. He told me that he
was looking to cut it by at least one
percentage point as a proportion of
output in the August budget. He then
said: “I would not not want, at this
stage, to say what the deficit will be in
three or four years. What is sensible is to
look at the conditions in which you are
operating. You have to make a judg-
ment about the level of deficit which is
appropriate to the next period.
“I assume the level of economic
activity will remain high and that the
decision we make now will be consistent
with an increase in private investment. I
think we will be able to lower the deficit
again the year after that.”
I asked about changes in the taxation
system. He said: “I made it clear in the
last 12 months that we want the com-
munity to examine the tax system. We
have no commitment to particular
changes. Tax is simply a decision the
community makes to pass over some
resources to government to enable it to
spend what the community wants. It
may be that opponents of a particular
tax like a value-added tax, based on a
proposition I’ve been committed to
which is that you tend not to want to see
more indirect taxes because they are
regressive. But it may be there are ways,
with appropriate countervailing posi-
tions, that tax may come to be seen by
the trade unions as well as the business
community as an appropriate instru-
ment because to the extent there is
more reliance on that form of tax it
eliminates tax avoidance opportunities.
You need to feed all these considera-
tions into a community-based deci-
sion.”
I asked Hawke how he saw our
relationship with the US over the next
term. He said: “I am not pessimistic
about the US economy. The signs are
that the recovery is easing back to a
more sustainable level, so I expect it to
go on for some time. There are prob-
lems with the deficit and the admin-
istration will be doing something in part
to deal with it.
“The other issue is US-Soviet rela-
tions. We have obviously had a very
difficult period in the last 12 months
with the atrophying of decision-making
in the Soviet Union and Reagan coming
into an election period. Once he’s re-
elected, there will be a change in the
attitude of the Soviet Union. They will
have to deal with him and I assume they
would accommodate that fact.
“My own view is that Reagan and
Shultz then want to see a diminution of
tensions. My view and the view of my
Foreign minister is that the US does
want to see a reduction of tensions and
a resumption of talks in the inter-'
mediate nuclear forces series and the
strategic arms reductions talks. I am
quite convinced that this will happen.”
Finally, I asked Hawke about his
unusual style of government. He said:
“What was buggering Australia was the
trade unions, with their perfectly
legitimate aspirations, and the business
community - with its perfectly
legitimate aspirations conflicting
because of the attitude that they were
not compatible. It’s obvious that you are
more likely to achieve what you want if
you co-operate.
“We in this government don’t regard
ourselves as the only source of wisdom.
There is lots out there in the trade
unions and the business community.
“In government, you don’t do
minutiae from here (indicating his desk,
the room); you assume that your
ministers are competent, have integrity
and so on. I’m not an interfering prime
minister. And it works.” □

THE CAMPAIGN
A mood of
farce in the
theatre of politics
Prime Minister Hawke at his Opera House revival meeting
KEVIN BROWN
The policy speeches of the major party
leaders being almost devoid of specific
content last week, The Bulletin decided
that we might as well review them as
theatre. So we sent our acerbic drama
critic BRIAN HOAD to the shows:
TO LAUNCH a topsy-turvy election
campaign, the populist party of Robert
Hawke held an elitist revival meeting at
the Sydney Opera House. The leader of
those Born to Rule, Andrew Peacock,
risked more slings and arrows of out-
rageous fortune by trying to rouse the
rabble in the Melbourne marketplace.
The theatre of politics is in farcical
mood.
On an otherwise sombre occasion, a
few red balloons were on offer outside
the Opera House. There were not many
takers. They contained subversive, anti-
government propaganda. Only trust-
worthy party zealots had been invited to
this special occasion. “I-Love-Bob”
badges were popular.
Some taxpayers might argue that,
since they are paying out some $32.7
million to enable politicians to preen
and squawk at each other for the second
time in as many years, members of the
general public deserve the passing
amusement of at least a little bit of
carnival for themselves to relieve the
depression of this fatuous election. But
the Hawke people, whose brief taste of
power has made them arrogant, dismiss
such vulgar suggestions. They have
chosen “simplicity” as the key-note of
their campaign. It is supposed to reflect
the harsh and stringent economic times
we live in. Such times were not reflected
in the glossly affluent audience.
Where were the poor and needy? A
few were outside, curious to get in but
barred from doing so by burly gents in
strangely bulging suits. Apparently the
great man-of-the-people was rather
scared that some other, less trustworthy
people might attempt to throw cricket
balls at him. The ways of the gods are
wondrous when it comes to punishing
hubris.
The occasional interloper gained
access. An out-of-work starlet once
famous for being well-known in The
Young Doctors was recognised as such
and welcomed with open arms. Anyone
famous for being well-known on televi-
sion (whether you can recall their names
or not) is highly valued on such occa-
sions.
Television cameras become
desperate for something other than
ranting politicians to focus on.
The stage of the Opera House, being
equipped with much marvellous
machinery, has presented the illusion of
many a political triumph (and disaster)
in its time mostly operatic. The
Sydney Dance Company is in residence
there. Any of its four sets in use could
have been employed to political ad-
vantage.
For the homely approach, the
charmingly seedy village hall of Old
Friends, New Friends would have been
perfect. For emphasising nationalism,
the simple wide brown landscape of
Homelands could not have been
bettered. Political punch could have
been heightened in the boxing ring of
Black and Blue. And for the traditional
conservative approach, the Roman
forum of Janiculum was simply waiting
in the wings.
But the Hawke organisers are
amateurs when it comes to theatre. The
stage had been sealed off. There was no
band to play Waltzing Matilda. The
orchestra pit had been covered with a
glossy white dais. It held a glossy white
pulpit.
It was an expedient arrangement.
The opera theatre was being used as a
television studio. Rows G and H in the
stalls had been ripped out to make room
for the cameras. They are the best seats
in the house. Highlights of the pro-
ceedings were broadcast nationally that
night on all channels as the official
Labor Party policy speech. Some of the
censored bits were featured on news
programs.
The sombre mood of the congrega-
tion was slightly marred with in-
termittent outbursts of a particularly
banal pop song.
Only the initiated could understand
the badly burbled lyrics. Apparently, if
we would only work hard and stop
being cynical and follow our leader
with unswerving trust, we shall become
the greatest nation ever to bless this
Earth. It was the official hymn.
A voice from heaven announced the
coming of the priesthood. The ministers
from Canberra entered one by one. It
was a motley spectacle. On being hit by
the spotlights some became oddly coy
like schoolboys late for morning
prayers. Others attempted a more ag-
gressive stance as if raring for a fight.
All need a crash course at NIDA before
attempting such performances again.
All took their seats beneath the sacred
dais.
What with the cabinet reshuffles to
come, the congregation seized upon this
rare occasion to register their approval
ratings. Bill Hayden scored by far the
highest decibel reading in an outburst
seemingly born of many an uneasy
conscience of wrongs done to others
and ideals sacrificed to power.
Barry Cohen hardly made the needle
tremble in a bread and butter and jam
election, airy-fairy stuff like the arts and
the environment are of little import-
ance.
As high priest, Neville Wran was the
first to ascend to the holy place. The
sound of his Teflon vocal cords sounded
uncommonly worn. What with one
thing and another, he has had a great
deal of fast talking to do this year. But
showbiz professional as he is, the
required incantation was punched out
with panache, and as Isaiah and


Opposition leader Peacock in the marketplace: the Max Factor tan restored
DON McPHEDRAN
Blanche d’Alpuget had foretold, The
Prince of Peace finally appeared.
The sober, dark-blue suit, con-
servative tie and purest of white shirts
highlighted his marvellous Max Factor
tan redolent of surf and sun and
Andrew Peacock (before the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune caused his
to fade). Only the fantastically coiffed
hair suggested that, in fact, he does not
keep thongs and shorts ever at the ready
in his briefcase.
For this particular performance, at-
tempts had been made to choreograph
something of the man-of-god into the
more familiar act.
It did not work well.
He has difficulties in wearing the
cloak of humility with grace. The cen-
tral pose, hands folded piously upon
pulpit, was increasingly swept with
agitation as the sermon proceeded. In
more unguarded moments, forefingers
stabbed at unseen enemies; clenched
fists rose compulsively to threaten tax-
dodgers with fire and brimstone. But the
overall effect was edgy and disjointed,
lacking in wit and humor, devoid of
affection.
Sentimentalists and other softies pre-
sent still believe that genuine tears of
profound emotion glistened momen-
tarily in his eyes as the voice finally
faltered toward an ultimate vision of
paradise-on-Earth in Godzone. And if
the rhetoric was not entirely hollow,
then there should have been. But the
organisers dismissed such whimsy and
cut the magic moment from their even-
ing telecast, protecting their image,
which nonetheless still managed to
signal a little of the inner-man through
seismic convulsions of the left eye-brow.
The sermon rambled on for more
than an hour. The monotonous rasping
dulled the senses. But the general
If your courier can’t

message, intended and received, was
that of peace on earth and goodwill
toward men (and women) and a little
something extra for just about everyone.
Of course it was all too good to be true.
But as the unfortunate Walter Mondale
recently discovered, you can be too true
to be good in politics.
And the band played Waltzing
Matilda as Andrew Peacock descended
into the Melbourne marketplace for the
official launching of his campaign. He
had, of course, been campaigning
tirelessly throughout the land for at least
five weeks prior to this. His Max Factor
tan had been restored to its former
glory.
The sun broke through to comple-
ment the mood of sweetness and light. It
was almost a carnival scene. But the
sullen rabble did not respond. Perhaps
1500 turned up.
It would not have mattered if
nobody had turned up. Peacock is
running his race by clockwork and
nothing can stop him now. He even
seemed to be having fun, making merry
repartee with imaginary hecklers.
(Political commentators say that this is
quite normal behaviour on such occa-
sions and gives no cause for worry.)
He was relaxed, smooth, charming,
the matinee idol of old a little saggy
under the chin, to be sure, but nothing
that a quick cut and tuck couldn’t cure.
Laughter danced across his generous
mouth. And that was laughter glistening
in his eyes, not tears. It made a nice
change from Big Brother.
The image for the official Liberal
Party policy speech broadcast to a
drowsy nation that evening was of
somewhat sterner stuff, thinner-lipped,
paler.
But it had been cobbled together
weeks earlier. And, anyway, there were
sterner matters to be confronted such
as that wicked assets test worrying 90-
year-olds into premature graves.
Nevertheless, this friendly fireside
chat in homely surroundings of potted
palms, Pro Hart prints and family
photographs radiated warmth as he
reminisced about the good old virtues of
Australian individualism and hard
work and just rewards.
He too had had a vision, a vision of
the perfect family which dutifully
kept skipping across the screen in brief,
almost subliminal scenes of carefree
happiness, bathed in the glittering light
of some perfect and eternal summer’s
day. It was eerily Proustian.
Mr Hawke said that Mr Peacock did
not have a policy. Mr Peacock said that
Mr Hawke did not have a policy. The
rest of us must try to make a choice
between the good old days and a brave
new world, between charm and the
charisma, the dull and the dangerous
or just toss a coin. □
OPINION
‘Protests taking
place of issues’
for the poll
Eve Mahlab: “effective disincentive”
The Bulletin has asked prominent people
from outside the mainstream of politics
for their opinions on the federal election.
EVE MAHLAB, The Bulletin /Qantas
Australian Business Woman of the Year
for 1982, who has a management con-
sultancy to the legal profession, discusses
what the issues should be.
THERE ARE no “issues” in the
forthcoming federal election. There
have been only “protests.” These “pro-
tests” emanate from the Opposition and
other minority groups who feel varying
states of dissatisfaction about certain
matters.
These protests would be elevated to
the status of “issues” only if significant
numbers of people in the electorate
supported them. To date, the Liberal
and National parties have tried to
develop support for their protests about
organised crime, the economic manage-
ment of this country and taxation. Their
efforts have been unsuccessful.
Part of the problem is that people
stopped listening to the Liberal Party
some years ago because so little it said
was relevant. Unfortunately, no one
takes Opposition leader Andrew
Peacock seriously enough to start listen-
ing again.
Another part of the problem is that
Australians have been charismatised by
Bob Hawke. This early love affair has
been replaced by a perception that the
economic management of this country
is being carried on about as well as it
can be, by men and women who are
firstly competent and (as a bonus) like-
able.
The “haves” in our society, who
(thank God) make up the majority,
believe that the government is develop-
ing an environment which not only
allows business to do its “thing” (which
is to create wealth and re-distribute it
through wages) but also allows people
to do what they are best at looking
after themselves. While there are dis-
satisfied people in the electorate, the
need for continuity and predictability
outweighs any promises of change being
held out by the Opposition parties.
What, then, in this general atmos-
phere of complacency, should the issues
be?
I think they should be:
1. Our decreasing competitiveness
compared with the developing countries
of the Pacific.
2. The government’s failure to man-
age our human resources, as reflected by
the shortage of managerial talent, the
low educational levels of our popula-
tion, the low morale of large numbers of
our young people and the under-utilis-
ation of the female workforce.
3. The neglect of the government to
nurture small business and exploit its
potential to create jobs.
4. Our failure to develop community
support systems such as child care
which make upward mobility compat-
ible with family stability and which
alleviate the pressures on families
caused by the increasing demands of an
industrial society.
5. The increasing gap between rich
and poor, coupled with the increase in
numbers of those in poverty.
6. The unfair burden of the taxation
system and its effective disincentive to
work.
7. The erosion of civil liberties as
reflected by retrospective legislation
and the manner in which the recent
Taxation Laws Amendment Act was
enacted. (The Bill, which was 207 pages
in length, amended 19 previous Acts. It
contained grave implications concern-
ing criminality and the onus of proof in
certain criminal offences. Yet, it was
rushed through parliament giving
neither members of parliament nor the
prestigious Law Council of Australia or
the Taxation Institute itself time to
consider its proposals properly.) □

When you need to hire equipment
to get a job done, you want it now.
Not tomorrow or next week. NOW.
So, when the little guy behind the
garage around the corner says:
“We can probably have it for you a
week next Thursday..
Or “We’ve only got this one left I’ll
just put the cover back on” and it breaks
down after half an hour...”
Or “We haven’t got that exact thing,
but someone said this should do the
same thing, I think” and, of course, it
doesn’t, it doesn’t help you much.
That’s why it pays to go to the big one
in the hire business. Coates.
Coates cares
Because at Coates you get:
• 60 branches around Australia
• 7 day accessability
• Biggest range of equipment
• Free Advisory Service
• 24 Hour Emergency Service
• On-going Upgrade Programme
So, when it comes to the hire game, it

THE POLLSTERS
How Morgan
Gallup works:
an inside look
By TIM DUNCAN
PERHAPS THE only valid general law
in modern politics is that which predicts
the relationship between politicians and
public opinion polls: If the polls are
favorable to a candidate, he will take
the credit; if they are unfavorable, he
will blame those who collect the
opinions.
Only a month ago, federal Opposi-
tion leader Andrew Peackock sought to
divert attention from his plummeting
approval rating by hinting that the
Morgan Gallup Poll published in The
Bulletin was partisan.
Ironically, similar grumbles were
coming from the Victorian Labor Party.
Premier John Cain’s approval rating
had fallen to a new low of 44 percent,
while that of the state’s Liberal Opposi-
tion leader, Jeff" Kennett, had climbed to
40 percent too close for comfort, as
far as the Victorian ALP was concerned.
True to form, rumors circulated among
party faithful to the effect that the
Morgan Gallup Poll was cooked.
Equally true to form, these rumors
ceased when the next such poll showed
that Cain’s personal approval rating
had climbed to 52 percent. But a new
element of scepticism had crept into
state Liberal discussions of the polls.
The Morgan Gallup Poll occupies
centre stage at election time but few
people have personal experience of how
the Roy Morgan Research Centre goes
about collecting the opinions it
publishes. In the guise first of a trainee
“interviewer trainer” and second as a
trainee inverviewer, I was able to get a
first-hand idea.
The operation begins with the
Morgans: Roy, now aged 76, who
started the business at the suggestion of
then-chief of the Herald and Weekly
Times Sir Keith Murdoch, and son
Gary Morgan who is now the effer-
vescent conductor of the show.
The Morgans are practical people,
not too impressed by academic
qualifications. Gary went straight from
school to the business and he tries to
hire as many staff as he can with the
same common touch. If there is any god
for the Morgans, it is the man (and
woman) in the street. They describe
what he thinks, what he eats, what he
buys and every fortnight how he
votes (every week just before elections).
The girls who prepare the sheets of
Gary Morgan’s questions and who
select potential interviewers are them-
selves hired for pristine normality. In
turn, the perfect Morgan interviewer
(800 are on the company’s books,
working throughout the country) is
someone without any unusual airs.
“Any adult can ask our questions,
provided they can read, and any adult
can answer them provided they can hear
and understand English,” says Gary
Morgan.
Bruce Osborne-Smith, manager of
Morgan’s interviewing department,
trains interviewers in groups of three.
His briefing sessions assume nothing.
There is a Morgan method for every
aspect of the job.
“You ask the question exactly as
worded,” he ordered. “Don’t aid,

A standard drill applies to the front
door ... “I’m not selling anything, just
collecting information for statistical
purposes.” ... “You’ve heard of the
Morgan Gallup Poll?” ... “Good. It
won’t take very long.”

“Bill, we’ve got to start
meeting this way..
TAT/STD/A/L


The interviews can take 25 minutes
or more which is one reason why he
tells interviewers that they should al-
ways get to a seat as soon as possible.
Jenny, a mother of three, from the
western Melbourne suburb of Keilor,
went through a mock interview with
Osborne-Smith. They practised the
political questions, which always come
first. Morgans have little cardboard
ballot boxes which they issue to all
interviewers and they ask people to fill
out ballot slips indicating their voting
intentions. In this way, the interviewers
do not see the answers to the voting
preference questions in the presence of
those who provide them.
Jenny had a bit of trouble as the
questions moved from the House of
Representatives to the Senate. “Do I
have to say ‘next’?” she asked. “Yes
exactly as worded,” came the familiar
reply.
Questions seeking whether or not
people approve of particular leaders
provide some standard problems. “Do
you approve or disapprove of the way
Mr Hawke is handling his job as Prime
Minister?” read Jenny. Osborne-Smith
tried her out with a smart reply: “Do
you?” Jenny was stumped for a
moment. “Repeat the question, ver-
batim.” She did.
“He’s hopeless,” replied the trainer.
Jenny thought she had the answer but
Osborne-Smith cut her off: “Don’t use
‘He’s hopeless’ and leap to a conclusion.
Respondents will change their minds
six times, some of them. Get either the
word ‘approve’ or ‘disapprove’ from
them. If you can’t, enter it as a dud.”
Thus prepared, Osborne-Smith and I
went out to find the man and woman in
the street.
We approached a leafy St Kilda
block just as some dark and furious
clouds arrived from the direction of
Antarctica. We found our starting point
at the moment it began to hail.
Osborne-Smith began to reminisce:
Stalwart Morgan interviewers have
crossed raging floods and negotiated
impenetrable bogs. The company
annals contain tales of courage under
fire from squadrons of swooping
magpies and packs of savage dogs.
He was unable to recall an instance
where a Morgan interviewer had been
beaten up but did admit that in-
terviewers might have triggered some
ugly domestic scenes.
“Husbands and wives learn things
about their spouses they would never
have learned without Morgan,” he ex-
plained.
Nobody was in at the first house.
There followed two Greek women
without sufficient command of English,
in Osborne-Smith’s opinion, to warrant
interview.
Everywhere we saw the dreaded “Be-
ware of the dog” signs. With each
disappointment, the hail gathered
strength. We sprinted at last for a front
porch, ignoring the dog, and were
greeted by a spectacular young blonde
with a perfect suntan and lovely teeth.
To the uninitiated in these things, it
seemed the toothpaste and suntan lotion
manufacturers were about to get some
unusually accurate market feedback.
But no; Osborne-Smith had seen this
sort of thing before. “Morgan Gallup
Polls. You’ve heard of us? We’re not
selling anything but we’d like to ask
some questions about what you use ...
airlines and that sort of thing. Been
away lately?”
It was masterly.
Cheryl had just come home from
Greece and within seconds we were
sitting in the kitchen, brushing off the
hail. The political questions went
smoothly. We did not see how she
would vote but she approved of all the
politicians about whom Osborne-Smith
asked her Hawke, Peacock, Cain and

Kennett; Cheryl seemed to like them
all. At each point where she asked for
some sort of approval or prompting,
Osborne-Smith simply repeated the
question and waited silently for a reply.
It was a house shared by four people
in their 20s. While Cheryl answered
questions on cars, magazines, shopping
habits and travel, the boys stuffed a
roast to the tune of the rock band Pink
Floyd. By the time we reached a real
area of expertise, the chewing gum
market (Cheryl had tried all the brands
which Morgans were surveying), the
interview had become a struggle to
prevail over the music.
Morgan interviewers are instructed
to move exhaustively along a street,
turning right going out each gate and
taking the next house. The idea is that
otherwise, if interviewers were able to
pick which house or flat looked most
appealing, the sample would be dis-
torted.
We had finished our block but
decided to get one more interview, just
out of the blue.
Another woman opened the door.
She was older than Cheryl, more
nervous and more deliberative in her
approach to the questions. Osborne-
Smith passed her the cardboard ballot
box and she asked what the Progress
Party was ... “Can’t tell you. I don’t
know what they are.” She approved of
Hawke but was not so positive about
Peacock. Osborne-Smith was able to
make her state precisely whether or not
she approved of each leader in question.
Many people take personally any
failure to recognise brands and pro-
ducts. “Oh dear,” she groaned on sight-
ing a list of car-makers, “I’ll fail this
test,” She did not know much about
chewing gum. It transpired that she was
a nun and that the house in which we
were sitting belonged to the church.
The Morgan Gallup Poll annually
interviews about 55,000 people, at the
rate of some 1100 in each weekly
survey. Gary Morgan is fond of point-
ing out that, at such a rate, it would take
about 200 years to interview 11 million
people and that the chances of any
particular adult being interviewed by
the Morgan Gallup Poll would be
roughly 4 to 1 against.
Some areas are harder to mine than
others. Toorak, for instance, contains
many long driveways, large blocks,
maids and butlers, savage dogs. These
are all buffers between the interviewer
and those with opinions.
Morgans interview on weekends, so
that they can find a diverse spread of
people at home. The aim is to finish the
10 interviews comprising each weekend
assignment with respondents evenly
represented through sexes and ages.
By its nature, the Gallup Poll
operates at arm’s length from its
headquarters in Melbourne’s Bourke
Street.
Interviewing is nominally unskilled
work but Morgans pride themselves on
ability to attract and hold reliable
married men and women who can
receive instruction by mail and be
trusted to report on their assignments in
great detail. They are expected to pract-
ise their interviews each time they
receive a new assignment. If any one
cannot complete 10 interviews each in
close proximity to the starting addresses
selected evenly over the electoral rolls
in all states, he or she is expected to
arrange return visits. They also are
required to report exactly their track,
explaining in detail why any adjoining
dwellings have been missed.
The Morgan Gallup Poll is a tightly-
controlled operation based on the “pro-
bability sampling” method developed
by Doctor George Gallup in the United
States and copied by Roy Morgan first
in 1941.
For “probability” samples, the in-
terviews must be spread mathematically
at random. Interviewers must have no
say as to whom they interview and must
not be allowed to select substitutes for
unavailable people.
The record of the Morgan Gallup
Poll speaks for the value of the method.
It has never picked the wrong party to
win a federal election.
As for the federal general election of
December 1, Gary Morgan does not
believe that his interviewers have been
recording public opinion incorrectly for
the first time. From what I saw of the
poll, including routine collation and
coding of their efforts, the man in the
street rules. □
SPORT
Brains before
brawn to beat
the Windies
By RICHIE BENAUD
HOW TO BEAT the West Indies is a
problem to be tackled by neither the
faint-hearted nor the know-all. It
requires tactical planning of the highest
order, discipline with the bat, fire and
common sense with the ball and glue-
like fingers in the field.
There is one other minor matter:
You should try to organise it that you
have the proverbial luck of the Irish
combined with the fortune that general-
ly favors the brave.
There was a time when beating the
West Indies was a 60/40 chance for an
Australian team. Then, in 1960-61, it
became 50/50 and now they are the best
team in the world. Let there be no doubt
about that. They are the best team the
West Indies have ever put into the field
and I find it difficult to believe that
anyone has had a better team.
The two to challenge would be
Armstrong’s 1920 and 1921 sides and
Bradman’s team from 1946 to 1948.
Both those teams would have their
vocal and staunch advocates but a
couple of matters must be taken into
account.
Those who plump for Armstrong’s
team should refer to the cricket books
of the time which were prepared to say
that English cricket was then not quite
back to its dynamic best.
And a contest between the 1948 team
and this West Indian side would need to
be played under the laws of the time,
which allowed a new ball every 55 six-
ball overs instead of every 85 as is the
case today.
Now, there would be an interesting
battle! Marshall, Garner, Holding and
either Baptiste or Walsh against
Lindwall, Miller, Johnston and
Toshack, with Loxton thrown in for
good measure batting at number seven
and Tallon at eight. Spinner? Barnes, I
guess.
At any rate, the object of the exercise
is not to worry about what might have
been 37 years ago or even two weeks
ago but to wonder what might happen
in the second fiesta in Brisbane.
In Perth, Melbourne and Sydney last
week, all the talk was of what happened
to the Australian batting. If I were
conducting an inquiry into the match, I
would not be bothering so much about
that question but far more about what
happened to the Australian bowling.
To put it all in perspective for the


Brisbane test, the Australians’ game
plan needs underlining not changing
or throwing away; nothing was wrong
with their planning. But it needs
underlining because, to all intents and
purposes, in Perth it was forgotten at a
crucial stage of the match.
When your plan calls for the ball to
be kept up to the bat and moved away
from it if possible and when success
duly comes through this, I think it
strange to change.
Greenidge, caught by Rackemann at
extra cover from an Alderman out-
swinger. Richardson, bowled by Aider-
man with just about the perfect out-
swinger. Richards, caught by Phillips off
a splendid outswinger from Alderman.
Lloyd, caught Phillips off a well-pitched
delivery which cut away from the left-
hander. Perfect tactics.
Now add to that Desmond Haynes,
caught by Yallop off the cut a
superbly planned tactic between
Hughes and Hogg.
And that was 5/104.
It had been a long long time since I
had been more impressed by the dis-
ciplined approach of an Australian
team when up against such stern op-
position.
It has certainly been a long time
since I have been more disappointed
with a second phase of play such as we
then saw.
Short-pitched bowling, bowling at
the leg stump instead of the off stump,
field placings that either belied con-
sultation with the bowler or bowling
which defied consultation with the field
placings . . . and more and more short-
pitched bowling.
All that because of the sheer excite-
ment of having the Windies 5/104 on
the first morning of the match.
That had gone to plan perfectly.
What had been needed was to win
the toss and put the West Indies in when
Australian captain Kim Hughes: things took a turn for the worse
the pitch had some life in it and knock
over their first five batsmen before they
had made a hundred.
Well, perhaps 5/104 wasn’t perfect.
In the absence of sheer perfection, it
had to do.
Then to allow Gomes one of the
better and at the same time more frus-
trating batsmen in the world to
take runs to third man, fine leg, straight
down the ground, without any discern-
ible attempt to bottle him up merely
added to the misery of the moment.
You did not need to be an Einstein
on the second day to know that West
Indies captain Clive Lloyd’s tactics
would be to hang on out there so that
the Australians would have to bat for
something like an hour to 80 minutes.
Nor did it require any great working
of the mind to know that that would be
a hellish session for the batsmen, when
the bowlers knew they only had to get
through something like four or five
overs each.
Lloyd’s game plan worked perfectly.
He wanted to have something like
400 on the board if he had to bat first;
alternatively, he was lining up for the
same as the Australians ... half the
opposition gone for fewer than 100 runs
if he had won the toss and fielded.
The difference between
Australians and the West Indians lay in
two areas.
The West Indies were the better side
a point only grudgingly conceded by
some, despite the overwhelming margin.
And they were the more disciplined
team, bowling to each batsman in strict
accordance with the team planning and
the long discussions that go on in this
regard.
On the rare occasions when you see
Lloyd run from slip to have a word with
a bowler who is doing something
wrong, you can take it from me, it is a
serious matter. They know exactly what
they have to do and they do it ... or
they have to explain why.
The selectors will have named the
team for the Brisbane test by the time
this hits the streets but the three players
up for discussion will have been (a) an
opening batsman, (b) a middle-order
batsman and (c) a spinner.
No matter who the replacements are,
it is no good their walking on to the field
without some idea of what they are
going to do and then sticking to that
plan.
I promise you that an undisciplined
cricket team will never beat the West
Indies.
At best, it may give them a shock
as did England a few times last summer
and as did the Australians in those first
two sessions in Perth.
“Discipline” should be pencilled on
the inside of every Australian’s cricket
bag ... ink it on, if you like, and paste it
in their caps and tattoo it on their hearts
and every other pulsing part of their
anatomy.
If they do that, they will be using
their brains.
Not for the first time this season I
point out that, if you substitute brawn
for brains against the West Indies, you
have as much chance of victory as you
would have of winning this week’s
lottery with last week’s ticket. □


THE LEFT
Halfpenny
begins his run
in Wthe ALP
By ALAN REID
VIRTUALLY unnoticed, John Half-
penny union secretary, articulate and
able performer on television and a
leading member of the Communist
Party of Australia until he resigned
more than two years ago has started
his upward move in the ALP.
When some 700 members of the
Victorian socialist left voted
recently to select members of
the faction’s executive, Half-
penny was given the nod.
This executive has no
formal ALP status but
nevertheless is the dominant
force in management of the
Victorian branch and Half-
penny is destined for higher
things.
He is to be pushed onto the
administrative committee
which governs the state party
between conferences and
then, in June, to be socialist
left nominee for the national
executive. That would put him
in eyeball-to-eyeball con-
frontation with Prime
Minister Bob Hawke who
controls a slender majority on
the all-powerful party body.
The Victorian socialist left
operates as a party within a
party with its own confer-
ences, executive and officers. Those who
called its tune were such ALP old-timers
as:
■ George Crawford, of the Plumbers
Union,
■ Bill Hartley, a former Victorian
branch secretary who is anti-Israel, pro-
Palestine Liberation Organisation and
has shown on occasions that he does not
approve of Hawke,
■ Tom Ryan, of the Food Preservers’
Union, who holds many views similar to
those of Hartley with whom Ryan has
had a long association and
■ Joan Coxsedge, a fiery speaker
who has been critical of the Hawke
government’s reluctance to throw
Australian security services into the
discard.
But the power has passed largely to
another, more flexible group which in-
cludes not only Halfpenny but also such
people as:
■ Gerry Hand, one-time Victorian
ALP oganiser, now Member of the
House of Representatives for the ultra-
safe seat of Melbourne. A man of very
considerable energy, he ran Hawke to a
38/29 vote when they contested the
Wills electorate pre-selection in 1979.
■ Pete Steedman, 44-year-old MHR
for Melbourne’s Casey. Steedman wears
a biker’s leather jacket and specialises in
parliament in smart, often vulgar and
generally highly amusing interjections
during debates. And
■ Henry Shapiro, an ALP staffer who
probably has long-term parliamentary
aspirations.
Hand and Steedman have func-
tioned as organisers of the socialist left
and its left-wing allies in the federal
ALP parliamentary party since the
Hawke government came to power last
year. Considering the dominating per-
John Halfpenny: destined for higher things in the ALP
sonality of Hawke and the right’s
superiority in numbers when supported
as it usually is by Bill Hayden and
his centre left grouping, they have not
done badly. On occasions, they have
been able to down the right-wing NSW
faction which provides Hawke with his
power base.
But, nearer the grass roots in
Victoria, there has been a bit of a
vacuum since the death of Jim Roulston
of the Amalgamated Metals Foundry
and Shipwrights Union. Roulston like
Halfpenny, a former Communist Party
of Australia member who left it Without
any great manifestation of hostility on
the part of former colleagues was a
very important member of the Victorian
ALP administrative committee. He
called the shots for the socialist left on
that committee, over which he exercised
the major control.
Roulston was no orator but he was a
very able tactician. He manufactured
many of the bullets which others, such
as Hartley, fired. Roulston’s death left
things very much in the hands of
hardliners.
Largely because the hardliners were
dominant, a policy of “No comprom-
ises” was in place when the ALP confer-
ence was held this year to determine
national policy for the ensuing two
years. That attitude meant that the
socialist left and its left-wing allies took
scarcely a policy trick, though numeric-
ally they were the strongest single
grouping.
On the administrative committee,
Halfpenny would be expected to take
over the master puppeteer role which
Roulston played.
Halfpenny’s presence on the
National executive would not change
the voting strengths but it would add to
the left wing’s debating
strength. The executive is the
ALP’s supreme governing
body between biennial con-
ferences and its decisions are
binding on all members from
the prime minister down.
Hawke generally maintains
an 11/8 majority.
Halfpenny is important as
a symbol as well as in his own
right as an individual. His
rapid rise in the ALP un-
doubtedly will influence other
former CPA members who
resigned this year, publicly
declaring that they could not
see an effective future for it as
a political grouping. If
Halfpenny has a promising
future in the ALP, they may
well decide that they too
could achieve positions of
significant influence.
Halfpenny had to wait two
years, under ALP rules, before
being cleared for membership after he
left the communists. But, interestingly,
there is no other barrier to shifting from
the CPA to the ALP.
This is not the case for some right-
wing recruits. For example, Hawke has
been trying for more than two years to
have four right-wing unions the Shop
Assistants, the Federated Ironworkers,
the Society of Carpenters and Joiners
and the Clerks re-admitted to
Victorian ALP. National executive
recently has instructed that three of
them be re-admitted and that the fourth,
the Clerks, be put on probation. But that
fight is not over.
The state administrative committee is
prepared to stall indefinitely. It held
only a brief meeting this month to
determine preferences for the general
election and stood discussion of the
unions’ re-admissions over until after
December 1. The committee is deter-
mined that Hawke will not become a
more potent influence within the branch
than the socialist left. □

ESPIONAGE
Spry lays an old spook to rest
By ANTHONY McADAM
THE recent release of the Petrov papers
renewed speculation about spooks,
“agents of influence” and those “simple
believers in progress who get caught up
in things they don’t understand.”
As if to liven up the season further,
prominent Fleet Street spywatcher,
Chapman Pincher, late last month
published yet another book pointing
toward the identity of “The Big Mole.”
Titled Too Secret, Too Long, Pincher’s
book elaborates on his thesis (in Their
Trade is Treachery, 1981) that the real
“spy of the century” the much-mused-
about “fifth man” in the notorious
British ring which included Burgess,
Maclean, Philby and Blunt was none
other than Sir Roger Hollis, the former
director-general (from 1956 to 1965) of
Britain’s internal security agency, MIS.
Of special interest is that Hollis advised
the Australian government on forma-
tion of the Australian Security In-
telligence Organisation (ASIO).
Former MIS “mole-hunter” Peter
Wright, living in retirement in rural
Tasmania, suggested the same thing this
year but with greater assurance than
Pincher’s.
An ambitious, if curious, attempt to
link up all these threads the grand
theory (“moles”) with a selection of
local detail (Russian defector Vladimir
Petrov and ASIO) was provided in
The Bulletin of October 2 by Rupert
Lockwood, journalist and Petrov affair
celebrity.
Unfortunately for Lockwood, his es-
say was written without the benefit of
the Petrov papers released at the time of
publication - with the result that many
of his claims in that article were
demolished.
The Bulletin last month published a
letter by a Mr George McCadden which
would seem to have knocked out one of
Lockwood’s more colorful stories the
one about the “sinister” fate of Ameri-
can journalist Peter Gruening.
But Lockwood’s central thesis turns
on his view, to quote the lead-in to his
article, that “Petrov was a decoy to
divert attention from Kim Philby,
Anthony Blunt, Hollis and other Soviet
agents who had penetrated M 15.” The
striking thing about that sentence - and
it’s a ploy repeated throughout the
article is the clear implication that
Hollis was a “mole,” working on behalf
of Soviet intelligence.
No such thing has been established.
Not only has British Prime Minister
Sir Charles Spry, retired security chief: key figure in the Petrov affair
Margaret Thatcher rejected the claim,
so have two serious writers in the field
Andrew Boyle (author of The Climate of
Treason) and Nigel West (author of
MIS ). Even the most energetic leader of
the “Hollis was a mole” school, Pincher,
argues only that there is a “high prob-
ability.”
In an attempt to shed further light on
Lockwood’s thesis about Hollis and the
Petrov affair generally, I talked recently
to the man who justly could be called
the key figure in the Petrov affair,
Brigadier Sir Charles Spry, ASIO’s
director-general at the time and the man
who recommended to prime minister
Menzies the establishment of the Petrov
royal commission.
In this exclusive interview, Spry said
he had been dismayed by the way in
which some commentators had claimed,
in spite of the evidence just released,
that elements of the old conspiracy
theory have been vindicated thus
giving life to further suspicion about the
role of Menzies, himself and ASIO.
Spry, an active 74-year-old, said he
was particularly concerned to rebut
Lockwood’s article if only, as he put it
“to ensure that future students of
Australian history did not take Spry’s
past reticence, professionally acquired,
“as some kind of guilty proof that what
is not refuted must somehow be true.”
He said: “To be honest, I was rather
surprised that Lockwood would make
such a play of his dubious role in the
affair. After all, I seem to recollect that
when he appeared on television im-
mediately prior to the release of the
Petrov papers he told us that he feared
that he and his family would once again
have to go through the trauma which he
said they had suffered during the days of

the Petrov royal commission in 1954-55.
“But, seeing as he has so spec-
tacularly re-opened his own part in the
affair and in the process cast aspersions
on myself and others, I see no reason
why his version should go uncontested
and many good reasons why it
shouldn’t.
“Seeing as Lockwood in that article
is so highly selective in what he tells us
about his own role in the affair, I think it
would be helpful to recall what the royal
commissioners said about Lockwood at
the time and about Document J with
which he is so intimately identified.”
Spry then quoted from paragraph
120 of the report of the royal commis-
sion: “The authenticity of the docu-
mentor) was hotly debated before us for
many weeks, it being charged that it was
fabricated as part of a conspiracy to
injure Dr Evatt (H. V. Evatt, then leader
of the Labor Party) and the Labor Party.
In our interim report, we dealt fully
with this matter. We found nothing in
the material placed before us since then
to cause us to alter our clear conclusion
that the document was wholly (Spry’s
emphasis) composed and typed by
Lockwood in the circumstances we have
set out.” The commissioners also stated
(para 117) that “the document was aptly
described by counsel assisting the com-
mission as ‘a farrago of fact, falsity and
filth.’ ”
Spry said that he found “the
elaborate structure of Lockwood’s essay
almost as interesting as some of the
details which clutter it up.”
He said: “For instance, in his at-
tempt to paint ASIO as nothing more
than a plaything of the KGB, fully
penetrated and thus neutralised,
Lockwood tells us that in order to cover
up for the noise of British moles at work
in MIS ‘diversions and deflections were
needed urgently.’ These words could
more aptly suggest that the purpose of
Lockwood’s essay was to divert our
attention from his role in the affair.”
Spry said: “I suppose the centrepiece
of Lockwood’s tale of menace and
murder is his allegation that Sir Roger
Hollis was a KGB mole all the time he
was head of MIS. What I have to say on
this subject is what I have publicly
maintained ever since these allegations
were first aired. I’ve heard all the
allegations against him and I would
have to hear considerably more detailed
evidence not supposition before I
accepted that Hollis was a Soviet spy.
“I saw a lot of Hollis over the years.
When I was in England, I always had a
few days of golf with him. I never
discerned any sign of pro-Soviet sym-
pathy.
“As for the suggestion contained in
Lockwood’s piece that Hollis made
determined efforts to minimise the
significance of the defection (a claim

Former “mole-hunter" Peter Wright, at home In Tasmania
attributed to former United States Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency counter-es-
pionage chief James Angleton), this was
not my experience of Hollis.
“And let me say that I think there is
one very telling piece of contrary
evidence which has not been given
proper consideration, either by
Chapman Pincher, by Peter Wright and
least of all by Lockwood. And the
evidence is this: Hollis would have
known of the possibility of the impend-
ing defection of Petrov by dint of our
close liaison. If Hollis had been a spy
for Soviet intelligence, Petrov, I am
sure, would have had a ‘fatal heart
attack’ in the Soviet embassy or have
been recalled to Moscow under a sub-
terfuge. Hollis, if a spy, simply could
not have taken the risk of letting Petrov
defect resulting in the possibility of his
own exposure. To allow Petrov to defect
would have been unthinkable.
“As for Lockwood’s insinuation
about ASIO and Colonel Charles Ellis,
an Australian-born agent with the
British secret service who has since been
exposed as having worked at various
times as a spy for both Hitler and Stalin,
the truth is he had no connection with
ASIO. He was stationed at MI6
headquarters in London and visited
Australia very rarely. As far as I am
aware, he had no foreknowledge of the
Petrov defection. Lockwood’s use of
quotes from various book reviews about
this or that prove nothing except how
tenuous is his idea of evidence.
Spy ring link Kim Philby
“Not surprisingly, Lockwood then
rolls out yet again the canard about ‘the
gnomes of Melbourne’ Menzies,
Casey (Liberal Party External Affairs
minister) and myself, presumably
circulated by Dr John Burton, the per-
manent secretary of the External Affairs
department in the late 19405, suggesting
some dark plot cooked up by a cabal in
Melbourne. I have had to correct Dr
Burton’s tricks of memory once already
in the past few weeks (in The National
Times). For the record, I first met Lord
Casey in early 1950 or thereabouts when
he asked whether he could submit my
name as a successor to Mr Justice Read
who was then D-G (director-general) of
ASIO.
“Subsequently, I met Mr Menzies (as
he then was) for the first time when he
asked me to accept that position subject
to the approval of a cabinet sub-com-
mittee.
“Lockwood’s reference to an MIS
interview in 1950 with Mr J. Hill, an
Australian External Affairs officer, in
the Australian high commission in Lon-
don was quite proper and had the
approval of the relevant Australian
authorities contrary to Lockwood’s
suggestions. And it is quite incorrect to
suggest that Hill did not, while in
Canberra, have access to state secrets.
As for Hill’s conversation with
Lockwood, I am intrigued if, indeed,
it is correct as to why Hill would
recount to Lockwood, an ardent and
known communist, a detailed resume of
an interrogation with an MIS officer.
And, if Lockwood is the innocent he
would like to portray himself as, why
did he feel it necessary to promptly fly
back to Australia to warn communist
leaders of what MIS was threatening?
“The informed reader of Lock-
wood’s essay also might notice the way
key bits of information which don’t fit
his plot seem to get left out. For
instance, although he mentions lan
Milner a key suspect of ASIO three
times, nowhere does he mention that in
July 1950 Milner resigned from the
United Nations in New York and went
immediately to Prague where he took up
a position at Charles University in that
city and where he resides to this day.
According to the royal commission
report, Milner, while in the department
of External Affairs, had access to ‘highly
secret material, some of it supplied by
Australia’s friends.’
“And this point of Hollis’s loyalty is
very important. I am sure Petrov would
have told us if he had known anything
about Hollis, Ellis or others. And I
make a clear distinction between Hollis
and the rest, a point which Lockwood
does not do and I think his linking them
together the way he does is quite
deliberate.
“Besides anything else, just imagine
what a fortune Petrov could have made
out of revealing the names of traitors
such as Philby. As I remember it, Petrov
did not know that Burgess and
Maclean were in Moscow until he was
told by one of his assistants, Kislystin,
who had been a clerk in London when
those two individuals were operating
there and who afterward played a role
in the escape of those two traitors to
Moscow. It is, after all, in the nature of
intelligence services to compartmental-
ise information and agents. For obvious
reasons, the existence least of all the

“Appropriately, I note that Lock-
wood rests his case against Hollis by
drawing on the alleged testimony of
Donald Maclean, to the effect that
Petrov ‘kept the best bits to himself.’
Given that Maclean was at the time
openly working for the KGB in
Moscow and thus hardly warrants
Lockwood’s description of him as a
‘liberal-minded English scholar,’ I find
it amazing that Lockwood should even
think that such a comment assists his
claims.
“Simply put, Lockwood’s convol-
uted argument that Petrov was really a
decoy for MI5 moles is nothing more
than mischievous nonsense.”

LAW ENFORCEMENT
Transferred
cop denies drug
allegations
By BRUCE STANNARD
DETECTIVE Sergeant Roger Roger-
son, one of six senior Sydney detectives
transferred to uniform duties, has de-
nied allegations that he is involved in
heroin trafficking and demanded an end
to the media speculation and parlia-
mentary criticism which has dogged his
career with the New South Wales police
since he shot dead drug dealer Warren
Lanfranchi in June 1981.
Rogerson, a veteran of 27 years in
the force 22 of them in plain clothes
has been transferred to general uniform
duties at Bankstown in Sydney’s west-
ern suburbs.
The jury at the Lanfranchi inquest
found that Rogerson had shot while try-
ing to make an arrest. It made no
finding as to whether he had acted in
self-defence.
Lanfranchi’s girlfriend Sally-Anne
Huckstepp alleged that he had taken
$lO,OOO to Rogerson to “get him off his
back.” There was no sign of any money
on Lanfranchi’s body. Later, in state
parliament, then-leader of the Opposi-
tion John Dowd alleged that Rogerson
had paid off a key witness with heroin.
Rogerson says that he believes he has
been the victim of a conspiracy involv-
ing both criminals and sections of the
media who he claims created an atmos-
phere of suspicion which led to his
transfer.
“I am not now and never have been
involved in any way in the drug trade,”
he said. “That suggestion is as ludicrous
as it is vile.
“I hate heroin. I have children of my
own. How could anyone seriously be-
lieve I could do anything which could
entrap my kids into the heroin scene?”
Rogerson said he had never given
any informants drugs in exchange for
information.
“I have had a lot of outrageous
things said about me,” he said, “and
among the most disgusting was that I
owned three blocks of units at Cronulla
and drove a Mercedes, all through the
proceeds of drug dealing. The suspicion
is that I am a distributor of heroin and
that I’ve got fellows working for me sell-
ing dope. None of it is true.”
Rogerson said that he had lived in

south-western Sydney suburbs for 20

Roger Rogerson: “Allegations are part of the job”
years. “If I had a fraction of the money
people say I have, I wouldn’t have to
stay in the police force,” he said. “I
could live like the criminals who make
those allegations.
“I wouldn’t have to worry about get-
ting up early and going to work. Why
would I stick at my policeman’s salary if
I was rolling in drug money? Why
wouldn’t I just resign and say, ‘Thanks
very much, fellas; I’m set up now: I’ll
live on my investments?’ Consider that.
The people who make these allegations
obviously haven’t.”
Rogerson said that he took a particu-
lar pride in knowing more criminals
than did anyone else in the NSW police
force. “That is my job,” he said. “But
the distance I place between them and
myself is the important thing.
“We need to know criminals. You
can’t do without them. And there’s no
doubt that federal police have tapped
their phones. Like police and journal-
ists, crims tend to tell lies and exagger-
ate. Now, a lot of these exaggerated
stories have been fed back to superiors.
“For reasons known only to them-
selves, those superiors seem to have ac-
cepted what they’ve said. Maybe they
think there’s something in it.”
Rogerson said that he had never
been called before his superiors and
confronted with any allegation of
wrongdoing.
“After a lifetime in the police force,
I’ve had a lot of complaints made
against me,” he said. “It’s standard pro-
cedure these days.
“When you pinch a crim,
the first thing he does is com-
plain that he is innocent
that he has been loaded, that
he has been robbed, given
dope and that his family has
been hassled. That’s standard
procedure for crims these
days.”
Rogerson said he had still
not been told officially that he
was being transferred. “I had
a phone call from a bloke who
said, ‘l’ve got a bit of bad
news for you, mate.’
“It was as simple as that,”
he said. “After 27 years, that’s
the way they do things. It was
supposed to be a secret but
after just a few days I was get-
ting phone calls from all over
the place asking ‘What’s going
on?’ Now, that sort of thing is
dreadful. We should have
been called down and given
some sort of reason.
“It’s in this sort of climate
that speculation and innuen-
do arises.”
Despite the allegations,
Rogerson remains outwardly
calm even cheerful. “Some-
thing you learn very quickly when you
become a copper,” he said, “is that alle-
gations are part of the job. The more
seniority you have, the more serious the
allegations seem to become. You’ve got
to be able to stand up to it.
“Crims have come to realise that, if
they make constant complaints about
the police, it keeps us tied up. Un-
fortunately, the hierarchy seem to take
notice. They say, ‘We can’t stand any
more allegations against this bloke;
we’d better piss him off or transfer him.’
“Journalists latch onto these allega-
tions and accept them as gospel. There
are some in the media who genuinely
believe that all cops are corrupt. They
create the climate where it’s easy for the
policy hierarchy to simply say. ‘Right,
we’ll get rid of this bloke and shut them
up.’
“Every time there is an unsubstan-
tiated allegation made, a little bit of
mud sticks. It’s no wonder that there has
been a steady erosion of public confi-
dence in the NSW police. The police are
losing confidence in themselves.
“These days, they are overshadowed
by the ombudsman and by all sorts of
public watchdogs that make police
work very very difficult.
“There’s an atmosphere of caution
throughout the force. They are
encouraged by the superiors not to be
stand-outs, not to be personalities, not
to be Roger Rogersons.
“These days, they keep their heads
down and do no more than they have
to.” □

Academics upset
over honorary
degree for Joh
By JANET WILSON
DURING THE Right To March
demonstrations of the late 1970 s and
early 80s the rallying cry was often:
“Joh Must Go.” It’s a sentiment many
Queensland University academic staff
support at the moment.
The first irritant was the Premier’s
dictum that all university appointments
be advertised in the Sun newspapers.
Then came state cabinet’s decision that
all academics going on study leave must
ask its permission first, and, having
returned, write a report to cabinet on
any findings made while overseas. Uni-
versity staff refused to comply.
The third point of annoyance, in the
eyes of many, was the announcement
that Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was to
receive an honorary doctorate of laws
next as part of the university’s 75th
anniversary celebrations.
Certainly there is nothing unusual in
bestowing the honor on a Queensland
premier. William Forgan Smith and
Frank Nicklin, received honorary doc-
torates to mark the university’s 25th-and
50th anniversaries.
The Academic Staff Association of
the university feels Sir Joh’s award
tarnishes the university’s reputation.
The association’s executive issued a
statement last week congratulating the
other 11 recipients of honorary degrees
but said that “the honor was markedly
reduced by the inclusion of the premier
in the list.”
It added that “the premier’s inimical
attitudes towards the ethos of the uni-
versity are renowned” and said the
executive had “grave misgivings about
the conseqi ences an award to the pre-
mier will have on the regard which the
community holds for the degrees gained
by students at this university.”
Nevertheless Bjelke-Petersen has
been “delighted” to receive the univers-
ity’s offer. And he had scathing words
for critical academics.
“The poor creatures it doesn’t take
much to upset them,” he said. “If they
don’t like it here, they can go south.
We’ve got a lot to be thankful for here.”
Bjelke-Petersen said he understood
the honorary doctorate hurt the aca-
demics, particularly when all their
political forecasts had been proved
wrong over the years.
“But they’re the least of my worries.
I’m not interested in what they think.
They’re just jealous.” □

BULLETIN/QANTAS NUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR
Step by step to success
Retail fashion executive Beverly Hancock is The RuMtiin/Qantas
Business Woman of the Year for 1985. GLENNYS BELL
tells how Hancock rose to the top from beginnings as a salesgirl.
BEVERLY HANCOCK is the career
woman’s dream come true. She started
work as a salesgirl and is now deputy
managing director and marketing
director of Sussan Corporation (Aust)
Ltd, one of Australia’s largest fashion
retailing chains. It gives her $6O million
a year to spend on clothes, all in the line
of duty.
Hancock grew up in the business, not
only learning as she went along but
contributing to the revolution that has
taken place in fashion retailing in the
past 20 years. Few television viewers,
male or female, would not be aware of
Sussan’s television advertising, for it has
stamped its own style on the fashion
commercial with the slogan, This Goes
With That. With the commercial,
Sussan pioneered a form of fashion
advertising that has been praised,
envied and borrowed by the rest of the
industry.
Hancock has played an important
part in the development of the com-
pany’s image. She is in charge of group
advertising, leading a team which pro-
vides the guidelines and approves the
advertising campaigns and promotions
devised by the company’s advertising
agency.
Few women would not have strolled
past one of Sussan’s 197 stores around
the country and glanced at the window
displays, the models caught in nonchal-
ant poses, capturing in their clothes the
mood of the moment. The shopfront
image, the look of the store, are now
integral to fashion retailing and Sussan
was one of the trendsetters. Again,
Hancock played a part. She Was (and is)
responsible for the visual impact of
Sussan’s, making sure that the themes
and look of all forms of advertising and
the appearance and products in the
store tie together.
There would be few young women
who have not gone into a Sussan’s store,
lured by the promise of low-priced
clothes in the latest fashion, with each
piece co-ordinated in color and style in
a way that reduces the worry of what
goes with what. Sussan’s recognised
early the need not only for a fashion
group to identify its target customer, but
also to persuade the customer to identi-
ty with the Sussan’s image. Hancock is
the arbiter of that image, the one
Business Woman of the Year Beverly Hancock with Prime Minister Hawke
responsible for the over-all fashion
direction of the group, from the clothes
purchased by the company buyers to the
way they are presented in advertising
and the stores, including the prices that
are charged.
It is Hancock who ultimately decides
who is the Sussan sort of young woman.
In today’s fashion market, it is easy to
spend $6O million on clothes. It is not so
easy to spend it on the right combina-
tion which will compel customers into
the Sussan stores, and sell to them. Nor
is it easy to keep coming up with the
right combination week after week,
season after season, in one of the
toughest, most competitive markets in
Australia.
Hancock accepts her position and
responsibilities serenely. She prefers to
remain behind the scenes and allow the
co-chairmen of Sussan Corporation,
Marc Besen and John 4 Gandel, to
represent the company publicly. She is


calm and quiet, but she is also a positive
person, as she herself notes. “People
who work closely with me find me an
extremely strong personality,” she said.
“I’m a particularly positive person and
I’m a strong decision maker.” They are
qualities she finds necessary in the
fashion business: “It’s enormously
tough and you need to make quick
decisions and stand by them, but you
also need to be able to make changes
quickly if necessary.”
For Hancock, the role of deputy
managing director, to which she was
appointed earlier this year, is a natural
progression. “I never set out
deliberately to achieve my position,”
she said. “Each step just seemed to
happen in my career. Generally, I’ve
just wanted to have the opportunity to
prove I could do more than the job I
was doing.”
Hancock started as a sales assistant
with Sportsgirl in Melbourne in 1964. It
was then a small operation, with just 1 / 2
floors in Collins Street. Hancock, how-
ever, had found her niche. She said: “I
loved selling. I was excited by it, and I
was good at it. I got a lot of pleasure
from selling something that satisfied the
customer.”
It was also her first real contact with
people for a long time. She didn’t finish
high school in Melbourne, where she
was born, because she developed
tuberculosis when she was 15.
It was a devastating period for her
because she missed out on normal
teenage life. She spent a whole year in
bed. Her parents were very protective
and she was surrounded by adults.
When she finally went to work at
Sportsgirl, it was like emerging from a
cocoon, fully adult, and expected to
participate as if she had never lost those
years. She believes, however, she gained
in other ways: “I learned to be tolerant
and I grew up quickly, but I also had to
find out for myself, because of those
missing years, what I could do and
wanted to do.”
She spent two years as a salesgirl
with Sportsgirl, before she started to feel
more ambitious. “I was good at
fashion,” she said. “I was good at
handling merchandise and I had the
right feeling about garments. It’s
something you can’t learn but I soon
wanted more. I wanted a department of
my own.”
Sportsgirl was owned by David
Bardas, a young man who had taken
over the business after the death of his
father. Hancock says he had the ability
to single out people with potential. He
singled her out, putting her in charge
of the knitwear department, when
knitwear was just becoming a major
fashion influence, and a big part of the
fashion industry.
Bardas then decided to expand and
Hawke acknowledges the impact
Hancock at work as deputy managing director of Sussan Corporation (Aust) Ltd
THE increasingly important impact of
women in the business world was ack-
nowledged by Prime Minister Bob
Hawke last week when he named
Beverly Hancock Australia’s Business
Woman of the Year for 1985.
As deputy managing director and
marketing director of Sussan Corpora-
tion, one of the nation’s largest fashion
retailing groups, Hancock is the top
woman executive in that sphere and the
first employee to win The Bulletin/
Qantas award. Previous winners have
all owned their businesses.
Hawke paid tribute to the diverse
contribution by women to Australia’s
economic life. “Women's efforts, be
they in small one-woman operations or
in large and expanding enterprises, are
integral to the continued prosperity of
Australia,” he said.
He also reviewed efforts being made
by both the business community and the
Federal Labor Government to en-
courage women to realise their full
potential. In particular, Hawke men-
tioned the affirmative action pilot pro-
gram the government is running in co-
operation with 28 of Australia’s major
companies and three higher educational
institutions. Through this program, he
said, “the government is encouraging
employers to give greater opportunities
to women. We have done so knowing
full well that the overwhelming majority
of women in the workforce are to be
found in only a very small number of
occupations.
“We are encouraging employers to
provide opportunities for women who
would like to move out of ‘traditional’
women’s jobs into management or
supervisory roles or into occupations
which in the past have been largely
closed to women.”
The director of the Office of the
Status of Women, Dr Anne Summers
also spoke at the lunch at which the
award was presented. She described her
department as one of the most diverse
and involving in all government. It was
broad and challenging, because women
make up more than 51 percent of the
population.
Much of the work of the office was
invisible to the public but it included
reviews of all policy matters going to
cabinet to see how they affected women
and the office, with access to the Prime
Minister, had the ability to comment on
them.
In accepting the award, Hancock
said that she received it with an enor-
mous sense of pride for herself but also
saw it as recognition for all women who
have the basic ability to achieve similar
positions in management.
Sussan Corporation had supported
women in managerial roles and had
shown its confidence in women in
appointing her to the most senior posi-
tion held by a woman in the Australian
retailing industry.
Her advice to other women in busi-
ness: “Dare to be yourself.”

Previous winners Carla Zampatti, Eve Mahlab and Patricia Lovell
upgrade Sportsgirl, and formed a team
with Anne Souter, from Myer, as
marketing manager, and appointed
Hancock buying controller, in charge of
all merchandise. She built up her own
team of buyers and started to learn
more about the business. “I made mis-
takes,” she said, “but relatively few, and
they didn’t inhibit me. In the fashion
industry, it’s easy to make mistakes but I
don’t agonise over them. In fact, I’m
probably the first to recognise them. I
think it’s a great attribute, to be able to
face a mistake and do something about
it.”
Another of her strengths, she
believes, is being afile to get the best out
of people: “You’re only as good as the
people you have around you. What I try
to do with people who work for me is to
find their strengths and ignore their
weaknesses. That way, you make them
confident and you end up with an
evenly balanced team.”
She quickly learned at Sportsgirl
how to eliminate conflict, and how to
build a team that worked with harmony.
The buying team was important,
because Bardas had decided Sportsgirl
should move into the young market.
The store was classic and conservative
in style, but Bardas believed no one in
the fashion industry was really catering
for the young.
The youthquake of the 60s was just
beginning to shake Australia when the
team of Bardas, Souter and Hancock set
about changing the Sportsgirl image.
“We were all relatively young ourselves
and we were embarking on a very
exciting period.” Hancock said. “It took
about five years to complete the change,
but the store became a showplace. We
were innovative and we were the talk of
Australian fashion. The three of us felt
very excited about what we were doing
and we caused a lot of excitement in
retailing. In the end, we had a world-
class store, yet none of us had been
overseas and we bought everything
locally.”
Hancock spent eight productive and
happy years with Sportsgirl, but as the
business expanded, and more stores in
different states were added to the com-
pany, Hancock began to realise her own
future was limited. It was a family
business, and she felt there would be
nowhere further to go. As buying con-
troller, she was now travelling overseas
and Sportsgirl was importing products
from Italy through an agency in Milan.
Hancock was occasionally conscious of
her lack of education in formal manage-
ment methods, but never encountered a
situation she felt she could not handle.
“Sportsgirl was going so well, we all had
a lot of confidence,” she said. “Our
formula proved successful and I don’t
think we could do anything wrong at
that stage.”
Despite her success, Hancock felt the
time had come to leave the company:
“I’d reached the stage where there was
nowhere to move, and I wanted to live
in Sydney. I wanted a change.”
She went into the travel business,
though her closest friends warned her
that she would never be able to stay out
of fashion retailing.
A year later, when John Gandel, co-
chairman with Marc Besen of Sussan
Corporation, asked her to join the
Sydney operation as a consultant, she
was ready to move back.
The Melbourne-based Sussan
Corporation had taken over a NSW
chain of about 60 stores called Chic
Salons and was in the process of
tranforming them into Sussan stores. At
the time, 1974, Sussan stores were aimed
more at the middle market and the older
woman. The Chic salons were even
further back in the market, a dowdy,
matronly kind of market. It was Han-
cock’s job to turn them into sharper,
more interesting Sussan stores. As she
remembers, it was a mammoth task:
“Every store was a problem in itself, I
used to wonder how I got myself into
the situation.
“Everything from merchandise, staff
to visual presentation had to be
changed. There were a lot of big deci-
sions to be made about how to move the
merchandise and give the stores a new
image.
“The retail industry was changing.
The spending power was with the
younger market and Sussan believed it
had to gain a younger image.”
Once the Chic Salons had been
absorbed, the Sussan stores started their
own transformation, with younger mer-
chandise and new stores to fit the new
image. It took a couple of years but
every store in the group was completely
renovated.
By then, Hancock had been invited
to become NSW manager, which meant


she had 75 stores in NSW and about 20
in Queensland, under her control. It was
a new experience, but gave her the
excitement she had felt at Sportsgirl.
She found she was good at it: “It was
only the financial procedures which
were a problem. I had to run very fast to
keep up.”
She was also discovering new talents.
Warehousing and inventory controls,
locating new stores, negotiating leases
for new properties were all part of her
managerial responsibilities. By 1977,
she had about 200 staff in both states
under her control.
Sussan as a group was also in the
process of promoting itself. Once all the
stores were in order, and the group had
a firm idea of the kind of customer it
wanted, and the kind of clothes it was
selling, top management sat down to
map out what it wanted to tell the public
about itself.
Hancock said: “That’s when we
brought in the advertising agency
Ogilvie and Mather, with account
director Rod Reddie. The creative team
thought up the slogan, This Goes With
That. By then, we felt we had done
everything to create the new Sussan
image and we put $1 million into the
television campaign the first year in
1979. I think Sussan was the first retailer
to do really exciting television advertis-
ing, just as Sportsgirl was the first to do
really exciting retailing. Sussan set the
pace.”
The campaign, This Goes With That,
was based on Sussan’s efforts to co-
ordinate its merchandise. Hancock
said: “We felt our strength was in co-
ordinating our range really well. No one
else was doing as good a job, and we
wanted to tell the customers they didn’t
have to go anywhere else to buy all their
clothes.”
By then, Hancock had been ap-
pointed buying controller for the group
and started to go to work by jet. She
loved Sydney so much she was not
prepared to leave, so part of her con-
tract stipulated that she was to commute
to Melbourne: “I was a bit ap-
prehensive then about whether it would
work, or even whether they would
accept it, but now I just take it for
granted. I must admit I’m a relaxed
traveller, and use the time for thinking
as well as work.”
In Sydney, she has a harborside
house and sails for relaxation during
weekends. She keeps her private life
quite separate from her business world.
She was married, but again, prefers not
to talk about it and is just as reluctant to
talk about her private interests.
As buying controller, her first prior-
ity was to set up a buying department
and build up a team of buyers. Sussan
had nearly 200 stores, but only about
three people directly involved with
Director of the Office of the Status of Women Dr Anne Summers
buying. Hancock said: “The expansion
had worked so well we suddenly had
thriving stores with people screaming
for more merchandise but not enough
buyers to meet their needs.”
Hancock found her team within the
group: “I moulded them into the role of
buyer. Some of them had no buying
experience whatever, but it’s something
you can’t teach. I just looked for people
with a good feeling about garments.”
They included a store manager, a cadet
and a girl friday from the sales office.
Sussan now has its central buying
office in Melbourne, but has expanded
overseas, and has an office in Hong
Kong, with seven young women
working there.
Two years ago, Hancock was
promoted to marketing director,
responsible for overall planning and
strategy of the corporate image within
the market place.
Now she finds herself a role model
for younger women seeking careers in
retailing and fashion. All the members
of her marketing group are women, just
as all her buyers were women. It was
never a conscious decision, nor does she
see herself as a feminist, It just
happened. Young women seek her
advice about their careers, and young
women see her success as something to
follow.
Hancock accepts it as serenely as she
does her executive responsibilities.
When she was appointed deputy mana-
ging director she was tremendously
pleased. It was a confirmation of Besen
and Gandel’s belief in her, but she was
also slightly surprised. It was not
something she had sought.
With an annual turnover of about
$lOO million, the Sussan group of stores
has little in common with the l'/ 2 floors
of Sportsgirl where Hancock first
started work. But she brings to her job
the same approach she had when she
was selling clothes.
“You have to have a feeling for
garments.” she said. That feeling is right
most of the time, but occassionally she
gets caught: “There’s no such thing as
the perfect range. On colour, for inst-
ance, I remember when khaki was
strong overseas but it simply didn’t sell
here. I expect there’ll always be that
danger.”
She works partly on “gut feeling” but
also relies on the knowledge she has
acquired over the years. She knows
buying and selling, and she knows her
customer.
“She is a very definite type” Han-
cock said. “When we look at a garment,
we always very carefully analyse
whether this is for a Sussan customer.
We may love it, but you always have to
remind yourself that there’s a certain
person out there you want to buy the
garment. Is it her garment?”
Hancock likes to discover the answer
to that question, so she relies on
feedback from the stores, and goes to
the stores herself, to keep in touch and
maybe occasionally to think back to
1964, when she was just starting out,
standing behind the counter in the sales
position which she loved and still finds
exciting. □

COLLECTING
Detecting the antique rackets
Collecting antique furniture, ceramics, art and oriental rugs can be full of costly
traps for the unwary. BRUCE STANNARD gives tips on how to negotiate what
may turn out to be a minefield of fakes.
THINGS ARE looking up in the Aus-
tralian antique business. These days,
Customs estimate that only 50 percent
of all imported antiques are falsely
labelled. The figure 18 months ago was
as high as 70 percent.
Australia with no great furnishing
tradition of her own unfortunately is
still seen as a convenient dumping
ground for third-rate, second-hand
English goods.
The assumption among unscrupu-
lous importers and the London dealers
who issue the false certificates must be
that the Australian market is so com-
pletely naive that any old chamber pot
should fetch as much as a Nanking por-
celain vase.
Four hundred and fifty containers
crammed with “antiques” were im-
ported through Melbourne and Sydney
last year and, since no import duty is
paid on genuine certified antiques, Cus-
toms say the false declaration racket has
cost the federal government millions of
dollars in lost revenue. “These days, we
open each and every container marked
‘antique,’ ” Customs spokesman Mark
Butler said. “There was a time when the
word of reputable London dealers’ as-
sociations was good enough. But it’s be-
come such a rort recently that we have
had to crack down hard. By going
through every container, item by item,
we are sending out a very clear signal
that says this is a racket no more.”
In Victoria and New South Wales,
Customs rely on the skilled assessment
of a panel of members from the Antique
Dealers’ Associations. It is these state
associations with their memberships
from among the oldest and most repu-
table Australian dealers who have been
hardest hit by the flood of shonky
imports.
Veteran dealer and restoration ex-
pert George Macedo estimates that his
Sydney business is down 20 percent
because of the cheap imports which find
a ready, though largely gullible market,
in city and suburban auction rooms.
Macedo blames “get-rich-quick mer-
chants,” individuals not necessarily as-
sociated with the antique trade. He said:
“They’re the ones who buy these con-
tainers, sight-unseen, from ads in the
Antiques Trade Gazette, ship them out
here, whack them into the auction
rooms and hope to make a killing. An
awful lot of people are getting their
Veteran dealer George Macedo: a shake-out sooner or later


Jewellery specialist Anne Schofield: believes in the powers of intuition-and the magnifying glass
fingers burned. In fact, so many people
have been burned that we are beginning
to see a return to the good old honest
dealers. Shonky operators can kid the
marketplace for just so long. Sooner or
later there is a shake-out and people
realise they have been had. In the end,
they come back to the established firms
they can trust.”
Macedo said established dealers
would welcome legislation which
clearly defined the meaning of the word
“antique.” “At the moment,” he said, “I
can sell a piece of 10-year-old furniture,
call it an antique and the client cannot
take legal action against me. That sort
of thing is happening all the time.
People advertise themselves as ‘antique
dealers’ whereas, in fact, they sell only
reproduction furniture. It’s quite

deliberately calculated to create a false
impression. And if clients aren’t aware
of the differences between, say, Waltons
barbecue furniture and a Hepplewhite
armchair they get dudded. There is a lot
of money involved and I’m afraid there
are quite a few greedy dealers who
wouldn’t dream of allowing the truth to
interfere with a sale. The attitude is,
‘Well, if they’re stupid enough to buy
the rubbish, who am I to say no?’
They’re not in business for their health.”
Macedo says that 95 percent of the
antiques sold in the Australian market-
place are worthless from a connoisseur’s
point of view. “There are some mag-
nificent pieces here,” he said, “but no
sooner do people get them than they
want to bastardise them, tart them up,
sand and polish them. That’s sacrilege
in antique terms. Once you remove the
old polish, the old patina, it may as well
be a brand new piece of furniture. But
people in Australia don’t want to live
with a piece of furniture with a cracked
edge or a few burn marks. They want
everything to look brand new. They
may want to buy a table that is 120 years
old but invariably they say, ‘Oh, how
about that mark there or that little
bruise?’ People want us to put a belt
sander on it, rip the marks off the timber
and re-polish it to some color that will
match their pink curtains.”
Macedo warned that inexpensive


Antiquarian Tim McCormick: provenance is especially important as a safeguard
Korean and Indonesian reproductions
recently imported as bare frames had
been polished and stressed and passed
off as genuine Victorian pieces. “I’ve
been offered the bare frames of In-
donesian-made Victorian style balloon-
back chairs for as little as $65 each,” he
said. “The quality is shocking but un-
scrupulous dealers do them up and are
quite happy to flog them for $l5O to
$2OO each.”
Macedo was recently approached by
a couple who had paid $2OO each for 12
Victorian balloon-back chairs which
were newly made in Jakarta from a
lightweight Indonesian mahogany.
They were told the chairs were copies of
English chairs circa 1860. The original
chairs would have been worth between
$6OO and $7OO each. The couple wanted
Macedo to sell them a matching table.
“Perhaps I should have told them the
truth about their chairs,” he said, “but
they were thrilled to the back teeth with
them.
“People never thank you for telling
them they’ve been made fools of. Home
heaters and air-conditioning are death
to cheap furniture like that. There’s just
not the density in the wood to withstand
the drying out,. They will develop cracks
and splits and pretty soon they will be
falling apart.” Macedo says many of
those who rush into antiques have much
more money than sense.
“I try to tell them to look around be-
fore they make up their minds,” he said.
“Compare prices, compare quality, de-
velop a shrewd eye. Don’t be afraid to
ask questions and, if a dealer makes
claims for a particular piece, get it in
writing. That way, at least, you have
some comeback through consumer pro-
tection legislation.”
Peter Cook, whose Grafton Galleries
have dominated the antique trade in
Sydney’s eastern suburbs since the end
of the war, said he had been
buttonholed by wealthy people who
expected him to “bring back a con-
tainer” for them whenever he went on a
buying trip to London.
“The hardest thing in the world,” he
said, “is to buy nice things and yet there
are Australians who assume that Britain
is so full of antiques that all you’ve got
to do is grab a container, stuff it full of
bric-a-brac, ship it back home and
you’ve made a killing. You can’t have
other people over there buying for you.
You must go and do it all yourself. As
Browning wrote, ‘A little less and, oh,
what worlds away.’ ”
But Cook does not only blame un-
scrupulous dealers and avaricious fly-
by-nighters. Bargain-hunting mums and
dads bring much of the trouble on them-
selves, he said. “Napoleon had a mule,”
he said, “who was with him through 16
campaigns. But, at the end of it all he
was still just a mule because he hadn’t
learned anything. You get a lot of
people like that. They won’t be told.
They go charging in, buying things
more often than not simply to impress
their friends. A lot of people who go in
for antiques do so only as a means of
demonstrating how much money they
have. Their choices have nothing to do
with taste or discernment. It’s show.
When people are that gullible, it doesn’t
take much to lead them astray.”
Not all antique dealers are as forth-
right or as painfully honest as Cook and
Macedo. When I raised the idea of The
Bulletin exposing pitfalls in antiques,
some of the country’s most reputable
dealers sought to steer me away from
the subject. Business was not good, they
said, but negative publicity was bound
to make it even worse.
Charles Aronson, president of the
NSW Antique Dealers’ Association
took the opposite view. “Educating our
clients,” he said, “is one of the roles we
have to take on if we are to right some
of the wrongs of the past. People are
entitled to have confidence both in the
antiques they buy and in the dealers
who sell them.”
Aronson, whose family has been in
the trade for more than a century, said
public education through exposure was
one of the prime functions of the 21st
annual Antique Dealers’ Association
Fair to be held at Sydney’s Entertain-
ment Centre at the end of November.
“A lot of the very finest antique
pieces will be offered for sale,” he said.
“It’s a way of showing people that there
is more to antiques than Australian
cedar chests.”

“TATTERSALLS CHOSE
PERKIN-ELNER COMPUTERS BECAUSE
WE COULDNT AFFORD TO GAMBLEr
Gunther Rothleitner, Deputy General Manager-Operations. Tattersalls.
If your company is considering upgrading
its computer facilities and wants a cost effective
solution, consider how Australia’s largest lottery,
Tattersa I Is, and Perki n-EI mer Computers work
together.
Consider a lottery with a weekly investment
of as much as $8,000,000 with the bulk of this
investment happening at lunchtime every Friday!
Suddenly, 1,250 transactions a minute are
taking place at Tattersa I is agents in Victoria,
Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory
Not to worry.
Tattersa I Is’ new computer system, based
around five Perkin-Elmer computers, can handle
up to 13,000 transactions a minute!
And it can handle all these transactions with
absolute security, because the system is fail-safe.
it has to be that way. Because if this computer
system was to go down, nearly a million people
would know about it instantly!
Tattersa I Is chose their new system after the
most careful study and analysis.
Reliability, performance and economy of
setting up were paramount.
And the more Tattersa I Is studied the figures
the more Perkin-Elmer’s numbers came out right.
Around the world, computer systems like
the one Tattersa I Is has installed are increasingly
being based around Perkin-Elmer computers.
For a number of reasons.
As the company that pioneered the 32-bit
minicomputer, Perkin-Elmer is an acknowledged
information industry leader, with a reputation for
hardware reliability which is second to none.
And because all Perkin-Elmer eguipment is
upwardly compatible, conversion problems
when upgrading are eliminated.
But it wi 11 be some ti me before Tattersa lls
has to upgrade.
Because with 900 terminals on-line when
the system is completed at the end of’B4, it will
still have a long way to go to reach its maximum
of 2,000 on-line terminals.
Naturally, with these Kinds of figures,
Tattersalls couldn’t afford to gamble on their
computer system.

she said. “Something clicks. They know
it’s going to be ‘right’ and nine times out
of 10 that trust in their own intuition
turns out to be justified. Doing business
with a specialist dealer helps. There are
fakes, especially art nouveau pieces, be-
ing turned out in Europe now, so you
have to be very careful.” Schofield’s ad-
vice is to invest $2O in a 10 X magnify-
ing glass. “The glass really is a must,”
she said. “It’s like looking at coral
through a glass-bottom boat. You can
peer down into the stones and the clasps
that hold them. The Victorians were
very good at faking everything from
ivory to coral and amber in their jewel-
lery but with the glass it’s relatively easy
to spot the bubbles in the paste or
imitation stones.”
The glass is also useful in spotting
signs of wear on gold chains, as well as
the tell-tale signs of gold-plate. “Hall-
marks were not obligatory on antique
gold jewellery as they are and always
have been on silver,” she said, “so it’s
important to look closely for the dull
brown signs of brass underneath the
gold plate especially around the edges
of lockets.”
Alan Landis is president of the NSW
chapter of the Wedgewood Society, a
band of 500 aficionados who collect the
blue and white English porcelain. In his
shop in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, he
maintains what amounts to a library of
reference books on early English cer-
amics. “I am only too happy to dig into
the background of a particular piece,”
he said. “People are entitled to know
exactly what they’re buying and yet so
often they seem willing to buy any old
rubbish for outrageous prices from
dealers who frankly wouldn’t know
Spode from Sevres. My advice is to steer
clear of the so-called fashionable pieces.
Go for what you like, not what other
people tell you you should like. And
don’t turn your nose up at pieces which
may be slightly damaged. Australians
have an aversion to chips and dents in
antiques whereas, in Europe, people
who really know antiques accept them
as fair wear and tear. Don’t be turned
off a piece just because it hasn’t got a
manufacturer’s stamp on the back.
Often you will find pieces which are
simply marked with pattern numbers.
This is where a little bit of scholarship
can help. My very strong advice is to get
some books and learn about porcelain
before you buy. It may help to avoid a
lot of heartache later when your pre-
cious Wedgewood piece turns out to be
a crude copy.”
Among the exhibitors at the Sydney
fair will be Sydney antiquarian Tim
McCormick who has been selling rare,
antique books, letters, paintings and en-
gravings for the past 12 years.
McCormick maintains that all an-
tique dealers must be prepared to pro-
Rug expert Ross Langlands: dealers should explain restoration
vide some sort of provenance for what-
ever antique they sell. “Provenance tells
you where the piece has lived its life,
who has owned it, what sort of collec-
tions it’s been in. Provenance affects the
value of things. If a book is from a very
good collection or has been sold by very
reputable dealers, one can be reason-
ably assured of getting something good.
It’s a different story at auctions. There,
it’s a matter of ‘Let the buyer beware’.
Auctions are where a lot of dealers get
rid of things they’re not sure of.”
McCormick said provenance was es-
pecially important with antique art. “If
an unsigned painting of Sydney in the
1840 s pops up,” he said, “it’s very hard
without extensive testing to be sure that
the painting is what it is supposed to be.
It’s very tempting for some less-than-
reputable dealers to say, ‘Well, that
looks like a certain painter so we’ll say it
is.’ I saw an ‘Arthur Streeton’ the other
day that was very definitely not an
Arthur Streeton. It was certainly a
painting from the Streeton period but
under ultra-violet light I could see
someone had deliberately faked the
Streeton signature. It was a quite delib-
erate forgery.”
McCormick claims antique dealers
enjoy the same public reputation as
dentists. “They both create pain and
vast profits,” he joked. “This is why it is
absolutely necessary to have scrupulous
trading. In the long run, it pays not to
rip people off because you’re trading
not just on your goods but on your
reputation.” He predicts that the ap-
proach of what he calls “bi-centennial
fever” will see a rash of suspect dealers
offering all manner of “suspect
Australiana” for sale. “These are not
necessarily going to be dealers who are
unscrupulous,” he said, “but they will
be dealers who don’t have experience,
who don’t know rarity. This is why
collectors have to be educated. It would
be nice to be able to romp into any old
shop and pick up genuine and beautiful
pieces but that can’t happen without at
least some background knowledge.
Anyone who is serious about his or her
collection ought to get stuck into
whatever books there may be on the
subject and they must be prepared to
put in a good bit of leg work. My very
strong advice is that they ought to get
out in the marketplace, talk to dealers,
question them, compare their goods, get
a feel for what’s available. I also believe
people are entitled to know if the
dealers are prepared to buy back a
particular piece if the client ever gets
sick of it. Most reputable dealers will be
prepared to buy back.”
McCormick says that, despite all the
warnings, there will always be incurable
romantics who fall in love with a par-
ticular item, plunge in and buy it.
“There is no way in the world you can
protect people like that,” he said. “All
you can do is hope that they spend their
money with somebody who is at least
trying to be a fair trader.”
Ross Langlands is an expert in tribal
rugs who has been in business in Sydney
for more than 12 years. In recent years,
he has watched bemused as people have
flocked to the sensational fast sales mer-


chants with their outrageous discount
prices on oriental rugs. He said: “There
has been a real rort, not to say a rip-off,
in recent times with these fly-by-night
operators whose modus operandi is to
put their prices up 1000 percent and
then discount them 87.5 percent. Most
of what those sales are offering are
bottom-of-the-barrel Pakistani rugs.
That sort of rubbish is on tap in London
all the time. All I have to do is pick up
the phone and say, ‘Look, I want 50 six
by fours’ and I know exactly what sort
of price I’ve got to pay. I once worked
in the Zurich rug market and the stock-
pile of Pakistani stuff which wasn’t sell-
ing had hit the roof. A lot of that stuff
was dumped on what was calculated to
be a fairly gullible Aussie market.
Something for nothing always appeals
and that’s where people got burned.
Cheap and nasty Pakistani copies were
being passed off as top quality originals
from Iran and Afghanistan.”
Langlands, who recently sold Syd-
ney’s Powerhouse Museum a Caucasian
rug valued at $12,500, warned antique
rug collectors to be sure of the proven-
ance of the piece and what dyes were
used. “That should give them a good
idea of the age and origin of the rug,” he
said. “Dealers should explain what res-
toration work has been done. Things
like rot can be quite devastating and not
always easily detectable. I bought a rug
at an auction and didn’t realise until I
picked it up and pieces came off - in my
hands that it was in fact quite rotten.”
Langlands said one of the most com-
mon misconceptions about antique rugs
was the notion that dyes made from nat-
ural ingredients, either vegetable or
mineral, would mellow and fade with
time. “That’s not true at all,” he said. “It
was really the first group of synthetic
dyes which had the poor light-fastness.
One of the oldest ploys in the east is to
age rugs by lying them in the sun or al-
lowing all sorts of traffic including cars,
trucks, camels and donkeys to walk over
them in the bazaars. One of the ways to
check for light-fastness is to look into
the base of the knots. If the color ap-
pears much richer down deep, then you
are probably looking at inferior chemic-
ally dyed wool. Most naturally-dyed
wools have very good light-fastness.
The much-sought-after mellowness in
antique rugs comes not so much from
the ageing process as from the fact that
most naturally derived dyes were orig-
inally vibrant colors, harmoniously
juxtaposed.”
Langlands said anyone buying an
antique rug had to be on the lookout for
bad repair work and restoration. “Often
the repairers in the east will simply take
the most expedient route,” he said,
“and, instead of re-weaving a whole
bottom border, they will cleverly cut it
out and join it up again in a reduced
fashion so that you can hardly detect it.
The best way to check for restoration is
to look at the back of the rug where the
new work will be much more obvious. It
is very important to make sure the side
cords and end finishes are original.
Often you find repairers have snipped
off a damaged border on one side and
then, to even things up, they will have to
cut the opposite side off as well. That, of
course, reduces the value of the rug.”
On a wall in his Surry Hills home
hangs a magnificent Divrigh rug (circa
1800) from Central Anatolia. It has
large and gaping rents about its lower
half and yet Langlands would not
dream of repairing them. “If I sell it,”
he said, “the question of repair would of
course be up to the buyer. I am quite
happy to leave it just as it is. I don’t like
the idea of interfering too much with the
historic integrity or the rug. All an-
tiques, whether they be rugs or furni-
ture, bear the patina of time. It may
sound strange to the layman but the
marks and scars that testify to its
antiquity also enhance its value both
in an aesthetic and a material sense.”
Langlands is definitely against the
idea of antique rug collections ending
up in bank vaults. “It’s nice,” he said,
“to be able to put a piece to the use for
which it was originally intended. To put
something in a glass case with a careful-
ly controlled temperature is not my idea
of enjoying it. Antique pieces can be
used if they’re given a reasonable
amount of care and vigilance. You
wouldn’t want to put a lovely old piece
down somewhere where it’s going to be
devoured by moths or trampled by
heavy traffic. From the outset, people
have to make the distinction between
whether they’re buying something pure-
ly decorative or functional or whether
its purely an important object.”
Among the true collectors the idea of
investment is, he says, secondary. “You
do slip up a lot if you concentrate on
rugs as an investment. A beautiful rug
ought to trigger an aesthetic response. If
you don’t like the thing, there’s no point
buying it. Part of the investment is the
enjoyment you get out of it.” □

in fact a monument to revisionists.
Open the door (with new wind-

How to cope with a VIP
RON SAW
HAD SOMEBODY asked
me, I’d have said that I was
about as tense as the average
dormouse.
God knows I’ve enough to
make me tense arcane
matters such as women’s
underwear and why my fox-
gloves will not flower but,
years ago, I grew so familiar
with tension and its failures to
sort out my problems that I
began to hold it in contempt.
And, lo and behold, I
unwound.
It would not be going too
far to say that life was halcyon
until Bonnie Seamonds
arrived.
She was, I was told (an <P
almost certainly she is still) an
American “consultant in occupational
medicine.”
I tensed up at once. I had no idea
what it meant but patently it had
something to do with headshrinking
because Bonnie undertook to assess my
“work and personal stressors” and my
individual coping skills and to show me
“cost-effective research efforts that can
result in the reduction of stress-related
illness.” God almighty!
I am, like most Australians, inordi-
nately fo§d of Americans. I have lived
with them and many of their ways have
become mine and I had always been
sure I had never found it necessary to
question what I had assumed to be the
fact that we spoke the same language.
But, unless (as I was inclined to suspect)
she meant “How to get your arse in
gear,” Bonnie seemed likely to leave me
with a head like a can full of worms
knotted worms, tense worms.
No sooner had I decided to let
Bonnie’s assessments pass me by than
another psychologist, another Ameri-
can, leaped unto the breach.
Dr Alfred A. Barrios, from Westlake
Village, California, sent me his Do-It-
Yourself Stress Control Handbook and
stuck to the cover was the Stress Control
Biofeedback Card without which, ap-
parently, not only Westlake Village but
the whole United States navy would be
dopey, boozy and mentally not unlike
the Gordian Knot.
Alf needed 16 pages to explain his
little card but it all boiled down to this:
You put your thumb on a black
square for 10 seconds. You were
“relaxed” if the square turned blue.
Green meant “calm” and red “tense.”
But you were in trouble if the square
stayed black: you were “stressed.”
I gave it 10 seconds, then another 10
to be sure. The square stayed black.
I had been sitting in my office, arms
dropping, head lolling, legs stuck out
before me on the floor only because I
hadn’t the strength (or possibly the
stress) to put them on my desk. It is true
that, all around me, typewriters were
chattering; a dozen brains were giving
off the well-oiled hum of cerebration.
On the other hand, I had not gotten
around to switching on let alone
using my typewriter. My thoughts
were concerned only with the logistics
involved in opening a drawer to get a
paperclip with which to gouge from
between my teeth a shred of snapper
that had been there since lunch.
Dr Buster Summerhayes, at the Hyde
Park Club that morning, had found my
blood pressure to be a childlike 120/85
and my pulse roughly that of a hiberna-
ting bear, yet, according to Alf, I was as
rigid as a fiddle-string. What on Earth
could have happened?
I turned the card over and read the
instructions: “Clench your fists tightly
for a count of 10, then let your whole
body go limp ... take a deep breath ...
hold it for a count of 10 ... exhale ...
all out at once ... loose and limp ... let
go ...” I was as loose and limp as wet
string. “Imagine yourself basking in the
warm sun on a beach or soaking in a hot
tub ...” Mmmm ... snork ... “feel
warmth come into your hands.”
I dragged my eyes open and pressed
my thumb on the black square. It stayed
black. I put it away and, in a low state of
mind, went to the pub. Half-an-hour
'jder, the square was red with green
flushes.
Bonnie and Alf had come into my
life on a Thursday. On the following
Monday, the Diners Club sent me a
catalogue of Christmas gifts and among
them was the “Pulsetime” watch. This is
a wristlet form, as I worked it out, of
Alfs biofeedback card or, in their
terms: “Your instant monitor on car-
diac rhythm and recovery rates
... When you place your finger
on the sensor, a built-in, in-
tegrated microprocessor takes the
pulse through the skin and dis-
plays the heart-rate, all within
seconds.”
It sounded like the kind of bauble
that Bonnie and Alf would wear, from
• wrist to elbow, for something to talk
about, but I let it pass.
Next day, at a time when a couple of
rums had my biofeedback card in the
red and green again, there arrived in the
mail a book by Eleanor Rowe an-
other American called Waiting
Games, subtitled How to Get Rich,
Powerful, Sexy & Healthy While You’re
Killing Time.
The first chapter was about “Waiting
to Meet or See Someone” and, in-
evitably, the first rule was Avoid
Nervousness. How? Among the rules for
meeting a VIP was “Picture the VIP in
his underwear or in her curlers and
mudpack.”
I was, as it happened, waiting to
interview Sophia Loren, so I got busy at
once, not just feeding back my bio with
Alf but Avoiding Nervousness with
Eleanor. I must have been pretty tense,
despite the red and the green, because I
was completely unable to control either
my imagination or my libido.
I did not want to imagine Loren in
curlers and mudpack. I put them on my
rival, Carlo Ponti, and gave him sagging
long-johns and false whiskers for good
measure.
But Loren! I imagined her in her
underwear on a warm, sunny beach.
The scene changed to a Roman
bathroom where I lay, eating oysters
stewed in honey, in a hot tub ... Feeling
warmth coming into my hands, feeling
my fingers crook like talons as Loren
the creamy, untanned skin deranging
against her tan drifted in ... and hot
on her tail came Bonnie and Alf and
Eleanor, shouting.
Automatically, I reached for my
biofeedback card. Black had never been
blacker. □

PEOPLE
Kathy Lette:
writer of
literary Glo-
mesh bags
Salvador
Figueroa:
Australians
guffawed at
his Christian
name
Anton Faber-
Castel: here
to settle
a bet
Edited by c ßqh Saw
There could have been not just
embarrassment but actual crisis: Kathy
Lette, the co-author of Puberty Blues
and a full bottle on the ways of beachers
and surfies, was sunburned; and not just
on hip, thigh, clavicle, etc, but,
agonisingly, on the behind. And she was
to spend time, at Dymock’s, the Sydney
bookstore, sitting on said rosy and
tender behind, signing copies of her
new book, Hit and Ms. But little or no
sitting was involved: nobody asked for
her signature, though, desperately, she
gave it to a clod who upbraided her for
writing dirty books. He didn’t want it.
Hit and Ms (Penguin $5.95) she
describes as “a literary Glo-Mesh bag”
and sub-titles or sub-subjects include
How to Survive Bondage, Whether to
Bed on the First Date, The Fag Epi-
demic and Mohair Stockings (to the
wimps, hairy legs). On January 4 comes
her next literary offering: a play called
Wet Dreams, presumably about sleepy
surfers.
To most people, from Sydney west to
Vancouver or east to Perth, the name
Faber means pencils; and, indeed,
Count Anton von Faber-Castell, an
eighth-generation pencil-fancier, is in
Australia now. He is 41 and is fond of
Princess Yasmin, the daughter of Rita
Hayworth and Aiy Khan. He is here not
only to check the traps but to settle a
bet: 14 years ago his younger brother,
Count Andreas, came to live in Australia
and, eight years ago, established SOS
Printing (“instant” printing, office
supplies, etc) with Bob Gardner and
Michael Peel. Ho-ho, said Anton at the
time, any time the trading profits of SOS
top, ho-ho, those of Faber-Castell I’ll
buy your wife (Ginny) a car. This year
, SOS just made it. So what manner of
car? When there are 1000 million pen-
cils a year to help, you can start with a
Maserati and work your way up.
There has been a setback to Jackie
Onassis’ royal pretensions her offer to
“ghost” Princess Di’s autobiography has
been summarily rejected by Buck-
ingham Palace. Neither Di nor the
palace was impressed by Doubleday
editor Jackie’s connections. Consider-
ing the nauseating number of books
about Diana already available none
of which includes an interview with the
Princess herself this can be seen only
as a respite for those less addicted to
royal drivel.
Residents of the picturesque Swiss
village of Gingins, near Lake Geneva,
have prevented an attempt by President
Bongo of Gabon to acquire a sha
property there. They don’t want the
village overrun by security guards.
When he was born, 40 years ago in
Tetuan, Spanish Morocco, Salvador
Figueroa was christened Jesus. As a
given name it’s about as remarkable as
Mohammed or Maria, Peter, Paul or
John. But it was enough to make
Australians guffaw when Figueroa
arrived here in 1967. So, with his family
names, Salvador Figueroa, he drifted to
Queensland, gathered opal and ameth-
yst, topaz and turquoise and sharks’
teeth and discovered a lasting vocation:
he is one of our more distinguished
craftsman jewellers. His exhibition is
now at the Woolloomooloo Gallery, but
he will progress to Canberra and other
capitals. For a man who began his
career in Paris, flogging works of dubi-
ous art to American tourists, it may
seem only right that he completes his
present peregrination in Perth with an
exhibition in time for the America’s
Cup challenge in 1986-87.
Margaret Thatcher reveals yet another
hitherto-hidden talent the label on the
“Prime Minister’s Reserve” whisky the
PM took the Tebbits in hospital recently
was designed by Maggie herself. There
is some dispute over the actual contents
of the bottle some reports suggest it
was 12-year-old Glenlivet, others that it
was just an ordinary Suntory with the
No 10 label slapped on it.
Could the world cope with yet another
movie star as the next president of the
United States? UK betting shop
William Hill is already making odds for
the ’BB election George Bush is
favorite so far, followed by Gary Hart
and Edward Kennedy. But an outsider at
33/1 is none other than Robert Redford.
He’s already made a trial run in The
Candidate.


Those who have been living in caves for
the last few weeks will be glad to know
that one way of seeing Bob Hawke has
been to venture into the street to see
Brian Henderson and others driving a
coach and towing a float bearing the
PM sculpted in sponge cake. Sculpted?
Certainly: in aid of the Variety Club of
Australia, which is raising money for
disadvantaged kids. Sponsored by CSR,
Nissan and Sunbeam The float, with
candidate, left Perth, did Kalgoorlie,
Widgiemooltha, Adelaide, Melbourne
and, about now, has turned north for
civilisation. The sculptress was a
sculptress indeed. When Anthea
Leonnard was in the US, sculpting in
rock, mud, etc was earning her about
one meal a week. Urged to try her luck
in a specialty cake shop, she sculpted a
pig and hasn’t looked back since.
Now she sculpts away like mad in flour,
eggs, sugar, fruit and brandy, in
Paddington, NSW, eats regularly and
can afford to help charities such as the
Variety Club. The smile, which seems to
be filled with either sugar or blanched
almonds, is explained by Leonnard’s
assertion: “Bob Hawke still has his own
teeth.”
Fur will fly next month when militant
members of the British Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals try to sack the Queen and Queen
Mother as RSPCA patrons because they
wear real fur. Through the “Help the
RSPCA to put cruelty out of fashion”
campaign, the militants intend to “at
least cause enough fuss to embarrass the
royals into not wearing their furs.”
RSPCA moderates who revel in the
royals’ support hope the resolution
will be defeated. A spokesman grace-
fully acknowledged that “it is not for us
to tell the Queen what to wear.”
Bill Hayden, his publicists report, is
beavering away like mad in the long
run-up to the election. So is any
politician you care to name. But a
politician must not just work but be seen
to be working. And where does that
leave John Brown, the federal Tourism
minister? Campaigning on Hayman
Island, he flatly refused to pose on the
beach. He maintained, and his wife, Jan
Murray, agreed, that holidays are few
and far between and that a picture of a
politician lolling around on the beach
would give too many people the wrong
impression. They finally agreed to a
pool-side pose, a la Paul Hogan, letting
everybody know that Brownie is
“working flat out for his country.”

Some friction among contented cows
PHILLIP ADAMS
A FEW DAYS ago, my ministerial
cobber Barry Cohen received a terse
telex from a Mr John Hawker, who is
executive officer of the Confectionery
Manufacturers of Australia Limited.
Hawker sent carbon copies to Professor
Di Yerbury, the general manager of the
Australia Council, and Pat Galvin, the
permanent head of the Department of
Home Affairs and Environment.
The communication was headed
“Re: Theatre Board of the Australia
Council Eastern Suburbs Community
Theatre Company, Melbourne.”
It said: “On behalf of the Confec-
tionery Manufacturers of Australia
Limited, representing 119 companies
involved in the manufacture of confec-
tionery and the supply of materials to
the confectionery industry, I wish to
register a strong protest over the actions
of the Department of Home Affairs and
Environment through the Theatre
Board of the Australia Council which
has funded a theatre production in
which products manufactured by this
industry and other sections of the food
industry are attacked, entitled The Nutri
Show.
“We would draw your attention to a
report published in the September 4
issue of The Advertiser (Williamstown,
Victoria) which detailed the manner in
which products manufactured by
Cadbury and Mars (among others) are
singled out for unfair critical treatment
by this government-sponsored theatre
company. “The CMA fails to
understand why vitally needed funds
are being channelled into activities
which discredit legitimate and nutrion-
ally sound products which are being
marketed in this country.
“I have been instructed to contact
you not only to register our protest at
the actions of your department in al-
locating funds for this sort of activity
but also to request:
“LA complete copy of the script of
the theatre production in question.
“2. An immediate cessation of
funding for the theatre company.
“3. An end to any associated activi-
ties in which defamatory statements are
made about products manufactured by
companies represented by this assoc-
iation.
“I am further instructed that, unless
a satisfactory solution to this matter is
achieved within seven days of your
receipt of this telex, legal proceedings
for product defamation will be in-
stituted without further notice.
“I shall look forward to your advice
as a matter of urgency.”
Clearly, Mr Hawker is not a man to
fruit-mince words. That has to be
among the angriest, most desk-thump-
ing, no-nonsense, hard-hitting, straight
from the shoulder communications
nay, ultimatums in recent history. It is
more appropriate to Mars, the god of
war, than to Mars the chocolate bar.
But, although it is hard-hitting and non-
negotiable, I don’t think it goes far
enough. What is needed clearly is a
Costigan inquiry into confectionery, a
royal commission into the subversive
onslaughts faced by chocky-bars.
It is inevitable that this matter will
become a major election issue. What
does Andrew Peacock think about left-
wing attacks on lollies? Where does
Don Chipp stand? Is the Eastern
Suburbs Community Theatre’s ugly at-
tack on sweeties linked, in some way, to
the issues raised by Geoffrey Blainey?
Cohen and the Australia Council
probably will suggest that the Eastern
Suburbs Community Theatre is a very
small company whose entire audience
could be squeezed into a single milk
bar. But that isn’t the point. Frankly, it
is a load of Polly Waffle. By being
violent to the Violet Crumble, those
theatrical thugs have struck at
Australia’s heart, have thumbed their
nose at a tradition that stretches back in
time like chewy.
I have been unable to obtain a copy
of the script in question, so can only
guess at the atrocities committed by
those Eastern Suburbs actors. One sus-
pects that they have been rolling JafFas
down uncarpeted aisles. Perhaps they
have been humiliating chocolate frogs
or making racist remarks about black
jellybeans.
It is intolerable that Cohen should
give taxpayers’ lolly to these anti-lolly
layabouts. This is further evidence of
the way social standards are Violet
Crumbling. As the League of Rights
points out, all over Australia radical
ratbags are Columbining in a red army
that ridicules Queen, country and
Cadbury’s contented cows. I under
stand from the Festival of Light that
there are even those who are ready to
abort jelly babies. As the Reverend Fred
Nile puts it: “It’s enough to break your
Street’s Heart.”
Cohen must think we are a lot of
sherbet suckers if we will cop this sort of
thing. Giving those Eastern Suburbs
actors a liquorice strap is not enough: I
think something along Islamic lines is
called for. They should be stoned to
death with gob-stoppers. □


Quest for a stud champion
DAVID M c NICOLL
AUSTRALIA is rapidly becoming ca-
sino-happy. They are springing up all
over the place. Some years ago, I was
made a member of The Enclosure which
is the members’ section of the Laun-
ceston Country Club Casino. I have not
yet been able to make an appearance
there but I get all the lively
correspondence.
The latest Tasmanian venture is a
$lOO,OOO poker championship, which I
feel will arouse a great deal of interest.
Five-card stud, entry fee $5OO (no ad-
ditional table stakes required). First
prize is a guaranteed $lOO,OOO.
The knockout heats will start at the
Launceston Country Club and the
Wrest Point Hotel on December 6,7,
and 8. The final will start on December
9 in Launceston and play will continue
until an outright winner is established.
Apart from the cash prizes (down to
Bth), the winner will receive two airline
tickets to Las Vegas plus table stakes,
total value $16,000. The tickets are
return tickets in case the buzzards at
Vegas give you a trimming.
OH, GOD, where will it end? Now I see
that an Adelaide paper, The Advertiser,
is using the word “Aboriginalise” and
“Aboriginalisation.” Let this monstrous
mutation be nipped in the bud at once
and never appear again in print.
THE improvement in gastron-
omic delights in our country
towns is quite astonishing.
Driving to Melbourne for the
Cup, I stayed a night in
Albury: Dinner at an excel-
lent little restaurant, Fer-
nando’s. The cooking was
first-class, the wine list exten-
sive and not expensive.
Albury has a flying start
because of its trout farm. The
exhibit I demolished was one
of the freshest and tastiest in
my experience.
SURELY it’s time we called a
halt to the “Pommy-bashing”
which has become such a
feature of our films and televi-
sion mini-series.
In the film Gallipoli, the
British came in for trenchant
criticism. Much of this was
deserved because there were
some spectacularly hopeless
English commanders. But it
should not be forgotten that
thousands of British soldiers were fight-
ing and dying on Gallipoli. It was not
only an Australian campaign.
Bodyline turned the Brits into con-
niving, unpleasant, backroom man-
ipulators prepared to go to any lengths
to beat Australia at cricket. Breaker
Morant gave the British commanders a
terrible name because the film script
was written on the premise that Morant
should not have been shot. In fact, the
latest investigations into The Breaker’s
activities have revealed that he
thoroughly deserved his fate.
Now we come to the recent turkey,
The Last Bastion. This pile of rubbish
attributed statements to Winston
Churchill which were a slur on his
memory and an affront to the in-
telligence of viewers. The depiction of
the rest of the characters was not much
better.
The sad thing about these Pommy-
bashing views, generally from the left, is
that many of Australia’s young believe
them.
A STORY which has been buzzing
round Sydney has it that Sydney
Grammar School is to give up playing
rugby union. Not true although I
have a feeling that Alastair Mackerras,
the headmaster, would not be sorry if it
were so.
The late Rudy Komon: his memorial fund deserves support
Talking to him last week, I gathered
that, like me, he regards rugby union as
not only too dangerous a sport (in its
current form) for schoolboys but also as
a rather ludicrous spectacle. His feelings
no doubt seep through to his scholars.
Apparently Grammar cannot compete
effectively against other GPS schools
which take the game seriously.
It’s time the worthies running our
schools took another look at rugby
and at the casualty list resulting from
the game.
I AM NOT sure if it was my influence
but quite a few of the chaps with whom
I went to school took up holy orders as
soon as they quit the ivied surroundings.
One of these was Peter Bennie. Peter
started, as good preachers apparently
do, as a curate in Brisbane, then moved
north to become Archdeacon of Car-
pentaria and later Canon of Brisbane
Cathedral. He came to Sydney 20 years
ago as warden of St Paul’s College,
Sydney.
As everyone knows, being warden of
a university college calls for the best in a
man tact, broadness of mind, a sense
of humor and an ability to capture
respect. Peter Bennie had the lot and his
20 years at Paul’s were memorable ones.
He found time for writing, published
verse and books of religious subjects, in
addition to being chairman of
the Blake Society for
Religious Art. Peter Bennie
leaves on November 24.
RUTH KOMON, Rudy’s
widow, writes to say that the
Rudy Komon Memorial Fund
is under way and the sum
invested will be used to buy
Australian art for the New
South Wales gallery. If ever
there were a fund which
deserved support from the art
and wine lovers of Australia,
it is the Rudy Komon Fund.
Rudy was a beacon, a man of
almost exhausting verve and
fascination. It will be a long
time before we see his equal in
Sydney.
I GOT my tycoons mixed last
week. Richard Pratt, not
Parry, is the man who
financed Victoria’s America’s
Cup challenge, and who
purchased Archbishop
Mannix’s palace at Kew. □

‘I said brim out the Drambuie! ’


Now Melbourne h
youd only expect
Two of Melbourne's most
elegant Victorian buildings have
been stunningly transformed into
the kind of hotel you'd only expect
to find overseas.
Outside, it's classic Victorian.
Inside, it's completely modem.
Every room has several direct
dial phones, a writing desk and
every facility you could want.
Most rooms have a balcony
looking down into the spectacular
glass-roofed Portego.
It is a hotel where every suite
is unique, with magnificent decor
varying from American Colonial to
the aptly named Royal Suite, com-
plete with opulent 4-poster bed.
But the glass-roofed Portego,
which soars 9 storeys, is the focal
point of the hotel.
Here, amid lush greenery and
cascading plant life, you can take a
drink at the bar and imagine your-
self in another century when horses
clattered their way over the cobble-
stones delivering their loads.
The Portego is also an ideal
place to meet friends or business
associates.
Although there are many fine
restaurants in Melbourne, you'll still
be surprised at the standard of ours.
The Chandelier Room is
magnificent.
The atmosphere is perfect.
The staff attentive.

The menu exciting and original,
And the chef lives up to his
considerable reputation.
The standard of these facilities
alone is enough to justify Menzies

most exciting new hotel.
But there's more.
In the brilliantly restored
Edinburgh Bar and the club-like
Tavern you can enjoy a quiet drink
or a quick snack.
The delightful Cafe Rialto is
open 24 hours a day.
And the magnificent Banquet
Hall makes an elegant setting for
everything from weddings to
conventions.
Menzies at Rialto is a brilliant
concept, brilliantly brought to life.
There isn't another hotel like it.

THE ARTS
It’s time for a change
as the Enz split nears
Leading rock music band Split Enz is calling it quits after a sometimes highly
emotional farewell tour and members will go their separate ways.
GLENDA THOMPSON reports on the rise and demise of a phenomenon.
AUSTRALIANS keen to wallow in the
bathos of “Split Enz last concert” in
Auckland on December 7 can take a
$450 three-day package trip. This takes
in the concert at the Logan Campbell
Centre a far cry but only about five
kilometres from the Wynyard Tavern
where the band first played publicly, 12
years ago.
The six musicians are keen to get on
with individual careers after the final
encore of the Australian and New
Zealand “Enz with a Bang” tour. Lead
guitarist Neil Finn says: “We haven’t
gone out to make people tragic about
our splitting up.”
Some concert reports say that crowds
have been emotional at the demise of
this group. There was a lot of audience
singing but few tears at the second
Sydney concert at the Entertainment
Centre. However, drummer Paul Hester
says a Launceston audience included a
2.2 metre hippie standing 2m from the
front... “We played Time fora Change,
off Mental Notes the first album and
the guy broke into tears. I got
sentimental then because I realised how
much it all means to people.”
It means a lot to Hester, too, though
he has been with the band only 12
months. The 25-year-old Melbourne
musician the only Australian had
been with Deckchairs Overboard. He
says he found communication with the
rest of the Split Enz easy, probably
because he lived in Wellington (NZ) for
a while. Other Enz members talk with
the clipped vowels that have their ex-
trovert lead singer Tim Finn widely
known as Tm Fn.
Finn, 32, is the last of the original
members. He and some mates started
out in their spare time with an acoustic
sound. Keyboardist Eddie Rayner, 31,
and percussionist Noel Crombie, 31,
soon joined. They metamorphosed into
a more conventional electric format and
turned professional when they moved to
Sydney in 1975.
Crombie was responsible for the
styling of the hair, clothes and make-up
which rather than their music, first drew
attention. Years later, in the Boy
George era, their image in old
photographs still seems eccentric.
For years they toured and recorded
in Australia, England and Canada.
They sold two million records but they
were regarded as tops in Australia only
after their sixth album True Colors
in 1980, produced by David Tickle who
had worked with Blondie and The
Knack. That sold 200,000 in Australia
which beat top local discs Shining by
Marcia Hines, Diamintina Cocktail by
The Little River Band and Howzat by
Sherbet. Only Skyhooks’ Living in the
Seventies in 1974 had done better, with
250,000 one for every 56 people.
The single I Got You sold 150,000
and brought recognition to Finn’s
younger brother Neil, 26. He had been
brought to England as a teenager in
Tim Finn, lead singer of Split Enz
ROBERT MORT
1977 to plug holes left by band members
pressured by touring. He replaced the
influential song writer Phil Judd who
played mandolin and guitar. Finn says:
“I couldn’t replace him; he was an
extreme personality.”
Neil Finn and Hester have plans to
form a new band. They will travel
overseas early next year, seeing pro-
ducers.
“We get on well personally and
musically,” says Finn. “Paul’s a fine
drummer and I can cover other things,
piano and guitar, but I’m a terrible
drummer.” A name and the rest of the
line-up are not decided, though Hester
says: “We’re going to have a play with a
few people. There’s a guy in New
Zealand called ‘Bones’ who used to play
bass with The Swingers ... and we’re
going to get out in Melbourne and see
young bands.”
For the rest, it is a splitting
of the ways. Tim Finn has had
a successful solo album, Es-
capade, and this year an-
nounced his leaving. The rest
of the band called it quits six
weeks later.
Tim Finn has dabbled with
acting. He is in The Coca Cola
Kid with a girlfri-end, the
beautiful actress Greta
Scacchi, and seems confident
of his many skills as a
songwriter and performer.
Rayner wants to be a
record producer. Bass player
Nigel Griggs, 34, has been
with the band for seven years
and intends recording more
music. Crombie, who played a
whimsical spoons solo on
tour, aims for film art direc-
tion. His distinctive touch
with visuals is in demand for
other bands. A Fine Arts
graduate, he also is keen on
designing furniture. He says:
“I love wood. At school, I did
a four-year carving course
with a Maori master crafts-
man.”


Raw energy of the band at work during its farewell tour: next, individual careers
The Enz s survival for so long in
their industry hinges on attitude. “We’re
sensible, however boring that sounds,”
says Neil Finn. “We sound like angels
because we don’t drink a bottle of
vodka every day.”
Printable tales prove that they can
unwind with the best of them. On last
year s New Zealand tour, cars loaded
with band members and crew were
crossing the Canterbury Plains in four-
cylinder Commodores. Crombie says:
“For some reason, we had a much faster
Cortina so, as we came up behind one
of the Other cars, we thought ‘What
could we throw at them?’
“We bought tomatoes and took oflf
after them and threw them. That didn’t
seem quite satisfying enough and we
were thinking of custard pies ...
squashy fruit. Then we saw the sign:
Eggs For Sale. We screeched to a halt,
then set off in pursuit plastering their
car with eggs. There was a running
battle all the way to Christchurch.”
Crombie enlarged the band’s reputa-
tion at his expense in Atlanta, Georgia,
in the United States. He was leaving the
stage and caught a foot on a crack. “I
flipped over into the front row and
landed heavily on my knee. Everybody
went ‘Wow’ as I jumped up and went
off. They thought I was a gymnast. I was
on a walking stick for the rest of the
tour. When I got backstage, Phil and
Tim and Mike were having a fistfight
they were getting hysterical and I could
only watch, bemused and in pain.”
Griggs, a heavy sleeper, once had his
American hotel door broken down by
the management who had tried knock-
ing in the afternoon and were con-
cerned. “We haven’t got a good record
with rock stars,” they apologised.
Hester streaked twice at the Revesby
Workers Club in New South Wales after
gigs. “They played the national anthem
after we finished, which I thought was
depressing. No this guy was making
announcements about Coming Attrac-
tions. Just as he was laying into the
middle of his monologue, I bounded
across the stage with nothing on. The
next night, he did it agin so I did. He got
a bit upset the second time and went,
‘Oh, no, not again’ in a broad
Australian accent.”
By accident, rather than design, one
of their songs was banned in Britain
during the Falklands war. The British
were upset about the connotations of
Six Months in a Leaky Boat.
Groupies have not been a big pro-
blem but a Canadian mother and
daughter team got on their nerves three
years ago, Neil says. “The daughter was
totally in love with Tim and we thought
it a bit strange that the mother, who was
about 60, was into it as much as the
daughter. They were down the front
every night and out front whenever we
arrived at a new hotel. We imagined
they flew between shows on a
broomstick. Tim got so fed-up, he had
them thrown out. That night, the mother
called him and said, ‘You can’t stop us
loving you’ and hung up.”
The reason Split Enz did not crack
the important American market was
lack of experience in its record com-
panies, local and international, accord-
ing to manager Nathan Brenner.
Brenner, 33, co-manages Men At Work,
an Australian band comparitively more
successful in the States. He says that
Americans categorise music: “If it
sounds like Fleetwood Mac, it will sell.”
They find it hard to handle anything
very different and wrote the Enz off.
“Their value to music is far greater
than Men At Work’s,” Brenner says.
Plenty of unreleased Split Enz songs
are in the can. Hester jokes that Michael
Gudinski of Mushroom Records “will
probably whip a Split Enz compilation
out once a month for the rest of our
lives.”
What about return concerts, com-
mon among rock bands in Australia.
Hester says: “So many bands make
more money getting together again after
they’ve broken up but they might not
have done anything else musically with
their careers. We’ve each got too much
on our plates and I don’t think we’ll be
looking too often at getting back
together.
Hardly a definitive “no,” is it? □


ART
Moved by
man’s violent
environment
By MARGARET SMITH
ONE OF Australia’s favorite sons,
Jeffrey Smart has returned to make us
look again at the world we have created
around us.
Smart lives in Italy but has sustained
yearly pilgrimages to Australia both to
show his work and to gain new subjects.
His latest exhibition, at the Rex Irwin
gallery in Sydney, practically sold out
before it opened.
Two years ago, Smart came home to
a review exhibition of his work at the
Art Gallery of New South Wales. Large
and prestigious, it conveyed the undeni-
able mark of his art. The gallery’s
director, Edmund Capon, says of
Smart: “His reputation is now firmly
and justly established in Europe as well
as in Australia. There is no doubt that
his stature will continue to grow. His
consistent pre-occupation with realist
imagery stands lucidly clear from the
mainstreams of abstract and figurative
expressionism in painting.”
One of the more famous works at this
exhibition was Smart’s portrait of the
Australian writer David Malouf who
lives near the artist in Italy. He painted
Malouf as a garage attendant and
created something of a controversy.
Despite Maloufs classical leanings, he
was squarely within the context of the
modern world.
Smart’s new exhibition takes a sim-
ilar plunge with its painting of
Germaine Greer, another neighbor and
friend in the Tuscany valley.
Smart says of Greer: “She’s very
beautiful, with a wonderful skin and
profile.” But he chooses to ignore the
profile and instead paints her looking
straight into the eye of the beholder. It is
a poignant study of Greer’s boldness,
strength and beauty but her eyes hold an
obvious vulnerability which has
characterised much of Smart’s depiction
of the human condition.
The Stairs, Florence Station is an-
other painting at the exhibition con-
cerned with the isolation of the in-
dividual in the world. It is reminiscent
of Smart’s Central Station (1961) and
another study of Central Station in
1974. Both these Sydney paintings con-
tain hints of the terror and the coldness
of the surroundings while acknowledg-
ing a real sense of beauty.
In the latest work, the path up to the
exit seems more arduous and Smart has
added a figure who walks alone up the
stairs the humanoid forever trying to
retain his sense of courage and, one
suspects, endurance.
Morning at Yarragon Siding has a
similar ambience, though very definitely
set in Australia with its galvanised iron,
the telegraph poles, and gumtrees on a
distant hill.
The exhibition also contains some
more familiar work. The Large Tanker
is reminiscent of his famous red semi-
trailers but the beauty here is more
ominous and the tanker appears almost
like a nuclear missile.
The Conversation has a man and a
woman leaning from their isolated bal-
conies to talk to one another. The
impersonal modern world is there but
so is Smart’s sense of hope and of
humor.
The Developer and The Observerhave
no such softening. The Developer is
unrepentent despite the nasty monolith
which stands behind him and The Ob-
server looks out at us through
binoculars, with a skewed eye, as
though he were some kind of Big
It’s amazing what we re able

It s amazing what we re able


Jeffrey Smart’s Germaine Greer confronts the beholder
Brother. Here is none of the frailty and
ambivalence which characterised the
man in his earlier Cahill Expressway.
Smart has always seen this figure
standing before the tunnel as a sort of J.
Alfred Prufrock but he carries in his
frame more optimism than did the
original T.S. Eliot character. He re-
appears in Yarrogon Siding and The
Stairs of this exhibition and Smart
stresses: “He’s you and me. He is long
past the threshold of life but he still feels
he is not. He should be a vehicle of
endless compassion.” Greer saw this
and commented on it in the introduc-
tion to the recent book Jeffrey Smart, by
Peter Quartermaine: “Those of us who
grew up on The Wasteland and matured
in the age of the bomb were forced sadly
to acknowledge that we were J. Alfred
Prufrock but a painter like Jeffrey Smart
is great enough to teach us how to love
him as he is.
Smart is still astounded at her per-
ception. He says: “I find myself moved
by man in his new, violent environment.
I want to paint this explicitly and
beautifully.” He takes his sharp images
of the city back to Tuscany and
replenishes them. He places great
emphasis on technical perfection. If a
painting is not working, he may turn its
face to the wall for more than a year.
“It's like leaving a difficult child for a
while,” he says, “I try to forget it until I
go back to it and a solution or a way
through emerges. No picture is ever
finished; it’s only abandoned.”
Smart is pleased by the impact of his
work and says: “Only very recently
have artists again started to comment on
their real surroundings.” □

THEATRE
‘Epic’ brisk
but hardly
memorable
By JOHN CARGHER
THE DOCU-drama or “faction” is
getting out of hand. We have recently
had dramatised biographies of Melba,
Mozart and Einstein. Now the success-
ful author of the last, Ron Elisha, has
tackled John F. Kennedy in what can
only be described as an attempt at
Brecht-style “epic theatre.”
The Melbourne Theatre Company
has been lucky in presenting Pax
Americana within weeks of a television
mini-series which covered the life and
death of the most American president of
recent years. Whether this 3!4 hour
revue-cum-vaudeville-cum-play mara-
thon would make sense to
anybody not thoroughly
familiar with the 80 or so
characters portrayed by 10
actors is a moot point.
The whole thing is pre-
sented with tremendous pan-
ache, starting with the superb
set by Tony Tripp a sort of
Leaning Tower of Wash-
ington the dome of the
Capitol set on a crumbling
White House sinking into
democracy’s decadence. The
tower and everything else
seems to lean only to the left
for the whole first act, as if the
Pram Factory had arisen from
the ashes. The second act
redresses the balance up to a
point but the smell of anti-
Americanism remains strong.
It is not that history does
not justify the mud thrown so
lavishly by Elisha but the
weakness of his play is that,
unlike Einstein, it has no cen-
tral figure. Pax Americana
may be built around Kennedy
and his assassination but it is
not about Kennedy; it is
about America and all it
stands for in the author’s
mind: “false witness, false im-
ages, false gods.” Putting the
other side is almost imposs-
ible in this context and the
premise that the whole thing is
satire does not hold water.
There was little laughter and
not much to laugh about.
The veering between vaudeville,
straight drama and political oratory
stretches the attention span with what
must be nearly every fact about the
Kennedy affair which has ever been
published. Some things flash by in
literally seconds while others are
stretched beyond reasonable bounds.
The play seems at times to be about the
assassin, Oswald, rather than about the
president, though Oswald is a shadowy
figure of little interest compared with
the complex JFK persona.
JFK is played ably by John O’May
but the author puts few words in his
mouth which are not taken directly
from the president’s speeches. He is not
allowed to come to life as a person. But,
then, hardly any character is.
Elisha introduces two pieces of
fiction, a weak wrath-of-God explana-
tion for the misfortunes of the
Kennedys and a postcript to provide his
play with a climax. Kingmaker Joseph
Kennedy (father of JFK) and his family
are cursed Verdi fashion by a Jewish
businessman he has ruined and JFK
leaves behind an illegitimate son born
out of a casual affair with a typist in his
office. The play ends with the young
Frank Gallacher as The Enquirer in Pax Americana: never falters
DAVID B SIMMONDS
man about to continue the Kennedy
line.
The action certainly is fast and
furious and slow patches are few and
far between. Director Bruce Miles
knows how to keep things moving. He
throws famous names around when
nothing else happens to be handy and
leaves no bed unturned.
The strange Australian stage tradi-
tion that male nudity is OK while
female is not jars at times in a play
which features at least three cases of
simulated intercourse. Or is there some
symbolic significance in the mysterious
Kennedy heir being violently conceived
through undamaged pantyhose?
Perhaps Pax Americana had to be
written by an Australian and performed
by the Melbourne Theatre Company.
The play might get more consistent
American accents in the United States
but not as lavish a production, though
somebody in the Land of the Free
would probably be prepared to stage it
off-Broadway. (Australians are not the
only knockers of their own idols.)
The central character is The
Enquirer and he rarely leaves the stage.
He is the “voice over” of filmed
documentaries, is dressed as
Uncle Sam and switches roles
without disguising his identi-
ty. Frank Gallacher never
falters in his monumental
part(s).
It is difficult to identify all
the others, because of Elisha’s
strange descriptions. Janet
Andrewartha is very good in
her many guises but why is
she “The Ideal Woman”?
Surely not because of her non-
speaking appearance as the
Statue of Liberty?
John McTernan is
identifiably odious as Joe
Kennedy, Kate Turner con-
vinces completely as a mute
Marilyn Monroe and in the
pointlessly long part of the
drab Marina Oswald, while
Chris Connelly is fine as the
mixed-up Oswald who kills
for no visible motive, if he
killed at all. Though he leaves
all his other options open,
Elisha categorically denies the
possibility of a conspiracy to
kill the president.
Clever lines are few and
far between. “Robin Hood
borrowing from the rich and
sub-letting to the poor” is one
of the better ones. But Pax
Americana sinks under its
own weight, a huge mix of
facts, fancies and history. En-
tertaining? Yes! Memorable,
let alone of lasting value? I
doubt it. □


DANCE
A survivor
pays off with
rich rewards
Sydney Dance Company principals in Louis Falco’s Black and Blue
By BRIAN HOAD
DESPITE that tired old furphy beloved
of philistines, that artists are at their best
when starving in a garret, the Sydney
Dance Company is back at the Opera
House demonstrating that a little
financial encouragement can breed a
great deal of confidence. Opening its
season at the large opera theatre rather
than the small drama theatre, the com-
pany has never looked so stylish,
danced so well nor offered such a
diverse program. It has clearly moved
up to a new plane of development.
Certainly, it has been a hard struggle.
For the past couple of years in par-
ticular, it has been teetering about on
the edge of financial collapse held
together, it mostly seemed, by the in-
domitable will of its guiding light, that
gentle genius Graeme Murphy.
But now, as gloom and doom
envelop most of the nation’s performing
arts companies, up pops the SDC with a
new and winning smile. It has survived
unscathed the recent purge of subsidies
by the Australia Council. Its very
special sugar daddy, Wang Computer,
is proving generously faithful. The com-
pany’s excursion into commercial
cabaret this year at the up-market
theatre-restaurant Kinselas not only
won new audiences but also left a little
extra money in the kitty.
A new work by Murphy, Old Friends,
New Friends, serves as a title for the
entire season. Some old friends of
Murphy’s teething days at the Aus-
tralian Ballet long ago are particularly
notable. Marilyn Jones, Kelvin Coe and
Paul Saliba are all up there dancing
with the younger generation, their
special talents and long experience
adding much to the richness of the
evening. Garth Welch has choreo-
graphed a new work Janiculum for
the current program and will be dancing
again too later in the season, for the first
time in five years, in another new
Murphy work called After Venice.
The presence of these old friends
also serves to help break down those
artificial barriers between classical and
contemporary dance forms which tend
to polarise audiences into tiresome,
narrow-minded cliques. There is just
good dance or bad dance. On this
occasion, there is some very good dance
indeed.
Important new friends include the
new fans culled from Kinselas during
the season of the light and amusing
Deadly Sins last June. Froth and bubble
and general high spirits have always
had a place in the work of the company
but art is serious at heart and Murphy
has decided to throw his new friends in
at the deep end.
Janiculum opens the evening, a
technical showpiece for the company in
a variety of styles bridging the classical
and the contemporary. The title comes
from the music which inspired it, the
Sinfonia Janiculum of American com-
poser Vincent Persichetti. Michael
Pearce echoes the hint of ancient Rome
in his stage setting. Otherwise it is an
abstract work which, in requiring no
particular interpretation, leaves the
audience free simply to enjoy the
dancers hard at work.
Thinking caps are, however, essential
for Murphy’s Homelands. First staged
in 1982, it remains one of his most rich
and subtle dance creations a major
example of his recurring fascination
with the special way dance may be used
to explore the nature of time and so of
memories and dreams, to strange and
haunting effect.
Many will recall the closing scene in
Rumours when a creaky old couple
danced with their former, youthful
selves; or in Beyond Twelve when time
past, present and future were drawn
together in a trio for a dancer per-
sonified at three different stages of his
career. It is impossible to describe the
complexity of emotion which can be
generated by moments of theatre such
as this.
In Homelands, an Australian woman
looks back to her youth in some gentler
land such as England in a lucid vision
of life and love untainted by regrets.
Home is where the heart is.
Jones is the woman, Janet Vernon
her younger self; Coe is the man of the
old world, Kim Walker that of the new.
Some new friends in the pit put their
heart and soul into a performance of
Janacek’s Second String Quartet (In-
timate Letters) that marvellous last
celebration of love and life by an old
man still passionately young at heart.
Seldom have dance and music been
drawn together to such rich effect. The
perfection is marred only by some fussy
additions to the eloquently evocative
simplicity of Kenneth Rowell’s original
setting. They should be burned.
By this stage, some new friends in the
audience seemed to be wilting a little.
Refreshment was soon at hand in the
form of American choreographer Louis
Falco’s Black and Blue. Here, all the
world becomes a boxing ring where
everybody works out their aggressions
in a sequence of complex punch-ups to
pop songs by Harry Nilsson and Randy
Newman. The dance style is laid-back
and loose. The overall effect is stylishly
glossy, dynamically entertaining and
rather shallow.
This lighter, popular mood is
maintained in the last work of the
evening, Old Friends, New Friends at
least for a while. But Murphy is ex-
perimenting with time again. In the
local hall of some country town (an
admirably detailed setting by Stephen
Curtis), a wedding reception comes to
life in grotesquely comic detail. The
time is the 19505. A scratch orchestra
scratches away on stage at a witty
pastiche of a score commissioned from
Graeme Koehne. A bad-tempered bride
emerges and later, from another time,
the groom some 30 years late. Anger,
sadness and regret permeate the raucous
jollity as what might have been and
what has been meet in one timeless
moment before the dream fades. It is a
beguiling, bitter-sweet piece of theatri-
cal magic. □


FILMS
Regrettable
lapse into the
conventional
By SANDRA HALL
IN THE 19705, with his big pictures
Nashville, M*A*S*H, and McCabe and
Mrs Miller Robert Altman announced
himself as a film-maker with a true flair
for the epic, for films with a hundred
things going on in them at once.
There was nothing studied or
composed about these films, for
Altman’s talent lies in the simulation of
barely controlled anarchy. Not that he
has confused pace with speed: he has
never under-estimated the value of the
reflective pause. But, because of his eye
for the idiosyncratic and the un-
orthodox and his skill in knitting
together a multiplicity of disparate
sights and sounds, he has known how to
grab attention. Holding it has been
another matter. Perhaps because he has
always paid audiences the supreme
compliment of asking them to con-
centrate, his work has never been exact-
ly popular and his budgets have shrunk
over the years causing his canvases to
shrink, too.
His latest film is an adaptation of
David Rabe’s anti-war play, Streamers,
which brings Altman back to where he
began with M*A *S*H. Once again he is
pre-occupied with the randomness of so
much of the violence human beings
inflict on one another. But his mood has
changed. This time round he resists his
natural flair for irony and goes for
tragedy and the result, for all its in-
telligence and the grim logic of its
conclusion, is merely lugubrious.
Rabe’s story takes place in 1965 in a
barracks room of a military training
camp in Virginia where a group of
young recruits are waiting, terrified, to
be shipped to Vietnam. While they wait,
they try to submerge their differences of
temperament and background in a show
of uneasy camaraderie. Roger (David
Alan Grier), the only black in the group,
fills in time by turning himself into a
model soldier. He keeps his brass
polished and his body fit because he
might start thinking if he stopped. Billy
(Matthew Modine), a small-town col-
lege boy, does the same out of an
ingrained belief in the need to make the
best of every situation even one as
desperate as this.
Richie (Mitchell Lichtenstein), the
third member of the group, has been
brought up in Manhattan with enough
money to do more or less as he liked
whenever he liked and is still recovering
from the novelty of being told what to
do. He is gentle and genial about this,
sardonic only on the question of his
homosexuality in which the other two
refuse to believe even though he
amuses himself by making passes at
Billy.
The precarious state of compromise
which exists between these three is
disturbed by the appearance of another
black recruit, Carlyle (Michael Wright),
a streetwise outsider with an outsider’s
suspicions and prejudices. Carlyle has
no trouble in believing Richie’s
homosexuality. On the contrary, he is
ready to exploit it and Richie goes
along because, to his mind, being ex-
ploited is infinitely preferable to being
told homosexuality is something to be
cured by push-ups and cold showers.
Violence breaks out in the barracks
room when, with volcanic inevitability,
Carlyle’s anger erupts. It leaves him as
bewildered as anybody else, and Billy,
because he is naive and decent, gets in
the way of it. Everybody behaves pre-
cisely according to type because Rabe’s
script does not develop its characters,
simply setting them up as symbols to be
manipulated in a dramatic ritual. They
slide passively toward catastrophe, not
so much tragic victims as sacrificial
lambs.
It is deeply depressing in abstract but
being all so strictly circumscribed, it
could well be happening under glass.
For once, Altman is disappointingly
conventional.
GHOSTBUSTERS (which could be
thought of as Animal House gone para-
normal), has a climactic moment in
which Dan Aykroyd, in an involuntary
feat of ESP, conjures up a figure out of
his childhood and then watches aghast
as it appears in a form a thousand times
larger than life and proceeds to trample
Manhattan underfoot.
This emanation is typical of
Ghostbusters’ style, which sets out to
invoke everybody’s childhood with cal-
culated ridiculousness going all the way
back to the Three Stooges. All that has
changed is the quality of the special
effects and the timing of the sight gags.
The plot is necessarily rudimentary.
Supernatural forces begin to take over
Manhattan, coming in from wherever
they have been hiding through a handy
crack in the psychic barrier. Aykroyd,
Bill Murray and Harold Ramis
specialists in psychic phenomena take
them on.
The mixture of technology and
madness is in proper proportions, but
none of it is any better than push-button
comedy.
The aim is lunacy, the end product
something more self-conscious than
that. But none of it is fast enough or
sharp enough to cross that fine line
between the mechanical and the
inspired.
But the audience is on their side.
They have built up credit; they’re a cult.
And, at the moment, that seems to be all
that matters. □

TELEVISION
Last bastion
of continuity
vanquished
Ray Barrett (front) as General Blarney in The Last Bastion
By RON SAW
HAD IT NOT been for the beef-witted-
ness of the management of the Ten
network, The Last Bastion would have
been a passable show. But it was lousy.
The Last Bastionl The mini-series
that had been the subject of more hoo-
ha, ballyhoo and platitude than the bi-
centenary? Lousy? Shock! Horror!
Scandal and concern! Somebody else is
saying that the emperor is wearing no
clothes!
Right. To continue that line of
thought, not only the emperor but the
whole of his court was naked.
Critics given previews said, almost
without exception, that they loved it.
They might have, too, because they saw
the show as it came from its makers.
By the time it got to the TV screen,
the advertising people had had their go
and ruined the whole thing. They, more
thoroughly than any I can think of,
drew attention to a sickness which
pervades our television generally.
You may have noticed that the critics
whose pieces came after the event gave
The Last Bastion a bit of a mauling. I’ll
bet I know why: because they, poor
swine, had become just as deranged as
the average viewer by the barrage of
commercials so deranged that they
were more inclined to concentrate on
trivia.
So: the series was passable if you had
ever heard of people such as John
Curtin, Artie Fadden, Eddie Ward and
Ben Chifley and, let’s face it, millions
haven’t. Millions would care far more
about the unspeakably dreadful women
of Prisoner than about a few years in the
life of Australia’s wartime PM and
Douglas MacArthur, the C. B. DeMille
of the south-western Pacific.
The acting was pretty dull, really:
there were no major parts.
Ray Barrett (Blarney), Robert
Vaughn (MacArthur) and Max Cullen
(Ward) were adequate but the rest,
whether playing Australians, Americans
or Brits, sounded more as if they were in
a bar in Perth discussing the first test
against the Windies.
And there was enough irritating
error to make one wonder: a football
match in Fremantle, “Fremantle v.
Visitors.” Good grief. You could, then
as now, have Souths or Easts but not
just plain Fremantle ... headlands in
the background at Cottesloe Beach on
a coast which does not have a headland
from about Busselton to Shark Bay ...
Churchill smoking a still-banded cigar!
Old Harrovians in our midst must have
fainted dead away ... and what was
meant to be a 1942 newsreel mentioning
Murphy’s Law. In 1942? Oh, come on.
Most of this, I suppose, could be
described as carping but consider those
commercials.
If you are to have a “prestige” series,
it is a good idea to give it a chance to be
good to cut down the advertising time
even if it means charging a loaded rate
for what remains. At least you give the
wretched directors and actors the
benefit of a little continuity.
On the first night of The Last
Bastion, the commercials ran, in
brackets of four, each bracket an av-
erage two and a half minutes, so
frequently that by 9pm I started taking
notice. Then: 9.09, 9.23, 9.34, 9.45, 9.53,
10.04, 10.15, 10.24, 10.29.
Second night: 8.34, 8.42, 8.55, 9.09,
9.19,9.29, 9.43,9.51, 10.05, 10.13, 10.23.
Third: 8.34, 8.41, 8.52, 9.04, 9.15,
9.25, 9.36, 9.47, 10.01, 10.08, 10.19,
10.24.
Read that last lot again. 10.01 to
10.08, minus two and a half minutes of
commercial yap, gives you just four and
a half minutes of drama.
And what chance would you have of
concentrating on the Three Stooges, let
alone the wartime plight of a nation,
when every five or six minutes you were
switched to Italian furniture, oil in
mayonnaise, radio-controlled toy cars
and Clint Eastwood and his frightful
monkey?
More to the point, the tiresome
foolery between politicians and soldiers
made the message of the advertisers
incomprehensible.
And, were I an advertiser, I would
not touch a channel like that with tongs
mainly because I, as an exasperated
viewer, would be inclined to burn the
furniture and the cars and stuff the oil
where Eastwood’s monkey probably
stuffed his nuts.
BY FAR the sharpest and most con-
venient angle of observation is hind-
sight, which makes it easy to pillory
Alan “Mumbles” Wilkie for his asinin-
ity the Friday after the storm had
washed Rose Bay into Sydney Harbor.
On TCN9, he told us, smiling confi-
dently, that the storms had definitely
gone a silly enough thing to say in
Perth in mid-winter, let alone in Sydney
in early summer. And sure enough
the following Sunday was hot and
steamy and still and yachtsmen,
cricketers and housewives knew that a
storm was on the way and WHAP!
Down came four or five hours of
buckets.
And Mumbles is the only pro-
fessional meteorologist of Sydney TV.
THEY RAN The Magnificent Seven yet
again. It is so old that the theme music
tends to make you wonder if tobacco
advertising is OK again. Despite the
ban, Marlboro is better-known than
Mexico. □


BOOKS
Unexpected,
delightful ways
through glass
By CEDRIC FLOWER
Stained Glass in Australia, by
Jenny Zimmer. Oxford University
Press, $4O.
“THROUGH the transparency, trans-
lucency, uneven textures and mar-
vellous color of stained-glass windows
the world beyond is transformed in
unexpected and delightful ways.” Few
would disagree with this statement by
the author that recalls magic moments
of childhood spent peering through the
amber and ruby sidelights of a Victorian
front door.
In this well-produced book with
more than 100 color plates, Jenny
Zimmer explores with style and en-
thusiasm the history of stained and
leadlight glass in Australia.
Australia in the late 19th century
experienced a prodigious amount of
building, including a host of parish
churches, cathedrals and public edifices
designed to include the rich decorative
effects of colored glass.
Major commissions proved a
bonanza for specialist firms in England
and Germany which supplied the
affluent colonies with a heritage of High
Victorian glass. These expensive embel-
lishments were made possible by private
donations with such surprising results
as a minor church in Adelaide able to
boast windows from the fabled Tiffany’s
of New York.
Some examples of English Late
Medieval glass in churches in Tasmania
and New South Wales may have been
useful to include for comparison and
there are rather more important
windows from the workshop of Morris
and Co than are noted in the text. The
Burne-Jones’ windows in the Saint
Barnabas Chapel on Norfolk Island
and his window in Newcastle Cathedral
are excellent examples of Pre-
Raphaelite design worth a mention.
But these are minor considerations
in a work which explores the whole
range of colored glass in Australia, from
the commendable effort of local
designers to compete for church and
civic commissions during the boom
years to the present-day state of the
craft.
Rather more interesting than the
proliferation of saints and allegorical
figures that seemed to grow more soppy
by the decade are the domestic leadlight
windows of the Post-Federation period
featuring local flora and fauna, along
with such Art Deco gems as the platypus
ceiling in the former Institute of An-
atomy in Canberra.
The final chapters are devoted to
those local artists and craftsmen who
are experimenting with ways to breathe
new life into an old tradition, marrying
abstract and semi-abstract images with
the seductive effects of light, color and
texture.
There is no lack of available talent
even if commissions on the scale of
Leonard French’s ceiling for the
Victorian National Gallery are few and
far between.
Zimmer’s book, apart from its value
as a historic survey, should provoke a
wider appreciation of imaginative con-
temporary approaches to a noble and
ancient craft. □

Bellow roars
back with
a collection
By ELIZABETH RIDDELL
Him with His Foot in His Mouth
and other stories, by Saul Bellow.
The Alison Press/Secker &
Warburg, $18.95
SOME OF Saul Bellow’s exuberance
was missing from his last novel, The
Dean’s December, probably because of
the nature of its subject. This caused
some to feel that he might be running
out of steam. They need not have
worried. This collection of three
novellas and two short stories has all the
old roar. Sometimes the noise sounds
like the protesting thunder of Bellow’s
big old subversive (in one way or
another) men before they die, because
the 70-year-old Chicago-style Jews who
dominate the stories have minds too
sharp and emotions too strong for their
degenerating though still solid flesh.
And one can say God help the wife,
lover or friend who has to put up with
them on a daily basis.
The men are called Shawmut,
Zetland, Wulpy, Ijah and Selbst. The
story which gives the collection its name
takes the form of a long discursive letter
of apology from Shawmut, sweating it
out in Vancouver awaiting extradition
to the United States on charges relating
to frauds perpetrated by his brother, to
a Miss Rose whom Shawmut insulted 40
years earlier as he walked on campus
with a friend. Shawmut’s story reminds
us that not all Jews come out on top in
business. They can be conned, like
anyone else usually by family and
friends.
The best story in the book is What
Kind of a Day did You Have? which is
about Chicago divorcee Katrina who is
the slave of her “celebrity” lover Victor
Wulpy, an art critic and critic of the
world. On a lecture tour of the eastern
seaboard, in the midst of a blizzard, he
commands her to Buffalo where he is
confronted at the airport by old enemy
Wrangel. Wrangel lives in California
where “they farm the kinks like they
farm Oranges and lettuce” but went east
for his enemy’s lecture.
Wulpy and Wrangel testily agree that
intellectuals are in shameless shape.
Expressing his belief in the malign
influence of “big money,” Victor says:
“The main money people despise the
intelligentsia, I mean especially those
fellows always suggesting to the en-
tertainment business how to deepen the
general catalepsy.” He has a theory that
society has collapsed into neurosis, an


era of play-acting has begun, vast re-
volutionary changes are concealed by
the triviality of the actors. “Clowns and
ham actors govern, or seem to.
Superficially it looks like farce but the
reality is anything but.”
The story ends with Victor safely at
his next lecture assignment (strings
having pulled private planes into and
out of Detroit, with limousines to meet
planes) and Katrina back in her sub-
urban deepfreeze discovering that her
children have hardly noticed her ab-
sence and that those people who know
where she has been simply think her a
fool.
The other rampaging old men are
not clones of Wulpy but ferociously
individual.
The one about whom we have still to
wonder is Zetland of the story called
Zetland: By a Character Witness.
Zetland is one of those clever people
who can keep taking things in but never
make a living dishing them out; in other
words, a perennial student.
Among them, the men whip up a few
instantaneous judgments such as: “I
refuse to overvalue the erotic life. I do
not believe that the path of truth must
pass through all the games of masturba-
tion and buggery.”
And this: “Most people know better
than to lack charm. Some are all charm,
like Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some
repudiate all charm, like Stalin. When
all-charm and no-charm met at Yalta,
no-charm won hands down.”
And: “It’s an exceptionally smart
man who is not marked forever by the
sexual theories he hears from his
father.” □

NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS
BOOK BULLETIN
Penguin is no bunny
by Patricia Rolfe
WHEN PENGUIN Books took over
Frederick Warne, publisher of Beatrix
Potter, there were little whimsies about
what happens when a Penguin takes
over a rabbit but when he paid out his
£6 million, Penguin head Peter Mayer
undoubtedly had an eye on the figures
on the bottom line rather than on Peter
Rabbit’s frolics at the bottom of the
garden.
The Beatrix Potter copyright was
Warne’s chief asset and it has 10 years
to run. Sales before the takeover were
around 100 million books worldwide
and Frederick Warne, established in
1865, had more than 100 licensed prod-
ucts based on the books.
According to Patricia Adam, market-
ing manager for Penguin children’s
books in this country, the publisher’s
first marketing step is a change in the
design and production of the list. The
basic format of the 23 little books will
remain with the Warne name but
printing and quality, by using the
original engravings, will be improved.
The American dustjackets will be used
and the books gradually will become
uniform in appearance worldwide.
Re-packaged editions will begin ap-
pearing here soon, The Complete Adven-
tures of Tom Kitten in December and
The Complete Adventures of Peter
Rabbit in March. The Jemima
Puddleduck pop-up book is being
prepared. Penguin began handling the
books here on July 1.
Penguin have begun looking at film
and video possibilities and expanding
merchandising. Even further into the
future is the development of Beatrix
Potter “theme parks.” These are the
brainwave of a former vice-president of
Walt Disney and may be opened in
Britain, the United States, Japan,
Canada and Australia.
Of more immediate interest to
devotees here is an exhibition of Potter
artwork to be held at Dromkeen, the
children’s literature centre at Riddell’s
Creek, Victoria. From February to
April, 50 pieces of art will be on show
there for the first time in Australia.
SMALL publisher Richard Griffin no
sooner gets one adventurous enterprise
(the latest, Brief Encounters, pieces by
Ron Saw with illustrations by Donald
Friend) out of the way than, with much
noisy flinging of caution to the wind, he
embarks on another. It is Art Available,
a quarterly devoted to new art books,
limited editions, prints and portfolios.
The first issue is just out. In it is news
of Griffin’s next book Art in a
Classless Society, Friend’s blast at the
art scene, illustrated with his pastiches
of well-known artists’ work. As well,
there are pieces on David Preston’s
Etchers’ Press and on Clifton Pugh
taking his nitric acid and plates out into
the bush to do some etching there.
ONE OF Australia’s most successful
enterprises is creating ghost towns,
places which spring up to serve some
industry often mining then return
to* the bush with amazing swiftness.
George Farwell’s book is the classic.
Now, Jeff Toghill has done Ghost Ports
of Australia (Macmillan $19.95). It
covers more than 40 ports, from Port
Arthur to Port Essington.
US PUBLISHER Morrow has found a
new way out of possible defamation
difficulties. It destroyed its first print of
25,000 copies of Splash of Colors: The
Self-Destruction of Braniff International
and American Airlines will foot the bill,
up to $150,000. In return, author John
Nance, a former Braniff pilot, has added
a paragraph to the reprint that no
charges were brought by federal
agencies against American and that a
civil suit against the airline’s president
was dismissed.
There is already one casualty among
publishers who have been dabbling in
expose books, covering ground usually
left to newspapers with their legal and
other resources. A small US publisher,
Richardson and Snyder, has had to
withdraw the 35,000 copies it printed of
God’s Broker and closed down the year-
old company. Author Antoni Gronowicz
claimed that he had spent 200 hours
with Pope John Paul II to get material
for the book but spent none at all.
Times Books have sent a biography
of the late Cardinal Spellman of New
York back to the author, asking for
proof of the assertion that the cardinal
was a homosexual.
ANGUS and Robertson rated one par-
agraph in the News Corporation chair-
man’s report: “Angus and Robertson,
the book publisher the company
acquired in 1981, maintained its dis-
tinguished reputation and enjoyed the
best profit in its 96-year history.” Nice
for Richard Walsh, even if it does sound
like a message carried in a cleft stick
from the remote colonies to the heart of
the world’s greatest empire. □

THE BULLETIN
ELECTION 84
n~page lift- out guides
The high popularity of Prime Minister Hawke and the
expanded parliament make this election one of
our most fascinating. This comprehensive report,
compiled by DEBORAH HOPE, studies the
odds, issues and the seats.
Labor odds on for the first time
NEXT WEEK’S federal election sees
Labor for the first time in its history
looking a certainty. The popularity of
Prime Minister Hawke, an improved
economic situation and the redistribu-
tion have all combined to give the
Liberal and National parties a
seemingly impossible task. It would
take a swing in the last 10 days of
between 5 and 6 percent in public
opinion for the improbable to happen.
Yet the pollsters, while varying a little in
their assessment of Labor’s lead, are as
one in not detecting any great volatility
in the electorate. Hawke and his govern-
ment have had a comfortable lead for
all their 20 months in office. For them to
lose it on the eve of this election would
almost need divine intervention.
In March last year Labor polled
some 49.5 percent of the vote and with
the preferences of the Australian
Democrats and minor party candidates
ended up with the support of 52.5
percent of the electorate. If this election
was being fought on the same bound-
aries as then, a Liberal gain of only 154
percent would be enough to regain
office. But the boundaries this time are
not the same. Labor on December 1 can
win with 50 percent. Removal of the
weighting that used to be given to rural
electorates has made this a very fair
election with the result that the coalition
needs a swing of 3.1 percent to win.
On the evidence of the polls so far,
the Liberal and National parties will
make no inroads at all. The indications
are that the swing will be towards
Labor, not away from it. My best guess
is that Labor will poll around 51 percent
of the national vote for the House of
Representatives and finish with a two-
part preferred figure around 55 percent
after distribution of Democrat and
minor party preferences.
On my calculations that makes the
most likely state of the new parliament
99 Labor and 49 Liberal and National.
A result of 121 for Labor and 27 Liberal
and Nationals is just as probable as
coalition victory by one about a 6
percent chance.
Of long-term significance from the
likely poor showing of the Liberals is
that there is unlikely to be any fresh
talent to mount the challenge for 1987.
With the increased size of the parlia-
ment, almost all sitting members have
managed to move themselves in the
safest seats. New faces will be hard to
find on the opposition benches.

From page 99
Among the departures could well be
National leader lan Sinclair. Using a
similar pricing formula to that with
which bookmakers make their market,
Sinclair at the moment is only a 51
percent chance of winning. So too is the
National Party in the Queensland seat
of Dawson.
Overall, however, the Nationals are
likely to fare better than their Liberal
colleagues. The most likely result is that
they will return to Canberra with 16
members a loss of two. The Liberals
at 33 would be down eight.
In the tables on page 110, a probabil-
ity is given about the likely result in
each of the 148 seats. The assumption
behind the figures includes Labor
polling better in Tasmania, NSW and
South Australia than in the other states.
In Tasmania at the last election there
was a pronounced swing against Labor
in the face of a national swing towards
it. With the Franklin Dam now settled
as a Federal political issue, Labor is
confident that its votes will rise by at
least 5 percent. Such a swing would
make it favorite in the seat of Denison
but variations of 2 or 3 percent either
way are common in elections within a
state. Hence the most likely result in
Tasmania is that Labor will pick up two
seats (or 1.93 seats to be precise).
In 1983 NSW was a disappointment
for Labor, the party doing worse in its
traditional heartland than it did in
Victoria. The indications are that this
time the situation will be reversed and
that Labor will pick up three seats in
NSW but only one in Victoria.
In South Australia where the polls
suggest a swing to Labor slightly higher
than the national average there will be a
difficulty in translating the extra votes
into an extra seat. In Western Australia,
Forrest and Tangney both see Labor as
favorite but the most likely result is that
they will only win one of them.
In Queensland, where a swing to
Labor below the national average is
probable, Labor must still be favored to
pick up at least two seats. No change is
likely in the ACT where Labor has two
of its safest seats. The Northern Terri-
tory is difficult to forecast because of the
absence of accurate polling. I’ve settled
for former Chief Minister Paul
Everingham as a 50/50 chance.
In the tables it should be noted that
figures for each seat have been taken to
the nearest whole number. Where it is
said that one party has a 100 percent
chance of winning what is really

AS THE Malcolm Mackerras pen-
dulum shows, the new Victorian seat of
Dunkley is the one to watch on
December 1.
On the basis of 1983 voting results,
Dunkley, which takes in Frankston,
Mount Eliza and Mornington, would
require a swing of 3.2 percent against
Labor the same figure the Liberals
need to win government. Before this
year’s redistribution the Liberals could
have won with a swing of just 2.3
percent.
Only two seats, Kooyong in Victoria
and Northern Territory are unchanged
after the redistribution, which added 23
seats, making a total of 148 in the House
of Representatives.
On the pendulum, Labor notionally
has 89 seats to the coalition’s 59,
compared with 75 and 50 in the present
house. This means a majority of 30 for
Labor, compared with 25 now. The
large number of marginal seats means
the Hawke government has an op-
portunity to increase its majority
significantly with a small swing. For
instance, the pendulum shows, a swing
of 1 percent would allow the govern-
ment to increase its majority to 42.
The redistribution has meant that
four seats held by Labor, Deakin, Petrie,
Tangney and Fadden are notionally
marginal Liberal seats.
The pendulum is based on 1983
voting results not on predictions.
Labor has no chance of controlling
the new 76-member Senate. As the
accompanying table shows, the new
Senate will be composed of 12 senators
from each state and two each from the
ACT and the Northern Territory.
In this election 46 senators will be
elected. This includes the 34 senators
who must face re-election and the 12
new seats being contested.
To control the Senate the ALP would
have to hold 39 positions. To do this it
must win four of the seven seats being
contested in five states and three in the
other. This is highly unlikely.
On the basis of the latest Morgan
Gallup poll, however, the coalition is
not guaranteed of securing three
senators in the six states either.
If this is the case at the election, the
seventh seat could be fought out be-
tween the ALP, the Democrats and, at
least in NSW and Victoria, the Nuclear
Disarmament Party. Whatever the out-
come, the strength of the Democrats will
be significantly boosted.

THE AUSTRALIAN Labor Party’s
hold on NSW should be increased
significantly on December 1. Following
this year’s redistribution and on the
basis of 1983 voting figures, Labor is set
to win 31 of the state’s 51 seats, with the
remainder divided between the Liberal
Party (12) and the National Party (8).
NSW made a net gain of eight new
seats in the redistribution, with the old
electorates of Paterson and Riverina
being abolished. Of the new seats, six
are safe for the ALP. These include
three new seats in Sydney’s west
Lindsay, Fowler and Greenway. The
others are Throsby (Mort) on the South
Coast, Charlton in the Newcastle area
and Dobell on the Central Coast.
The new seats of Parkes, extending
north-west through the state from
Forbes to the Queensland border, and
Page in the north-east of NSW look safe
for the National Party.
The most interesting contests among
the new seats should be fought out in
Riverina-Darling, a marginal Labor
seat (I.6pc) constructed from the
abolished Riverina electorate, and in
Gilmore, stretching from Nowra on the


South Coast through Goulburn to
Cowra in central NSW, with a Liberal
margin of just 0.4 percent.
Of the eight NSW country seats
being contested by both Liberal and
National parties, the contest in the
reshaped electorate of Hume between
National Party incumbent Stephen
Lusher and a former Education minister
in the Fraser Government, Wal Fife
(Lib), and present MP for Farrer,
should prove most interesting.
Labor’s two most marginal seats in
NSW are Macquarie, centred on the
Blue Mountains, and Eden-Monaro on
the far south coast. Macquarie, held at
present by the ALP’s Ross Free, was
transformed in the redistribution from a
relatively safe Labor seat to a very
marginal one. Free moved to Lindsay, a
new seat adjacent to Macquarie, with a
12.1 percent Labor margin.
Murray Sainsbury (Lib) is again
contesting Eden-Monaro, which he lost
to Jim Snow (Lab) in the 1983 general
election. Eden-Monaro was changed
considerably in the redistribution,
halving Labor’s margin there to around
1.0 percent.
The outcome in the southern Sydney
seat of Cook, held by Don Dobie (Lib),
should provide a gauge of Labor-Lib-
eral fortunes in NSW. The redistribu-
tion gave the Liberal Party an improved
margin in Cook of just 1.0 percent. This
is the only Sydney seat the Liberals
could lose.
National Party leader lan Sinclair’s
New England electorate remains a
marginal seat for the NP with a 2.8
percent margin, but is considered
slightly safer for the Nationals than
Cowper, on the NSW North Coast. The
NP member for Cowper, lan Robinson,
has moved to safer territory in the new
northern seat of Page, which has a

National margin of close to 5 percent.
Two Sydney seats that tend to swing,
Phillip in the east and Barton in the
south, were both made safer for Labor
in the redistribution, while a marginal
Liberal seat in Sydney’s north-west,
Dundas, has been made a safer seat for
the Liberal Party. The much examined
seat of Bennelong, held by former
Treasurer John Howard (Lib) since
1974, looks good for the Liberal Party
with a 4.9 percent margin. Another
marginal seat in Sydney, Lowe, should
stay with the ALP.
Seven Senate seats are being con-
tested on December 1. The first three on
Labor’s ticket Senators Kerry Sibraa
and Bruce Childs, and former union
official John Morris are certain of
election. Of the Liberal-National Party
ticket former senator Chris Puplick, NP
head in NSW David Brownhill and
former Liberal MP for Macarthur
Michael Baume should win places. The
seventh seat is expected to be fought out
between the ALP’s number four, Sue
West, and Australian Democrat Senator
John Mason. A wild card is Nuclear
Disarmament Party’s rock-star can-
didate Peter Garrett, lead singer from
Midnight Oil. The NDP has polled as
high as 8 percent nationally.

Moreton, 20. Oxley, 21. Petrie, 22. Rankin,
23. Ryan, 24. Wide Bay (NP).
AMONG THE Australian states,
Queensland invariably is a maverick in
federal elections. Regional issues will
play an important part in deciding
whether the north Queensland seats stay
Labor while in south-east Queensland,
and more particularly metropolitan
Brisbane, the National Party push
witnessed at last year’s state poll may
hold back the Hawke bandwagon.
The outcome, both in the House of
Representatives and in the Senate may
be further setbacks for the Liberal Party,
which in the Senate will be running its
own ticket.
This sort no doubt encouraged Lib-
eral senator Kathy Martin to run for the
seat of Moncrieff, created as a result of
rapid population growth at the northern
end of the Gold Coast.
Moncrieff looks an easy win for
Martin, the shadow minister for Home
Affairs and Administrative services. Her
do-or-die dash for Moncrieff makes it
the key Queensland seat to watch for
further signs of a Liberal Party decline
in the sunshine state.
On the 1983 results, the Liberals
should win six of the 24 Queensland
seats (up from 19 previously) with the
Nationals gaining seven and Labor in a
minority with 11.
However, the Queensland branch of
the National Party is making the
strongest claim for real gains. The
National Party now holds six seats in
Queensland. It believes, executive
director Col Walker told The Bulletin
last week, that it will win at least 10 and
perhaps 12 of the 24 House of
Representative seats.
While holding solid in the seats of
Kennedy, Maranoa, Groom, Wide Bay
and Dawson, the Nationals should have
no trouble winning Fairfax, a new seat
created from the break-up of the old
Fisher electorate. It should also win the
new Fisher electorate and is claiming it
will win the new, nominally Labor, seat
of Hinkler, based on Bundaberg.
The Nationals have also nominated
the finely marginal seat of Petrie, at
present held by Labor’s Deane Wells
being re-contested by former Liberal
Immigration minister, John Hodges
as a seat they will win.
Petrie will probably be the litmus
seat to watch, at least for south-east
Queensland, as early figures go up on
polling night.
Both the Nationals and the Liberals
are hoping to win the new Brisbane seat
of Forde, which should, on 1983 figures,
go to Labor’s Hamish Linacre on a 2.6
percent margin.
In North Queensland and in the


Queensland coastal cities the Nationals
have been belting the Hawke govern-
ment hard over its unwillingness to
underpin two major industries:
shipbuilding in Cairns and the sugar
industry.
Labor’s John Gayler captured
Leichhardt from the Nationals last year,
but would lose it on a 2.8 swing. Linked
with Gayler’s future is that of fellow
ALP member Eamon (Ted) Lindsay in
adjoining Herbert, centred on
Townsville. Lindsay’s margin is even
finer, at 2.7 percent.
Nonetheless, the prime minister
devoted considerable attention to the
two electorates early in the campaign
and the two seats may hold for Labor.
Former state opposition leader Keith
Wright, should easily make the transi-
tion into the federal arena in the
Rockhampton-based seat of Capri-
cornia where Labor has a 7.9 percent
margin.
It is in the Senate that the
Queensland vote may spell gloom for
Labor. Of the seven seats, Labor is
likely to win only three although Hawke
needs four to overcome the anti-Labor
majority there.
The Nationals say they will win three
Senate spots, which is overly hopeful,
but they may, with the Liberals, secure
three spots for the coalition with the
remaining spot being fought out be-
tween the three major parties, the
Australian Democrats and the NDP.
Unless the Nationals suffer a last-
minute reverse the election will see the
return to the Senate of Dr Glenister
Sheil, their number two candidate, after
a period in the wilderness following his
failure to wrest McPherson from the
Liberals.
Sheil holds a place in Australian
history as the shortest serving minister
following his dismissal by Malcolm
Fraser for comments supporting
apartheid in South Africa.
DENIS REINHARDT
The territories
THE Northern Territory and the ACT
made no gains in representation in the
national redistribution.
However, a tough and interesting
battle should be fought out on
December l over the Territory’s single
House of Representatives seat between
sitting Labor member John Reeves and
former NT Chief Minister Paul
Everingham (Country Liberal Party).
Labor at present holds a 2 percent
margin in Northern Territory, but it is a
swinging seat. Reeves won it from the
NP’s Grant Tambling in 1983. Both
candidates are confident of winning,
with Reeves hoping the advantage for
incumbents and popularity of Prime

Minister Hawke will carry him through
as winner.
No surprises are anticipated in the
ballot for the two Northern Territory
Senate seats, in which sitting Senators,
Ted Robertson (Lab) and Bernie
KilgarifF (Lib), are expected to be
returned.
The ALP is expected to hold easily
the ACT’s two safe Labor seats, Fraser
and Canberra. Ros Kelly has held
Canberra since 1980, converting it from
a marginal Liberal seat to a safe Labor
seat. Liberal Party candidate Gary
Humphries, a solicitor, is not expected
to make much inroad into Kelly’s 14
percent margin. However, she could
lose some votes to Robyn Hancock, a
student and candidate for the Nuclear
Disarmament Party.
In Fraser, John Langmore (Lab) will
replace Ken Fry (Lab), who is retiring
after 10 years in parliament. Langmore
will not face an NDP candidate because
he is deemed to have a record of voting
anti-nuclear. The Deadly Serious Party
and the Democrats are contesting both
seats.
Sitting ACT Senators Susan Ryan,
Education minister, and Margaret Reid
(Lib) are expected to hold their seats,
despite a probable strong showing from
the Democrats and the Nuclear Dis-
armament teams.
Western Australia
TANGNEY, Forrest and O’Connor are
the seats to watch in Western Australia
on December 1. Western Australia
gained two seats in the redistribution
Cowan, part of the mortgage belt in
Perth’s northern suburbs, and Brand,
stretching from Perth’s south to the
outskirts of Bunbury. Both are fairly
safe for Labor.
Tangney, however, won by Labor’s
George Gear in 1983, has become a
marginal Liberal seat. According to the
Mackerras pendulum the Liberal Party
holds a 1.4 percent margin in Tangney.
Peter Shack (Lib) who held the seat
from 1977-83 is again contesting the
seat. Gear has moved to safer ground in
Canning, leaving ALP candidate David
Dale, a scientific consultant, to fight for
Tangney. Wendy Fatin, sitting Labor
member for Canning, has shifted to the
new safer seat of Brand.
Forrest, held by Liberal Peter
Drummond since 1972, is Western
Australia’s most marginal seat, with a
Liberal margin of 0.6 percent. The slight
swing to Labor expected in WA could
nudge this seat to ALP candidate Peter
Holland, an ABC television announcer.
On paper O’Connor in WA’s wheat
belt, looks safe for the Liberal Party’s
sitting member Wilson Tuckey, who
holds the seat with a 14.1 percent

margin. However, O’Connor is the only
seat in the west where the National
Party is fielding a candidate and the
ALP has decided to direct its pre-
ferences his way. This could cause an
upset for Tuckey, who has held the seat
since 1980.
The Nuclear Disarmament Party is
fielding only one candidate in the elec-
tion David Nourish who will
contest the massive western desert seat
of Kalgoorlie, held since 1980 by
Labor’s Graeme Campbell. Labor has a
9.9 percent margin in the seat. Nourish
and Liberal candidate Douglas Krepp
have little chance of shifting Campbell.
As a result of the redistribution
Labor is certain of at least nine of the
state’s 13 House of Representatives
seats, compared with eight in the pre-
sent parliament. The ALP won 54 per-
cent of the two party preferred vote in
1983 and hopes for a slight improve-
ment of around one percent on
December 1.
In the Senate, the seven seats should
divide up with three each going to the
ALP and the Liberal party, with the
seventh being fought out between Labor
and the Australian Democrats.

39. Wills.
IN VICTORIA, eight metropolitan
seats are at risk to swings of 4 percent or
less and the Liberals hold four of them.
Deakin, a newly created eastern sub-
urban electorate, is certain to attract the
most interest. The Liberal candidate is
Julian Beale, the persuasive en-
trepreneur behind Moonie Oil. Labor is
running Richard Johns, economist and
former private secretary to John Button.
A swing of only 0.2 percent would see it
go to Johns.
A swing of 0.3 percent would see the
adjoining Bruce go to Labor’s Joan
Graystone over sitting Liberal Ken
Aldred.
Pete Steedman won Casey for Labor
in 1983, but he suffered by the re-
distribution. Rob Halverson needs only
a 0.2 percent swing to beat him.
Peter Reith, the Liberal who won Sir
Phillip Lynch’s seat of Flinders at the
by-election following his resignation,
but lost it in 1983 before entering
parliament, is standing again. His Labor
opponent is Russell Joiner, a Cain
government ministerial adviser who
would have to suffer a 0.9 percent swing


to lose. Another close metropolitian seat
is Chisholm, held by Labor’s Helen
Mayer. Liberal Graham Harris requires
a 2.6 percent swing.
The new seat of Menzies is largely
constructed from the former swinging
seat of Diamond Valley. Two former
Diamond Valley members, Neil Brown,
a former Fraser government minister,
and David McKenzie, an “It’s Time”
1972 winner, are at it again. Brown
would have to suffer a swing in Menzies
of 3.2 percent to lose it.
Goldstein is held by former Fraser
government minister lan Macphee, who
would fall to a swing of 3.2 percent.
Complicating matters are the Nationals,
since Goldstein is one of the nine
metropolitan seats in which the
Nationals are fielding candidates for the
first time.
Dunkley has been called the “litmus
seat” of the election, since, if the 3.2
percent swing the Liberals need to take
it were uniform throughout the nation,
the government would fall. Labor
member Bob Chynoweth is matched
against the Liberals’ Leonie Clark.
Mixed rural Labor seats vulnerable
to swings of 4 percent or less include
Bendigo and Ballarat, where the Lib-
erals require swings of 2.1 and 2.4
percent respectively, and McEwen,
where the margin is 2.6 percent.
McEwen seems more vulnerable for
Labor than either Bendigo or Ballarat.
The Nationals are running a well-
known local, John Brewster, against
former Hamer government minister,
Brian Dixon, and the result may be
decided on preferences.
The only rural seat within the 4
percent swing range held by the Liberals
is Corangamite, where Labor’s Gavan
O’Connor is matched against the Lib-
erals’ Stuart McArthur. O’Connor needs
a 3.7 swing to win.
So, four mixed rural or rural seats
are in the 4 percent swing range and
Labor is vulnerable in three of them.
Almost in this category is Burke, which
Labor’s Neil O’Keefe would lose on a
4.3 percent swing. Burke lost its solid
Labor industrial area with the re-dis-
tribution.
The Liberals need 7.4 and 7.6 percent
swings to take the southern metro-
politan seats of Isaacs and Henty from
sitting members David Charles and
Joan Child. These two seem set for
further terms, as does the Liberals’
Roger Shipton in Higgins (which in-
cludes Toorak, Malvern and Cam-
berwell) buffered by a margin of 8.9
percent. Safest of all the Liberal
metropolitan seats is Kooyong. Andrew
Peacock would have to suffer a 9.3
percent swing to lose.
Labor’s Lou Kent, in the south-east
Springvale area electorate of Hotham
should go back to Canberra, as should
Labor’s Peter Staples, who has
transferred from the old Diamond
Valley area to the new Bundoora seat of
Jagajaga, where he is safe by 10.5
percent.
Thirty-six candidates have nomi-
nated for the seven Victorian Senate
vacancies. The Labor ticket consists of
Olive Zakharov, Robert Ray, Barnie
Cooney and Carole Marple. The first
three seem assured of victory, but the
fourth spot, after a three-cornered
struggle between Marple, the
Democrats’ John Siddons and Jean
Melzer, of the Nuclear Disarmament
Party, may on preferences go to
Siddons. The coalition has Alan Missen
and David Hamer heading its ticket,
and the National’s Shirley McKerrow
and the Liberals’ Jim Short will compete
for the third coalition spot.

South Australia
THE SEAT of Sturt in Adelaide should
be the key seat in South Australia on
December 1.
The Liberal Party’s lan Wilson, a
former Fraser Government minister,
holds the seat by 3.4 percent. Nestled in
Adelaide’s affluent eastern suburbs,
Labor candidate Jim Gale, an English
lecturer, faces a tough test in Sturt.
Although an outside chance for the
ALP, it is the only seat in the state that
could change hands.
Two new seats were added to South
Australia in the redistribution Makin,
a safe Labor seat in Adelaide’s north-
east, and Mayo, a safe Liberal seat to
the city’s south-west, former South
Australian Attorney-General Peter
Duncan (Lab) will take Makin while the
Liberal Party’s Alexander Downer is
expected to win Mayo.
The additional seats mean a tally of
13, with eight for the ALP and five for
the Liberal Party.
Two other marginal Adelaide seats,
Kingston, held by Gordon Bilney and
Hawker, held by Ralph Jacobi are
expected to stay with the ALP. A fourth
marginal seat, Grey, covering the vast
west of the state and including in-
dustrial centres Whyalla and Port Pirie,
is expected to stay with sitting Labor
member Lloyd O’Neil. The Liberal can-
didate Russell Reid would need a 6.5
percent swing to win Grey.
A more interesting contest could be
witnessed over the seventh senate seat.
Labor’s top three senate candidates
Senators Nick Bolkus, Graham Mag-
uire and Rosemary Crowley are
certain of re-election, as are almost
certainly the Liberal Party’s top three,
Senators Baden Teague, Don Jessop
and newcomer Amanda Vanstone. The
seventh seat is expected to be contested
between Vic Heron, state ALP president
and secretary of the Miscellaneous
Workers Union, and Australian
Democrat David Vigor.
Tasmania
Legend: 1. Bass, 2. Braddon, 3. Denison, 4.
Franklin, 5. Lyons.
AFTER NEARLY 10 years in the
political wilderness in Tasmania, the
ALP has a chance of a comeback in this
election. Despite a paper margin favor-
ing the Liberal Party in each of the
state’s five seats, there is a very different
atmosphere prevailing in Tasmania to
1975 when Labor was knocked out of
the state in the anti-Whitlam and 1983
when the issue there was the ALP
opposition to the Franklin Dam.
In March 1983 Labor’s vote fell by
more than 4 percent to just under 43
percent. It hopes the settlement of
compensation for the dam and the
popularity of Prime Minister Bob
Hawke will result in gains of at least 5
percent. Particularly at risk for the
Liberals are the seats of Braddon and
Bass, where sitting members and former
Fraser government ministers Kevin
Newman (Bass) and Ray Groom
(Braddon) are retiring.
Although he holds the smallest
margin of all (3.6 percent), former
Liberal Immigration minister Michael
Hodgman is expected to be re-elected to
Denison, the essentially Liberal
electorate covering Hobart, which he
won from the ALP in 1975.
Lyons (previously Wilmot) was ex-
tended in the redistribution to take in
Tasmania’s west coast, a factor which
should make sitting Liberal Max Burr
almost certain of holding his seat.
The Launceston seat of Bass could
go to Labor. Newman won the seat
from the ALP in 1975 after one of the
most disastrous by-elections in Labor’s
history. Before that the seat had been
held by Labor’s Lance Barnard for
more than 20 years. The new Liberal
candidate, Warwick Smith, a solicitor,
faces Vicky Buchanan number four
on the ALP senate team in 1983.
The ALP is encouraged by its private
polls in Franklin, which Liberal Bruce
Goodluck holds with a 6 percent
margin. However, a tough contest is
expected against Labor candidate John
Devereux, state secretary and national
president of the Electrical Trades
Union, with Goodluck favored to win.
Despite the large Liberal margin
(10.1 percent) in Braddon, in
Tasmania’s north-west, both parties are
treating the seat as marginal.
The first six senate seats in Tasmania
are expected to fall three Labor, three
Liberal with a difficult contest over the
seventh seat, with the odds falling on
Kath Venn, of the Brian Harradine
group. Venn is a former secretary of the
Tasmanian Labor Party. □


From page 101
meant is that the opposition party has
something less than a half a percent
chance of winning. The forecast result
in each state has been obtained by
adding up the individual seat probabili-
ties a 90 percent chance translating to
0.9 of a seat.

'lf you fly out that night, you’ll avoid
a shour wait in Bahrain’
\
That advice
from ANZ Travel
certainly made
my trip a
lot easier.
You see, I knew the European Sales
Seminar was due to end Thursday
afternoon. So I thought - ‘Til stay put
Thursday night, get a good rest
and fly to Asia next day” Good idea?
Wrong! If I’d stayed on that night,
instead of getting my rest and relax-
ation in a comfortable hotel in
Jakarta, I’d have spent five hours the
following day contemplating the
transit lounge in Bahrain. And I didn’t
need that.
Obviously I’d put more thought
into my business commitments than
into my travel arrangements.
What a relief to find that my ANZ
Business Travel consultant made it
his first priority to get me wherever
I had to be in the quickest and most
convenient way

BATMAN’S MELBOURNE
A roller-coaster ride with Xavier
FRIENDSHIP with Xavier Herbert
was like riding one of those dangerous
mechanical broncos wildly exhilarat-
ing but you could be tossed on your
neck at any second.
He would write long letters in a
minute, careful hand not matey,
newsy letters but loaded with comment,
introspective and often accusing.
One day he wrote me a 12-page
letter, Herbert the crown prosecutor. It
dissected me brilliantly, brain cell by
cell. It was 99 percent true, spotlighting
my every innermost fear and in-
adequacy. He scourged me for lack of
guts, lack of talent, for meekly subject-
ing myself to the will of second-rate
journals.
On, on it went. I read it sick in the
stomach with tears in my eyes and it
took a week to get over the shock. At
first I thought I wouldn’t answer, would
never speak to him again. But after 10
days, still seething, I wrote back. How
dare he set himself as judge, execu-
tioner, supreme arbiter of my life!
The next letter came by return mail:
“Hello. Don’t worry about that letter. I
was just testing you out to see whether
you could take it.” Later, Robert
Roseman who had the awesome task of
editing Poor Fellow My Country for
Collins, said the author had done exact-
ly the same thing to him. Indeed, it was
a regular Herbert ploy.
I first met Herbert in the winter of
1972. I had heard that he was writing an
extraordinary book, that he had been on
it for seven years and that it was on the
point of completion. He was living at
Redlynch, in a tiny wooden cottage
north of Cairns.
The first task was to get past Sadie,
his little white-haired wife. She guarded
him like an alsatian and only after I had
passed all the tests, proving that I was a
genuine admirer, did she agree to let me
see him at 11 am the next day while he
was doing his exercises.
Indeed, next day, there he was
grey hair, neatly clipped moustache,
sun-tanned and very erect.
He could have been a retired colonel
and, but for the sandshoes, bare legs
and shorts yes he could even have
been Lord Casey.
He called himself “Old Horrible”
and his book was “The Octopus.” He
was the perfect eccentric. He trained by
punching a huge boxing bag. He jogged
by measuring out an exact distance
through the canefields and the distance
he covered was kept in a log. Oh, he
kept a log of everything. He planned his
day on a 24-hour clock. He went to bed
at 7.30 pm, setting an extraordinary
Heath Robinson gadget. It was a
gramophone fitted with studs that gave
off a strange rhythmical scraping noise.
He said this curious gadget blotted out
the noise of cars on the highway.
“I sleep,” he said, “until my body
tells me I have had enough. That may be
between midnight and 2 am. Then I get
up to start work.”
He had a little shed out the back and
his working spot was a deck chair by a
low table. He typed on the oldest
Remington portable I have seen. It was
one of those with the long pop-up keys.
Everything from Capricornia to Poor
Fellow My Country was typed on that.
He bought it in 1927. Never did it have
an overhaul and the unfortunate thing
typed millions of words.
I just could not believe that a great
work was created this way. “How many
copies do you have?” I asked. _
“Only one,” he replied.
“But what would happen if there
were a fire out here and it was
destroyed?”
“My God, I’d hang myself. Sadie
used to cart it off and put it in a safe
deposit at the bank but that became too
inconvenient. I’ll show you what I’ve
done.”
He had taken an old gas stove and
lined it with fibreglass so that, in-
geniously, the whole thing was
fireproof. On the front of the stove was
still a little temperature gauge. He
opened the stove as if about to cook the
week-end roast and there was the man-
uscript on the stove racks, pile after pile
of quarto paper, filling the entire space.
He was having trouble then in
finding a publisher. He had only to
mention the size of the thing and they
tended to flee. Of course, his contempt
for publishers was awesome. They were
all thieves, rogues, parasites, trying to
do the writer down.
As for critics and journalists, he had
no time for any of them. “I never read
reviews of my books,” he said. “For
some people, pissing on things bigger
than themselves is as compulsive as for
puppy dogs.”
I didn’t see him again for two years.
He was about to leave for Sydney and
he had the book all packed in a suitcase.
There was a certain amount of terror
about the plane journey. Should he have
a parachute not for him but for Poor
Fellow My Country?
Xavier Herbert at his Redlynch retreat in north
He looked thin and pale and he had
been out of action for nine months. He
explained: “After I finished the man-
uscript I was very ill indeed. A complete
collapse. After nine years’ work, I
suppose it was to be expected. When I
write, the adrenalin starts to move.
What I am writing excites me to such an
extent that if I look in the mirror I can
see that my face is flushed and I actually
get tingling in the fingers. If that
happens every night for nine years,
something has to give.”
Ken Wilder* who has just retired as
managing director of Collins,
remembers the day Herbert arrived in
his office. The manuscript was two
metres high, half as long again as War
and Peace, as big as the Old Testament
and the New Testament combined.
“I was terrified, absolutely terrified,”
Wilder said. “We wanted to do it in
three volumes. He insisted on one, all or
nothing. It was the biggest single
challenge of my career.”
The day they signed the contract was
quite something: “He came in with his
agent, Tim Curnow, of Curtis Brown.
The contract was produced. He signed
it. I signed it. Not one word was spoken
and out they went. I was stunned. It
seemed incredibly rude.
“Five minutes later, the lift doors
opened. He walked into my office. Put
his arms around me and gave me a great


Queensland
Gallic kiss on both cheeks. Tears were
running down his cheeks. Again he left
without a word.”
Of course, it was not easy. He did not
want a line, a word of his manuscript
changed. Every change was a skirmish
akin to the Battle of Waterloo, accord-
ing to Wilder. But he had no doubts
about Herbert: “When you were with
him, you always knew you were in the
company of a genius.”
Roseman had the terrifying job of
editing the huge manuscript. At times,
he was driven to such desperation as to
be tempted to tell Herbert to keep his
book. “There were parts of it,” said
Roseman, “which just didn’t make
sense. He had to be talked into altering
them. He had public figures with their
titles wrong or a governor-general with
his name spelled incorrectly. For a start,
he wanted them just like that: It il-
lustrated his utter contempt for them.
But we had to explain that, as
publishers, we couldn’t accept
responsibility for sending a book out
like that.
“There were times when he just
wouldn’t discuss things or see me for
days on end. If he hadn’t been such a
fascinating man, I couldn’t have put up
with it.”
Probably nobody has studied Poor
Fellow My Country more than Roseman,
so what did he think of it?
“He was a great writer, a great story-
teller, a great social historian and an
appalling novelist. He wasn’t a good
novelist because he didn’t understand
characters. His characters were always
moralising, spouting convoluted
theories. But the final tapestry was
spectacular and we had no doubt the
whole thing was worth publishing, warts
and all.”
The battered manuscript was a mess.
It had to be re-typed and this took seven
weeks. A poor girl at Collins worked
there daily, dawn to dark, type, type,
type. Xavier was there to advise. He was
living at Kings Cross and every day he
ran to the office in Clarence Street,
arriving hot and sweaty. Thereupon he
lay down beside a desk and slept for an
hour.
He would not take sugar in his
coffee; he brought his own honey. Nor
would he go out to lunch; he preferred
mashed banana and bran.
The final work went off to be set in
Hong Kong. “It was too big. We
couldn’t afford to do it in Australia,”
said Wilder. “The ironic thing was, it
was set by two Chinese operators who
couldn’t speak a word of English. But it
was incredible. Their work was so clean
they made barely a mistake.”
Of course, it was a success the
greatest Collins publishing triumph in a
decade and they sold 34,000 copies in
hardback and 45,000 soft covers.
"Naturally,” Wilder said, “I wanted to
submit it for the Miles Franklin award.
And he refused. He was absolutely
against what he called 'the Aust. Lit.
establishment.’
“But Sadie said not to take any
notice of him: ‘Go ahead and submit the
book. He’ll only pretend to be angry.’
“And, of course, it won. Xavier,
obviously, was delighted but he put on a
great turn.
“At the presentation there was a big
crowd including a bevy of knights, plus
a full line-up of press and television. I
don’t think he could resist it.”
Herbert, receiving the award, said
such occasions made him sick; he
should never have accepted the award.
He called the chairman a silly old fool
and referred to all the ‘bunyip knights.’
Wilder remembers it as absolutely
vintage Herbert.
Sadie died in 1979 and Herbert went
to pieces. Roseman would call him up
and he would tell Roseman not to
invade his privacy. Two years passed
before he started to come out of it.
Wilder continued to see him. Herbert,
Wilder said, suffered terribly from
arthritis. His hands became all gnarled
and lumpy so that he could not even
hold a pencil. Then he had joint
replacements on both knees.
“He was a real bushie. He endured
all this without complaint,” Wilder said.
Herbert gave away his house and all
he had at Redlynch and went to live in a
caravan out of Alice Springs. Wilder
had been writing to him about a new
work, Billygoat Hill, and Herbert
seemed excited about it. Another
Capricornia, another Soldiers’ Womenl
“No, no,” Wilder said. “I can’t shed
any light on it. He was funny that way.
He was never a person to discuss a work
in progress.”
Herbert was lonely at the finish. He
was not the same without Sadie. It was a
grief that he had no children. He said
many times, both personally and by
letter: “I would like to die cere-
moniously, like an Aboriginal. I won’t
let Svenson (the local undertaker) get
me. I don’t want to lie in a cemetery
with all those strangers about. I intend
to die in the wilderness somewhere, if I
can find any, if it lasts long enough. I’ll
know when my time has come and I’ll
go into a cave or something. Then I’ll
dynamite the opening. It will be my
tomb and no one will find it.” The end
was not like that. But almost. □

management.
EFI now managed by EEC 4 Micro Computer.
When Ford put the EEC 4 (Electronic
Engine Control) on-board computer in
charge of its 4.1 litre EFI power plant it got
some astounding results. The kind of results
businessmen really want from computers.
EEC 4 makes cars fitted with it more powerful
and responsive. When a situation
calls for a bit extra, the car
responds instantly.
And it makes the engine run
more smoothly and more efficiently
to provide better fuel economy.
How does it do it?
By being able to adjust the
timing of every spark, the car’s
piston can deliver the designed
power output.
And by sensing conditions
such as engine temperature, outside
temperature, degree of acceleration
and a lot more, the EEC 4 can
calculate the exact spark timing
required, along with the correct
air/fuel mixture.
There’s more.
This new efficiency alone might have been
considered to have been quite a breakthrough. But
like a business computer, the information gathered
by EEC 4 and its sensors, was found to be very
useful in other areas of engine management.
And Ford has put this information to good

use. EEC4’s sensors for engine and outside temperature
allow it to automatically adjust for cold starts and cold
running. 'You don’t have to wait for the engine to warm up
to get a good start to the day.
And on warm days when you turn the air conditioner
on, it compensates for the increased load on the engine.
Stays in tune longer.
Detuning happens as a result of
coke build-up in the combustion
chamber. EEC4’s more efficient spark
timing and improved combustion means
less coke build-up. Therefore your engine
stays more in tune, longer.
Easy Service.
Then, come service time, your Ford
dealer can run a simple test to ensure
everything EEC 4 controls is running
smoothly.

Ford is now into its fourth

THE WORLD
A modern man poised at the
edge of Kremlin power
Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachov is a modern, well educated man waiting to
take the reins ofpower from the genontocracy that rules the USSR. A special
correspondent tells what this may mean to the west.
SOVIET POLITBURO member
Mikhail Gorbachov, who is as close as
possible to being number two in the
Soviet Communist Party, represents a
new generation of leaders. Gorbachov,
a strong candidate to succeed the 73-
year-old President Konstantin Cher-
nenko, comes from a group far better
educated than were the Brezhnevs and
the Kruschevs and less likely to have a
chip on the shoulder when dealing with
the outside world.
The announcement that he is to head
a Soviet parliamentary delegation to
London next month has touched off an
unusual flutter of interest there, par-
ticularly in view of the increasing
reports of illness afflicting key figures in
the Soviet leadership.
Gorbachov was barely in his teens
when the Red Army cut up Hitler’s
wehrmacht and laid the foundations for
the Soviet claim to superpower status.
His youth was punctuated with tri-
umphs of Soviet power the Soviet
atom bomb, the Soviet hydrogen bomb,
the first Sputnik satellite which
overnight knocked the complacency out
of an America that had believed itself
infinitely more advanced.
This is a man whose career has co-
incided with a growth of Russian power
undreamed of by the czars or even by
Stalin. It is not unrealistic to suppose
that it has bred in him a maturity and
sense of responsibility that was denied
to earlier generations in the communist
Kremlin who felt that they had only
survived by a whisker.
Little in Gorbachov’s
appearance marks him out
as a new Kremlin man. He
is burly, with far-gone
baldness revealing a birth-
mark which runs back
from the top of his
forehead (it is airbrushed
out in official photo-
graphs). On public occa-
sions, he wears the same
dark suits, overcoats and
soft hats with the brim
turned up all round that his
CAMERA PRESS (POLY-PRESS)
colleagues do. He looks what he is the
offspring of Russian peasants.
But, particularly since the death of
Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 when he
emerged as right-hand man and confi-
dant of new leader Yuri Andropov,
Gorbachov has been very generally
perceived in Moscow as the man on
whom you pin your hopes if you want
change in Soviet society.
His comparative youth
he is younger than
Chernenko by 20 years
has something but not all
to do with it. Public
statements are certainly
not the reason. Unlike
most of his politburo col-
leagues, Gorbachov has
not published a collection
of his speeches perhaps
for the good reason that
they would remind
everyone of how limited
his experience at the top has been. Until
Brezhnev’s death, Gorbachov was
running the country’s farms and you
don’t attract attention even in Moscow
with speeches on sugar beet and com-
bine harvesters.
The feeling that Gorbachov is sym-
pathetic to new ideas and change has
been built up by gossip, some of it very
likely inaccurate, and by more informed
talk that has leaked out of the one place
where real politics are conducted in the
Soviet Union the central committee.
The impression has emerged
cloudily, perhaps, but no less corn-
pellingly for that - that
Gorbachov is a man who
wants to get the Soviet
Union moving.
Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachov (accent on the
last syllable) was born on
March 2, 1931, in the
village of Privolnoye in the
Stavropol region, which is
rich farming land north of
the Caucasus mountains.
According to his official
biography, he began farm
CAMERA PRESS (NOV/MO)
work while still at school. Then, in 1950,
aged 19, he made the dramatic jump to
Moscow University where he joined the
Law faculty. He is the only Moscow
University graduate in the present
leadership and its only trained lawyer,
too. (Most of the politburo had at best a
higher technical education.) This has
added to his standing among educated
party members and the in-
telligentsia as a whole.
Gorbachov was at un-
iversity at a peculiarly in-
teresting and difficult time.
Stalin died in 1953 and his
death and the pressures
and discontent it released
were to find authoritative
expression in Kruschev’s
secret speech attacking the
old dictator, delivered in
1956. Russians who knew
or knew of Gorbachov at
university say he was criti-
cal of Stalin’s crimes even before
Kruschev’s speech. Nevertheless, the
record shows that he was an active
Komsomol youth organiser at univers-
ity, joined the party one year before
Stalin’s death and returned to Stavropol
on graduation to party not legal
work.
The odd and potentially damaging
thing about Gorbachov’s career is its
lack of diversity. He worked in the
Stavropol party machine from 1956 to
1978, ending up as the region’s boss
when only 39. Although he scored eye-
catching successes in farming, he does
not seem to have made any vivid mark
as a leader. One Russian with an
unusual knowledge of Soviet politics
has argued that Gorbachov has yet to
show in his career the toughness, the
“killer instinct,” needed to get to and
stay at the very top. (A rival for the
leadership, Grigori Romanov, the ex-
Leningrad leader who supervises the
defence industry, seems by contrast a
most lethal politician.)
Perhaps Gorbachov did not even
really have to fight his way to power in
Moscow. Fyodor Kulakov, the party


Mikhail Gorbagbov: at 53.2 young man for Soviet leadership
CAMERA PRESS (TS/RBO)
secretary running agriculture, died in
1978 and Gorbachov was picked to
replace him. Kulakov was an ex-
Stavropol man. So was the powerful
Mikhail Suslov, keeper of the Kremlin’s
ideological treasures. Suslov may have
wanted his own protege to balance
Brezhnev’s men. In any case, the job
was as dangerous as it was enticing.
Farming was the country’s Achilles’
heel. Significantly, there had been talk
that a desperate Kulakov had suggested
radical changes provoking an almighty
row in the politburo and the heart
attack that killed him.
In the event, Gorbachov managed a
program of massive farm investment
sponsored personally by Brezhnev that
brought some but not sufficient results.
Gorbachov pushed some new ideas,
such as giving a group of workers full
responsibility for an area of land and
rewarding them by results. The thrust
was significant to increase the
peasant’s tie to the land, a tie that Stalin
labored mightily to cut. But neither this
nor any other experiment has worked
magic.
What did work magic for Gorbachov
was the short rule of Andropov. This
clever, tough-minded and
austere communist found
in Gorbachov the ideal
right-hand man in his
effort to clean up the murk
and muddle left by
Brezhnev. Gorbachov saw
to the details of
Andropov’s campaign
(frustrated by the latter’s
illness) to purge the party
and government
leadership. As Andropov
weakened, Gorbachov
Yuri Andropov
CAMERA PRESS (TS/RBO)
stood in for him, liaising between the
sick-room and the politburo.
There is no unchallengeable evi-
dence that Andropov believed that
Gorbachov should succeed him. But
many party members who supported
Andropov hoped that Gorbachov
would and did not hide their disap-
pointment when he did not.
He was the sort of leader of whom
they could be proud: educated, with a
strikingly good-looking wife and both
of them genuinely cultured even to the
point of going to the Bolshoi for
pleasure.
Gorbachov had been more visible
under Andropov. He had led a par-
liamentary delegation to Canada where
he handled tough questions coolly and
lucidly (though in no way giving un-
expected answers).
In rare encounters with foreign dip-
lomats, he had impressed both by his
knowledge and his courtesy.
Gorbachov has almost certainly sur-
rendered his agricultural brief (surely
with a relieved sigh) and now oversees
the economy generally, as well as the
party and key appointments. He is
gathering the experience which older
politburo members, such as Foreign
minister Andrei Gromyko and the
sickly Defence minister Marshal
Dimitri Ustinov, thought he lacked at
Andropov’s death. He is also in a
position to build up his strength against
younger rivals, notably the abrasive
(and, in some intellectual quarters,
feared) Romanov.
It is already being put about that
Gorbachov is soliciting all sorts of new
ideas to get both Soviet economy and
society moving again. And this is
significant, for few intelligent Russians
doubt that their country has reached a
point where the old methods no longer
work and that new ones not only
economic experiments but social and
political ones needed to support them
must be found if the country is not to
remain in outmoded isolation.
The hopes for this kind of change,
which might slowly modify the world’s
perception of the Soviet Union, have
been pinned on this clever farmer’s boy
from the rich black earth grainlands.
They may be misplaced. Gorbachov
may be more apparatchik
than apostle of change. Or,
as some fear, he may lack
the cutting edge to win the
battle to succeed
Chernenko.
However, it remains a
matter of interest to us all
that the Soviet Union
should have at least a
potential leader waiting in
the wings who has become
the repository of hopes of
this kind. □


BRITAIN
Calls to quit
UNESCO
grow stronger
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow: critics liken him to J. Edgar Hoover
By SANDRA JOBSON
WILL BRITAIN withdraw from
UNESCO? As America’s deadline to
leave the ball (midnight on December
31) approaches ever closer, debate in
the UK press and in parliament over
Britain’s intention is hotting-up.
While certain Tory MPs, known to
think along Margaret Thatcher’s lines
about the profligate spending and over-
staffed bureaucracy, not to mention
communist bias, of UNESCO, are call-
ing for withdrawal, the Foreign Office
is arguing that Britain can better serve
UNESCO by remaining inside the
fence, supervising reform from within.
The Fleet Street quality papers,
meanwhile, are baying for blood, par-
ticularly the blood of UNESCO’s
director-general, Amadou-Mahtar
M’Bow, with headlines such as A
School for Scandal; Devastating Look
At How Unesco Wastes Members’
Money; and Unesco’s Black Mischief.
Since last April, when the UK
minister for Overseas Development,
Timothy Raison, sent a letter of
ultimatum to M’Bow telling him to put
his house in order or else Britain
would get out, Britain has been closely
monitoring the activities of the
UNESCO headquarters in Paris.
Raison’s letter called for less emphasis
by UNESCO on such programs as
human rights, communications and
“peace and disarmament” studies,
which were tending to lead to ideologi-
cal confrontations between various
members, particularly from the Third
World, and more emphasis on the
original aims of UNESCO: to dis-
seminate educational and scientific in-
formation as widely as possible and to
encourage literacy programs. Addition-
ally, Raison’s letter urged a thorough
shake-up in the management adminis-
tration side of the organisation.
Despite the success of a move led by
America and Britain in late October for
UNESCO to vote to freeze its budget
for 1986-87, many critics of UNESCO
Timothy Raison: an ultimatum to M’Bow
CAMERA PRESS
are now calling for more draconian
measures, such as total withdrawal by
Britain, because they say that Raison’s
outlined reforms, and the subsequent
response to his suggestions by
UNESCO, are nothing more than
cosmetic repairs to a faulty institution.
If Britain does announce she’s to pull
out (and such an announcement would
be likely to be made within the next few
weeks), the question will be: To what
extent was the decision merely a tri-
umph of Thatcherism over the Foreign
Office, and how much a bowing to
pressure from the Americans to join
them in their lone stand?
Sources high up in UNESCO’s
headquarters in Paris believe there is no
question that the Americans are waging
a concerted campaign to woo Britain
out. These sources pointed out to The
Bulletin that the recent visit to London
of the US ambassador to UNESCO,
Jean Gerrard, coincided with a visit by
the former Australian ambassador to
UNESCO, Owen Harries, UNESCO’s
arch-critic.
While in London, Harries was a joint
speaker with former UNESCO execu-
tive Richard Hoggart at a debate on
UNESCO at the Institute for European
Defence and Strategic Studies on
October 25. In the debate, Harries
argued that the only way to deal with
the profligacy and scandalous mis-
management of UNESCO affairs was
for Britain to give notice to quit. Also at
this meeting was Gerrard, who spoke
after the debate, putting the US case.
Other invited guests included journal-
ists from the Fleet Street quality papers
and selected Conservative MPs.
Whether meetings such as this have
helped mould the opinion-makers’
opinions or not, there has been a
marked increase in the number of anti-
UNESCO articles and editorials
published in Britain in the past month.
Some of the information they report is
staggering: with an annual budget of
SUS6OO-million, UNESCO manages to
put only 870 workers in the field the
other 2466 permanent staff plus a
further 2363 supplementary staff are
based in Paris. Sixty percent of the
budget is spent in Paris (the US pro-
vides 25 percent of the annual budget;
Britain contributes 4.6 percent;
Australia comes low down the list,
contributing only 1.6 percent).
The articles have also concentrated
on the chaos in UNESCO’s secretariat
where M’Bow, who spends around 40
weeks a year away from his penthouse
offices in Paris travelling, has decreed
that even the most minute decision can
be made by him alone. Some critics
liken M’Bow’s control over UNESCO
to that of the late J. Edgar Hoover’s
vice-like grip on the FBI.

“mysterious fire set to destroy financial
documents,” “espionage,” “high life at
the taxpayer’s expense within sight of
the Eiffel Tower,” and compared recent
events at UNESCO to “a third-rate
novel.” The “villain of the piece,” wrote
The Times, “is its black Director-Gener-
al, Mr Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow. He is
Senegalese, Francophone Africa, and
Master of what Richard Hoggart called
the ‘enclosed Byzantine system’ of
UNESCO’s Parisian bureaucracy.”
The article accused M’Bow of
neglecting the literacy programs and
other earlier worthy UNESCO causes in
favor of endless conference papers and
anti-American resolutions.
Writing in the Spectator recently,
Andrew Brown reported that for many
member states belonging to the
“Geneva Group” Europeans
M’Bow’s resignation is now a minimum
requirement for their continued
membership. It is also known that
several countries Holland, West
Germany and even New Zealand are
keenly watching Britain’s next move.
In the House of Commons on
November 12, questions on UNESCO
tabled by seven MPs (four Conservative
and three Labor) plus a question
without notice from another Con-
servative, were answered by Thatcher
and Raison. The Conservatives tended
to dwell on the shortcomings of
UNESCO and its blatantly spendthrift
ways, and called for Britain to an-
nounce its resignation from the or-
ganisation. At least one of the Con-
servatives, Sir Peter Blaker, had met
with America’s UNESCO ambassador
while she was in London last month.
Labor MP Guy Barnett, secretary of
the unofficial and recently-formed All-
Party Committee on Overseas Develop-
ment, said in his question that while it
was accepted that “there are grave
reserves about the way in which
UNESCO is being run” did not the
minister recognise that British
withdrawal would cause grave dismay
in the Third World?
Raison replied that “obviously some
people would be worried if Britain were
to withdraw but others would say that to
give notice of withdrawal would be an
effective way of keeping up the pres-
sure.”
The feeling at the Department for
Overseas Development is that a deci-
sion is likely to be made soon. If Britain
does decide to give notice to withdraw
she can still change her mind in October
1985 when the next session of the
general conference takes place, if it is
then felt that sufficient reform has been
made to UNESCO’s messy affairs.
If this is the way events go, Britain
may well be accused of sitting on the
fence while holding a big stick. Yet
sometimes that kind of tactic works. □
THE SEXES
Women make slow
progress in
politics worldwide
Indira Gandhi lies in state: a record rule is over
UPI
By ABIGAIL TRAFFORD
THE assassination of Indira Gandhi
brought to an end the longest rule by a
female chief of state in modern times.
Gandhi led the world’s second-most-
populous nation for 15 of the
past 18 years.
India is not the only nation
to have been led by a woman.
Great Britain and Yugoslavia
are headed by females and
women politicans are making
strides in several other
countries.
Recently, lawyer Elisabeth
Kopp became the first woman
to be elected to the Swiss
cabinet and will serve as pres-
ident within a few years.
Thirteen years ago, women
there were not even allowed to
vote.
At the same time, statistics
show that few women in most
foreign countries are elected
to legislative bodies or ap-
pointed to cabinet-level posts.
Still, numbers do not tell
the whole story. In the United
States, while only 5 percent of
congress is female, women are
making gains at all govern-
ment levels. In other
countries, too, they are trying
with mixed results to
assume a greater role in politics.
Despite the rule of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in Britain, women
have not made substantial progress
under her leadership.
Thatcher, a conservative nationalist
dubbed the “Iron Maiden,” surrounds
herself with an inner circle of male aides
and she heads a parliament where only
25 of 650 House of Commons seats are
held by women.
In the British civil service, few
women make it to the top jobs. Of 684
senior positions, only 31 are held by
women despite the government’s com-
Britain’s Thatcher, with America’s Reagan

mitment to equal opportunity. “The
actual penetration of women into higher
ranks falls off steadily as you get up the
tree,” says senior official Anne Mueller.
The picture in France is changing
under socialist President Francois
Mitterrand. Some 15 percent of cabinet
posts are held by women. Mitterrand
named Yvette Chassagne prefect
(regional representative) of Loir-et-
Cher. She is the first woman to hold that
post since Napoleon created it in 1801.
Generally, the French appear willing
to accept women in high positions. In
one poll, Simone Veil, former minister
of Health and former president of the
European parliament, was voted one of
the nation’s‘most influential politicians.
Nevertheless, women have not had
much success in elections. They account
for 5 percent of the deputies elected to
the National Assembly, 4 percent of the
mayors and 14.4 percent of city council
members.
Only in the ultra-left Greens Party
are women making headway in West
Germany. In the latest election, 10
females were among the party’s 28
members elected to the Bundestag.
Nonetheless, well-known Greens Party
activist Petra Kelly, 26, was ousted as
party leader on the ground that she was
becoming too much of a celebrity. Over
all, 49 members of the 498-member
Bundestag are women.
In Italy, women hold only 3 percent
of the cabinet-level jobs. The country’s
most powerful female politician is
Communist Party leader Leonilde Jotti,
president of the parliament’s Chamber
of Deputies. In Greece, the Socialist
government of Andreas Papandreou
has opened some doors for women and
a key official is former movie star
Melina Mercouri who serves as minister
of Culture.
A different picture emerges in
Yugoslavia, where Milka Planninc is
president and women are well
represented in national and local
parties.
So far, women in Denmark, Norway
and Sweden have made the greatest
political gains. They hold 19 percent of
cabinet positions in Denmark and 23
percent of the seats in parliament. In
Norway, former prime minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland, 45, leads the op-
position party. In Sweden, female
cabinet members run the departments
of Education, Energy, Labor and Immi-
gration.
Although Soviet women gained
equal-rights legislation in 1918, they
have had little success in reaching high
posts in the government or the Com-
munist Party.
There are no women in the 12-
member Politburo, no women among 90
ministers of the central government and
no female judges on the Soviet Supreme
Court. Of the 18 million members of the
Communist Party, only 27.4 percent are
female.
While there are 487 women among
the 1500 deputies in the national parlia-
ment, or Supreme Soviet, this largely
ceremonial body has no real power and
meets only 10 days a year.
Women do slightly better at the local
level. Lidia Lykova is deputy premier of
one of the country’s 15 republics.
Golda Meir, Israel’s prime minister
from 1969 to 1974, remains the excep-
tion in a power base that is largely male.
No Israeli women have been ap-
pointed cabinet ministers in the coali-
tion government of the Likud and
Labor alignments. Of the 120-member
Knesset, 10 members are women.
Women in Moslem countries face a
range of religious and social barriers
when it comes to politics. In states such
as Egypt, Syria and Jordan, they hold
cabinet positions. But no women were
elected to parliament in Morocco’s
recent poll. And women in Saudi
Arabia are not allowed to vote.
The political role of women in the
Arab world is likely to change under
pressure from the swelling ranks of
female university students and pro-
fessionals. In Jordan, women out-
number men at the university level and
account for one third of the students in
law school and one quarter of those in
medical school.
Many African women were activists
during struggles for independence and
held important government positions
after colonial rule ended. But, with an
increase in military takeovers, the in-
fluence of female politicians has
declined.
In the military government to
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation,
there are no women in the cabinet. Two
women are in the cabinet, however, in
Zimbabwe. In South Africa, no women
hold cabinet posts.

India accepts matriarchal figures as
leaders and the tradition of female
activism goes back long before the reign
of Indira Gandhi. Her mother was a
leader in the fight for independence.
Gandhi’s daughter-in-law Maneeka
Gandhi has formed a separate party in a
challenge to the dominant party.
In spite of the equality promised by
the communist revolution, only a few
Chinese women have powerful jobs and
most gained prominence on their hus-
bands’ coat-tails.
Deng Yingchao, widow of Premier
Chou En-lai, is the only female member
of the 25-member Politburo. Kang
Keqing, whose late husband was Army
Marshal Zhu De, is one of 11 women
among the 210 members of the party’s
central committee.
Most notorious is Jiang Qing who, as
the wife of Mao Tse-tung, presided over
the Cultural Revolution in which
millions of Chinese died in the 1960 s
and early ’7os. Desposed after Mao’s
death, his widow languishes in prison.
In the recent reshuffling of Japan’s
21-member cabinet, the first woman in
22 years was appointed to a ministerial
position.
Shigeru Ishimoto, a leader in the
nursing field, was named minister in
charge of environmental affairs.
Since women gained the vote in
1946, they have seen major social
change. Today, more than half of the
married women are in the workforce.
Mayumi Moriyama, female member of
the parliament’s House of Councillors,
explains that the “new generation is
accepting the changed role of men and
women.”
At the same time, fewer than 4
percent of parliament members are
women and only 2 percent of elected
officials in local governments are fe-
male.
Canadian women are gaining politi-
cal ground. In the September general
election, more women ran for office
than ever before. Newly-elected Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney named six
women to his 40-member cabinet a
record number for Canada.
Women are making uneven progress
in breaking down traditional machismo
attitudes toward female political leaders
in Latin America.
In Marxist-oriented Nicaragua,
where women fought side by side with
men in the Sandinista revolution of
1979, no women are among the nine
members of the ruling directorate.
In contrast, the Chilean parliament
has long had women members. In
Mexico, women are beginning to move
into key jobs in private industry and
politics. They now sit in the Chamber of
Deputies. Recently, a woman was
elected to a senior post in the coalition
government. □
THE UNITED STATES
A wave of
libel writs
hits the press
By ALVIN SANOFF
THE LEGAL fight between General
William Westmoreland and CBS in the
United States is a microcosm of the libel
wars being waged throughout the
country as angry plaintiffs seek huge
damage awards against news media.
Westmoreland is suing the television
network for $l2O million over a docu-
mentary that claimed the former
Vietnam commander was part of a
conspiracy to distort estimates of enemy
troop strength.
Many analysts see it as simply the
most dramatic in a long line of cases
that have put reporters and editors on
the defensive and raised questions
about the accuracy and ethics of the
news media.
Since 1980, 20 verdicts of $f million
William Westmoreland on a veterans’ march
UPI
or more have been handed down
against publishers and broadcasters.
Even though most large judgments are
reduced or overturned, Washington
libel lawyer Bruce Sanford declares:
“This is a bad decade for the news
media in the courtroom.”
A recent study by the Libel Defence
Resource Centre which tracks cases for
the media, found that more than 60
percent of juries return verdicts in favor
of the plaintiffs. Among them:
■ A $3.5-million verdict against the
El Paso Times in a suit by a former
assistant US attorney over a column
accusing him of lying during a narcotics
trial.
■ A $l.l-million claim against St
Louis television station KSDK over a
story calling a waterworks employee a
“convicted thief.”
■ A $9.2-million-dollar judgment
against the Alton Telegraph resulting
from a memo written by two reporters
to federal authorities asking for con-
firmation of a tip that a businessman in
the Illinois town was linked to or-
ganised crime.
The suit was settled for $1.4 million.
Increasingly, lawsuits are being
brought by well-known fig-
ures. Nevada’s Republican
Senator Paul Laxalt recently
filed a $250-million-dollar
claim against the McClatchy
Newspapers, based in
Sacramento, California, fol-
lowing a story alleging that
money was skimmed from a
Carson City casino when
Laxalt’s family owned it.
Scientist William Shockley
sued the Atlanta Constitution
for $1.25 million over an
article comparing his vol-
untary-sterilisation proposal
for the “genetically dis-
advantaged” with Nazi gen-
etic experiments. The jury
awarded him $1 but Shockley
is appealing.
Israeli military leader and
politician Ariel Sharon is
suing Time magazine for $5O
million over a story linking
him to the 1982 massacre of
Palestinian refugees in the
Lebanon.
Public figures for many
years were reluctant to in-
itiate libel suits because of a
1964 US Supreme Court
ruling requiring them to show
that a story not only defamed
them but also did so with
“reckless disregard” for the
truth. In this way, the court
hoped to protect unrestricted
debate of public issues.
But the courts have
narrowed the definition of

who is a public figure and well-known
people have become less shy about
bringing suit. “In certain circles, you
become a hero if you take on a segment
of the news media,” says Sanford.
Behind the success of suits brought
by people in all walks of life is a widely
held belief that news coverage is unfair
and inaccurate.
Lawyers say public hostility toward
the media is especially evident in hefty
punitive-damage awards by juries.
“Punitive damages reflect resentment of
what the public perceives as press arro-
gance and lack of accountability,” con-
tends New York lawyer Jonathan
Lubell who represents libel plaintiffs.
Industry defenders counter that the
size of awards now is far out of propor-
tion to any harm that may have been
done.
Some experts say that the huge
awards occur because jurors view jour-
nalists as representing wealthy corpora-
tions wielding enormous power. But
others argue that the media have only
themselves to blame for the big awards.
Washington lawyer Arthur Hanson,
director of a major libel insurance firm
and former general counsel for the
American Newspaper Publishers As-
sociation, contends that “reporters
cause libel cases.
“They have been sloppy as hell ever
since Watergate. There is an absolute
inability of reporters and editors to sit
down and take another look at a story.
The whole approach is to go with it and
damn the torpedoes.”
Even when they win a suit, news
organisations can emerge with images
tarnished and pocketbooks drained. It
can cost at least $250,000 to fight a big
case with fees sometimes running as
high as $3 million. In addition, libel-
insurance premiums to defray the legal
costs are increasing by as much as 200
percent a year.
All this has sent shudders through
the nation’s newsrooms and produced
chastened, even fearful, attitudes about
what to print or broadcast.
Small and medium-sized papers with
limited resources are especially likely to
back away from controversial stories.
Stephen Cousley, editor and
publisher of the Alton Telegraph, ac-
knowledges exercising more caution
today than before the large libel judg-
ment against his paper. In one case, he
decided against pursuing a telephone
tip about gambling at a local club.
Instead, he told the caller to contact the
sheriff. “We don’t want to be in front
doing the job of the sheriff and state’s
attorney,” Cousley says.
As the threat of losing suits mounts,
news organisations seem more disposed
to settle out of court. The Wall Street
Journal recently agreed to pay $BOO,OOO
to two former federal prosecutors who
Homosexuals parade in New York: growing influence across the nation
UPI
said they were defamed by articles
claiming that the men improperly
harassed a prisoner to get him to co-
operate with an investigation.
The ABC network settled for a
reported $235,000 in a suit by a federal
official over a segment of a 20/20
television program that accused him of
being “badly misinformed or intention-
ally lying” about the number of
witnesses murdered while under
government protection.
In this environment, analysts say, the
Westmoreland case will be watched
very closely. If CBS wins, public figures
may become more reluctant to haul
a media firm into court. But, if
Westmoreland triumphs, the decision
could lead to even more suits for eye-
popping damages. □
THE UNITED STATES
‘Odd couple’
rule in West
Hollywood
By WILLIAM SCOBIE
“FOR GAYS,” said homosexual
publisher Bob Craig at a packed Holly-
wood celebration of one of the odder
victories in last week’s national elec-
tions, “Camelot has arrived.”
The homosexual Camelot is an
urban muddle of some 500 hectares
called West Hollywood, tucked in be-
tween chic Beverly Hills and sleazy
downtown Los Angeles. Its 35,000
residents have just voted to turn their
community into a separate city the
first in America to be run largely by
homosexuals, an increasingly influential
force on the political scene.
Homosexuals have long been a
driving force in this affluent pocket of
Los Angeles. They make up at least 40
percent of the population. They own
most of the shops, restaurants and
businesses, including two banks. To the
two-million-strong California homo-
sexual community it is known as “Boys’
Town.”
But the boys share West Hollywood
with thousands of elderly, retired Jews.
The two minorities got together this
year to devise a plan for cityhood. The
homosexuals wanted it because, as
Virginia Apuzzo, director of the
National Gay Task Force, says: “It was
a unique opportunity to show people
that gays are a vital, controlled force in
this nation’s politics.”
The Jews wanted it because 90 per-
cent of them were elderly renters and
rent control in West Hollywood was
due to end next January. Thousands of
tenants had been warned that their rents
would be doubled or trebled.
Homosexual leaders swore that, if
elected, they would maintain strict rent
control in the new township. The result:
out of 44 candidates for the five city
council seats, 22 were openly
homosexual. Two such men and one
woman won office. The remaining two
seats went to a 73-year-old retired
Jewish schoolteacher and a young
Jewish real estate developer.
None of this sits well with West
Hollywood landlords and businessmen.
“We don’t want a total gay take-over
here,” said property owner Francis
Montgomery. “And this new city is
bound to lead to an influx of homos
from all over the country.”
Valerie Terrigno, 31, the lesbian


lawyer who won most votes for a city
council seat and who is first choice for
mayor of the new township, said such
complaints are “based on prejudice.”
“Gayness is not the real issue here,
any more than Jewishness.
“What we have here is a community
that is recognising mutual needs.”
Across the United States, there are
only 14 openly homosexual elected
officials the highest-ranking being
Democratic congressman Gerry Studds
of liberal Massachusetts. “That’s pretty
silly,” said Appuzo, “when you consider
there are more than 20 million gay men
and lesbians in America.”
Local newspapers are filled with
whimsical references to the new city’s
police force and fire brigade “easily
recognisable in their silver Corvettes,
Gucci leather shorts and fashionable
lavender helmets.”
In fact, said Terrigno, West Holly-
wood would simply make a special
contract for police and fire protection
with Los Angeles county authorities.
“It will be business as usual,” said
mayor-elect Terrigno, “but we will be
asking the police to appoint more gay
male and lesbian officers.” □
EDUCATION
Quality of US
teaching poor,
says expert
By WILLA McDONALD
EDUCATION in the United States is
poor, according to Dr William Nault,
publisher of World Book Inc and ad-
viser to the United States Government
on education and the main cause is
bad teaching.
Nault, who recently visited Australia
on a study and lecture tour, said: “A
shocking study released only a week ago
showed quite a few teachers could not
point to where Pennsylvania was on a
map or India, or Australia.
These are teachers ... many of them
didn’t know the US has two senators for
each state, fundamental facts that each
citizen has to* have.”
He said teaching no longer drew
upon the most intellectually able: “It
used to be teaching was the best op-
portunity for women graduates of our
finer universities and colleges. Now
they go into medicine, law, business
the professions. They have better op-
portunity there today than men because
of affirmative action.”
A 1983 report, A Nation at Risk,
prepared by the National Commission
William Nault: parents should show more interest
ERNIE Mc McQUILLAN
on Excellence in Education, found that
despite widespread publicity about a
surplus of teachers there are severe
shortages in some subjects, for example,
maths, sciences and foreign languages.
Half of the newly-employed teachers in
maths, science and English were not
qualified to teach those subjects.
Nault said that low salaries were a
deterrent the average salary after 12
years’ experience was found in 1983 to
be SUSI7,OOO; lower than nurses’
salaries. Many teachers left after only a
few years because of the poor prospects
of promotion. The prestige of teaching
had plummeted no longer were
teachers respected in the same way as
the local minister or doctor.
Nor was the job easy. With so many
one-parent families or families with
both parents working, teachers were
expected to provide students with
counselling and parenting as well as the
three Rs. Studies such as that done by
Harold W. Stevenson, of the University
of Michigan, Making the Grade: School
Achievement in Japan, Taiwan and the
United States, had shown that attitudes
of parents were very important to suc-
cessful schooling.
That study found Asian students
were given much more homework (first
graders in Taipeh studied 77 minutes a
day at home compared with 17 minutes
a day for American children) and were
expected to take home notebooks for
parents’ comments on school assign-
ments.
Eighty percent of the Taiwanese and
Japanese parents said they would help
their children with homework if they
were having difficulties, while
fewer than 10 percent of Am-
erican parents felt helping
their children was important.
One reason for the reluctance
of American parents, accord-
ing to the study, was that they
feared they didn’t know
enough to help their children,
particularly in maths and
science.
American mothers em-
phasised their children’s
ability rather than the effort
they made. This attitude
carried through to the schools
where students were labelled,
for example, as failures if they
were low-achievers. In Asia,
parents emphasised hard
work rather than intelligence
as the way to success and
refrained from categorising
children in the same way as
Americans.
Nault placed positive
family attitudes as one of the
most important features of
successful education. Unless
parents supervised homework
and encouraged reading and discussion
of current affairs, the child would be
disadvantaged.
The curriculum was another pro-
blem. “Driver training became a bona
fide course in all our classrooms and
one of our precious class periods was
devoted to teaching kids how to drive
an automobile. In a school you are
dealing with a finite number of hours
and days in a year. You can’t afford to
deal with personal development.”
The result was a seriously ill educa-
tion system. The report of the National
Commission on Excellence in Educa-
tion found that:
■ Functional illiteracy (defined as
inability to fill out a job application)
might affect as many as 40 percent of
minors while about 23 million adults
were classified as functionally illiterate.
■ On international tests of student
achievement, American students were
never first or second compared with
other industrialised nations they rated
last seven out of 19 times.
■ The average achievement of high
school students on standardised tests
was lower than it was 26 years ago.
■ Entrance exams to colleges showed
a steady decline in standards over the
past 20 years.
■ Almost 40 percent of 17-year-olds
could not draw inferences from written
material, only one fifth could write a
persuasive essay and only one third
could solve a maths problem requiring
several steps.
Nault said that because of the com-
mission’s finding, US states were requir-
ing that high school students be taught a

minimum four years of English, three of
maths, three of science and a half year
of computer literacy. The remaining
time could then be used for less essen-
tial subjects.
The commission had found that
while intermediate algebra was offered
in high schools, only 31 percent of
graduates completed it; only 13 percent
completed French 1; only 16 percent
completed geography; calculus was
available in schools enrolling about 60
percent of all students but only 6
percent of all students completed it.
In 13 states, 50 percent or more of
the units required for high school
graduation might be electives, chosen
by the student. Many students opted for
less demanding courses to fill that half
or more of their education, such as
“Bachelor Living.”
Some schools provided only 17
hours of academic instruction during
the week and the average school
provided 22. Poor management of
classroom time meant time spent in
maths, science and English varied enor-
mously from school to school.
Nault fears demands for better con-
ditions and higher pay by the strongly
unionised teachers will be too high.
“Where will the money come from to
pay teachers who are unionised and will
not work longer hours unless there is a
quid pro quo?” he asked.
Legislation passed by the states in-
troducing minimum time to be spent on
the three Rs and extending the school
day and year was not, said Nault, the
complete answer. Students already un-
interested in school and those with
literacy problems might feel more press-
ure to drop out: “Some of us fear that if
we do not get at the basic quality, which
is teacher quality, giving more of the
same could be worse because it could
make it more unbearable for the
students.”
Poor education was a social pro-
blem. Drop-outs were found mainly
among the black and Hispanic
minorities. They can’t find a job and
take to the streets. “It’s a social time-
bomb,” said Nault.
Education for all, regardless of race,
class or economic status was the
American dream. “Some people believe
the implementation of that very philos-
ophy has led to the sorry state of affairs
that exists today,” said Nault. □

Amid the killing,
it is business
as usual
By JOSABETH DRUCKER
“Mummy, when shall I be old enough
to drive a truck?”
“What for?”
“To fill it with dynamite and drive it
against a stronghold of our country’s
enemy.”
from an Iranian propaganda pamphlet.
“Merchants are among God’s favor-
ites.”
The Prophet Mohammed.
WHILE THOUSANDS of Iranian
youngsters are being sent to die in the
struggle against the “infidel” Iraqis in
the Gulf War, now four years old, the
business of living continues back home.
Ayatollah Khomeini’s government
rations, or subsidises, such staples as
Young hawkers offer contraband cigarettes in a Tehran bazaar: a thriving black market


Sophisticated goods displayed in troubled Tehran
sugar, rice and meat even cigarettes
but their very scarcity has spawned a
thriving black market.
Almost everything foodstuffs,
cigarettes, videotape recorders and
luxurious cars is smuggled into the
country and sold.
Jewels, particularly, are very much in
demand as a hedge against inflation
which runs at about 40 percent.
Khomeini is well aware of the black
marketeering but he is careful not to
antagonise the rich “bazaari,” the mer-
chants who helped finance his campaign
to topple the late shah’s regime.
This attitude of tolerance in an
otherwise intolerant nation is justified
by some mullahs, including the most
fundamentalist. They argue that the
Koran discourages the “socialist” views
of supporters of the revolution who
want to help the downtrodden by large-
scale re-distribution of income or land
reform. The Prophet Mohammed, they
point out, was once a merchant.
But the sale of life’s luxuries is about
the only activity to which the regime
turns a blind eye. The notorious Evin
prison holds some 30,000 political
prisoners. Once, dozens were cramped
into a single cell and as many as 200
executed at one time. Now, however,
the government says that the jail is a
“vocational training centre.”
Prisoners are urged to repeat such
lines as: “This place is not a prison but a
school where we learn how to live” and
“We thank Ayatollah Khomeini who
enabled us to correct our mistakes.”
In some 35 prisoner-of-war camps,
35,000 Iraqis are subjected to daily
indoctrination aimed at convincing
them that Iran’s cause is that of a holy
war a conflict of the “righteous
against the wicked.” The propaganda
has some apparent effect. Prisoners are
known to study the Koran, launch
accusations against the Iraqi govern-
ment and petition Khomeini to be
permitted to fight in the name of Islam.
Whether this is a matter of opportunism
or conviction is not so clear.
In spite of the regime’s acceptance of
black marketeering the signs of war
remain. At the “martyrs” cemetery of
Zahra, in Teheran, a fountain spurts a
steady stream of reddish liquid a
reminder of the blood spilled in the
fighting.
A recent conservative estimate put
the number of dead on both sides at
250,000. The number of wounded was
more than twice as great. □

THE UNITED STATES
Nuclear dilemma:
What to do
with old plants
Dismantling old nuclear structures sets American industry a poser
TIMOTHY A MURPHY/USN&WR
By STANLEY WELLBORN
HARD ON the heels of many problems
that have plagued the nuclear energy
industry in the United States, another
nightmare is developing: How to dis-
pose of a growing inventory of ageing
power plants.
Of mounting concern is the fate of as
many as 20 outworn reactors that may
be shut down by the end of the next
decade and could pose health hazards
far into the future. Even with uranium
fuel rods removed, the concrete-and-
steel hulks will remain dangerously
radioactive for thousands of years.
Dismantling the huge reactors, say
industry officials as well as critics of
nuclear power, could add to consumers’
utility bills or create a public health
threat if radiation is allowed to escape.
“Giving old nuclear reactors a
decent burial is going to be a difficult
task,” concedes Daniel Williams, an
Arkansas Power & Light Company
engineer and chairman of an industry-
backed task force on dismantling. “We
have the technology available to do the
job but we haven’t put it to the test yet.”
Long before the first kilowatt of
commercial US nuclear power was pro-
duced in 1958, it was known that
reactors eventually would have to be
decommissioned an industry term for
razing them and disposing of the debris.
“Like any other piece of heavy in-
dustrial equipment, nuclear plants wear
out,” says Lynn Wallis, a General
Electric engineer and an American
Nuclear Society spokesman. “Pumps,
valves and pipes are subject to corro-
sion and leaks. Eventually, it
becomes more economical to
shut a plant down rather than
try to maintain it in good
condition.”
Of 86 operating reactors in
the US, four already have shut
down permanently and are
candidates for demolition:
Humboldt Bay in California,
the Dresden plant near
Chicago, Indian Point in New
York and Shippingport in
Pennsylvania. In addition, the
Three Mile Island reactor
in Pennsylvania that was
crippled in a major accident
in 1979 is still being cleaned
up and may not re-open.
Some congressional an-
alysts and experts at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion suggest that closed re-
actors could number 20 or
more in the next few years.
They cite maintenance and
structural problems, such as
cracks in pipes or brittle re-
actor walls, as the kinds of
defects that will shorten the
plants’ projected lifespans.
By any measure, decom-
missioning commercial react-
ors will be costly. The At-
omic Industrial Forum, a nuclear power
advocate in Washington, forecasts
demolition costs of large plants averag-
ing $77 million a unit in 1984 dollars.
Though some utilities have reserves
to cover part of the decommissioning
process, others will have to pass costs to
consumers in higher rates.
“The industry underestimates how
massive this job is going to be,” says
Michael Totten of the Critical Mass
Energy Project which backs alternatives
to nuclear power. “Taking apart a
The pioneer plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania: to be buried


highly radioactive vessel weighing hun-
dreds of tonnes isn’t an everyday
engineering problem.” Anti-nuclear
groups also argue that decommissioning
poses serious health risks. They note
that radioactive chemicals and building
materials will be carried by boat and
truck and that landfill sites may leak
hazardous run-off into public water
supplies.
Several methods have been devised
for getting rid of plants after their
uranium fuel has been removed.
Some will simply be mothballed
fenced off, guarded and monitored for
years.
Another approach is entombment, in
which a reactor vessel is encased in
concrete until radiation inside subsides
enough for disassembly.
A third method is being tried at
Shippingport, which is about to become
the first commercial reactor to be dis-
assembled and buried. Department of
Energy supervisors of the four-year
project guess that dismantling Shipp-
ingport’s relatively small reactor will
cost $BO million.
The job will require heavy protective
shielding for workers because one day’s
exposure to the reactor would con-
taminate a person with a lethal dose of
radiation.
Used tools will have to be buried as
radioactive waste. Water will be sprayed
continuously over the demolition site to
keep radioactive dust from spreading.
When the reactor vessel itself is
exposed, it will be encased in concrete.
The 770-tonne structure then will be
carried by barge down the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers and through the
Panama Canal for burial at a federal
facility in Washington state.
Ed DeLaney, head of the Depart-
ment of Energy decommissioning staff
that is managing the Shippingport
work, believes the job can be done with
minimum risk to the public. “What we
learn at Shippingport will determine the
best way to dismantle other plants,” he
says.
What worries officials at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission as well as con-
sumer advocates is whether the industry
will be able to afford the costs of
decommissioning plants that are 10 to
20 times larger than the reactor
Shippingport.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion has proposed that electricity utili-
ties be required to set up funds to
finance decommissioning so that users
of a reactor’s electricity also pay those
costs.
“You can’t guarantee that a power
company will even be around in 40 or
50 years,” says a commission official.
“It’s important that utilities provide
for future costs of dismantlement
now.” □

The difference between Philips Hi-Fi Stereo Video
and normal Low-Fi stereo VCR is something like watching
a concert with only one eye and one ear open.
You're missing out on half the action.
But slip a Hi-Fi video cassette of a favourite movie
or concert into Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR, hook up your TV
to your stereo speakers, and listen.
During the high notes your dog will sit up and howl.
During the low notes the floor vibrations will curl your toes
up. You'll hear sounds you've never heard before, effects
that enhance the visuals with added realism. Because
Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR represents the new dimension in
home entertainment.
Not only will it out-perform the most sophisticated
sound systems, its slim-line compact design means you
can file it into your home entertainment rack. You might
even want to use it just for audio recordings.
Where else can you record a 4 hour concert in
Hi-Fi quality without running out of tape? Of course you
can also record in stereo and mono as well as Hi-Fi.
Alternatively you can play-back pre-recorded cassettes in
Hi-Fi, stereo or mono. And Philips Hi-Fi Stereo VCR has
more features than M.G.M. Typical of Philips well thought
out design is the Dockable Remote Control that's never
further away than your fingertips.
Press the release button and the infra-red remote
control glides out from a concealed drawer. A clever idea
that keeps your remote control where you can find it and
safe from inquisitive little hands.
There are also many other labour-saving niceties.

to have the best.

Singapore’s rush to the future
threatens tourist dollar
As Singapore rushes to become South-East Asia's first stainless steel and glass city, its
tourism market comes under threat. MICHAEL MEAGHER tells how the city-nation
is losing its charm.
FUELLED BY its billion-dollar urban
redevelopment program, the Singapore
economy has marched on through 1984
with impressive growth rates, but the
country’s vital tourism industry may be
threatened in the euphoria.
With some 20 hotels due to open
within the next 18 months to two years,
the country’s future is critically tied, to
tourism but the lure of a growing num-
ber of major shopping complexes sell-
ing an increasing array of Western
goods may not be enough to sustain
tourism growth.
Traditional two and three storey
shop-houses manned by Chinese, In-
dian and Malay merchants have been
torn down or are earmarked for demoli-
tion. To the Singapore Government the
dilapidated shops are not consistent
with its aim to bring the city to, or be-
yond the retail standards of developed
nations. But to tourists they represent a
chapter of the oriental past, a part of the
drawcard of an Asian destination. The
government has had second thoughts
about the pace of its demolition, with
isolated streets designated for preserva-
tions, but most of the rows of old
trading areas are destined to go.
On a drive along Singapore’s hotel
row, Orchard Road, home of the Man-
darin, Marco Polo, Dynasty and new,
first-class establishments such as the
Meridien, a Singapore Tourist Promo-
tion Board officer points out the hun-
dreds of shop-houses that will go. If the
government decides to tear down a shop
it gives the merchant first choice of a
new location. Under the urban redevel-
opment program residential apartment
blocks, of which the first two storeys at
least are taken by shops, are being built.
Hundreds of food hawkers who used
to set up their stalls around Smith
Temple, Sago and Trengannu Streets in
the Chinatown area south of the Singa-
pore River were resited last year in a
modern building nearby. There are still
food centres in the city where a tourist
can buy a variety of Indian, Cantonese
and Malay foods for as little as SS2
(5A1.14) a meal. However much of
High rise buildings tower over Singapore’s Chinatown
Chinatown will disappear unless the
government changes tack.
Little India, off Serangoon Road,
north of the city, and Arab Street near-
by where Malay traders and merchants
have traditionally sold their wares, is
also likely to all but disappear. The re-
organisation of shops comes on top of
the general measures the government
has taken to clean up the city over the
past 10 years.
The housing and shopping redevel-
opment is an answer to the shortage of
space in Singapore, an island that is
now around 10 percent larger than it
was, through the reclamation of land,
mainly on the eastern seaboard. Appar-
ently for space reasons the government
has a rule that no dogs over 38 cm tall
(ground to shoulder) can live in high-
rise apartment blocks. There is a keen
market for Pekinese and other small
pedigree dogs.
Through heavy taxes on cars, the
government attempts to keep traffic and
pollution to a minimum. A company di-
rector claimed that after sales tax a 280
SE Mercedes Benz would cost a com-
pany some $5280,000 ($A 160,000), after
landing in Singapore for no more than
$550,000 ($A29,000) from Germany.
One side effect of the transferring of


shop merchants to new shopping
centres in which they are offered con-
cessional rates is that it helps the gov-
ernment in its goal of avoiding segrega-
tion of the Chinese, Indian, Malay and
other Asian groups in the city. The gov-
ernment can space the merchants in
separate buildings while giving them a
general locality preference.
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and
his ministers, in a line that comes
through strongly in the pages of the
government-owned newspapers The
Business Times, The Strait Times and
the Singapore Monitor, are keen to
down racial barriers and establish
Singapore firmly as a harmonious
multi-racial society. Last year there
were 7000 inter-racial marriages.
Many of the traders are not im-
pressed by the pace of the new shop de-
velopment. An optical supplier with
computerised eye-testing facilities who
sells a pair of glasses for SSSS (around
SA3I) complains that business is quiet.
She says business is suffering from too
many competitors and not enough cus-
tomers.
Consequently, the competition is
keen. Shoppers are accosted by the
tailor who appears as a long lost friend
and lures the innocent to a tape
measure. There are bargains in electri-
cal goods particularly. A search for a
micro-cassette tape recorder revealed a
fixed-price store price of SS92 (SASS)
but this was lowered by $S 12 (5A6.90)
in a bargain store in the People’s Park
complex near Chinatown.
Singapore’s tourist numbers perhaps
reflect some discontent with the way de-
velopment is progressing. Last year they
were down for the first time in 19 years.
There has been some recovery in the
first half of 1984 largely due to an
upturn in the world economy. In the
first quarter of the year visitor numbers
were up marginally to 695,245 and in
the second quarter up 6.3 percent to
734,617 for a first half total of 1.4 mil-
lion people. Australians showed a larger
increase than most other countries with
133,420 visitors in the half year, up 7
percent on the same period last year.
The Singapore Tourist Promotion
Board estimates that average hotel oc-
cupancy for the first half was 75.4
percent compared with 73.5 percent for
the same period last year. Hotels
planned in the pre-recession period and
opening in the next two years make
tourism increases more important. Total
rooms available will double to close to
30,000 by 1986. Hotels under construc-
tion include the Furama, Excelsior,
New Otani, Chinatown Centrepoint,
Nikko, Park View Holiday Inn and Dai
Ichi. A second Meridien hotel near the
Changi airport has been delayed be-
cause of the hotel glut.
On top of these are two major
harborside developments. The Raffles
City Complex will cover 3.4 hectares
and will include a 71-storey hotel the
tallest in the world, a 42-storey office
tower, a “smaller hotel” and 23,000
square metres of shops and restaurants
and lounges. Raffles City will offer 2000
guest rooms and 140 suites.
Nearby, the $5OO billion Marina
Square Centre is billed as the “place in
Singapore for international shopping.”
Scheduled for completion in 1986, the
complex will contain the Pan Pacific
Singapore with 850 rooms, the 640-
room Marina Mandarin Hotel and the
590-room Oriental as well as depart-
ment stores, a supermarket, mini-cin-
emas and 240 small shops. When the
Raffles City and the Marina are opened
the government can also be expected to
have cleaned up Singapore Harbor. Al-
ready the bumboats have been cleared
from the Singapore River, and are now
restricted to the harbor south of the city
centre. □
NEW ZEALAND
Superannuation
changes enrage
the pensioners
By IAN TEMPLETON
PRIME MINISTER David Lange, after
a charmed run, is facing his first major
test as some of the fiscal wounds in-
flicted in the budget show signs of
festering.
Thousands of pensioners are protest-
Prime Minister David Lange: pledges
JOHN SELKIRK
ing angrily at being deprived of what
used to be a universal benefit applied
without any means test. Other social
security beneficiaries are protesting
because they have been declared inelig-
ible for the new “family care” package
going to low-income families.
Emerging from a meeting of caucus,
where some backbenchers reportedly
demanded changes to measures in the
budget particularly those affecting
superannuation and family care
Lange showed less of his customary
bonhomie.
He made clear that the government
would not be amending the budget or
the main principles of its economic
measures but nevertheless would seek to
remove any anomalies.
Lange’s problem is that, during the
election campaign, he gave specific
Finance minister Roger Douglas: on the defensive
JOHN SELKIRK


pledges that a Labor government would
not alter the structure of national
superannuation paid to 450,000 New
Zealanders over the age of 60, at an
annual cost of $2.5 billion.
The budget, however, introduced a
surcharge on any other income which a
pensioner might have above $5200 a
year. The effect of that is to wipe out the
value of the superannuation benefit
when “other income” reaches $21,684.
More than 100,000 pensioners will be
hit by the new surcharge. Few of them
realised what the surcharge meant on
the night of the budget and most
assumed that they would still receive
something from the benefit. Since the
full impact has dawned, ministers and
members of parliament have been
bombarded with protests. Finance
minister Roger Douglas defends his
measure by saying that he regarded
$20,000 as an adequate income on
which a person could live.
The government’s move on super-
annuation has been labelled a “breach
of promise tax.” Its targets, apologists
say, are the wealthy. But many of the
protests are coming from ordinary
working people who might be staying
on the job beyond the age of 60 to pay
off some commitment such as a
mortgage.
The government justifies turning its
back on election promises about
superannuation by saying that there
have been clear signals from the public
that those in a relatively advantageous
position should carry the greater share
of the necessary restraint in expecta-
tions and claims.
Douglas estimates the fiscal yield
from the surcharge at $l6O million.
Many economists have argued that
financing the national scheme which
takes up 63 percent of social welfare
expenditure has imposed an undue
strain on the economy.
Douglas says that a comparison of
the costs of national superannuation
with the previous system of means-
tested age benefit and universal
superannuation benefits shows the ad-
ditional costs of the scheme at about $1
billion gross and about $5OO million net.
“This has to be paid for by taxes on the
earning population which are already
high or by borrowing to fund the
resulting larger fiscal deficit. The longer-
term future of superannuation is of
concern because of growing
demographic pressures. As the popula-
tion bulge associated with the post-war
baby boom moves into the over-60s age
group, the relative burden of the scheme
on the working population will increase
substantially.”
But the reaction to the outcry indi-
cates that few in the cabinet fully
appreciated the consequences of the
rationalisation. □

In 1969, Lindemans
discovered a potential new
wine growing district near
the small rural town of
Padthaway, 80km north
of Coonawarra, in the
cool south east of South
Australia.
The soil was rich and
red. The climate ideal.
Lindemans chose to use this new district
to produce some very special wines.
Exotic varietals.
Wine styles many Australians wouldn't
even hear about for another ten years.
From 1981, Lindemans' foresight paid off
with wines that took the Wine Shows by storm.
Padthaway wines have since won a Special

BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT
AFT now aiming for
its second billion
Dick Hargraves: an attitude of “aggressive prudence” in property
Thousands of people, in a bid to protect their savings from inflation, have invested in
Australian Fixed Trusts whose total funds dominate the industry’s holdings.
MICHAEL MEAGHER looks at the group and its prospects
AS Australian Fixed Trusts blows out
the last candle on its “One Billion
Strong” celebration cake, the puffed
king of the unit trusts is gathering its
breath and heading for a billion more
assets under management. But the
second billion will not come easily. At
the end of this month, AFT will an-
nounce the result of its first revaluation
of its Real Property Growth Trust No 2.
Property industry rumor has it that the
trust, which is specifically structured to
secure 100 percent capital growth and
no income, will show a disappointing
compound growth rate over its first
three years.
AFT copped plenty of flak when the
properties in the Real Property Growth
Trust No 1 (the pioneer of the total
capital gain-orientated trusts) turned in
a capital growth rate, after a front-end
load manager’s fee of 8 percent, of 10.6
percent for the three years to May. AFT
had forecast rates of 15 to 20 percent
over the trust’s life. The No 2 trust is
widely tipped for a worse result. The
Real Property Growth series now
numbers five with a sixth waiting in the
wings. They have been the most success-
ful funds lure for AFT Property Com-
pany Ltd which manages the property,
mortgage and superannuation trusts.
The 100-percent-capital trusts have at-
tracted $4OO million in less than four
years and account for more than half of
total property trust funds under man-
agement of around $750 million.
In unit trusts, it has always been AFT
and the rest. The group also manages
some $245 million of equity funds, $55
million mortgage and $250 million in
cash management trusts. AFT’s total
funds dominate the total funds trusted
to the unit trust industry, estimated now
at close to the $6 billion mark. AFT’s
nearest competitor is Westpac with $3
billion of funds under management but
of which only $6OO million are in the
unlisted unit trust category. Westpac
also has $1 billion of funds in its staff
superannuation scheme, a further $1
billion in other superannuation schemes
managed for companies and various
organisations and some $4OO million in
“in-house” pools which are used by the
bank’s portfolio managers. The other
members of the top five are Brick
Securities Ltd, the Hooker property
funds and the Telford group.
Investors are asking to see returns
from property trust investments in the
short term and AFT and other trusts are
being asked to answer the call. The
pressure is coming from trusts such as
the Western Australian Armstrong
Jones’ group’s Western Growth trust
showing a compound capital growth
rate of more than 20 percent. Another
biting at AFT’s heels, the Australia Wide

* Property and Buildings. ** Brick Securities Ltd, Dawson Trevena. *** Hooker Property
Investment Trust.
Property Trust, this week announced a
net capital gain (after front end and
management fees) of 30.3 percent and
3.1 percent income growth in its maiden
year.
In a performance that parallels that
of the Equity Link managers in equity
fund management, in which the man-
agers posted a gain of 89 percent in the
Growth Link Trust in its first year,
Australia Wide expects to have $lOO
million invested come Christmas.
As millions of dollars continue to
pour into the property industry each
month, although the flow has been
slowed by fears of the assets test and
some form of capital gains tax, doubts
have been raised on the capabilities of
fund managers. In a climate in which
valuations of some properties are under
question and in which pensioners lost
their life savings in the shocking failure
of the Balanced Property Trust, AFT’s
stoic image has stood it in good stead.
The figures in the accompanying
table show that AFT has performed
consistently, if not spectacularly, over
the past ,10 years. But the group has still
to prove itself in a new ball game where
capital growth is the key player. The
trend in property trusts both listed
and unlisted over the past 10 years
has been from an accent on maximising
income to the unit holder to maximising
capital gain. In the late 70s the trust
managers were still hammering out the
message that inflation had to be beaten
by investing in trusts showing high
distribution or income. But the
emphasis now is on beating the tax man
and inflation through capital growth.
AFT caters for investors seeking an
income and hedge in against inflation
with the Property and Buildings Trust
series, for those after a low income and
a bigger hedge in the Property Growth
Trusts and for those who do not need an
income but want tax-free growth with
the Real Property Growth series.
Some trusts are losing credibility
through high commissions they are
offering investment advisers. Most are 4
to 5 percent of funds invested, with
some as high as 6 percent. Most of
AFT’s business is generated by its 60
regional managers and 120 consultants
across the country. They are paid 4
percent of the gross income on the
invesment income they raise but of this
they pay all office expenses including
rent, although AFT sometimes subsid-
ises it.
When AFT’s parent company, the
merchant banker Development Finance
Corporation, was taken over by the ANZ
Banking Group late last year - giving
AFT the potential of a further 1200
retail outlets - it gained further
respectability.
Responsibility falls on two new gen-
eral managers who report to the group’s
managing director Ron Cox. They are
John Cloran who recently took over as
general manager of the AFT Property
Co and former Westpac man Dick
Hargraves who is the new group general
manager, sales and marketing.
Hargraves says: “Because of the
success of the Real Property Growth
trusts early on, and the time it took us to
get the funds bedded down, we stopped
being innovative for a while.”
Investors knocked doors down to get
into the first trust. AFT was hoping for
$2O million but when subscriptions
closed it had collected $65 million.
Total inflow has taken a “slight dip”
over the past couple of months with new
funds down from $2B to 24 to 25 million
a month.
On the growth trusts, Hargraves
says: “AFT has been criticised for not
performing up to what it promised
but AFT has always said that perform-
ance of 15 percent plus will be attain-
able over the life of the trust.” This
means that AFT must show rates of 20
percent and above in the later years of
the trust. Hargraves is confident it can.
He is also sceptical about some of the
other trusts.
Hargraves thinks the explosion of
Overall gain
of 15.9 percent
AFT’S Property and Buildings Trust
shows the best performance of the
current unlisted trusts over a 10-year
period with an overall gain income
and capital gain of 15.9 percent.
A study by Investment Measurement
Services Pty Ltd (IMS) a joint venture
between the actuarial firms PTOW-TPF
& C and E. S. Knight & Co shows that
AFT’s average overall return for all its
trusts over 10 years was 13.9 percent.
Over a three-year term, AFT trusts
shows an average overall gain of 10.9
percent just above the average for
Brick Securties Ltd and just below that
for Hooker trusts.
IMS results showed that listed trusts
(not given here) had average overall
gains of 16.6 percent over three years
and 18.7 over 10, against corresponding
unlisted returns of 11 and 13.1 percent.
The study, to June 30, included all
trusts available to the public and in
force for more than three years and
hence did not include Clayton Robard
and other more recent trusts. The in-
vested performance is real return after
commission, initial charges and other
management fees. □

fund managers “from three or four to 40
in a few years” may cause problems in
some trusts.
He says: “You don’t have to be a
brilliant fund manager to manage a $5
million fund. You may only have three
properties but when you’re talking
about big growth in the short term it
does put stress on portfolio managers.
The easiest thing to do is spend the
money any old way.
“If a property is worth $1 million as
judged by what the rents say and a trust
is forced to buy the property at, say,
$1.25 million, there is an effective
dramatic dampening of the capital
growth prospects of that property.”
AFT chose to leave the lower end of
the market. Hargraves says: “Because of
the inflated market for some com-
mercial and industrial property, we
made a decision not to
enter the volatile markets
between, say, $2 and 5
million. We thought that
some of these were a bit
overpriced. We took the
decision to develop pro-
perties in 1981.”
In the past year AFT
has conservatively spent
$l5O million on develop-
ments for its trusts. One of
the problems with develop-
ments is that they take
time. A good proportion of
funds must have entered
the fund from its opening of the
prospectus before commitments to a
development can be made. Some build-
ings in a trust may only be “set”
(completed and leased out) for a year or
less before a three-year valuation.
AFT’s re-opening of the Real Prop-
erty Growth No 1 is likely to be
followed by some of the other trusts.
With the $25 million of funds hopefully
raised by the re-opening, Cloran says
the trust will develop a new head-
quarters for Unilever subsidiary Streets
Ice Cream at Arncliffe, NSW. It is due
for completion in June next year.
No 1 also has land available at its
Beacon Hill property in Sydney. AFT
will be looking for a development there
to be set before the next distribution of
bonus units.
One lesson AFT has learned has
been that three years is too infrequent a
valuing period. While AFT’s investors
have waited patiently for news of their
investment, other trusts have stepped in
with valuations as close together as six
months. In a smart move, Australia
Wide Property Trust made its first
revaluation after six months while the
trust was still open. The Royal Mail
House in Melbourne - bought cleverly
and refurbished quickly by the trust -
was revalued for $4.4 to 5.5 million and
a one-for-four bonus granted to unit-

holders which, after front-end and other
charges, meant an effective net gain of
15 percent. The innovation helped the
trust to its closing funds raised of more
than $7O million.
AFT, still conservative or (as Har-
graves prefers) “aggressively prudent,’’
says it will revalue on a two- but not
one-year basis. He says $lOO million
worth of property might cost $130,000
to value. Repetition is costly to the unit-
holders. However, competitors say
every valuation after the first is only a
fraction of the initial cost. Cloran says:
“If you get a reduced rate there is
always the possibility that you are
getting a reduced service.”
AFT will be interested in opening
trusts for six, rather than 12, months
the practice in the latest two Real
Property Growth Trusts. That way, pro-
perty can be bought or
developed more quickly.
As funds are lower, a
bigger percentage of the
trust’s funds can be com-
mitted earlier. The No 4
trust raised $6O million and
the just-closed No 5
around $65 million.
The No 2 growth trust
due for revaluation can be
expected to produce a low
growth rate initially
because of its sheer size.
Open for a year, the trust
raised $122 million, much
of the monies being raised in the second
six months.
One of the No 2 developments, an
industrial complex at Rosebery in
Sydney, was completed only three
months ago. It has only just been set
with the valuation on top of it. AFT is
ready to gear up the trust to maximise
capital returns. Up till now, AFT has
borrowed only $2O million on the $122
million for a gross trust value of $142
million. AFT plans a $2O million shopp-
ing centre at Port Macquarie on NSW’s
north coast which would mean $2O
million more borrowings and $2O
million on to the value of the trust.
The next six months is likely to see
plenty of action from AFT. Cloran says
there are four or five new products
planned. One is likely to be a pubicly
listed trust overdue for AFT.
In April, AFT launched the AFT
Superannuation Property Trust de-

Toyota
HiAce -
from the
No. 1 name
commercial
vehicles.
The feeling of quality and reliability
you get in a Toyota commercial vehicle
is unequalled.
That's why Toyota commercial
vehicle sales are unequalled.
Official figures show that Toyota's
market share* is over 33% of all
commercial vehicle sales-almost three
times its nearest competitor!
Toyota also offers you an unequal-
led range, with over 90 models to
choose from.
So there's always a better chance
you won't have to compromise your
specifications when you buy Toyota.
Vantastic HiAce, with the sixteen
models shown here, is an example of
Toyota's remarkable range.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A shower of golden reports
PROMISING gold reports abound
among the quarterly reviews received in
the past month. The “lulu” of them all
was last week’s news from Placer
Development on the Porgera venture in
mountains 150 km west of Mt Hagen in
Papua New Guinea.
With previously announced reserves
of 59 million tonnes averaging 3.55
gm/tonne of gold and 14.4gm/tonne of
silver, the company reported a new area
where reserves indicated so far could
exceed six million tonnes averaging
Bgm/tonne and open at depth and to
the east. One hole recovered, at a depth
of 196-282 m an 86m intersection
averaging 38.9gm/tonne.
Unfortunately, it’s not for short-term
share punters with limited resources.
Placer owns one-third in equal joint
venture with MIM Holdings and
Renison Consolidated Goldfields. Those
companies have such diverse operations
represented in their scrip that even the
discovery of King Solomon’s mines,
untapped, would be hard-pressed to
move their paper significantly.
Back to the “cheapies,” where we
can see some potential. One that fits the
bill is Aquarius Exploration NL, with an
issued capital of 7.37 million shares and
4 million options expiring in December
1985. (Of the issued shares, 1.9 million
are unlisted.)
Aquarius is a backdoor listing that
returned to the stock exchange on July
19 after Adelaide brokers Goldsmith and
Co sponsored a discounted placement
of 4 million 25c shares at 20c each.
Directors are Jim del Piano (chair-
man) and Sol Mayteles both partners
in the Perth law practice of McLeod and
del Piano geologist and mining
engineer John Clema and public ac-
countant Rob Collins.
In mid-1984, del Piano and friends
paid $150,000 to buy out a group of
prospectors who were near the end of
their tethers with a group of tenements
covering 1750 hectares 90km north-west
of Kalgoorlie and 27km west of Ora
Banda. They retained leading consult-
ant geologist Keith Fox (a consultant to
Metana) to assess the area, known as the
Chadwin gold project.
In a report released in October, he
identified “a major ore target” within an
area known as the Magdala lode system.
Potential was stated as 700,000 tonnes
of 4gm to sgm/tonne ore, on the basis
of 3000 metres of costeans across a
strike length of 700 metres. He added:
“Initial exploration of the remaining
3.3 km strike length suggests that other
similar and possibly larger exploration
targets exist.”
He identified other targets on differ-
ent lode systems within the block.
A reverse circulation drilling pro-
gram began within the past fortnight
and initial results are expected early
next week.
I took some heart from several of the
prospectors who had sold their interests
in the block being among the sub-
scribers to the Goldsmith placement. I
ordered 4000 to 38c. The shares have
traded this year from 25c up to a recent
high of 42c and the lightly traded
options (exerciseable at 25c) last traded
at 18c.
Apart from that, one of our oil punts
Abrolhos Oil is approaching an
interesting watershed with its 15 percent
in Moothandella No 2 on ATP 240 P in
the Cooper-Eromanga basins.
The well, with Crusader as operator,
is 1.75 km east-north-east of Mooth-
andella No 1 which produced hy-
drocarbon shows.
We bought Abrolhos because of its
participation in an 11-well program
which began in September. Its first three
chances have been disappointing but we
live in hope.

THE MD-80. THE TOP CHOKE FOR THE BOTTOM UNE.


.
For maximum profit, appeal to passengers and for return on investment, 28 airlines
around the world already have selected the quiet, fuel-efficient MD-80.
Here's why: The MD-80 flies 25% more seat miles per gallon of fuel than any older
aircraft it is replacing. The operational versatility of the MD-80 family offers
exceptional service options for airlines. And passengers consistently praise its
comfort. In independent surveys, they prefer it by more than three-to-one over
its competitors.
The traits that give the MD-80 family superior economics for airlines make it more
attractive for investors. MD-80s continue the McDonnell Douglas tradition of
quality and longevity that has made our twin-jets hold higher residual values than
competing aircraft.
The new MD-80. When we designed it, we made sure that one of its most
beautiful lines would be the bottom line—where profits are.

WILDCAT
Steeling a march on the outsiders
FEW PEOPLE could have been sur-
prised when the Queensland govern-
ment last week selected a home town
company to build a steel processing
facility instead of backing other more
obvious contenders.
But hardly anybody south of the
Tweed River was familiar with the
Queensland company that got the nod
for the $66 million project Quest
Corporation Pty Ltd.
Queensland’s Minister for Industry
Terry Ahern was quoted in the Brisbane
newspapers as saying the cabinet was
satisfied that Quest “a heavyweight
group that stacks up well” had the
financial, management, marketing and
technical resources to build and operate
Queensland’s first steel-making facility.
Quest, in fact, is a company owned
by a consortium known as the Cur-
rumbin Engineering Group, which
employs 85 people on an annual
turnover of around $6 million.
Currumbin directors comprise chair-
man and managing-director Terry
McComb, two partners in the Brisbane
legal firm of M. G. Lyons and Co
Michael Lyons and Liam Walsh
finance director Michael Geraghty,
group marketing manager John Spence
Thomas and technical director David
Carey.
Currumbin has a boatbuilding yard
on the Gold Coast (it recently com-
pleted a $4 million dredge for Con-
solidated Rutile), a 7.5-hectare industrial
estate, a gas distribution business in
northern NSW and small structural
steel shop in Mt Isa.
The Currumbin proposal won the
government’s endorsement ahead of
three rival submissions entered as a
result of a government invitation:
■ One from BHP to build a $4O
million steel rolling mill to be fed with
billets from Newcastle but no steel-
making capacity. BHP is going ahead
with its plant regardless.
■ An offer from the Hanwright part-
nership to install a turn-key mini-plant
from overseas, but in support of this
free enterprise initiative Lang Hancock
sought various government guarantees.
■ Northstar International of the US
proposed a 300,000-tonne plant for
Gladstone using a new but not yet
extensively operated direct reduction
process.
In the upshot the Currumbin group
will retain less than 10 percent equity in
the project and Sydney broker Bain and
Co has been commissioned to find other
Australian partners to finance the initial
100,000-tonnes-a-year plant to be based
on scrap steel.
Drink-tank
AN IDEA that developed over a few
beers in Perth some years ago has won
the support of McDonnell Douglas
Corporation and secured the fortunes of
two more West Australian millionaires.
At a reception in Sydney last week,
to mark their impending back-door
listing on to the stock exchange,
German-born engineer Gene Kostecki
recalled a drink-time conversation four
years ago with George Browne,
principal of Mine Spares a business
that supplies exactly what it says.
They decided to pool some resources
and look for opportunities in a “high
technology” area. They engaged a team
of talented technicians in their early 30s
and one of them Harry Spence-Bate
came up with a microfiche system
which can store and receive documents
and drawings in assorted sizes and
colors. The first of their patented cam-
era systems was sold last month in
Perth. Another three of the systems
(price $100,000) are being built two
for the West Australian government and
one for McDonnell Douglas.
Once their product had been per-
fected, the two entrepreneurs went off to
the world to assess the market. Through
Australian Trade Commission offices in
America they came to the notice of the
giant aerospace conglomerate which
has agreed to become US business co-
ordinator for the product and negotia-
tions are under way to appoint dis-
tributors in 35 other countries.
Kostecki told Wildcat that his com-
pany Cameronics Enterprises ex-
pected to be producing between 20 and
30 units a month by July-August next
year.
A major target is the US micro-
graphics market which runs to SUS2OOO
million sales a year.
The enterprise is about to be back-
door listed through the shell of the old
wine maker and timber company Cal-
derman Ltd, which is now suspended. It
will be renamed Cameronics Technology
Corp Ltd, having acquired the Perth
business in a share issue which will
leave the promoters with 89 percent of
the capital. It is then planned to place
with the public 500,000 shares at up to
$2 a share which would lift the listed
company’s issued capital to 5.16 million
shares.
Pennant’s waving
ANOTHER Perth-based business an-
nounced a float last week when prop-
erty developer Brian Johnson revealed


plans in Sydney to offer the public a
share in a ssl million property trust.
A 54-year-old civil engineer, John-
son founded his business in Western
Australia 10 years ago when he left
Leighton Holdings and began contract-
ing around the North West. In 1981, he
went public as Pennant Holdings Ltd
and still holds more than 50 percent of
that company with its market capitalisa-
tion of $34 million.
Pennant Holdings will inject the bulk
of its property portfolio into the trust,
which plans to raise $22 million from
the public, bringing its total capitalisa-
tion to $5l million. The remaining $29
million or 57 percent will be retained by
Pennant. In the future, however, the
trust will undertake its own develop-
ments in conjunction with its manager-
parent and thus should get the benefits
of expected developer profits.
According to the prospectus
(underwritten by Mclntosh Griffin
Hamson Wallace Smith and Co), the first
four properties developed within the
trust will cost $33.19 million but have
been independently valued on a com-
plete basis at $37,465,000.
In its first full year (1985-86), the
trust expects to distribute 11c a $1 unit
and achieve a compound rate of growth
of 12.7 percent. □
THE CHARTIST
Brighter outlook for big miners
by Russell Lander
PEKO SHED its primary downtrend
some weeks ago, for no apparent
reason. This was to be a precursor to
similar breaking of downtrends by the
other large mining groups during the
week ended November 9 and by the
metals index itself.
The accompanying four weekly bar
charts, reproduced by courtesy of
Bridge Data, illustrate some of these
reversals and point up the large bases
which have been taking shape in the
base metals sector since May 1984.
They also show that the 15-week
moving average lines denoted by
asterisks have been broken on the
topside and have themselves turned up.
These bases have the potential to sire
substantial rises as they are very broad.
Linear measurements of their heights
give the following approximate upside
targets: Metals index, 630: North
Broken Hill, $3.05; CRA, $7.00; and
Western Mining, $4.50. These possible
values compare with the real (some
would say hard, cruel) world as follows:
Metals index, 505; Norths, $2.37; CRA,
$5.50; and WMC, $3.40.
The writer always feels less confident
about giving upside targets on charts
than on the downside as it takes money
to take stocks up the hill whereas
withdrawal of buying suffices to lower a
market. Nevertheless there would seem
to be plenty of money available for
stockmarket action at present with the
banks flush and with the real estate
market by all accounts marking time
and therefore not deflecting interest
from the stockmarket.
Changes in investor sentiment are
always hard to fathom except after a
safe elapse of time. Nevertheless, the
rekindling of interest in those former
pariahs the mining heavies appears to
owe something to a marginal improve-
ment in lead and copper prices in US
dollars, to a marked fall in recent weeks
in London Metal Exchange stockpiles
of copper, lead and zinc and to lower
interest rates in the US which could
enable processors to increase their
metal inventories. Renewed interest in
WMC probably arises through a slight
upward flicker in gold and a marginal
improvement in the nickel market.

THE MODEST FARMER
Click go the shears, click go the cash registers
by Bert Kelly
RECENTLY I told a Labor Party
minister that if Australian factories were
run as we ran our shearing sheds the
world would not see which way we went
and we would not have to prOp up so
many of our secondary industries with
tariffs.
He replied that he found shearing
sheds to be demeaning places! I have
been worrying about this ever since.
For a while I thought he meant that
he found the shameful brutality as-
sociated with the wide-comb dispute to
be demeaning but, on further question-
ing, I discovered his comment was not
associated with this example of blind
stupidity.
Instead, it was directed at the way
shearers work hard to make a lot of
money. He seemed to find it demeaning
that the piece work system should have
this rewarding result.
When I was in parliament, I always
tried to get home for at least one or two
days at shearing time, and each time I
came away tired, dirty and happy. I
used to make a special effort to get to the
shed about 7.20 am which is pretty early
for a statesman to get going. Instead of
everyone bowing low at my arrival, I
would be greeted by a gruff “G’day”
and the shearers would go on with
fiddling with their gear as shearers
always do, while criticising the weather,
the sheep, the shed, the government and
particularly the income tax. Then one
would say, “Funny smell around here,”
and his mate would reply, “It must be a
new kind of rouseabout. They have to
put up with what they can get these
days.”
That was all the welcome I got or,
indeed, expected. I would have been
suspicious if it had been more fulsome.
Then at 7.30 they started shearing
and if I got behind with picking up the
fleeces or with the broom, there would
be dark mutterings about the decadence
of modern woolpickers. They worked
hard, very hard, and so did I.
But we all worked well together in a
good-humored and effective way which
I found very satisfying after the
bitchiness of parliament. But the Labor
minister found this kind of behaviour
demeaning. Why?
I suppose he found it so because the
shearers were getting a dollar a sheep,
so if they worked hard they made a lot
of money. But they did not have to work
hard; they could have just coasted along
and, indeed, if it got really hot, this was
what they did. But they worked hard if
they wanted to. What is so demeaning
about that?
It is doing just that, working hard to
make money, that made us one of the
wealthiest countries in the world earlier
this century and it is the distrust of
working hard to make money that is
now causing us to slip further and
further behind the rest of the world.
I know that, in some industries, the
history of piece work has not always
been happy but it works well with
shearing. What efforts are we making to
see if there are other industries where it
would suit management and men? Or,
failing piece work, what is wrong with a
bonus system which seems to work so
well in Japan and Korea. The more
profitable the factory is, the more
money its workers make. What is wrong
with that?
In the view of union stalwarts, I
suppose, it is demeaning but what about
asking the men who would make the
extra money? What kind of efforts are
the Industrial Relations Club members
making to find profit-sharing op-
portunities in factories?
I suppose they are fearful that the
ACTU might be cross with them if they
did so or perhaps they are too busy
grooming old Bruce, the industrial rela-
tions dinosaur, to look around for other
better ways of doing things lest they
make the poor animal redundant and
then they would lose their lofty place in
life.
I could not understand how a Labor
Party minister could think like that until
I discovered that he migrated here from
Britain and so came to us, as so many
union stalwarts do, with a great-class-
conscious chip on his shoulder. He is
probably still brooding on half
forgotten, far-off things and battles long
ago.
His view of the way we conduct our
shearing may be related to a fear that
shearers, by working hard to make a lot
of money, may turn into little capitalists
and then into big capitalists and this
would not suit his class classification of
workers.
When I write out the shearers’
cheques I think that this will probably
happen. When I think how hard they
work I know they certainly ought to get
on in life.
But for the life of me I cannot see
anything demeaning with this kind of
behaviour. □

PIERPONT
Taxing the brain
AT MANY a lunch in this wicked old
world, Pierpont has been left holding
the bill but never as impressively as the
other week.
Your correspondent was lunching at
the Croesus Club with a broker who
rejoices in the impenetrable pseudonym
of Hiss and who was taking the op-
portunity to relax after a long campaign
to take over AOD. We had just reached
the coffee and ports when a waitress
approached.
She said: “I’m afraid you’re wanted
on the phone, sir” and Hiss departed,
leaving Pierpont to pierce the Ramon
Allones.
Hiss returned with the immortal line:
“They’ve just crossed 17 million AOD
and our bid’s in jeopardy. My place is
on the trading floor.” And he galloped
off, not even pausing to wipe his mouth,
leaving your correspondent stuck with
the freight for food and drink plus two
Ramon Allones.
Sure enough he dashed back to the
exchange, bid AOD up and saved the
grand old company for the right people.
One more port and it would have fallen
to the enemy.
It is the best excuse Pierpont has ever
seen for ducking a lunch bill and has
given your correspondent the glimmer-
ings of a new career. If anyone out there
is planning another takeover, Pierpont
is prepared on the crucial day to
take the rival broker out to an expansive
lunch at some inaccessible hostelry.
Pierpont’s subsequent fee will be one of
the larger costs of the takeover.
LEFT slack-jawed at the Croesus Club
with the afternoon still a pup, your
correspondent began reading a paper
prepared by a Sydney barrister (who
had better remain nameless for pro-
fessional reasons) on recent changes to
the tax laws.
Pierpont would have said offhand
that he had seen so many high-handed
excesses committed by the Australian
Taxation Office that he was beyond
surprise at any fresh horror. However,
he was shocked to learn of the import of
the Taxation Laws Amendment Act
1984.
Under Section BZF, a corporation
convicted of keeping incorrect records
with an intent to deceive or of falsifying
or concealing identity with intent to
deceive can be fined up to $25,000 for a
first offence and $50,000 for a sub-
sequent offence.
Having known a few falsifiers in his
time, Pierpont is not inclined to argue
with these penalties. However, under
Section 8W (the draftsman obviously
had some difficulty with the alphabet),
the corporation can be ordered to pay
the taxman double or treble the amount
of tax sought to be avoided by the
corporation or by some other person.
So far, so good except that any
corporation pursued in this grim man-
ner by the tax man will soon be incap-
able of paying any dividends to its poor
old shareholders.
But all readers should pay attention
to sub-section 5(1), which says:
“Where a corporation does or omits
to do an act or thing the doing or
omission of which constitutes a
taxation offence, a person (by
whatever name called and whether
or not the person is an officer of the
corporation) who is concerned in,
or takes part in, the management of
the corporation shall be deemed to
have committed the taxation offence
and is punishable accordingly.”
Sub-section 5(3) further provides:
“... an officer of a corporation shall
be presumed, unless the contrary is
proved, to be concerned in, and to
take part in, the management of the
corporation.”
Pierpont can see the taxman’s aim
clearly enough. Often when a company
commits fraud, the guiding spirit may
be an individual who is not one of the
directors or the chief executive or even
formally connected with the company.
But, to arm himself in such cases, the
tax man has been given a weapon with a
very wide range indeed. Literally
anybody whom the tax man thinks has
been connected with the management of
a dodgy company will be liable to be
prosecuted for these offences.
Officers of the company have the
onus of proving that they were not
involved in the management. This re-
verses the previous common law rule.
Thus, if a corporation is convicted of
a taxation offence, all persons “con-
cerned” with the management will be
deemed to have committed the offence
also and are guilty unless proven
otherwise. And, if the corporation is
convicted of having sought to mislead
the tax man by keeping incorrect books,
the maximum sentence is two years’ jail.
It is a defence if the accused can prove
that he did not “aid, abet, counsel or
procure” the act or omission and that he
was not in any way, by act or omission,
directly or indirectly “knowingly con-
cerned in or party to the act or omis-
sion.”
In Crown cases, the case against the
defendant normally has to be proved
beyond reasonable doubt. Here, the
onus of proof is on the defendant and
the standard of proof required is on the
balance of probabilities.
Anybody convicted of such an
offence is barred for five years from
becoming a director or promoter.
Worse is to come under sub-section
8W(2). This provides that, where a
person is convicted and the court is
satisfied that he was trying to avoid a
tax liability of his own or of another
person, the court may impose as an
additional penalty an order to pay the
tax man double or treble the amount of
tax sought to be avoided.
So somebody who does not even


work for a company may, if he fails to
prove to the court that he was not
“concerned” in its management, may
wind up with a couple of years’ jail and
a treble tax bill. In all ordinary cir-
cumstances, he might as well jump off
his window-ledge straight away and
save himself the agony of the sub-
sequent bankruptcy proceedings.
This draconic little act comes into
effect on December 14. Its passage
through parliament may serve as an
index of how effective that institution is
in preserving our liberties.
When it was first introduced on
September 13 by Chris Hurford, the
minister assisting the Treasurer,
Hurford spoke about such aspects of the
legislation as transfers of losses within
company groups. The Law Council of
Australia was properly horrified at the
reversal of the onus of proof and wrote
to the Treasurer, who appears to have
ignored the protest.
A 206-page Act incorporating many
complex changes to our tax laws would
seem to Pierpont to require long and
careful consideration but, in Canberra,
it received scant attention.
Debate resumed on October 2, just
19 days after Hurford had introduced
the Bill. In the three-hour debate the
Bill was debated in conjunction with
something called the Income Tax (In-
ternational Agreements) Amendments
Bill the opposition spokesman, John
Howard, criticised the reversal of the
onus but supported the Bill. Replying,
Hurford defended the reversal of the
onus of proof on the grounds that
similar provisions existed in 200 other
commonwealth laws.
This worries Pierpont even more
than does sub-section 5(3). Obviously,
the process of abandoning English law
in favor of the Code Napoleon is much
further advanced in Australia than
Pierpont realised.
It did not worry our legislators,
though. They shoved the Bill through
and adjourned for the election. □
CHESS
Clairvoyance not required
by Terrey Shaw
PLAYERS often worry about not being
able to analyse far enough ahead. How-
ever, the ability to see ahead is far less
important than being able to evaluate a
given position.
Most computer chess programs are a
perfect example of this. It’s com-
paratively easy for a computer to work
out, given the rules and a starting
position, what can legally happen.
Nevertheless, until recently, the top
human players (who, in the majority of
variations, would be calculating fewer
than five moves ahead) would regularly
trounce computers analysing, say, eight
moves ahead in every line.
Some positions are so complex and
unclear that you would be doing well to
analyse ahead more than a move or two
with any certainty. Others contain virtu-
ally forced series of moves which can be
anticipated. In the following game,
played in 1922, Alexander Alekhine
claimed to have worked out (from the
diagram position) a variation more than
20 moves deep!
More importantly, he correctly
evaluated this future position as a win
for Black. But such a claim should be
treated with caution Alekhine’s com-
binative vision was known often to
improve with hindsight.

WORLD AFFAIRS
An African
Nightmare
Famine sweeps the continent, killing hundreds of
thousands of people and endangering millions more.
When a Red Cross relief station opened
three weeks ago in Bati, a remote
township in northern Ethiopia, the local
population quickly swelled from 3,000 peo-
ple to 15,000 —all of them hungry. “Today
it’s 25,000, and they’re still coming,”
George Reid of the Red Cross said last
Help in Bati: Some children forgot how to eat
JOHN ISAAC— UNITED NATIONS
week. Only the relatively fit make it to Bati.
“One woman I met left home with her four
children after her husband died, ” Getachew
Araya, general secretary of the Ethiopian
Red Cross, reported after visiting Bati.
“Three of them died on the road. The day
after she arrived, the last child died. This is
normal in Bati. . . Last Friday I drove south
from Bati to Addis. Starving children were
lying on the road to stop food trucks. It took
me five hours to travel 28 miles.”
At times this year, it almost seemed
that the entire population of Mozambique
was on the move —all 14 million of them,
searching for food. From countless “dead
villages,” dusty columns of lame, gaunt Af-
ricans trudged through the bush, some of
them already blinded by malnutrition and
clinging to their neighbors. “We have been
hungry for three years,” said a peasant
woman named Elisa Ferro. “I have forgot-
ten what it feels like to have a full belly.”
In Mauritania, the earth and the sky
meld into a uniform gray. In barely 20
years, the West African country has lost
more than three-quarters of its grazing
land to the encroaching sands of the Sa-
hara. Rainfall has become another forgot-
ten luxury. Last year’s precipitation was
the lowest in 70 years, and most of the
grain crop failed. In some areas, 90 percent
of the livestock died olf. Now it is the
people who are going hungry.
It is the worst famine in African history.
Two vast belts of drought have spread across
the continent, parching the land and starv-
ing its inhabitants. Nearly 30 countries are
officially listed as hungry, and in some of
them, whole populations are in danger of
extinction. Already, as many as 200,000
people may have died in Mozambique. In
Ethiopia, the famine has helped kill at least
300,000 people, and an additional million
may perish before the disaster is over. But
the numbers are little more than guesswork.
The precise dimensions of the tragedy re-
main unknown, merely suggested by the
horror stories that trickle out of the back
country or by the haggard hordes that ap-
pear almost nightly on Western television.
“What we know,” the acting secretary-gen-
eral of the Organization of African Unity,
Peter Onu, said last week, “is that millions of
our people are starving and hundreds of
thousands are dying because we are no long-
er able to provide our own staple food. ’ ’
There is something hideously wrong
about people dying of famine when others
have more food than they know what to do
FRILET —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
Ethiopian children wait for food at the relief


camp in Korem; Emergency food supplies were finally on the way, but for many peasants in the war-torn back cuntry, it was already far too late


Ethiopian refugees crossing into Sudan, a mother tending her suffering child: The precise dimensions of the tragedy remain unknown
with. Tony Hall, an Ohio congressman, re-
turned from a visit to Ethiopia last week
complaining about precisely that inequity.
“It is unconscionable,” he said at a press
conference, “that people on the other side of
the globe should die of starvation while
mountains of food —yes, literally moun-
tains of food—pile up in our silos and ware-
houses.” Last week the mountain was final-
ly moving. In a vast outpouring of concern
and generosity, relief agencies were deluged
with contributions. Ethiopia, the country
whose plight has received the most publicity
so far, was swamped with more food than it
could handle efficiently. But many Ethiopi-
ans were too far gone to be saved. “It was too
late for many six months ago,” a British
relief worker said recently. “It is too late for
others today and too late for many
tomorrow.”
Warnings: The last big African famine
occurred only 10 years ago—leading,
among other things, to the overthrow of
Ethiopia’s Emperor Haile Selassie and the
creation of a Marxist state. About 300,000
Africans died in that famine, and at the time,
some relief workers vowed that it would
never happen again. The experts insist that
famine is predictable, manageable and even
preventable. But not this time. The first
warnings of impending disaster, issued two
years ago, were largely ignored by Western
governments, relief agencies and news me-
dia —and by the Ethiopian regime itself. It
was only last month that a British Broad-
casting Corp. film alerted the world to a
tragedy that, by then, was well under way in
Ethiopia and other black African countries.
Drought is, of course, a normal occur-
rence in Africa. But the effects are steadily
getting worse because of Africa’s deepening
poverty, booming population and abuse of
the land itself. Some Africans agree that
part of the damage is self-inflicted —that
mismanagement, corruption and civil strife
aggravate the natural disasters that have

JOHN ISAAC— UNITED NATIONS
always beset their societies. It is
no coincidence that some of the nations
suffering most from the current famine—
Ethiopia, Mozambique, Chad, Angola—
have been embroiled in civil war for years.
None of that will change quickly. Nor will
the famine go away overnight; with the best
of weather, the hunger is likely to last until
this time next year. “Even after the harvest
then, substantial numbers of people will still
need food,” says Klaus Wiersing of the
United Nations Disaster Relief Organiza-
tion (UNDRO). “It won’t be enough to feed
people now and then forget about them.”
The rains finally came to Kenya in Octo-
ber, and last week parts of Mozambique
were soaked by a downpour. The hunger
remained. In Mozambique, village children
were catching and eating tiny sparrows.
Even the birds were emaciated, and they
were becoming fewer in number. Kenya, a
more prosperous country, has been able to
limit human deaths. But hundreds of thou-
sands of cattle, sheep and goats have died,
reducing the country’s food potential for
the next few years. Even with rain, Kenya
must continue to rely on imported grain.
‘All Our Fault*: Cruel dilemmas come up
all over central and southern Africa these
days. Zimbabwe, where crop and cattle
losses are heavy, has been swamped by
50,000 refugees from neighboring Mozam-
bique. Now the government has ordered
its border patrols to turn back starving
Mozambicans, “ruthlessly if necessary.”
“They treat us as though the drought is
all our fault,” complains one of the
refugees, Maria Ntape. Dr. Simbi Mubako,


Perez de Cuellar and his wife watch grain distribution in Bati: ‘Mountains of food’ were piled up in the warehouses of the West
Zimbabwe’s minister of home affairs, main-
tains: “We cannot improve the living stand-
ards of our own citizens if foreigners keep
adding to the numbers.”
Living standards are declining every-
where. For three years, Jane Comstock, a
Peace Corps desk officer, has been watching
Niger deteriorate. “Now it’s really astound-
ing,” she says, recalling a September visit.
“There are people eating on three- and four-
day cycles: the children eat once every three
days, and the adults eat once every four
days.” Comstock also reports signs of a
cholera epidemic in Niger, Mali, Burkina
Faso (fortnerly Upper Volta) and Senegal.
Triage: In Ethiopia, relief supplies were
beginning to show up in quantity, and digni-
taries like U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar arrived to show their con-
cern. The first food trucks reached the
northern town of Korem in a military con-
voy, for protection against rebels. “We had
been here for eight months, screaming for
food, and yet none was arriving,” Dr. Mi-
chel Corvalet, a French physician who
works at the Korem refugee camp, said by
telephone from Addis Ababa. More than
50,000 people were waiting at the camp for
food, and there wasn’t enough to go around.
Before the convoy came in, about 100 peo-
ple were dying every day; afterward the
average dropped to somewhere between 30
and 50. Doctors were forced to perform a
gruesome act of triage, selecting only the
hardiest refugees to receive food and cloth-
ing. The physicians would work their way
through the teeming crowds, using marking
pencils to place crosses on the foreheads of
those who stood the best chance of survival.
Aid could not be wasted on the weak.
The refugees squatted out of doors, ex-
posed to the fierce daytime sun and the
harsh cold air that settles over the moun-
tainsides at night. The food station at Ala-
mata attracted more than 5,000 members of
the nomadic Afar tribe, who line up each

day for a small ration of grain. They weren’t
allowed to stay inside the compound at
night, for fear that they might admit rebel
attackers. They weren’t allowed to build
huts outside the compound, for fear that
they will settle down; the government wants
them to go back to where they came from.
Diseases: Many refugees were so debilitat-
ed that they could not swallow or digest
food when it finally became available to
them. The answer was “wet-feeding”—
mixing grain with water } so that it will go
down easier—but in many'camps there was
a shortage of clean water. Some small chil-
dren had a slightly different problem: they
had to be hand-fed because they had forgot-
ten how to eat. Starvation brought other
ailments with it, including influenza, mea-
sles, tuberculosis, diarrhea, smallpox, ty-
phus and kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency
that lightens the skin, reddens the hair and
bloats the bellies of malnourished children.
In most refugee camps, there was no medi-
cine for such maladies. At Alamata, a group
of mothers recently brought their children
in for treatment of pneumonia. “I am sor-
ry,” said Dr. George Ngatire, a Kenyan.
“There is nothing I can do. I know your
children need treatment, but I have nothing
to treat them with. Come back in five days.”
Getting food to Ethiopia was a lot easier
than actually delivering it to the people
most in need. The main port at Assab and
the airfield at Addis Ababa were badly
jammed. Roads leading to the interior were
clogged, and there was a shortage of vehi-
cles and fuel. “Sometimes it is a question of
too much at once without coordination,”

“At the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital, we found that HP
was the one company which
could satisfy our need to
follow patient progress with
instantaneous, accurate
data.”
Dr. Diana Horvath, Medical Director
of the hospital, refers to the installation
of HP's intensive care patient data
monitoring system and the E.C.G.
Management system.
"We looked at several companies and
chose Hewlett-Packard. HP's systems
provide us with meaningful, readily
accessible information. Now we can
identify things that will cause patient
problems and head off many potential
emergencies.
"The automated monitoring system has
made us much more efficient because the
semi-manual system could not provide us
with essential data so quickly and easily.
"Most importantly, both systems enable
patient care staff to devote more of their
attention to patients rather than tying up
valuable time with clerical functions. We
are more productive and able to spend
more time caring for patients than before.
“HP’s back-up and support has
been excellent. They have readily
adjusted their own timetable to suit
ours and instigated a thorough
training programme which ensured
staff were totally at ease and
confident in the systems.
Consequently, we have built a close
and rewarding relationship with HP.”

satisfaction levels are very high. Because
the system is easy to use, it has taken the
drudgery out of their working day, and
made the staff more totally involved in
their jobs.
"Now our programmers are able to
produce extremely productive systems in
a very short space of time.
"And the equipment is remarkably hardy
- we use it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
"The quality we are talking about is most
impressive. In terms of technical
excellence and innovation, I believe HP
have distinguished themselves.

Hans Einhaus, the director of UNDRO,
said in Geneva. “The response in the case of
Ethiopia was magnificent, but now we have
54 aircraft waiting to be unloaded at an
airport which normally can deal with just
three or four planes a day. Everyone wants
to be the first to send in relief, but that is not
always a good thing. There are cases of
wasted food, although it is difficult for us to
say so because of the danger that people
might stop giving.”
Whisky: Not all of the relief supplies were
appropriate. The Soviet Union contributed
10,000 tons of rice, which Ethiopians don’t
like. A British shipment turned out to in-
clude cases of whisky, apparently intended
for delegates to last week’s OAU summit in
Addis Ababa. “With everyone getting into
the assistance act, there often are serious
problems,” says one relief
official. “The various agen-
cies within the U.N. com-
pete against each other for
image-building purposes,
preferring to send their own
individual shipments with-
out any clear notion of how
the food or other aid can
ever get to the actual people
in need.” Sometimes the
same criticism is made of
private, voluntary agencies,
which depend upon the con-
tributions generated by a
sympathetic public reponse
to disasters. “One agency in
a certain recent case flew in
150 tons of food when
150,000 tons were re-
quired,” says Einhaus. “If
that had been put together
with donations by others,
the total could have beep
reached and distributed. T,
But private organizations?-’' 1
like official agencies, some-
times don’t care to submerge their own
identities in a common cause.
In this case, the Ethiopian government
was partly to blame for the severity of the
disaster. In 1982 the country’s leader, Lt.
Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, was warned
of impending famine in a report from a
group of experts headed by Keith Griffin, an
Oxford University economist. The Griffin
team recommended immediate food ration-
ing and heavy new emphasis on rural devel-
opment. Mengistu ignored the advice. In-
stead, he poured 46 percent of Ethiopia’s
gross national product into military spend-
ing, buying at least $2-5 billion worth of
arms from the Soviet Union. What invest-
ment he did make in agriculture was concen-
trated on building Soviet-style state farms—
hardly a promising model, in view of the fact
that the Soviets can’t even feed themselves.
When the famine began, Mengistu’s regime
covered it up, apparently to keep from spoil-
ing the $250 million party for the 10th
anniversary of the revolution. Only when
the celebration was over did the government
allow foreign journalists to visit areas that,
by then, were blighted by famine.
Tittle Commies’: The United States re-
sponded slowly at first to the looming crisis.
At the World Bank meeting last September,
France proposed a special-aid program for
Africa. “The Americans weren’t interested,
to say the least,” recalls Dominique Brustel,
an official of the French Ministry for Coop-
eration. “They blocked the funds.” Critics
of the Reagan administration charge that
Ethiopia’s status as a Soviet ally inhibited
U.S. relief. “The hungry kids are seen by
some as ‘little commies,’ so the grain just sits
there,” charges Democratic Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont.
So far, the administration has refused to
tap a reserve grain stock that was created
last year for emergencies like the African

FRILET —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
famine. But it has donated grain from other
sources. Last week, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID) ear-
marked 137,000 tons of grain, worth $57.5
million, for Ethiopia, Mozambique, Mauri-
tania and Chad. In terms of tonnage, U.S.
food aid in the current fiscal year, which
began only on Oct. 1, already exceeds the
amount donated during the entire previous
year. The political overtones, however, are
loud and clear. “The word is out that the
West delivers the food,” boasts AID admin-
istrator M. Peter McPherson, who recently
returned from Ethiopia. Other American
officials still hope that U.S. relief may repre-
sent “a threat to Soviet hegemony over Ethi-
opia,” as one of them puts it.
Africa’s dependence on relief aid will
probably grow in the years ahead. A study
issued last week by the Swedish Red Cross
and by Earthscan, a London-based environ-
mental news service, reports that “events
called ‘natural disasters’ are killing more
and more people every year. Yet there is no
evidence that the climatological mecha-
nisms associated with droughts, floods and
cyclones are changing.” Instead, the report
says that the effects of natural disasters are
worsened by poverty, environmental dam-
age and rapid population growth.
Black Africa is the world’s poorest area,
and it is the only region in which the popula-
tion is growing faster than the food supply.
Agriculture never fully recovered from the
devastating drought of a decade ago. In
1982, Ethiopia’s per capita food production
was only 81 percent of what it was in 1969-
1971; in Mozambique, the figure was 68
percent. On average, African governments
spend four times as much on armaments as
they do on agriculture. Primitive farming, in
turn, has devastated the environment.
Under increasing pressure for produc-
tion, traditional fallow periods have been
shortened, wearing out the
soil. Most farmers have no
chemical fertilizers, and the
animal dung that they once
used to enrich the soil is now
being burned for fuel be-
cause so many trees have
been cut down. “With de-
forestation, the soil loses
much of its capacity to re-
tain moisture and conse-
quently its productivity and
resistance to drought,” says
U.N. environmentalist Sei-
fulaziz L. Milas.
A Bumper Crop: There is
reason to believe that relief
shipments, though neces-
sary, only aggravate the fun-
damental problems. “Food
aid saves lives but can also
undermine long-term local
self-sufficiency,” says the
Earthscan report. The study
concludes that “disaster as-
sistance must go hand in
hand with development as-
sistance.” There is much that could be done.
Many African nations ought to raise their
artificially low food prices to encourage
farmers. Large areas need reforestation.
Many countries should strike a better bal-
ance between food crops and cash crops
raised for export; Chad recently reaped a
bumper cotton harvest, but its people are
dying for want of home-grown food.
Above all, governments must spend mon-
ey on agricultural development. “I believe
Africa can become a granary for a large part
of the world, but there has not been a very
major investment until now,” William
Clark, president of the International Insti-
tute for Environment and Development,
said recently. Time is running out. Without
the right investment of effort and money,
Black Africa is more likely to become a
charnel house than a granary.

A Five-Point Plan for Action
By Dr. JEAN MAYER
Once again, the African example re-
minds us that the melancholy rule of
one famine a year—from droughts, floods,
earthquakes, plant diseases, locusts, civil
or foreign wars —is still operative. Yet
each new famine is dealt with as if it were a
completely new phenomenon. In fact we
could, in most cases, predict famines,
prevent them and, even if this fails, at
least cope with them in much more effec-
tive ways than we do now. Here are five
basic steps that need to be taken:
Establish an Early-Warning System:
First, we need a system that will identi-
fy potential shortages before it is
too late. This system should be based
on data on weather, agricultural and
economic conditions, as well as the
health of vulnerable segments of a pop-
ulation. Continuous monitoring of glob-
al weather is done for the airlines; these
data could be transmitted to famine-
monitoring organizations, such as the
United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization, by the International Civ-
il Aviation Organization. The monitor-
ing agencies could then correlate in-
coming information to estimate coming
droughts. Communications satellites
could also be used to monitor changes
in the color of vegetation.
Surveillance of crop prices in threat-
ened areas can also provide a delicate
index of impending food shortages.
Famines usually strike a population
whose nutritional status is marginal to
begin with. The state of growth and
health of poor children is, sadly, a fairly
sensitive indicator of approaching dis-
aster. This information should be
passed on routinely to the World
Health Organization (WHO), as is al-
ready done with data on infectious dis-
eases. The WHO is the best candidate
because political entities see famines in
partisan terms: governments minimize the
danger, and opposition parties may exag-
gerate it. In Ethiopia, the Marxist govern-
ment has behaved just as Emperor Haile
Selassie’s regime did, hiding the growing
famine from the world until very late.
Mobilize Grain Reserves: Famines can be
prevented if we act in time. We have done
it once or twice, in India in the mid-19605,
for example. At present, in the United
States, we have grain surpluses in abun-
dance. All that has to be done is to get the
food to where it is needed as quickly as
possible. There are always grain ships on
the high seas. If the rich countries that
import grain (such as Japan or Saudi Ara-
bia) could establish sufficient reserves to
meet a temporary shortage nearby, ships
could be diverted to a famine region (as
they were in 1974 to Bangladesh). This
would gain a lot of time in combating
food crises, particularly if governments
and international organizations have de-
veloped at least a model of a distribution
method. Military commanders could play
a helpful role, since they are trained to
move men and materials. There is also a
great need for logistical support. I have
seen a number of famines, and in each
instance the limited availability of skilled
mechanics and spare parts for trucks,
Famine’s deadly embrace: A need for assistance

in the end, inhibited the relief effort.
Settle the Population: Past experience
shows that once a famine has struck, peo-
ple start moving around the country in
search of food, generally to where the
hospitals are. The social breakdown that
develops makes the famine harder to cope
with and the re-establishment of order
more difficult. Children are lost. People
drink ditch water, and epidemics spread.
Adolescents form foraging gangs, attack-
ing food convoys; once these youngsters
have had a taste of successful banditry,
they are hard to rehabilitate after the crisis
is over. All this makes it imperative to keep
local populations in place by creating addi-
tional first-aid stations, staffed by nurses
and medical students, as a form of reassur-
ance. However, relief convoys will not be
safe unless police, drivers and other work-
ers are assured of food supplies for them-
selves and their families. Price control is
useful only when food becomes available
again. An information network on food
stocks must be cast over the affected area
so that relief work can be most effective.
Centralize Relief Efforts: All this argues
for one person to be in charge, both of
national efforts and of coordinating inter-
national relief work. Lately, the U.N.’s
organizations have worked better together,
usually under the direction of country rep-
resentatives. But if the activities of volun-
tary agencies are not coordinated to the
same extent, their efforts will lack effec-
tiveness. We also need an international
agreement that starvation will not be used
as an instrument to wage foreign or civil
war. Relief workers need to be able to
bring food supplies freely through the
battle lines in famine-affected war
areas, like Eritrea in northern Ethiopia.
Improve Agricultural and Population
Planning: Famines generally occur in
countries where most of the people are
farmers. They must be helped to devel-
op a strong agricultural system, and
this cannot be done if farmers’ earning
power is brought down by dumping free
commodities on their markets. Effec-
tive agricultural extension services,
as now exist in many Asian countries,
are needed. The United States did not
invent agricultural-experiment stations,
but we developed them beyond what
others have done. We did invent
the agricultural-extension system, rural
banking and land-grant colleges. We
must separate our role as a country that
sells very large stocks of commodities
from the role we should be playing—
the teacher of modern-but-appropriate
agriculture in the developing nations.
It is to the great honor of the United
States that in every recent famine ex-
cept one (Biafra during the 1967-70
Nigerian civil war), we have reacted
quickly and well when asked to do so.
Since World War 11, America has been
the world’s bulwark against famine. But
we must do equally well in spreading
agricultural knowledge; in the long run,
the greatest need in the countries threat-
ened by famine is for agricultural and
economic development and for population
planning. It is regrettable that the U.S.
technical assistance effort in agriculture is
less substantial than it was 10 or 15 years
ago. Without being too visible, we also
need to be as helpful as we can in making
the methodology and the tools of birth
control available to poor countries.

versity, was chairman of the first White

the President's Commission on World Food
Problems (1978-1980).

The Hints of a Conspiracy
Marchers in New Delhi last week: Suspicions grow that Mrs. Gandhi’s killers had ties to other militant Sikhs, some of them overseas
LANGEVIN—SYGMA
Rajiv Gandhi takes charge as investigators begin unraveling his mother’s murder.
As the 12-day mourning period for In-
dira Gandhi came to an end, Rajiv
Gandhi began to emerge from his mother’s
shadow last week. First he was unanimously
selected as the president of India’s ruling
Congress (I) Party. Then he delivered his
first major address to the nation as prime
minister—an appeal for unity, coupled with
a pledge to continue his mother’s policies at
home and abroad. He also called a
general election, to be held Dec. 24
and 27, in the strong expectation of
being returned to office with a five-
year mandate. But while Gandhi test-
ed his muscles, India’s news commen-
tators and intelligence agents pursued
a troubling question: were the two
Sikh bodyguards who murdered Mrs.
Gandhi operating on their own, or
were they part of a conspiracy that
may have extended beyond India?
Government investigators in New
Delhi told Newsweek that they be-
lieved Sikh militants had plotted for
some time to assassinate Mrs. Gan-
dhi, and that they may have acceler-
ated their timetable after Indian
troops stormed the Golden Temple in
Amritsar last June. Wealthy Sikh
emigres living in Britain, Canada,
West Germany and the United States
may have provided financial backing,
they added. The government will ask Nor-
way to extradite a former Indian diplomat,
Harinder Singh, who is accused of having
paid $ 100,000 to help finance the assassina-
tion. Singh denied the charge. So far there
was only circumstantial evidence of a direct
link between the assassins and Sikhs outside
India. Police found “inflammatory litera-
ture” from Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale —
Beant Singh (rear) at a 1980 reception: Lax security

the Sikh firebrand killed in the Golden Tem-
ple assault—among the possessions of
Satwant Singh, one of Mrs. Gandhi’s killers.
Still, many Indians were prepared to be-
lieve in an international conspiracy against
Mrs. Gandhi. They pointed to Pakistan—
India’s neighbor and adversary—as the
likeliest culprit. Some sources in New Delhi
claimed they had overwhelming evidence of
official Pakistani support for Sikh
separatist aspirations, and that as
many as 20 training camps for Sikh
terrorists exist in Pakistan. The daily
Indian Express said that terrorists
“sneak into Punjab” after training in
Pakistan, and that others come from
Britain and West Germany. Their
targets, according to the Express, are
Congress (I) Party leaders and other
prominent Indians. Moscow’s hints
of a CIA role in the assassination have
also aroused suspicion among many
Indians, despite Ronald Reagan’s dis-
missal of the Soviet innuendoes as the
“world’s biggest cheap shot.”
Whether or not they were part of a
far-flung conspiracy, Mrs. Gandhi’s
assassins had no difficulty carrying
out the murder. Security around the
prime minister was disastrously lax:
an estimated 40 seconds elapsed be-
tween the time that Beant Singh


opened fire with his pistol and Satwant
Singh poured bullets into Gandhi with his
sten gun. Beyond that, intelligence sources
in New Delhi said that the two Sikhs had
been acting suspiciously weeks before the
shooting—there was evidence they may
have planned to kill her on at least two
earlier occasions in October —but that no
one paid attention until it was too late. Beant
Singh had been distraught following the
assault on the Golden Temple, and began to
hold meetings in his home at odd hours to
discuss an assassination attempt. Satwant
Singh was never properly screened for his
highly sensitive job. In the period preceding
the assassination, he sometimes came to
work by taxi and took meals outside the
official mess —odd behavior for a soldier.
Those and scores of other questions sur-
rounding the assassination will be probed by
Supreme Court Justice M. P. Thakkar, who
last week was appointed as a one-man offi-
cial commission of inquiry into the killing.
His report, backed by the work of an elite
force of 20 security and intelligence experts,
is expected to take several months to com-
plete. In the meantime, Rajiv Gandhi has
moved quickly to beef up security around
the prime minister’s residence. He has dis-
banded his personal detail of bodyguards
and replaced them with antiterrorist troops.
Mrs. Gandhi’s chief security adviser has
resigned. And the director of intelligence
has been fired, along with his deputy.

DWIG —SIPA-SPECIAL FEATURES
Mandate: In the weeks
ahead, Gandhi’s chief
priority will be to win a
decisive mandate in next
month’s elections. His
opponents include Ma-
neka Gandhi, widow of
his younger brother San-
jay, who announced that
she would run for Parlia-
ment against her own
brother-in-law. Several
opposition parties, in-
cluding the Janata Party
of former Prime Minister
Morarji Desai, also talked of forming an
electoral alliance. But by calling for elec-
tions quickly, Gandhi may capitalize on a
wave of public sympathy for his slain moth-
er. He seemed assured of capturing a com-
fortable majority for the Congress (I) Party,
which currently holds two-thirds of the
seats in Parliament.
So far, most political observers give
Gandhi good marks. They feel that he
weathered the trauma of his mother’s assas-
sination with dignity, and that he restored
order in a levelheaded fashion. But one
Western diplomat in New Delhi maintains
that he “is just marking time until the elec-
tions. The real Rajiv Gandhi will emerge
only after he has won.’’ Only then will Rajiv
show whether he has his mother’s political
mettle —and whether he can unravel the
mystery of Mrs. Gandhi’s assassination.
ANGUS DEMING with RAY WILKINSON
and SUDIP MAZUMDAR in New Delhi
Zia: ‘We Wish India Well’
No country reacted more quickly than
Pakistan to Indira Gandhi’s death. On the
night of the assassination, Pakistan Presi-
dent Mohammad Zia ul-Haq spoke at
length by telephone to Rajiv Gandhi and
later, after attending the funeral, spent 15
minutes meeting with him. Last week Zia
spoke with Newsweek’s Edward Behr,
and offered his assessment of future rela-
tions between the two countries. Excerpts:
BEHR: How do you see the course of
relations between your two countries after
Indira Gandhi’s death?
ZIA: I’ m very optimistic, now that there
is a much younger leadership. From my
talk with [Rajiv Gandhi] in Delhi, I got
the impression that here was
someone with a very wide vision
of the world. My feeling is this
must lead to a dynamic youth-
ful approach to Indo-Pakistani
relations.
Q: But isn’t this the same Ra-
jiv who not so long ago claimed
that Pakistan was likely to over-
run Kashmir in four days?
A: Sometimes political per-
sonalities without responsibil-
ities make such statements.
Now he has much greater
responsibilities. I was more than
satisfied with our meeting.
There was an expression on both
sides that both India and Paki-
stan should remove suspicion
and misunderstandings and be-
gin a fresh chapter in our
relationship.
Q: What about the allegations
of Pakistan aiding and training
Sikh extremists?
A: It simply isn’t true. Some
Sikhs may have sought refuge in
Pakistan. We have a long border with
India, and smuggling is endemic. I can
accept that. But the allegation that some
Sikhs have come to Pakistan to be trained
as saboteurs is just not acceptable. There
are some 400,000 Sikh ex-servicemen in
India. They don’t require training in
Pakistan.
Q: How can India and Pakistan start off
on a new footing?
A: Two years ago I suggested regular
exchanges and inspection teams between
Indian and Pakistani military officers. I
have also proposed a bilateral nonprolif-
eration treaty.
Q: Would this end the India-Pakistan
arms race?
A: If there is an arms race there is only
one runner—lndia. We have acquired
military equipment through U.S. help and
French loans that are barely adequate
given the threat posed by the Afghanistan
situation. But certainly, if we can create an
atmosphere of trust and good will and if
we can both reduce our military spending,
we can then get down to tackling our real
problems of poverty and development.
Q: For all your optimism , isn’t it a fact
that there was a very tense situation be-
tween India and Pakistan only a few days
before Indira Gandhi’s assassination?
There are even rumors that you withdrew
some Pakistani troops currently on loan to
Zia: ‘We should remove misunderstandings’
CHIP HIRES—GAMMA-LIAISON
Saudi Arabia and brought them home.
A: The withdrawals didn’t occur, but
you’re right: there was a tense situation,
there were war clouds. W e went out of our
way to defuse the situation without com-
promising on principles.
Q: Isn’t there some unexpressed satisfac-
tion that India’s troubles with the Sikhs
must be a source of relief to Pakistan —in
the sense that now war between the two
countries is less likely?
A: I have never felt comfortable at the
spectacle of someone else’s troubles. We
wish India well, we hope its difficulties
will be overcome and that our bilateral
relationships will be improved. A weak
and crisis-racked India is definitely not in
Pakistan’s interest.


Marcos Looks to Washington
The president: Willfailing health send him abroadfor help—and leave a political vacuum?
THE PHILIPPINES
If Ferdinand Marcos were to die tomor-
row, Philippine law mandates an election
within 60 days to pick his successor—in
itself an ominous prospect. But what would
happen if the 66-year-old President, ru-
mored to be seriously ill with kidney dis-
ease, merely went abroad to seek medical
treatment? That long-hypothetical ques-
tion loomed suddenly larger last week —
and left even the many Filipinos who are
demanding his ouster distinctly uneasy
about the possible answers. Their worst
fears: that with the president safely away,
senior officials in the government and mili-
tary might scramble to fill the vacuum, or
even attempt a full-blown coup.
The spark for those concerns was a speech
a fortnight ago by opposition leader Aqui-
lino Pimentel, who told a Manila business-
men’s group that Marcos was already plan-
ning a trip to the United States, possibly by
the end of this month—and that a junta of
three senior officers and two civilians would
be appointed to run the country while he was
gone. Acting armed forces chief of staff Gen.
Fidel Ramos, who Pimentel said would
head the junta, called the charges “a ca-
nard” and a “figment of someone’s imagina-
tion.” But a senior Marcos official told
Newsweek last week that the president
had in fact discussed the issue during a ten-
minute private telephone talk with Ronald
Reagan earlier this month. Marcos, the offi-
cial said, told Reagan that his doctors were
advising him to seek American medical
help. He in turn reportedly received assur-
ances of a welcome from Washington—
along with a pointed question about who
would be left “in charge” should he go
abroad. U.S. spokesmen deny that any such
call took place. “There’s no secret trip in the
works,” said a senior official in Washington.
Despite a highly publicized check-up last
month that supposedly gave him a clean bill
of health, Marcos is reliably reported to
have undergone periodic dialysis over the
past year. He is also said to be taking steroids
and other medications. In late October, ac-
cording to Malacanang Palace sources,
Marcos’s doctors advised him that his kid-
ney condition might need further tests and
possibly surgery. “They were not recom-
mending immediate action,” says one offi-
cial, “but they did say that if an operation
was necessary, he might consider undergo-
ing it while he was still relatively strong.”
Even if Marcos were to be treated in
Manila, major surgery would raise immedi-
ate questions about who would govern dur-
ing what might be a protracted recovery.
Marcos has reportedly had his advisers
draft contingency plans for up to six months
of surrogate rule. According to palace insid-
ers, a strong possibility would be a “working
secretariat,” which would run the govern-
ment’s day-to-day affairs under some
combination of senior civilian and military
officials. One such list is said to include
Gen. Ramos, Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, Prime Minister Cesar Virata and the
speaker of the National Assembly, Nicanor
Ynigez. Another reportedly gives places to
two respected—but retired —generals.
Fears: One prominent figure who would
not be in the running is Gen. Fabian Ver.
The former chief of staffs recent implica-
tion in last year’s assassination of opposi-
tion leader Benigno Aquino has raised
fears —especially among U.S. officials —of
a possible backlash by his many supporters
in the armed forces. What may already be a
hint of that came last week, when a gunman
shot and killed Zamboanga City mayor Ce-
sar Climaco, a flamboyant Marcos foe who
had often spoken out against the military.
“If they could have it their way,” says one
Marcos official, “the Americans would like
to see General Ver accompany the president
on any trip outside the country.”
But mindful of the disturbing chain of
events that started when the Shah of Iran
was brought to the United States in 1979 for
medical treatment, Washington may well
be hoping that Marcos recovers speedily—
and at home. During a march last week on
Malacanang Palace, thousands of demon-
strators cheered when Agapito “Butz”
Aquino, younger brother of the slain oppo-
sition leader, set fire to an effigy of the
president lying on a sickbed, propped up by
a figure of Uncle Sam.
Marcos nevertheless may still be count-
ing on a political boost from a visible display
of U.S. concern and hospitality. If possible,
say palace insiders, the president would like
to hold off on a visit until after Reagan’s
inauguration in late January, when a brief
hospital stay might be slipped into what
would otherwise be described as a routine
official visit. In his speech last week, Pimen-
tel said flatly that if Marcos attempts to put
some interim junta in place, even temporar-
ily, “the legitimate opposition will just
abandon our peaceful struggle.” Neither
the president nor his potential caretakers
can easily afford to court new troubles in the
streets. But the question now may be simply

THAILAND
The Generals’ Threat:
Shape Up or Ship Out
Thailand’s economy was headed for trou-
ble. The trade deficit was ballooning, for-
eign exports were slumping and the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund was pressuring
Bangkok to control its debts. Prime Minis-
ter Prem Tinsulanond concluded he had no
choice but to devalue the Thai baht by 17
percent. The surprise move two weeks ago
drew accolades from economists. But it
sparked an outcry from unions and aggra-
vated an old feud between Prem and Thai-
land’s top military man, Gen. Arthit Kam-
lang-ek. Last week railway workers walked
off the job and some generals, Newsweek
learned, gave Prem an ultimatum: either get
the country on the road to recovery quickly
or face the possibility of a coup.
It was the third and largest devaluation of
the baht since 1981. This time, Bangkok’s
central bankers freed it completely from its
peg to the dollar; it now floats against a
basket of currencies, including those of the
United States, Britain, West Germany and
Japan. However, that adjustment alone will


not solve Thailand’s economic woes. The
country’s total foreign debt now stands at
$l2 billion. And some economists predict
that inflation will hit 8 percent next year,
more than twice the original projection and
5 percent higher than the rate now.
Prem’s most immediate economic prob-
lem, however, is the $l7 million in overtime
pay due to state railway employees. The
back wages have been piling up for two
years, and last week’s strike brought all rail
traffic to a standstill, cut supply lines to the
provinces and stranded thousands of travel-
ers. At the weekend the trains were rolling
again, but no one was sure just how the
government planned to settle its account.
The prime minister’s biggest political
threat seemed to be coming from General
Arthit. Five days after the devaluation,
Arthit, 59, appeared on nationwide televi-
sion to denounce the government’s mone-
tary policies. In a rambling speech, he called
for a return to the old exchange rate and
warned darkly that “whatever problems oc-
cur from now on, the government must be
prepared to tackle them. . . It is not my duty
or the duty of the armed forces to prevent
the consequences of the government’s care-
less action. What will happen, will happen.”
Prem stood his ground against the attack,
and by last week it was plain even to Arthit
that the speech had been a serious blunder.
He tried to calm the waters by insisting that
it was all a “misunderstanding.” Despite
the damage to his credibility, Arthit still
wields considerable power in Thailand.
Revving up the stalled economy within 90
days, as the generals have demanded, may
well be an impossible task for Prem. The
prime minister, however, is an old soldier
himself, and has already survived one coup
attempt. But while he has clearly won the
battle over devaluation, his war with Arthit
may go on for some time to come.

THE KOREAS
Warming Up to Trade Talks
At the bargaining table in Panmunjom: An unprecedented outbreak of smiles
As they smiled and exchanged jovial
greetings, it looked more like a reunion
of old business cronies than a meeting be-
tween implacable enemies. But there they
were last week: delegates from the two Ko-
reas, calmly trading proposals aimed at
forging the first economic ties since 1945.
North and South Korea have tried before —
with no success—to start economic talks.
But the climate was decidedly more friendly
this time. And if the results were less than
conclusive, the two-and-one-half-hour ses-
sion at the truce village of Panmunjom in the
demilitarized zone did manage to raise
hopes that the two old foes might eventually
exchange more than angry words and bul-
lets. “The important thing,” says Kim Nam
Shik, a Seoul-based expert on North Korean
affairs, is that the talks will “significantly
reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.”
All observers were not quite so sanguine,
but most agreed that the talks were encour-
aging. The meeting proceeded amicably,
with both sides seeming eager to strike a
compromise on commercial exchanges.
Seoul and Pyongyang agreed, at least in
principle, to buy each other’s commodities
and to consider joint projects aimed at de-
veloping the peninsula’s mineral wealth.
They mutually supported proposals to re-
open railway links between the two capitals
and to establish a telephone “hot line” for
trade matters. They talked, if a bit vaguely,
about opening key North and South port
cities for trade purposes, and agreed to meet
again early next month.
The discussions were considerably
warmer than other recent North-South ex-
changes. In May, talks of fielding a joint
team for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles
ended in a shouting match, and in August
Pyongyang pointedly ignored a Seoul offer
for technical and economic assistance. In
September, however, Seoul surprisingly ac-
cepted Pyongyang’s offer of $l2 million in
relief supplies for flood victims in the South.
That diplomatic overture opened the door
for last week’s economic talks and for a
resumption of the long-stalled Red Cross
negotiations aimed at reuniting millions of
families separated by political partition.
Swap: But analysts caution that the
new North-South thaw may prove to be
more a game of one-upmanship than a seri-
ous effort to improve relations. Political
jockeying was plainly evident at the bargain-
ing table last week. As if to emphasize the
North’s underdevelopment, the industrial-
ized South offered to swap sophisticated
household appliances, cars, color TVs and
high-grade steel for North Korean pig iron,
zinc, scrap metal, fisheries products and silk
cocoons. And despite assurances that poli-
tics would not be discussed, Seoul’s chief
delegate announced that his people “are still
unable to control their shock and bitter-
ness” over the North Korean bomb blast in
Rangoon a year ago that killed 17 South
Koreans. That mild rebuke, however, may
pose less of a threat to future talks than
Pyongyang’s insistence that trade accords
should take a back seat to joint development
of mineral and fisheries resources.
Still, both sides stand to gain from a
renewal of hospitable relations. Pyongyang
is currently burdened by nearly $3 billion in
foreign loans that are now technically in
default. The North Korean economy also
suffers from aging factories and equipment
and the burden of huge military expendi-


tures. As a result, the North risks falling
hopelessly, and humiliatingly, behind the
more prosperous South. Pyongyang now
seems to recognize the need to woo outside
help to get its economy back on track.
Pyongyang watchers in both Seoul and To-
kyo say that North Korean President Kim
II Sung has his sights set far beyond limited
contacts with Seoul, and is looking toward
Japan and the United States for possible
trade opportunities.
The South also has good reason to en-
courage negotiations. Its prestige will be on
the line in 1988 when Seoul hosts the next
Summer Olympics. Government officials
want to ensure that North-South tensions
do not spoil Seoul’s moment in the interna-
tional limelight. Further, officials in the
South are eager to expand unofficial diplo-
matic and economic relations with Peking,
and they recognize that any opening of
trade between the two Koreas might enable
Seoul to play its China card more effective-
ly. But South Koreans remain wary of the
new pacific overtures. Government officials
have warned that the North’s seeming flexi-
bility should not be taken as proof that
Pyongyang has suddenly dropped nearly 40
years of aggressive designs. Even as final
preparations were being made for last
week’s talks, President Chun Doo Hwan
exhorted his Army brass to prepare “to
meet any eventuality with a watertight de-
fense posture.”
The renewed dialogue between the Ko-
reas also increases the chances for serious
talks about national reunification. But that
is a long way off. For now, the Koreas must
move beyond pleasantries and make some
hard diplomatic choices. If the past is any
guide, bottlenecks may stymie progress in
the months ahead. “The talks will drag on
for a long time before reaching any substan-
tial agreement,” predicts one veteran North
Korea watcher in Seoul. But the mere pros-
pect that the talks will not end in collapse is
cause for cautious optimism.

The Case of the Chinese Fortune
A family portrait in 1933, Zongyang and Biyan fighting for their fortune in 1981: ‘A saga of international intrigue ’
It is 1943 and the tide of the war is turning against Japan. Zhao
Xinbo, a Chinese working for the Japanese, flees Tokyo and
returns to his homeland of Manchuria with his wife and child.
He leaves behind a treasure trove of gold and jewels in an
underground bunker in Japan. After the war, Zhao is jailed as a
traitor and eventually dies in Peking. Years later, Zhao’s family
begins a legal battle to obtain his fortune.
It sounds like the plot of an Asian “Dallas.” But it is all true —
and, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, it is nothing
less than “a saga of international intrigue. . . which ended with a
Peking family becoming multimillionaires.” Indeed they did. A
Tokyo judge has ruled that Zhao’s widow, Biyan, now 84, and
her son, Zongyang, 59, are the rightful heirs to the fortune,
worth as much as $2O million. The Zhao family has promised to
use the money to help China improve its relations with Japan.
Zhao Xinbo helped lead Japan’s imperial adventuring in
China in 1932 by serving as the first president of the Japanese-
controlled Manchukuo legislature in Manchuria. Zhao and
other officials of the regime persuaded residents of Manchukuo
to contribute cash or grain to the puppet government; the
Japanese satraps were rewarded with “gifts” of as much as
$600,000. When Zhao resettled in Tokyo in 1938, he converted
his wealth into land, antiques, gold and diamonds and hid the
fortune under one of his houses.
After the war, the gold and gems were uncovered by U.S.
forces and turned over to Japanese officials. Meanwhile, the
Chinese government began to hunt for Zhao’s survivors. It was
not until 1973 that the widow, Biyan, petitioned to have the
Zongyang: Victorious
MAINICHI SHIMBUN
family fortune returned to her. But her
battle had just begun. “There were doz-
ens of people claiming the inheritance,”
says Kyubei Ogawa, the lawyer who represented Biyan in the
subsequent 11-year legal fight. “Most would say they were
adopted children or distant relatives.” Three even insisted they
were Madam Zhao. Seven claimed to be her son. But when
Zongyang finally produced his father’s death certificate, the
treasure was returned to the Zhaos.
‘Trespassers’: It may be some time, however, before the family
sees most of its money. Over the years, dozens of families have
built homes on what is officially Zhao land. Many have filed suit
to stay where they are. “To the Zhao family,” says lawyer
Ogawa, “[these people] are blatant
trespassers. But the homeowners all
say they bought the property from oth-
ers before them.”
Regardless of the outcome, millions
of Chinese will be able to follow the
saga of the Zhaos to its conclusion. The
government’s China Film Coproduc-
tion Corp. plans to make a $3.9 million
movie version of the story and top it off
with a television series. Will the Zhaos
finally get their fortune? Will the
homeowners give up their houses? And
what about Sino-Japanese relations?
Stay tuned.

EUROPE
A Latter-Day
Battle of Britain
Thousands of miners return to the pits, but the bitter
coal strike still seems likely to drag on for months.
The attacks bore all the earmarks of a
military operation. With precise co-
ordination, hundreds of striking British
mineworkers and their supporters descend-
ed on coal-belt communities in South York-
shire last week. One gang wearing ski masks
smashed office equipment and roughed up
two local managers at a pit near the town of
Hickleton. In neighboring Dinnington, pro-
testers hurled Molotov cocktails at a police
station. As hundreds of baton-wielding riot
police tried to restrain the mobs, looters
plundered dozens of shops. When the seven-
hour rampage finally ended, some 25 col-
lieries had been damaged. But if the miners

PRESS ASSOCIATION
won the skirmish in South Yorkshire, they
clearly seemed to be losing the war.
The eight-month-old coal strike has be-
come a latter-day Battle of Britain. Aside
from the financial hardships endured by the
miners, the conflict has impeded the coun-
try’s economic recovery. The spreading
stain of violence from the walkout has called
into question such national traditions as
respect for law and civilized discourse. The
strike has also cast the miners—once con-
sidered heroes of labor for their rugged
independence—in the role of outlaws. The
backlash against the miners has bolstered
the antiunion policies of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and has undermined the
status of the labor movement as a whole.
Last week’s clashes in South Yorkshire
were the worst in the bitterly fought strike.
Fifty-four people were injured and 45 strik-
ers arrested. The organizers of the raids
obviously hoped to discourage miners in the
key coal-producing area from crossing pick-
et lines and hoped to damage the collieries
into the bargain. But their tactics may have
backfired. At the clock-in for the morning
shift in the sprawling Yorkshire fields, the
number of miners who showed up for work
was up more than 100 percent over the week
before. And by the end of the week, 59,000 of
the country’s 189,000 miners
had defied Arthur Scargill,
the fiery leader of the Nation-
al Union of Mineworkers
(NUM), by appearing on the
job. Indeed, there was a spread-
ing suspicion—perhaps prema-
ture but nonetheless preva-
lent —that the longest and
bloodiest strike in British histo-
ry might have reached a turn-
ing point. Although officials on
both sides of the picket line still
believe that the walkout is like-
ly to drag on well into next year,
the union’s chances of winning
outright seemed to have van-
ished for good. The only re-
maining question was how long
Scargill could play out the
string—and what the price
would be.
In sheer economic terms, the
strike has already cost Britain
dearly. The country has been losing $75
million a week; officials estimate that the
strike will have cost almost $2 billion by the
end of the year. The violent dispute has also
hampered efforts by Prime Minister Marga-
ret Thatcher’s government to curb inflation,
reduce state spending and cut taxes. Gov-
ernment funds that might have been used to
create jobs and ease the country’s 13.4 per-
cent unemployment have instead been di-
verted to buy oil for the nation’s generating
stations and to pay overtime for police. The
strike has trimmed overall economic
growth by a point, to 2.5 percent. For all the
damage that has been done, it is unlikely that
Heated confrontation on a picket line:
the walkout will create any serious energy
shortages or power outages this winter;
present reserves and imports of foreign coal
should be able to take up the slack. But that
is nothing more than short-term relief. The
fact is that the walkout has set Britain’s
economic recovery back by many months.
Anguish: The deeper cost of the strike is
not to be found in an accountant’s ledger.
From the beginning, the walkout has been
more than just a dispute over wages or work
rules. In the government’s view, the issue is
whether Britain can successfully wean itself
from outmoded, oversubsidized smoke-
stack industries and shift to a truly competi-
tive economy. The miners—many of whose
fathers and grandfathers worked in the
pits—see themselves struggling to preserve
their livelihood and their rapidly vanishing
way of life. But this is far more than a clash
between a government and a union. Many
people in Britain have been horrified by the
degree of hatred that the strike has demon-
strated and stunned by two deaths and more
than 2,000 injuries. In his maiden speech to
the House of Lords last week, former Con-
servative Prime Minister Harold Macmil

PRESS ASSOCIATION
lan, who at the age of 90 recently became the
Earl of Stockton, expressed the nation’s
anguish in poignantly personal terms.
While hailing the miners as the “best men in
the world” for their wartime service, he
called the strike “pointless” and said that “it
breaks my heart to see what is happening in
our country today” (box).
The strike has also created serious rifts
within the British labor movement. Official-
ly, both the Labor Party and the country’s
umbrella labor group, the 10.1 million-
member Trades Union Congress (TUC),
have endorsed the walkout. All along, how-
ever, their support has been tepid at
best. And last week TUC chairman Norman
Willis delivered a stinging denunciation of
some of the miners’ tactics. “Any miner who
resorts to violence,” he told a rally of strik-
ing miners in South Wales, “wounds [the
union’s] case far more than they damage
their opponents’ resolve.” Later in the week,
Labor leader Neil Kinnock echoed that
theme, praising those whose “support for
the miners is as strong as their opposition to
the use of violence.” But Scargill staunchly
defended the actions of the miners and
charged, with some justification, that the
police had provoked their share of the vio-
lence. “I represent my class,” he said. “I will
not condemn those magnificent young men
whose only crime is to fight for their jobs.”
Scargill called the strike last March after
months of growing tension between the
NUM and the government. The proximate
cause for the walkout was a plan by the
National Coal Board to close roughly 20
unprofitable pits and to lay off as many as
20,000 miners. Scargill insisted that only
nonproducing fields should be shut down.
But many critics believed that Scargill, who
has earned the nickname “King Arthur” for
his imperious manner, had an ulterior mo-
tive: a desire to bring down the Thatcher
government by creating industrial chaos.
Foolhardy: Whatever the case, Scargill’s
move turned out to be precipitous and fool-
hardy. As it was originally conceived, the
Coal Board’s plan would not have resulted
in any mandatory firings. The board’s idea
was to encourage miners to take voluntary
early retirement with a hefty severance pay-
ment. In all likelihood, the Coal Board
would have had no difficulty finding a suffi-
cient number of miners to accept the offer.
Scargill’s timing was especially bad. Brit-
ainhadjust emerged from an unusually mild
winter, and the country’s utilities had a
record stockpile of coal. Scargill also had
trouble rallying the support he needed from
his own rank and file. He had called the
strike with the backing of the union’s 24-
member executive committee, but he did not
put the issue to a vote by the miners them-
selves. Many members were outraged by
what they saw as another example of'“King
Arthur s contempt for democratic proce-
dures. Others objected to being forced out of
work during hard economic times with no
more than minimal support from the union.
(For all its radical rhetoric, the NUM’s
strike benefits are virtually nonexistent; the
union pays only $4 a day for picket-line
duty.) The result was that roughly one-
fourth of the miners never left the pits,
To a large degree, the division m the union

‘We’ve All Had Enough’
His friends call him a scab. He has been threatened, followed,
intimidated —even assaulted. The reason: Mel Hunt, 36, is one of
several thousand miners in Great Britain who have returned to
work in recent weeks. He crossed the picket line at the Darfield
Main colliery near Barnsley, a mining town in Yorkshire where
he has lived all his life. “I suddenly thought, ‘l’ve had enough of
this’,” he said. “So I talked it over with my wife and with my
workmate Ray, and we decided we had all had enough. The two
of us made up our minds to go quietly back to work.”
Hunt’s return to his job was anything but quiet. “That first
morning was the worst,” he said. “We were picked up by one of
those armored vans with mesh on the windows and rushed to
work between two police transit carriers. We had to lie flat on the
floor of the van so that no one would see us going in. ” It was not a
secret for long. The next day the two men went to a Union
meeting. “There were some rabble from the NUM [National
Union of Mineworkers] waiting for us outside,” says Hunt.
“One of them shouted at me, ‘lf I see thee walking about the
streets, I’ll kill thee! Bastard scab!’ Then one of the others came
up and punched me in the face. He said, ‘There’s no way you’re
myself, ‘I won’t let them do that to me.’ I just hope they don’t get
at my kids. But I support my husband all the way.”
Hunt also finds that his life today is difficult—and lonely.
There are certainly no more nights out spent in the local pub with
friends. “I daren’t leave the house in the evenings,” he says. “I
never know when the next brick is coming. I usually just watch
television and maybe have a glass of home brew. I keep in touch
with Ray; we phone each other. You need someone else to give
you a bit of moral support.” Hunt’s loneliness may continue long
after the strike has ended. “A few people are talking to me now,”
he says. “When the strike is over, it will be up to them whether
they accept Ray and me. Some will and some won’t, I suppose. I
don’t care. I’ve made my decision.”
The Kaddafi Connection: That decision was slow and painful.
“Every time there were peace talks our hopes would build up for
a settlement,” Hunt says. “But I gradually realized that [union
president] Arthur Scargill didn’t want a settlement for the
miners. He just wanted to bring down the government.” Hunt
decided to defy the union when NUM leaders approached
Libya’s leader Muammar Kaddafi for money to keep the strike
going. “Taking money from someone like that was really scrap-
ing the bottom of the barrel as far as I’m concerned,” he says.
Hunt was also angry at the failure of the NUM leadership to
Hunt, police line the road as a convoy escorts miners returning to work: ‘I’ll kill thee! Bastard scab!’
getting into that meeting.’ They started rocking the car and
yelling abuse, so we just drove off. We had to. As we went they
shouted, ‘You two won’t be going back to work again’.”
That was only the beginning. At the mine the two men face a
constant group of pickets standing just outside the gates ready
to hurl abuse —and stones. Just to get across the pit yard, Hunt
says, requires a shield of seven police officers. All last week, he
says, pickets parked near his home and followed him whenever
he left the house. “One lout even followed me into my local
paper shop, but I suddenly found a policeman standing next to
me,” he says, adding that in the future he might not always be
that lucky. “The police are very alert but they can’t be there all
the time.”
Tears: The violence has taken its toll on the entire family.
Hunt’s teen-age son and daughter have been called names at
school. While the family was asleep one night, bricks were
hurled through the kitchen and bathroom windows. “I’d been
waiting for that to happen,” Hunt said. “In a way it was a relief.
You think, ‘Well, at least that’s over and we’ve got through it’.”
Hunt’s wife, Christine, who has a part-time job as a cleaner at a
local school, says that she lies in bed at night trying hard not to
cry. “I can feel the tears beginning,” she says. “But I say to
condemn violence on the picket line. “They won’t even admit it
exists,” he says. “Are they going to tell me that it was the police
who threw bricks through my windows?”
Hunt believes the violence has intimidated other miners from
going back to work. “I can’t blame them for holding back,” he
says. “I wouldn’t advise anybody to go through what I have.”
That very violence, says Hunt, has made him all the more
determined to cross the picket line each day, every day. “I’ve
been dictated to enough by the NUM, and I’ve got a mind of my
own,” he says. “Now that I’m back at work, I’m not budging.”
He insists that he has not gone back to work for the money—
although he admits that he needs it. The family has lost about
$5,500 in wages since the strike began and has been living on
savings that were earmarked to buy their own home and take
their first trip abroad, to Spain. “I’ve gone back for a principle,”
he says. “I feel if we don’t go back now, there are not going to be
any pits to go back to.” Will there be a normal life for him to go
back to when the strike ends? Hunt is not sure. “I don’t know if
we can ever be the same again after all the bitterness this has
caused,” he says. “It will take years to repair all this bitterness.”
And years more to forget.
JOSEPH TREEN with RITA DALLAS in London


HUGH ROUTLEDGE— FINANCIAL TIMES
Strikers and their supporters, miners’ wives: A hope that the longest walkout in British history has reached a turning point
lack of solidarity, the strikers began forming
illegal “flying pickets”—caravans of mili-
tants that traveled to nonstriking areas—in
an attempt to disrupt coal production
throughout the country. Aside from the
human toll in deaths, injuries and arrests,
the violence cost the union much of the
public sympathy it may have had at the
beginning of the strike.
Image: ScargilPs bizarre flirtation with
Libyan leader Col. Muammar Kaddafi last
month also battered the union’s image. Ever
since a London policewoman was murdered
by a sniper positioned inside the Libyan
Embassy last April, Kaddafi has been a
figure of evil in Britain. But the national
revulsion over the embassy killing did not
stop Scargill from meeting secretly with a
delegation of Libyan officials in Paris in
October and then dispatching one of his top
aides, Roger Windsor, to Tripoli to confer
with Kaddafi. The Libyan leader’s subse-
quent expression of “solidarity” with the
miners brought on a round of angry denun-
ciations in Britain, and then Scargill com-
pounded his error. He did say that he would
not accept any “contributions” from the
Tripoli government but added that he
would happily take money from Libya’s
unions; for most critics, that was a hair-
splitting distinction that made little
difference.
Ever since the strike began, Scargill has
taken the hardest possible line in negotia-
tions with the Coal Board. His adversary in
the dispute was genuinely conciliatory. The
board’s chairman, lan MacGregor, pledged
to reconsider the plan to close the pits if the
miners would go back to work. He also
offered to submit all future proposals to shut
down unprofitable mines to a labor-man-
agement committee and an independent
panel for review, though he insisted that the
board would have the final say on any deci-
sions. Scargill rejected both concessions,
saying that MacGregor should renounce
the immediate plans to close the pits. By last
week, the government’s patience—and the
prospects for a negotiated settlement—ap-
peared to be at an end. ‘ This challenge will
not succeed,” said Thatcher. “[We] will
hold firm.”
Thatcher’s government does bear at least
part of the blame for the stalemate. As the
head of British Steel Corp. from 1980 to
1983, MacGregor became known, among
other things, as “Mac Wrecker” and “Mac
the Knife” for his drastic reductions in the
company’s work force. When he was first
appointed to the Coal Board in 1983, he
promptly announced his intention to clean
house, without defining what that meant,
“He spread a degree of uncertainty about
jobs that went far beyond the cuts he pro-
posed to make, ” says Benjamin Roberts, a
professor of industrial relations at the Lon-
don School of Economics. “That convinced
many miners that [he] was out to do a
hatchetjob on them.’’MacGregor’s boss did
nothing to allay those fears. Not once has
Thatcher expressed any dismay over the
prospect of tightly knit mining communities
being wiped out because their labors are no
longer needed. “The government has to ad-
just its attitude and start treating the miners
with something approaching respect,” says
Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the Labor
Party. “They’ve got to stop talking about
miners as if they were enemies of the state.”
Reluctant: For the most part, the prime
minister has tried to keep her distance from
the dispute. Since 1980 the Thatcher gov-
ernment has pushed through three major
pieces Of legislation designed to curb the
unions’ power. But so far the government
has been reluctant to use the statutes against
the miners. The reason is that Thatcher fears
a crackdown on the NUM could trigger a

can afford to bide her time and wait for the
miners to cave in. She may well be right. A
recent Gallup poll showed that only 26
percent of those surveyed supported the
miners, while 53 percent sided with the
Coal Board.
In an effort to increase the number of
miners returning to work, the Coal Board
last week extended its offer of a bonus pack-
age for those willing to work during the
Christmas season. The package would pro-
vide a miner with $ 1,230 in wages and bene-

incentive; some of the men have been forced

past eight months just to raise money for

food. “How do you tell your children that
they’re not going to get any Christmas pres-
ents?” asks John Heaton, who recently re-
turned to his job as an electrician at the
Kellingley colliery in South Yorkshire.
The walkout is probably far from over. If
nothing else, the defiant Scargill shows no
signs of giving up. “When we’ve won the
struggle,” he told a group of supporters last
week, “you will go back to work in the
knowledge that you’ve been privileged to be
part of the greatest victory in modern
times.” Scargill’s boundless confidence has
probably helped cheer the strikers in recent
weeks. But he still must prove that his re-
peated boasts are not simply the last hurrah
for the era of union dominance.
BILL HEWITT with RONALD HENKOFF in London
'It Breaks My Heart'
At the age of 90 last week, one of the oldest veterans of British
politics made his maiden speech in the House of Lords. The Earl
of Stockton, better known as Harold Macmillan, was Britain ’s
Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. Now bent with
age but still proudly mustached, Lord Stockton—whose heredi-
tary earldom was created earlier this year—spoke for 30 minutes
without notes. At the end he received a resounding standing
ovation from the assembled peers. Excerpts from his speech:
On the miners’ strike: It breaks my heart to see what is
happening ... A terrible strike is being carried on by the best
men in the world. They beat the Kaiser’s Army and they beat
Hitler’s Army. They never gave in. The strike is pointless and
endless. We cannot afford [it].
On British society: There is [a] growing
division ... in our comparatively pros-
perous society. This cannot be allowed to
continue. The old English way might be
to quarrel and have battles. My noble
colleagues know that there were plenty
of rows and battles in the past —but they
were friendly. I can only describe as
wicked the hatred that has been intro-
duced and which is to be found among
different types of people. That must go.
On the House of Lords: When I come
back to Parliament at my advanced age,
I feel a sort of political Rip van Win-
kle. .. During all my active life Your
Lordships’ House played an honored but
not a very powerful role in our politics.
Now, to my amazement, I find that [the
House] has been even in conflict with
and forcing its amendments upon the
government of the day.
On economic policies: There are people
who are on the expansionist side —and I
do not think it is really political; it is
more what people feel like. They would
come along and say, like the neo-
Keynesians, “Let’s spend a bit more.”
The Labor Party spent, let us say, a great
deal more. The Liberal Party said,
Lord Stockton: ‘We can’t afford this strike ’
PRESS ASSOCIATION
“Well, not quite that; but let’s spend some more.” And the
[Thatcher] government said, “No. Do not spend any more.”
Many of Your Lordships will remember that [such differ-
ences] operated in the nursery. How do you treat a cold? One
nanny said, “Feed a cold”—she was a neo-Keynesian. Another
nanny said, “Starve a cold” —she was a monetarist. It is natural.
On the Reagan administration: He has broken all the rules,
and all the economists are furious. He has a completely unbal-
anced budget. What does he do? Of course, according to the rules
... he ought to have increased taxation. He did not do it; not at
all, he has reduced it . . . Then there is this huge deficit in the
balance of payments, but [the United States has] not introduced
any particular protectionist thoughts. When they want a thing
[from abroad] and they like it, they buy it.
On U.S. monetary policies: [The
Americans] have had the sense to make
somebody else pay for [economic recov-
ery]. By keeping the bank rate at 1 per-
cent above everybody else, they have
attracted all the money ... It has been
flowing in—not only the quick money,
but also serious investment, because ev-
erybody believes in it ... In a word,
Reagan, to reverse Keynes, has called in
the resources of the old world in order to
finance the expansion of the new.
On industrial development: [A new]
phase has come, based upon the comput-
er, silicon chips, automation. . . [But] we
cannot just say, “It would be rather nice
to have a bit of it,” as the government
seemed to suggest. It is a complete revo-
lution in thought.
On the future: I can only hope, because
I am so old, to see the first gleams that
precede the dawn, but I know that, if
[the] effort is made, generations to come
will see the bright sunlight of day. If
some of the dreadful, wicked systems
which have crept into our lives are re-
placed. If we abandon cynicism, criti-
cism and hatred for each other. . . then I
foresee ... a new phase along the long
road which we call man’s pilgrimage
here on earth.

ITALY
Cracking the Mob’s Top Rung?
Of the many rich businessmen in Sicily,
Nino and Ignazio Salvo rank near the
top. The two cousins rule a financial empire
that includes hotels, real estate, vineyards
and manufacturing companies. If the Sal-
vos’ wealth has raised speculation about
possible Mafia connections,
few have voiced it. After all,
the Salvos amassed some of
their fortune by running collec-
tion agencies to gather taxes for
local governments. And, en-
trenched in Sicily’s establish-
ment, they were untouchable.
Or so they thought. Last week
both Nino, 58, and Ignazio, 56,
were arrested in Palermo on
charges of criminal association
with the Mafia —and Italy’s
drive against organized crime
appeared to take a quantum
leap forward.
The arrests signaled that in-
vestigators may be making in-
roads into the hazy “third level,” the under-
world’s top rung where political and
business leaders allegedly rub elbows with
Mafia chieftains. As with most of the 123
Mafia suspects seized since late September,
the testimony that led to the Salvo arrests
was provided by Tommaso Buscetta, the
56-year-old disaffected Mafia boss who has
been telling his story to police since July.
Ignazio Salvo in custody: An untouchable gets nabbed
AP
Buscetta: Informer
AP
Initially, Buscetta denied that he knew
the Salvos. But he recently changed his
tune, and said he had once been sheltered
in a Salvo house for three months while
on the run. More damning still, Buscetta
charged that the Salvos were not only
involved in recycling Mafia
drug profits, but were “men
of honor” themselves, a eu-
phemism for membership in
the Mafia.
The Salvo arrests were
not the first foray into the
Mafia’s so-called third lev-
el. One week earlier, investi-
gators seized Vito Cianci-
mino, a former mayor of
Palermo, on charges of ille-
gally transferring large
sums of money abroad.
Ciancimino is reportedly
suspected of recycling Ma-
fia “narcodollars.” Antonio
Lo Bianco, the mayor of an
island town off the coast of Palermo, was
also arrested with nine members of his
municipal council, all on charges of fraud
and conspiracy in a case involving Mafia
connections. And following the Salvo
arrests, authorities questioned Giuseppe
Cascio, mayor of the Sicilian town of Sale-
mi.Cascio, the town’s mayor for 20 years,
promptly resigned. Two days later he
was arrested after investigators
found an unlicensed rifle in his
home. Suspected of close busi-
ness dealings with the Salvos,
Cascio now faces tougher ques-
tioning ahead.
As investigators cast their
dragnet ever wider, they no
longer have to rely solely on the
confessions of Buscetta. Salva-
tore Contorno, 37, has also
broken the code of omerta, the
Mafia’s traditional vow of si-
lence. Like Buscetta, Contorno
was linked to the losing side of a
war between the underworld
godfathers. Last month Con-
torno detailed his knowledge of
the Mafia’s internal struc-
ture, criminal activities and
drug dealings. His testimony
prompted a massive sweep that
pulled in 57 Mafia suspects to
join the 66 arrested after Bus-
cetta’s revelations. Based on
Contorno’s charge that Ales-
sandro Vanni Calvello, the
prince of San Vincenzo, had
Mafia ties, a warrant was issued
for the prince’s arrest. By the
time police acted, the prince
Ciancimino under arrest: The 'third level'?
had disappeared from his family’s villa.
Others have not been so fortunate. In an
apparent attempt to scare any other mafiosi
who might plan to talk, two unidentified
men last week gunned down the brother of a
man who has been cooperating with the
police. In October eight men were shot to
death in Palermo, a mass slaying that police
suspect may be related to Buscetta’s testi-
mony. More recently, the families of the
magistrates involved in the current investi-
gations were threatened. Last week another
Mafia figure was shot down in Palermo.
“The sense of hidden violence, which you
know can start up any time, accompanies us
at all moments of the day,” says Vincenzo
Geraci, a Palermo investigator.
Sing: Yet the tension is accompanied by a
heightened sense of optimism. “We have
finally arrived at the highest level of the
Mafia,” says Palermo prosecutor Domen-
ico Signorino. U.S. prosecutors hope short-
ly to be able to make a similar claim. Last
week authorities announced that reputed
Sicilian boss Gaetano Badalamenti, 61, will
soon be extradited from Madrid to New
York to face charges of running “the pizza
connection,” a $1.65 billion heroin-smug-
gling ring that used pizza parlors as fronts.
Justice Department officials say there are
strong indications that Badalamenti will
cooperate with prosecutors. Not coinciden-
tally, Buscetta is scheduled for temporary
extradition to New York as early as next
week and is expected to testify against Bada-
lamenti and others. As the script for an old
gangster movie would have it, if both ma-
fiosi sing, it should be quite a duet.

Type 2400
In Defence of The Nation
VSEL Type 2400 will be in the water in 1987
when Australia is expected to award its own build
contract for RAN submarines.
VSEL Type 2400 is backed by a $585 million per
annum defence research programme allocated to
sea equipment in the U.K. defence estimates.
The Royal Navy has announced its willingness to
change the design of its own later Type 2400
submarines to match Australian requirements.
VSEL is developing one of the largest "greenfield"
warship sites in the world on a 24-acre site at
Barrow U.K. at a cost of $336 million.
The "greenfield" facility incorporates modern
production technology and build strategies and
will be on-stream in mid 1986 for the Trident build
programme.
This "greenfield" design technology experience is
available to Australia for its submarine/
warship programme.

Minicars for a Maxi Price
BERNARD GOTFRYD—NEWSWEEK
Agostini’s junior-size ‘Ferrari': ‘Conspicuous consumption gone berserk’?
This is conspicuous consumption gone
berserk,” said Cathy Ballman, an Am-
herst, Mass., mother of two, last week as she
gazed at what just might be the world’s most
expensive children’s toy: a replica of a Fer-
rari 308 GTS, made in Italy by Agostini
Autojunior Co., that sells for $lO,OOO. The
priciest model by far, it is only one of dozens
of gas-powered minicars on sale this year at
several U. S. toy and department stores.
Would your child like a Jeep Laredo with
chrome trim and plastic headlights? It’s
only $2,400. Or how about a Pennzoil racer
modeled after the Indy 500? It sells for just
$l,lOO, but then it has no trim, and the
lights are painted on. There’s also the clas-
sic Mercedes, which carries a $3,000 price
tag. The Ferrari, of course, is in a class by
itself: sold only at F.A.O. Schwarz’s toy
store in New York City, the 9-foot 4-inch-
long, red minicar boasts leather bucket
seats, shock absorbers, electrically operat-
ed lights and an 11-horsepower engine that
can run up to 28 miles per hour—but only
on private property, since the car doesn’t
meet the emissions tests required for on-
road driving.
The major American mini manufacturer
is F.W. Leisure Industries, Inc., in Tempe,
Ariz., which is currently making 30 or 40
models, including a pickup truck and a fu-
F. W. minicars: A limited but lucrative market
turistic Lola race car, along with the chassis-
less go-cart of yesteryear. Most of its cars are
sold to businesses for use in promotions; in
fact, retail sales account for less than 5 per-
cent of F. W. ’s sales. But retailers are basical-
ly pleased with the volume of their sales.
Schwarz’s New York store, which has seven
minis besides the Ferrari on display, sells
between two and five cars per week. Nei-
man-Marcus has sold 5 of its 14 Jeeps, but
only 1 of its 6 German-made Mercedeses.
“People say, ‘Look, isn’t it cute? How fun’,”
says toy buyer Ann Stuart McKie. “But
when it comes to buying, I’ll sell a whole lot
more teddy bears than I will Mercedeses. ”
Cruising Room: The minicars do have a
limited market —not only because of the
cost. They are unsafe for children under 7
and uncomfortable for kids older than
about 14. “I’ve driven one,” says I. Magnin
toy buyer Janet Crain, “and I’m 5 feet 8. Of
course, my knees were up to my chin.” Also,
the cars require more cruising room than
the average backyard offers. Still, says
Schwarz executive Andrea Claster, “lots of
people have estates, and they need to get
around them. It’s no different than getting a
snowmobile or a horse.” Most of the buyers,
she adds, are affluent car buffs or those who
consider the minis “a funny status symbol.”
Parents probably shouldn’t worry that
their kids will all be clamoring for
minis this year the way they were for
Cabbage Patch dolls last Christmas.
As Ballman points out: “Most kids
won’t even look at this and ask to
buy it with any seriousness—kids
know the outer limits of their par-
ents’ resources.” But some people
will be outraged at the very idea of a
$lO,OOO children’s toy. “It can be
considered kind of gross,” concedes
Claster, “especially to people who
have trouble affording a $ 10,000 car
for themselves.”

SUPE'I? RESPONSIVE


FACT: TOYOTAS
NEW SUPER RESPONSIVE ENGINES
ARE A POWERFUL ANSWER TO
TODAY'S DRIVING NEEDS.
The fact is that they literally deliver 'super
response.'
That's also the feeling of the motoring writers
of Australia, who are hard to impress at the best of
times.
Their reaction to the new SR engines was
unanimously enthusiastic.
"Toyota now has a range of engines almost
bewildering in their diversity., but all of mouth-
watering configuration." The Advertiser.
"The array of engines that have flowed from
the development workshops...from Toyota is, quite
simply, stunning.” The Sydney Morning Herald.
Toyota engineers have achieved four remark-
able goals at once: 1. Super responsive performance.
2. Less fuel consumption. 3. Low noise. 4. Less main-
tenance.
This has been developed with technological
fact after fact.
SR engines
feature fuel
efficiency in-
novations, ad-
vanced elec-
tronics, new
mechanisms,
and sophisti -
cated engine
analysis tech-
niques.
I
Special laser holography of the engine block
led to huge weight cuts. New materials cut
friction and reduced inertia. With design innova-
tions such as pent roof combustion chambers and
wr
WL
swir! control
valves.
In fact,
Toyota has devel-
oped several
world firsts in the
process. A hollow
camshaft, and
sinter-forged
connecting rods.
The objective was to challenge all existing en-
gine technology and break new ground. And many
million dollars later, leaving no stone unturned, the
SR series of engines is Toyota's super response.
"Make no mistake. These are very wonderful
engines...the main interest lies in lifting the bonnet
and showing the amazement underneath. They are
for visual gasps and whistles of excitement."
The Financial Review.
The best way to judge the difference in these
engines is to feel it for yourself. In remarkable cars like
Camry, Sprinter, Corona, and other exciting new
Toyotas. To sit behind the wheel and feel the Super
Response. It's a fact!

Reagan: 'I'm Not in a
Compromising Mood'
Reagan wants spending cuts to reduce deficits—but Congress may not cooperate.
Accepting the annual turkey: A bipartisan ‘Thanksgiving dinner’strategy was abandoned
WALLY McNAMEE —NEWSWEEK
It was Ronald Reagan’s first cabinet
meeting since his landslide election vic-
tory, and he was feeling feisty. The subject
was the federal deficit—and as budget di-
rector David Stockman finished a brief but
gloomy presentation on the rising tide of red
ink, Reagan declared that he was “not in a
compromising mood.” In re-electing him,
the president insisted, the nation had voted
against tax increases and for further cuts in
spending—and he said he was “ready to hit
the sawdust trail” to fight for his principles.
He railed against scaling back his defense
buildup, maintained there is still plenty of
fat elsewhere in the federal budget and—
reaching back to his speech endorsing Barry
Goldwater for president in 1964—argued
that his vintage views on reducing the scope
of government are “as true today as they
were then.” He also took dead aim at the
notion that less than two weeks after his
triumph in the presidential campaign, Ron-
ald Reagan is a de facto lame duck. “The
cast on my supposedly ‘lame’ leg is a won-
derful kicking tool,” Reagan said. “And I
intend to use it.”
With that defiant rhetoric, Reagan ral-
lied his troops for what may be the toughest
battle of his second term: an all-out attempt
to reduce the deficit without a tax increase.
To a man, his budget experts say that goal
implies a new and even more drastic assault
on Big Government—sacred cows, social
spending, entitlement programs, anything
and everything except the Pentagon.
But if, as Reagan says, social security
and the Defense Department are olf limits,
and if the “social safety net” has been
trimmed to the point of rupture, there are
no easy cuts left. Although Stockman’s
experts can find budget cuts worth up to
$lOO billion over the next four years, every
item on their hit list is either defended by
entrenched special interests or comes out
of the pockets of the middle class. Mean-
while, as Stockman told the president last
week, new estimates show the 1985 deficit
jumping to about $2lO billion—a debt bur-
den that has shaken the confidence of even
the most optimistic Reagan advisers. As a
result, the administration’s current plans
for tax reform may need retooling—
and Reagan faces the dreary likelihood
of a protracted impasse with Congress
over the details of domestic spending.


WRIGHT—SCRIPPS-HOWARD NEWSPAPERS
Bad news from Stockman: The projection is for red ink out as far as the eye can see
It is still far too early for anyone to know
how the budget battles will turn out. The
mood of the 99th Congress will be shaped
by the election results, by a series of leader-
ship battles and by the president’s tactics.
The administration itself, furthermore, is
still divided between those who think some
form of tax increase is urgently needed and
those who disagree: the supply-side loyal-
ists, self-anointed keepers of Reaganomics’
flame. Despite his fighting words at last
week’s budget review, Reagan has yet to
confront the hard details of choosing
which programs to cut, and none of his
closest aides is willing to predict just how
he will set priorities. “Anyone who tells
you what the president is going to do about
the deficit, beyond proposing another
round of spending cuts that he may or may
not get, is kidding you and himself,” says
one senior aide. “Nobody knows how this
is going to turn out.”
Freeze? It is the U.S. economy itself that is
likely to play the decisive role during the
budget debates ahead —which is why, last
week, the administration’s deficit busters
were tinkering with their forecasts one more
time. If the economy slows down, as most
economists think it will, projected revenues
will shrink, safety-net spending will in-
crease with higher unemployment and the
deficit may grow more rapidly than it al-
ready has; if the economy grows at a sus-
tained high rate, as some supply-siders still
hope, the deficit may yet gradually disap-
pear (chart). The bad news for Reagan,
however, is that the 1985 deficit seems to be
climbing even though the economy as a
whole is still expanding—which suggests
that continued economic growth, in itself,
will probably not reduce the deficit much in
the years ahead. Stockman’s revised fore-
cast shows that trend: by his estimates,
spending will exceed revenues by about
$2OO billion a year until the end of Reagan’s
second term. In fact, Reagan’s men no long-
er talk about balancing the budget at all;
their new goal is merely to reduce the deficit
to a “reasonable” (but unspecified) percent-
age of the gross national product by 1989.
Accordingly, last week’s postelection
cabinet session was hardly a festive occa-
sion. There was discussion of a possible
freeze on domestic spending and a collective
vow to take a “base line” look at current
ing within the administration be-
fore Reagan’s new budget goes
to press. But the bottom line,
based on Reagan’s combative
mood, was that the Reaganites
would go up Capitol Hill next
January prepared to fight. The
political strategy was what
White House aides had pre-
viously called “the OK Corral”
scenario—and all thoughts of a
reasoned appeal for bipartisan
cooperation (the “Thanksgiving
dinner” scenario) seemed to
have been abandoned. “We’re
going to send Congress some
very tough cuts,” said one top
aide. “We’re going to go for some
of the cuts that have been denied
us before. .. . We’ll fight for
them. We’ll take whatever heat
there is, and we’ll point fingers
where people in Congress refuse
to go along.” The voters, the aide
added, knew “precisely where
[Reagan] is on all of this,” and
voted for him. Now, he said, the
message is clear: “People don’t
want taxes raised and they want govern-
ment shrunk. If the Congress doesn’t cut,
we’re gonna lay it on them.”
Grumbles: The mood on Capitol Hill was
equally grim. Reagan’s fighting words —
and the memory of past budget battles they
elicited —set off a chorus of grumbles from
Democrats and Republicans alike. Given
the intractable realities of the deficit and the
GOP’s scant gains in the House, there
seemed little likelihood that the next Con-
gress would be disposed to accept the White

Volcker (left) and Kemp: As critics see it, the Fed stands in the way of strong economic growth
programs with an eye to justifying every last
million. Aides agreed that Reagan would
probably have to accept some reduction in
defense spending, just as he has in the past.
But Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
blocked the suggestion that, this time, the
administration should accept political reali-
ty by outlining at least some defense cuts in
advance. “For God’s sake, Cap, give us
something!” Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan exploded at one point. “No,” Wein-
berger replied, gazing at the ceiling.
In fact, there will be more hard bargain-
House view of Reagan’s mandate on budget
issues. “I get tired just thinking about the
next nine months,” said one Senate Repub-
lican staffer. “The Democrats are bitter
from this election and the president has
boxed himself in very badly in all of this.”
House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O’Neill
and Majority Leader Jim Wright were
unanimous on the Democrats’ postelection
strategy: as O’Neill put it, “We’re going to
make Reagan keep his word on taxes.”
What that meant, a Ways and Means Com-
mittee aide explained, was that “we’re not

Reagan’s Code ofHonor
CHRISTOPH BLUMRICH— NEWSWEEK
Can the president keep his pledge not to raise taxes?
Speaking in Pittsburgh in 1932, in the
throes of the Great Depression, Franklin
Delano Roosevelt pledged to balance the
federal budget and cut spending if elected.
But shortly after FDR took office, a young
member of his Brain Trust advised that
achieving either goal was hopeless—and
potentially disastrous. “What about my
promises in Pittsburgh?” Roosevelt is said
to have asked. Deny you were ever there,
the aide replied.
Ronald Reagan, a onetime supporter of
FDR’s New Deal, may face a similar di-
lemma. During the campaign he pledged
not to raise taxes —even though budget-
deficit projections by his own experts show
red ink as far as the eye can see. But next
month the Treasury Department will un-
veil its long-awaited tax-reform plan—one
that, while officially not an overall tax
hike, seems certain to increase some taxes.
The chances that the entire package will be
enacted are slim, and Congress may well
reject its key provisions in favor of more
conventional tax increases. With the 1986
budget deficit now estimated at $2OO bil-
lion, the president may find he has little
choice but to go along.
By all accounts, Reagan is still holding
out for “revenue neutral” tax reform: sim-
plifying the tax code, cutting tax rates,
“broadening the base” of taxable income—
and holding the total tax take level. The
Treasury’s proposal will take this ap-
proach. Largely developed by Treasury
aides Charles McLure and Ronald Pearl-
man, a preliminary draft of the plan calls
for a modified flat-rate tax —a concept bor-
rowed from two congressional
proposals, one sponsored by
two Democrats (Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey and
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Mis-
souri), another by two Repub-
licans (Sen. Robert Kasten
of Wisconsin and Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York). The plan
would separate taxpayers into
several tax brackets, certainly
fewer than the 13 in the cur-
rent system, and subject them
to sharply lower rates than
most now pay. Personal ex-
emptions and standard deduc-
tions would be large enough
to exempt those below the
poverty line from income tax-
es altogether, granting them
some modest tax relief. Broadly
speaking, most other taxpayers
would pay roughly the same in
taxes that they do now—but
some middle- and upper-in-
come taxpayers who are heavy
users of tax deductions would
probably pay more.
The reason is that the Treasury plan
would tax a number of so-called preference
items now entirely or partially exempt
from taxes (table). Many of the changes
would be startling: state and local income
and sales taxes would no longer be deduct-
ible from federal taxes, and interest on
municipal bonds might be taxed as well
(although the Treasury is considering a
provision that would route receipts from
such a tax back to states or localities that
issued the bonds). Employers’ contribu-
tions to pension funds and for health bene-
fits would be taxable to employees. The tax
code’s special treatment of long-term capi-
tal gains would be eliminated; gains would
be adjusted annually for inflation, then
taxed at the same rates as ordinary income.
And even the most politically popular
preferences, deduction of interest on home
mortgages and installment loans, may well
be scaled back; the Treasury is consider-
ing limiting the total amount of interest
that taxpayers could deduct —perhaps to
$15,000 to $20,000 a year.
Sweeping Change: The Treasury pack-
age would also do away with some major
tax-law changes that the president sup-
ported in his first term. Individual Retire-
ment Accounts and Keogh plans may no
longer be exempt from taxes, and employ-
ers’ contributions to deferred-compensa-
tion plans would be taxable to employees.
Corporate tax changes would also be
sweeping: the Treasury’s draft calls
for doing away with investment-tax
credits and the accelerated-depreciation
allowances contained in the 1981 tax bill. A
long list of tax loopholes designed to benefit
certain industries, such as oil, timber and
Bradley (left), Gephardt: Choosing among options


going to allow Reagan to hide in the base-
ment while we raise taxes. If he wants some-
thing, he is going to have to ask for it.” More
likely, this staffer said, “absent a willingness
from the president to get serious [or] some
sort of crisis, we’re just going to spend our
time punching each other in the dark.”
*No Risks’: Reagan’s chances for winning
Republican support were not much bright-
er. In the Senate, where 22 Republican in-
cumbents will face the voters in 1986, the
prospect of yet another round of wrangling
over the deficit had decidedly limited ap-
peal. “These guys aren’t going to take any
risks,” said one GOP staffer. “Do you think
they’re going to want to raise taxes, and
possibly drown, for a lame-duck presi-
dent?” Said another Republican aide:
“Large discretionary domestic cuts are ri-
diculous even to think about. When you
exclude social security, there just isn’t all
CHRISTOPH BLUMRICH— NEWSWEEK
that much to touch —and what’s left could
be just as sensitive.”
In the House, meanwhile, the adminis-
tration’s budget-cutting game plan is al-
ready under fire from right-wing Young
Turks like Rep. Newt Gingrich and Rep.
Jack Kemp. “I’m not going to support these
slashes in social-spending programs in the
absence of a commitment to high growth,”
Kemp said last week. “The mandate I heard
was for economic recovery, and Stockman
is still talking about reducing the size of
government.” As a leading supply-sider,
Kemp lamented the possibility of “another
logjam over fiscal policy,” and he was criti-
cal of Stockman’s new economic forecast.
But the real reason the economy has re-
cently begun to slow down, Kemp said,
was Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker’s attempts to control the
money supply. “The Fed should loosen
things up and quit trying to manipulate the
economy,” Kemp complained. The Demo-
crats, watching the GOP’s deepening divi-
sions, could happily conclude (in Senate
Majority Leader Howard Baker’s phrase)
that they “ain’t got no dog in that fight.”
The postelection political outlook, in
short, can be reduced to a single word —
stalemate —and Reagan’s men know it.
For one thing, his strategists at Treasury
have already conceded that their top-prior-
ity plan for tax reform was probably going
nowhere for the time being; as one
Treasury official put it last week, “We can-
not imagine that something so fundamental
and radical could get adopted by Congress
in a single year.” For another, as one veter-
an business lobbyist says, the notion of a
frontal attack on spending, whether or not
it is coupled to tax reform,
is probably “dead in the water
right from launching.” And even
last week’s hot rumor about an
across-the-board freeze on feder-
al spending left some adminis-
tration officials unimpressed.
“The more you look at it, the
sillier it is,” said one budget
expert, arguing that a “freeze”
would entail “hundreds of
pages” of legislation cutting fed-
eral programs in detail.
Mystery: In the end, all parties
to the deficit wrangle agree,
Ronald Reagan himself is the
central mystery of Reaganom-
ics. Which forecasts does he
read —and which does he be-
lieve? Which programs will he
cut —and which will he save?
Will he give a little on defense
spending and taxes, or will he
fight to the bitter end for dra-
conian domestic-program cuts
that almost no one in Congress
wants? Does he worry, even a
little, that the deficit may yet
drag the economy down, or does
his inveterate optimism tell him there will
be a happy ending? Above all, how much
does he care about the arcane details of
fixing the broken budget?
Probably no one, not even those closest to
the president, really knows the answers to
these questions —but one former adviser,
economist Murray Weidenbaum, has his
own view. Reagan believes that a constitu-
tional amendment to require a balanced
budget is “the only satisfactory long-term
solution to the fiscal problems of the United
States,” Weidenbaum says, and he will fight
for its ratification for as long as it takes. In
the meantime, Weidenbaum says, Congress
will tinker with taxes and spending —and
the nation will suffer from 12-digit deficits
for the rest of the 1980 s.

coal production, would be sharply cut or
eliminated. Finally, a single tax rate, per-
haps 30 percent, would be levied on corpo-
rate income—well below the current maxi-
mum rate of 46 percent. Companies would
be assured one major tax break: to end the
so-called double taxation of corporate divi-
dends, they would be able to deduct them
from income as a normal business expense.
The final result, Treasury officials main-
tain, would be a vastly simpler and more
equitable tax system than the current 13-
bracket code. They argue that their pro-
posed code would bring in exactly the same
amount in revenues as the current system
yields; any increases will come as lower
marginal tax rates encourage more eco-
nomic activity, thus raising the flow of
revenues to the Treasury. Reagan’s tax
experts also believe that lower tax rates will
coax much of the underground economy to
the surface, where it will pay taxes.
Fiction? Others outside government
aren’t nearly so sanguine about tax reform.
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson
Lehman/American Express, worries that
many of the potential reforms could actu-
ally impair economic growth. Cutting
back on interest deductions would raise the
real after-tax cost of borrowing and could
even drive down housing prices, making
homeowners less wealthy and crimping
overall consumer spending. Changes in in-
vestment incentives could have an even
larger impact. A change in capital gains,
for example, might sap the strength of
financial markets, while eliminating de-
preciation could dramatically slow spend-
ing for plant and equipment.
Above all, many dismiss the ostensible
“revenue neutrality” of the reform scheme
as pure political fiction. “It’s unrealistic to
expect Congress to battle with all the inter-
est groups who will be fighting this, only to
wind up with no net gains in revenue,” in-
sists Irwin Kellner, chief economist at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. It’s also
likely that the opposition of such groups
could either delay tax reform until 1986 or
put it on the road to nowhere. As a result,
the Treasury has also drawn up a detailed
analysis of a kind of national sales tax, or
value-added tax, as the new levy most like-
ly to be adopted by Congress should total
reform fail.
Given the heated political climate in
Congress, raising the odds on overall tax
reform seems a safe bet. The best guess is
that lawmakers will pick and choose
among the various reform proposals to try
to devise a package of their own liking.
Then they can turn to the truly gargantuan
task of trying to persuade Ronald Reagan
that, like FDR, he can forget an “over my
dead body” promise.

NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES
Biotechnology: From Lab to Marketplace
Biotechnology has come of age. The first biotech prod-
ucts —such as human insulin manufactured by genetically
altered bacteria—have left the laboratory and entered the
marketplace. Researchers are now readying a number of genet-
ic products designed to accomplish anything from treating
cancer to reducing air pollution. While some of biotech’s
brainchildren are the result of sophisticated gene-manipula-
tion techniques, others rely on nothing more complex than the
simple fermentation process that turns grape juice into wine.
Making Interferon With Microbes
Biotech’s most celebrated offspring has long been inter-
feron, the protein that is seen as a possible cure for cancer. All
three types of interferon —alpha, beta and gamma—are pro-
duced in small amounts by the human body. Today, biotech
firms such as Genentech, Inc., of South San Francisco, Calif.,
are producing interferon in
greater quantities by implanting
the appropriate genes into the
genetic structure of microbes; as
the organisms multiply, they
serve as interferon factories.
Of the three interferon types,
gamma seems to be effective
against the widest range of can-
cers, according to Genentech of-
ficials. But the protein’s effec-
tiveness is boosted even further
when it is used together with a
newly synthesized substance
called Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF). Like gamma interferon,
TNF is produced in minuscule
amounts by the body’s immune
system. When applied to a tu-
mor, TNF appears to cause the cancerous cells to break apart
and die. Healthy cells remain unaffected. Genentech research-
ers are unsure how TNF can distinguish between normal and
diseased cells, but they know that TNF’s ability to do so is
valuable: conventional chemotherapy destroys certain healthy
cells as rapidly as it destroys cancerous cells.
TNF is still being tested on animals; human tests will begin
in 1986 at the earliest. By 1989, Genentech, along with Fu-
jisawa Pharmaceutical Co. of Kyoto, Japan, plans to market a
TNF preparation. The firm expects to market a gamma inter-
feron product by early 1987 at the latest.
Preserving Life—And Destroying It
A Seattle, Wash., biotechnology firm is working on another
cancer treatment that may be available within a year. IMRE
Corp. recently hired Dr. John Sjoquist, a Swedish scientist who
is a pioneer in working with Protein A. This natural compo-
nent of human cell walls appears to work against not only
cancer, but also hemophilia and Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer-
ous condition associated with AIDS. All of these diseases may
be caused in part by a breakdown of the body’s immune system;
as a result, antibodies that might normally attack a disease
suddenly fail. Protein A apparently binds to these renegade
CHRISTOPH BLUMRICH— NEWSWEEK
antibodies and allows them be filtered out of the bloodstream,
freeing the body to reactivate its defense systems.
IMRE has developed a blood-dialysis system that uses a
machine to pump a patient’s blood plasma through a tube rich
with Protein A. As the offending antibodies are filtered out, the
plasma is returned to the patient’s circulatory system. The
procedure reportedly has cured 20 percent of test cancer
patients in Sweden and the United States.
Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd. of Tokyo is using an antibiotic to
destroy life rather than preserve it. The firm’s new herbicide
reportedly kills any type of unwanted plant while leaving
minimal amounts of elements that might harm animals and
people. The company synthesizes the antibiotic by fermenting
a strain of fungus common to Japanese soil.
Many biotech firms are developing products based on bacte-
ria that eat substances undesirable to people. Researchers at
the University of Illinois in Chicago, for example, have created
a microbe that feeds on a princi-
pal component of Agent Orange,
the ill-fated herbicide used by
U.S. troops in Vietnam. And a
General Motors assembly plant
in Bowling Green, Ky., is using a
specialized bacterium to help
keep its air cleaner.
The Bio-Solve process, devel-
oped by a GM engineer, is help-
ing the automaker gear up to
meet a 1987 government dead-
line for air-quality standards in
auto-assembly plants. As auto-
mobile bodies are being spray-
painted, most of the toxic solvent
used in the pigment is released
into the air, where it floats and
may be inhaled by workers. With
Bio-Solve, motorized fans draw the solvent into a stream of
water running under the floor grating. The solvent-water
mixture flows into a biological reactor, where bacteria in a bed
of sand feed on carbon compounds in the solvent. Once saturat-
ed with solvent, the bacteria-filled sludge is removed, freshen-
ing the water for the next batch of solvent.
Next: Designing New Proteins
As incredible as some of today’s biotech products may seem,
they could pale in comparison with tomorrow’s custom-engi-
neered proteins that may well be tailored to almost any chemi-
cal task. A firm in Liverpool, England, has created a product
that will make developing such proteins much easier. The
substance, called Ligaid by its creator, P and S Biochemicals, is
a chemical glue that allows any two bits of genetic material to
stick together. Simply by adding Ligaid to the right test tube,
technicians can now create a new combination of genetic
material in a fraction of the time it used to take. Ligaid contains
ligase, an enzyme that helps genetic material bind. Ligaid costs
$47 for one milliliter, enough for as many as 200 genetic
experiments. P and S plans to distribute Ligaid throughout
Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

Coxsedge to
Nicaragua
WELL-KNOWN Australian
Labor Party left-winger Joan
Coxsedge is seeking pastures
greener in the struggle to
defend the Nicaraguan re-
volution.
One of the four of the
socialist left old guard who
withdrew from the elections
for the faction’s executive,
Coxsedge has joined a
Victorian trade union delega-
tion to Nicaragua, “so that she
could explain to the
Australian people just what is
occurring there now.”
David Grove, secretary of
the Trade Union Committee
on Central America, ex-
plained Coxsedge’s pivotal
role thus: “The delegation will
examine ways to assist Nicar-
agua in the event of a US
invasion and will highlight
some US companies suscept-
ible to industrial action in
Australia. This tiny under-
developed country is in
danger of becoming another
Vietnam and we hope Mrs
Coxsedge can put the lie to
current US policy.”
Fact-finding has come at a
convenient time for Mrs
Coxsedge whose circle of
hardliners, headed by Bill
Hartley and George Craw-
ford, has suffered a series of
crushing party and factional
defeats lately. The rot began
during the recent round of
federal pre-selections.
Mother superior
A FORMER NUN has been
chosen as Housewife of the
Year in a national contest in
the Irish Republic. Mrs Mary
Holleran, 39, a mother of
seven, of Clonbury, County
Galway, won the first prize of
almost $l2OO.

Opinion poll puzzle
THE McNAIR Anderson
group is conducting three sim-
ultaneous Australia-wide
surveys on voting intention
for the three major newspaper
groups in Australia.
Although conducted at the
same time, the three surveys
are giving significantly differ-
ent “leads” for the Australian
Labor Party over the Liberal-
National party.
A poll published in The
Sydney Morning Herald and
The Age said the lead was 19
percent, that in the Melbourne
Herald and papers in other
states said it was 15 percent;
while The Australian’s poll
said 13 percent!

Timely appeal
for a comeback
at the Rialto
A MYSTERIOUS letter
arrived last week at the
Vecton Corporation, builders
of Melbourne’s Collins Street
Rialto project. The letter
claimed it was neither a hoax
nor a joke and was signed, in
pencil, “the guardian of the
Olderfleet.” The Olderfleet
clock, a weighty piece of 19th
century grandeur disappeared
from the 300 metre-high
Gothic Olderfleet Tower in
the Rialto in December 1980.
The loss was noticed
eventually but only after a
letter from its abductors ap-
peared in The Age newspaper.
Almost four years later,
with the restoration ceremony
due on November 21 and the
official opening ceremony
scheduled for Christmas Eve,
the spectre of the clock arises
again.
Michael Buxton, a director
of the corporation, will go on
Victorian television this week
to appeal for the clock’s
return.
He will offer immunity
from prosecution and promise
to throw in a couple of bala-
clavas for the culprits.


A challenge to the wealthy
BUSINESSMAN Dick Smith
has thrown down the gauntlet
to the wealthy people of
Australia because he is “sick
of multi-millionaires who
never give a cent.” The
challenge was issued at the
weekend when funding for
Australia’s first dedicated Life
Education Centre was out-
lined by New South Wales
Premier Neville Wran.
The $1.5 million high-tech
centre to combat drug abuse
through educational pro-
grams is to be built at Coly-
ton, near Penrith all the
sooner as the result of a
$750,000 donation from
Smith.
The state government an-
nounced a contribution of
$500,000 toward the centre on
November 4. Smith contacted
Wran offering to donate
$750,000 if the government
raised its commitment to
$750,000, thereby eliminating
time-consuming fund-raising.
Outlining his reasons for
support, Smith said: “This is a
project close to the heart of
the Reverend Ted Noffs, a
renowned crusader against
drugs, and I have long been
an admirer of the way he is
working on this important
issue.
“He has been trying to
raise the money for the Coly-
ton project for the past five
years but, until a few weeks
ago, had only a measly
$BO,OOO in hand.
“I thought I should do
something constructive about
it, so I’m putting up $750,000
and I’ll take that donation up
to $1 million with a further
$250,000 providing someone
will match it. I am also
hopeful that my donation may
be the catalyst that encourages
governments and people in
every state to act in the same
way.
Sapphire Sun, Nov 84
“It’s the festive season, it’s
a time for giving so I’ll keep
the offer open until Christ-
mas,” Smith said.
He had declared “open
season” on tight-fisted mil-
lionaires. If just one person
takes him up on the offer, the
total amount of money Smith
will have given away to
charities and other needy
causes in recent years will be
well over $2 million.
Smith was motivated, in
part, by the latest wealth
listing in a business magazine.
It showed that more than 100
people each had more than
$32 million. “But what do
they do with it?” Smith
exploded. “They’re obsessed
by it. They hang on to it.
“I’m aware of one man
worth more than $5O million
who told me straight that
‘all letters for donations and
help go direct to the rubbish
bin.’ What a great Australian!
How disgusting!”
Smith added: “The chal-
lenge will show whether
Australia’s wealthy are gen-
erous or selfish. For anyone
with $3O million, a $250,000
donation is less than 1 percent
and not likely to be missed.”

Party do not ask you, the
people of Australia, to take us

- Prime Minister Bob Hawke
The only trust I seek is the
continuance of the trust we

20 months, the trust - the
mutual trust - that we have
tried to build with and between
all sections of the community,
your trust that we will continue
to put Australia first.

Last week’s solution
BACKGAMMON
by Michael Llayd
HOW MANY times are you bored
by the re-creation of a game with a
frustrated player saying: “Look at
this this was the position and
guess what he (the opponent)
rolled!” The answer is always
easy. One simply looks at the
position and picks the “horror
roll.” The questioner invariably
remarks: “How did you know?”
Players who continually blame
their rotten luck very rarely admit
that they lose through their own
inadequacy. Logical explanations
for their losses usually fall on deaf
ears.
The problem is that Lady Luck
does play a part in their downfall
but the key word is “part” the
rest of the blame is theirs!
Consider the illustration.
White rolls a 6-5; what is the
move? How many people would
simply move as indicated, placing
Black on the bar and closing
White’s home board?
Suppose, on your next roll
(having made the indicated play),
you threw a double 5. The two
men on Black’s 8 point would stay
there and you would be forced to
open your 6 point. If white closes
and rolls a double 5 and Black re-
enters on the 6 point, White quite
easily could be gammoned!
You might argue that a double
5 is 35:1 against. So it is, but why
tempt fate? Why lay the ground
for a horror roll when there is
absolutely no need? White should
move the 6-5 from B 8 to W 6.
Double 5s would be no problem
nor would anything else.
Of course, playing as suggested
leaves a blot on B 8 but Black
would be wary of hitting because
all White would need to do would
be to sit on the bar until Black’s
board was ruined. The old adage
goes: “Never give a sucker an
even break.”

Opening lead five of spades.
I WAS playing in a tournament
some years ago in Juan les Pins,
France, when this deal arose. My
partner was Dorothy Hayden, of
New York, and our opponents
were two Frenchmen we had
never seen before. West doubled
two diamonds and led a spade.
Mrs Hayden won the queen
with her ace and returned a low
heart. Worried that the heart
might be a singleton, West took
his ace, and East who wanted
no other suit led played the
jack. West returned a heart, won
by South with the 10.
Aware that the trumps were
stacked against her, Mrs Hayden
led a low diamond from her hand.
West took the 10 but was end-
played! He had to give away a
trick, whatever he returned.
Hoping to find East with the
king, West led the A-10 of clubs.
Mrs Hayden won with the king
and returned the five of diamonds,
putting West under pressure
again.
If he took the jack and exited
with a club, declarer would ruff,
play the ace and another trump,
and thus force West to play a heart
to the K-Q.
If he ducked the diamond,
hoping East could win the trick,
the outcome would be the same.
West was thoroughly licked and
he knew it.
Later that day, Rixi Marcus,
England’s top woman player,
came to me and said West had
asked her: “Who is that tall, at-
tractive English woman who is
such a good player?”
Mrs Marcus, recognising from
the description that it was Mrs.
Hayden, answered: “If she’s at-
tractive and English, she’s not a
good player, if she’s English and a
good player, she’s not attractive;
and if she’s attractive and a good
player, she’s not English!”
