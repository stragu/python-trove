THIS MONTH'S COVER
A camouflaged Japanese fuel barge blazes
furiously in Pelikaar Bay, near Koepang
(TimorJ after an attack by Australian Beau-
fighters. These aircraft, by smashing Jap-
anese supply lines, are helping to starve
out the enemy's Pacific island garrisons.

COVERED Since its formation in November, 1943,
EVERY the Australian First Tactical Air Force
LANDING has covered every landing within reach
of its New Guinea airfields and has
completely disrupted the enemy's sea supply routes.
In 17 months, from its first base at Nadzab (see
map below) it has advanced its stations to the
forward airfields in Tarakan, Borneo.
The force, equipped with squadrons of Spitfire and
Kittyhawk fighter-bombers, Australian-built Beau-
fighters and Beaufort medium bombers, was strength-
ened by Australian Liberator squadrons flown from
their northern Australian bases before the Tarakan
operation. For 17 days before the Tarakan invasion
by Australian troops, Liberators softened up the
landing area defenses while fighter-bombers covered
the invasion convoy from th>elr base at Morotal in
the Halmahera Island group. On the morning of the
landing, Beauflghters flew a record round trip of
1,400 miles to strafe enemy beach positions and to
draw enemy fire for photographic spotting by a high-
flying Mitchell. Information of the enemy's loca-
tions, gained from this mission, enabled Australian
commandos to smother enemy gunfire before it could
be brought into action against the invasion troops.
During the landing, beyond the range of Morotai-
based fighter-bombers, Australians brought down
their big Liberators in daring low level sorties to
spot for the amy and act as co-operation planes.
ENGINEERS Australian Air Force engineering and
LANDED bomb disposal units landed with the
WITH TROOPS invaders and began unloading 10,000
tons of heavy equipment for airfield
construction while the infantry was still fighting
for its beach-head. When the first airfield was
captured five days after the landing, it was read-
led for use overnight. Occupation of Tarakan has
now brought hard-hitting fighter-bombers within
reach of many important enemy bases in the Nether-
lands East Indies. It also gives them a front-
line base from which to cover new landings attempt-
ed in the rich, firmly-held Islands in the vi-
cinity.

BEAUFORTS HELPED SPEED WEWAK'S FALL
280 SORTIES Twin-engined Beaufort bombers of
IN 5-DAY the RAAF flew 280 sorties in
BOMBARDMENT three days to help Australian
ground forces capture the import-
ant Jap-held base at Wewak, in northern New
Guinea. For months before its fall, Beauforts
based on Aitape hammered at Wewak in close co-
operation with the Australian Army advancing
down the coast and over the inland mountains.
During the final onslaught, targets for the
bombers were mainly enemy ammunition and fuel
dumps and stores. High explosives found their
mark to wreck vehicle parks while incendiary
bombs started fires raging in the stores area.
More than 700 Beauforts have been built in Aus-
tralia and a great number of these have now
been provided for the squadrons operating from
bases on the north coast of New Guinea. Tar-
gets for these planes are Jap concentrations in
New Guinea and New Britain. But, additional to
bombing, their work includes flying ammunition
and supplies to Australian ground patrols which
are sometimes cut off during deep penetration
of enemy-held territory. On one such mission,
a Beaufort dropped two cages of homing pigeons
by specially-designed parachute to waiting
patrols. All the birds were recovered and were
later used to carry Army messages. On another
occasion, a formation of Beauforts intercepted an Army call for help, swung from its course and dived into
the enemy formations with guns blazing, to disorganize completely the enemy's attack. Latest role of the
versatile Beaufort is the spraying of areas in New Guinea Infested with malaria. For this Job the bomber
is equipped with a "flying spray gun" and an entomologist as passenger.
All these tasks are incidental, however, to the day-by-day bombing missions in support of the army, and
strikes at enemy supply areas and coastal vessels with which the Japs try to supply their beleaguered
forces on by-passed Pacific Islands. They add up to make the Beaufort one of the hardest working planes
in the RAAF.
AUSTRALIANS FLEW THUNDERBOLTS "AERIAL ARTILLERY" TO COVER RANGOON INVASION
TRIUMPH Australian pilots, flying Thunderbolts, provided aerial artillery cover for British troops
FUR AIR when they Invaded Rangoon, last Japanese bastion in Burma. Rangoon's capture marked the end
SUPPLIES of a long, often heart-breaking Job of supplying the Fourteenth Army from the air. Dakotas
undertook the supply work and ability of the army to call on them for practically every re-
quirement enabled the Fourteenth to make a spectacular drive from central Burma almost to the gates of
Rangoon without fear of their land supply lines being cut.
Australians figured prominently in the fall of Rangoon. They were among the aircrews temporarily divert-
ed to Jump-masters' duties, teaching and flying with Indian and British paratroops who captured defense
points near Elephant Point on D-Day. Australians were in the crews of RAF Liberators which softened up
Rangoon with 390 tons of bombs the day before the invasion forces were aerially escorted to the river ap-
proaches of the city. An Australian navigator was the first to lead relief planes to Rangoon Jail with
food and medical supplies for abandoned Allied prisoners, including a number of his own countrymen.
Finally, it was an Australian Wing Commander who, when the Japanese abandoned him in Rangoon Jail, hoist-
ed the British flag over the prison, proclaimed martial law and ruled the town until the arrival of the
British Aimy four days later.

HEAVY BOMBER CREWS FIND "FOOD DROPPING" HAPPIER JOB THAN BOMBING CITIES
SURRENDER Since the end of the war in Europe, Australian crews of heavy bombers have been asslgied
BRINGS a Job which they find happier than bombing blazing European cities flying mercy planes
NEW TASKS 311(1 dro PPl n g food supplies in Holland. Intelligence officers have been hearing a differ-
ent sort of report after missions have been completed when they are told that the "food
bombs" have been dropped "right into the larder". When the "cease fire" came, Australian airmen con-
tinued to fly to the continent as part of the enormous taxi service which brought thousands of war
prisoners back to England.
One Australian Sunderland flying on the Coastal
Command service, won the distinction of captur-
ing a Nazi U-boat. Far out over the Bay of
Biscay, scene of many grim fights with enemy
submarines and Ju 88's, the crew of the Sunder-
land sighted a surfaced U-boat and prepared to
attack when the black flag of unconditional sur-
render appeared on the submarine's conning tower.
The Sunderland signalled a British destroyer and
flew round as escort until the submarine was
taken into custody.
There were 12 Australian squadrons in England
and Northern Europe when the Nazis capitulated.
They comprised heavy bombers, fighters, fighter-
bombers, Beauflghter attack ships and flying
boats. These squadrons dropped 58,000 tons of
high explosives, and 8970 tons of incendiary
bombs on Nazi targets. Heavy bomber squadrons,
flying Lancasters and Halifaxes, made 692 at-
tacks on 241 targets. In Northern Europe, Aus-
tralian aircraft flew 33,000,000 miles in
195,000 operational hours equivalent to over
22 years of battle flying. First Australian
squadron to begin operations from Britain was a
Sunderland reconnaissance unit in March 1940.
During the war, they covered 4,000,000 miles in
33, 700 operational hours.
BEAUFIGHTERS HELP STARVE OUT JAPS
DEATH Australian aircraft based on Morotal (Halma-
TQ heras) and Darwin (Australia) have rung up
aiIPS an imposing record of Japanese ships sunk
and damaged in Pacific waters and are help-
ing to starve Japanese from their island garrisons.
In the first four months of 1945, Australian aircraft
in the Southwest Pacific have sunk 9 ships and dam-
aged 22, and have sunk 101 barges and luggers and
damaged 113.
Beauflghters, low level attack ships, are equipped
with four 20 mm. cannon and eight .303 machine guns.
Combined fire-power from these has been known to cut
a 60-foot lugger in half. They also carry bombs
under their wings and, occasionally, depth charges
and rockets.
Typical of a Beaufl giter's dally work is this report
from a pilot after a morning's Job: "No barge sitt-
ings. Strafed and left listing a 60-foot two-masted
schooner. Strafed and hit 40-foot coastal schooner
nearby. Strafed and sank two-masted coastal schoon-
er and strafed another, leaving burning. Strafed
and broke up 60-foot schooner. Strafed and hit 30-
foot motor launch".
