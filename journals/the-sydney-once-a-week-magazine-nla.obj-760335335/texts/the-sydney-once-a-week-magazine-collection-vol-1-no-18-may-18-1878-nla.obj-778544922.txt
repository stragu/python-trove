AGENTS will oblige by forwarding returns immediately after receipt of
accounts rendered from this office.
Remittances, if by P.O. Order, to be made payable to C. H. Barlee,
Sydney.
TO BE, OR NOT TO BE?
Wb shall feel obliged to our Subscribers by an
early intimation of any irregularity in the
delivery of weekly numbers, that it may at
once be rectified.
NTS.—Advertisements for “SYDNEY ONCE A
WEEK ” will be received up to ten o’clock on
Thursday morning.
We are compelled to address our
readers on a personal topic. We
hope, however, that it is one in which
they will manifest not only some
interest, but also a little principal.
The favourable reception which
this magazine has met with from the
public of New South Wales is suf-
ficient to show the want which
existed of an entertaining and inex-
pensive family journal.


Believing that by the expenditure
of a moderate amount of additional
capital the circulation may be in-
creased to such an extent as to make
the “ Once a Week ” a handsome
property in a very short time, the
proprietors have resolved to invite
their supporters to take an interest
in it to the extent of one half of the
proprietary by purchasing 1000
shares at £1 each.
The magazine being even now
almost self-supporting, the proprie-
tors feel confident that an additional
£5OO would be ample to render it
thoroughly payable. They do not,
therefore propose to call up more
than 10s. per share, unless the
shareholders should themselves de-
cide to expend the balance in render-
ing the property more attractive.
This step is not taken without due
consideration.
1. It will give the public confi-
dence in the stability of the concern.
2. It will engage the efforts of a
large proprietary to promote its suc-
cess.
3. It will attract the attention
of advertisers, who will in the forma-
tion of the company receive a reply
to the doubt which seems to haunt
them Is “ Once a Week ” going
to last?
The shares will probably be ap-
plied for at once, without going
beyond the list of subscribers.
Early application is therefore ne-
cessary to prevent disappointment.
Shares will be allotted in the
order of application.
Terms —One shilling per share
on application; one shilling and
sixpence per share on allotment; the
balance in calls of one shilling and
sixpence per month.
Messrs M. B. Pell and W. Hill
have kindly consented to act as
Trustees pro tern .
Should any unforeseen circum-
stances prevent the formation of the
company, all moneys will be returned
without any deductions

TALES OF THE GOLD MANIA.
BY OUR OWN MANIAC.
No. 4.
THE COMPASS AT FAULT.
In a mining township at which I was
living, where quartz-mining was the
principal industry, I was member of
a Church Committee. Church matters
under the voluntary system somehow
were not in a very flourishing condi-
tion in that place, and sometimes we
were for months without a clergy-
man.
There was also more or less diffi-
culty in getting the money to pay the
necessary stipend when we did succeed
in getting a parson to undertake the
duties of the district, and the Com-
mittee had to exert themselves to their
utmost to obtain donations and sub-
scriptions.
In one of my rounds taken for this
purpose I called upon a well-to-do
blacksmith, and asked him to con-
tribute a monthly or quarterly sum. I
urged upon him very strongly the duty
which devolved, upon him as an old
resident and a householder to do some-
thing to support the church to which
he belonged, and having got him to
express his satisfaction at learning
from me that a clergyman whose
services we had been trying to secure
was on his way to the township, tried
to apply his own motto, “ Strike while
the iion is hot,” to the subject in
hand.
“ Come, now,” said I, ‘‘what shall
I put you down for ?”
“ Well, I don’t know,” said he,
“ I’m paying into a good many claims
as it is.”
“ Perhaps the claim I am asking you
to go into might pay far better than
any of them in the long run,” I re-
plied.
“Yes, that's what they all say ; but
there’s very few of them turn out so
well as they’re cracked up, and they
cost a deal of money.”
“ Then I can’t persuade you to give
anything at all towards the Church.”
“ No, I don’t think I’ll go into any-
thing else just yet.”
And I left him feeling that it was no
use to hammer at him any more than
it was at one of his own anvils.
On one occasion, when there had
been no resident clergyman for some
time, we had a visit from a reverend
gentleman, a most estimable man and
an excellent preacher. He merely
came up to see the place, but he stayed
over Sunday, and, as a matter of
course, officiated in our church. Now,
the Bev. Mr. was a high
churchman, and was strict in his ob-
servance of the forms of worship
which ministers holding his views
affect. For instance, in repeating the
creed, they turn their faces to the
east, intone various portions of the
service, and so on. The impressive
way in which our visitor read the
prayers of the church gave great
satisfaction. We listened with pleasure
to the clear and melodious tones of his
voice as he led the chants, and an ex-
cellent sermon at the close confirmed
the favourable opinion we had formed
of him from the moment he entered
the reading desk.
Our prejudices were in no way
shocked by the slight innovations upon
the form of worship we had been ac-
customed to join in, and we did not
feel in the smallest degree offended
when he turned his back upon us to
repeat the creed.
At this part of the service he in-
tended, no doubt, to turn his face
eastward, and that he made a con-
scientious effort to do so there could
be no question. Perhaps it was the
fault of the architect who designed
the chancel, or it may be that our new
pastor mistook its position, for as a
member of his flock I took particular
notice of his movements, and I can
safely affirm, from my knowledge of
the bearing of the quartz reefs on
either side of the church as seen from
the open windows, that by the compass
he was standing in a line exactly twenty
degrees west of north.


A RAT.
BY A. DE FONBLANQUE.
The party remained on board till
about six o’clock, and by the time it
broke up everyone had forgotten the
“ Rat”; but as Mrs. Austen was
crossing the levee, he ran up, much to
the annoyance of her companion, who
had had enough of him.
“Isay,” says the Rat. “Do you
like him ?” with a chuck of his thumb
towards the steamer.
“ Captain Gilbert?”
“ Yes—is he your feller V*
“ Get out, you scamp !” cries the
gentleman indignantly.
“Let him speak, Fred,” the lady
pleads. “No, Dick, I am married,
and is my husband ; but Captain
Gilbert is our kind friend. I crossed
with him once, and he was very good
to me when I was sick.”
“Was you ever sick?” asks Dick,
with a face full of wonder.
“ Often. So I can answer your
question, and say I do like the captain
very much.”
“ You’d hate for anything bad to
happen him ?”
“ Why, of course ! to him or to any
one else.”
“ Wot, to me ?”
“ Indeed I would my poor boy. Oh,
Fred! see how wistful he looks!
Mayn’t I give him some of Charley’s
left-off* things ? I have a little boy at
home,” she goes on, seeing assent in
her husband’s eyes—“ about your
size.”
“ Does he get chicken to eat ?” asks
the Rat.
“ Yes.”
“ Every day ?”
“ Not every day,” she answers,
smiling; and it is well she does not
qualify her reply, for Dick’s credulity
was not yet sufficiently elastic to beat-
such a marvel as a boy, about his size,
who had chicken every day.
So they bid him follow them, and
more wonders are in store for him.
He sees Charley. He is taken up to
the lady’s own room, where the pro-
mised things are produced, and tried
on over his rags. Here he stands,
lost in admiration. The great broad
bed, with its satin coverlet, its lazy
lace-bound pillows, and snowy mos-
quito bar held back by silken ropes of
the same colour as the little knots
which, here and there, light up the
varied greens of the fern-spread car-
pet ; the armoirs with their plate-
glass doors; the dressing-table all
a-glitter with crystal and with gold,
and a score of crinkum-crankums, such
as he never before beheld; the pic-
tures on the wall; the flowers in the
balcony ; the perfume of the place (no
fixed odour, but a combination of all
sweet things), bewilder the Rat. If
he had ever heard of Fairyland he
would have thought himself there. He
had never heard of Fairyland, or of
the enchanters, giants, dwarfs, genii,
and all the dear old myths which sur-
round its beautiful princesses and the
exemplary third sons of its kings. A
drunkard who would drop a dime as
he staggered from the bar-room was
the nearest approach to a good fairy
that Dick knew. He gazed about him
bewildered; and some dim sense of
shame stole over him as he saw his
own reflection in the looking-glass
doors.
“ Mayn’t I put ’em on now ?” he
asks, as i 1 the things” are selected.
“Better not,” says the lady. “Put
them on in the morning. Come here
again about ten o’clock, and we will
see what can be done for you.”
He submits, and goes down reluct-
antly, with two whole suits of Charley's
left-off clothes bundled up in a large
handkerchief, and fifty cents in his
pocket. As soon as the hall-door closes
after him, the brute instincts of se-
crecy and evasion pull his jelly-bag hat
over his eyes, and send pirn off at a
run.
Outside a bar-room at the corner,
conversing affably with several noted
thieves of his acquaintance, is a police-
man. ‘ ■ Set a thief to catch a thief” is
a maxim which the powers that “ run’’
the New Orleans constabulary, put in
practice ; but the thief is rarely


caught. The chief duty of the force is
to catch votes for the polticians to
whom they jointly and severally owe
their places, and to be otherwise poli-
tically useful. The policeman at the
corner had just done a good stroke of
work. He had arranged that a row
should break out at a hostile club that
night, and the predestined disturbers
of the peace had pledged him once,
twice, thrice ! in whisky. He was all
a-glow with importance (and whisky)
when he saw our Rat come out of Mr.
Austen’s house, and scuttle off. Here
was a victim worthy of his “steal,” so
he immediately gave chase, shouting,
“ Stop thief!” and firing his revolver
at the fugitive.
His first shot struck a coloured girl
who was crossing the street, about ten
yards from where Dick ran, in the heel,
and his second went through a first-
story window and smashed a looking-
glass. The girl howled dismally, and
the proprietor of the starred mirror
appeared in his balcony, and discharged
several rounds of profanity. And
there it ended. It is quite regular for
policemen (or, indeed, for any one) to
fire after persons who attempt to give
justice leg-bail, though tney urge their
wild career through the most crowded
thoroughfares.
Our Rat—ignorant of the fact that a
New Orleans policeman has never yet
been known to hit anything that he
actually aimed at —gave in at the
second shot, and was walked off in
triumph to the station.
*****
Captain Gilbert spends the evening
with bis agent, and returns to the ship
about eleven o’clock.
“ Sorry to say, sir,” begins the chief
officer, ‘ ‘ that most of the men are
ashore.”
“ Without leave ?”
A shrug of his shoulders is his
answer.
“ Whose watch is it ?”
“ Mr. Andrews’.”
“ Send him here. How’s this, Mr.
Andrews ?” asks the captain angrily.
“It’s not my fault, sir. They don’t
go over the gangway. They crawl
over the side, and oil to the beams of
the wharf.' It’s impossible to stop
them*”
The captain knows New Orleans,
and being a just man, has no more to
say. It is very provoking! He is
going to sail to-morrow, and those
men will come on board either drunk
or stupid with the effect of drink.
Some of them, perhaps, won’t come at
all. „ n
The weather for the last few days
has been oppressively hot, and
now there is hope of rain. The sky
is dark and low, and the faint evening
breeze has gone down. The captain
goes to his cabin, which is on deck,
and tries to read, but the mosquitoes
won’t let him, so he gets into bed,
tucks in his bar, and sleeps the sleep
of a tired man.
Something makes him conscious
that two bells (one o’clock) are strik-
ing. Then he hears a whisper, “Cap’n!
Cap’n /” close by his side. In an in-
stant he has his revolver ready, and is
in the act of striking a match when
the whisper says, “Hush! it's me,
Dick. Don’t say a word ; don’t light
a match. Hush! Is there a man
named Phil Wood in your crowd?”
“ Yes, a fireman ; but he deserted
last week.” The captain whispers too.
“ Have you got specious aboard ?”
“ Specious ? Oh, specie you mean.”
“Wot’s that?”
“ Money.”
“ I thought so! Well, Cap’n, Phil
Wood and five more is after that there
specious, and they’s aboard now. ’
“ Good God ! Why didn’t you tell
me before ?” gasps the captain.
“ P’liceman chevied me, ’cos I'd got
a bundle that the lady giv’ me. Took
it away he did, and locked me up,”
explains the Rat; “ but I got out.”
“On board now, do you say?” asks
the captain.
“Yes ! and at work, too. Listen !
What the captain hears sends him
out of his berth with a spring.
“Fire that,” he says, thrusting a
pistol into Dick’s hand, “ and run for-
ward shouting help as loud as you can
scream.” Then he darts out on deck.


And no time to spare! The thieves
have overpowered and gagged the man
on watch, have cut round the fasten-
ings of the hatch leading to the specie
room, and already two boxes are out
and ready for spiriting away.
Dick does as he was told, and then
rushes back. Four of the thieves are
on deck, firing at the captain, who has
dodged behind the cabin skylight, and
is shooting steadily. Dick has five
shots left, and these he discharges
one after the other, with his eyes shut,
as fast as he can pull trigger. It is a
brisk affair whilst it lasts; which is
until the chief officer, doctor, steward,
and some others (aroused by Dick’s
shouts and the firing) come upon the
scene. Then such of the thieves as can
do so, jump overboard—for their re-
treat forward is cut off. Three re-
main ; one—the leader— dead, another
with his thigh splintered, and a third
with several balls in non-vital parts of
his body.
The first thing done is to release
poor Mr. Andrews, whom they find
still insensible from the blow on the
head which had put him hors de com-
bat. By this time the police have
come, and are searching the ship,
lest others of the thieves might be
hiding.
il What’s that in the wheel-house ?’
says the chief officer; bring a light
here. Ah ! it’s another of them;
turn him over. Oh, Lord ! Captain
look here 1 Here's gratitude ! If it
isn’t that d d Eat that the lady—”
“My God!” cries the captain ; “I
forgot all about him! Is he hurt ?”
“ Shot right through the body, and
serve him right,” is Mansfield’s reply.
It struck the speaker “ silly,” as he
afterwards said, to see the skipper fall
down on his knees beside the “Eat,”
lift his head upon his shoulder, and in
a voice hoarse with emotion, say,
“Are you hurt, Lick? Oh, Dick!
Are you bad, my boy ? Don’t start.
I’m your friend, the captain, Dick-
speak to me!”
“Is the p’lice gone ?” he moans.
“They shan’t hurt you, Dick—no
one shall. Oh, doctor, come and at-
tend this poor brave little fellow. Any
drop of his blood is worth more than
the lives of those scoundrels. Do your
best for him, and send for all the sur-
geons in the city if they can help poor
Dick . Poor little faithful chap ?”
The wounded thieves are carried off
to the charity hospital by the police.
Dick is taken to the captain’s cabin,
and placed in his bed. The ship’s
doctor does his very best for him. The
most famous surgeon in the city comes,
and looks grave. Captain Gilbert
never leaves him.
‘•Say!”—Dick’s voice has become
very low and tremulous—“was that
there money yourn ?”
“ No; but it was in my charge.”
“ You’d got hell if you’d lost it, eh ?”
il I should have been ruined.”
“ She wouldn’t ha’ liked that.”
“ She ? Who do you mean, my
boy ?”
“ The lady—her as you was good to.”
The captain turned aside, and tried
hard to swallow something which had
never passed his lips.
“Was it for her sake,” he asked,
“that you did this ?”
“Shesed she’d hate to have any-
thing bad come to you,” replies the
Eat, “ cos you was good to her when
she was sick. Two nights ago I heard
Phil Wood and his crowd talking about
robbing a ship of specious They sed
they was going to ’tice all the men
ashore with drink, and there’d be only
one forward besides the cap’n. There
was to ha’ bin one put at the cap’n’s
door to knock him on the head if he
came out. I didn’t know for sartin it
was your ship, and I was a-coming to
ask if you had specious, when the
p’liceman chevied me.”
“ Who was it that shot you ?”
“Don’t know. When I see the
p’lice I crawled away to where you
found me. I was skeared they’d think
I belonged to t’other crowd.”

NORFOLK ISLAND.
BY VIATOR.
No. 3.
It will readily be believed, after the
remarks I hear made as to the com-
plete isolation of the prisoners, and
the almost hopeless chance of many
ever leaving the island to eDjoy the
blessings of freedom, —that one grand
idea—the ruling passion in many in-
stances —the positive mania of the long-
sentenced men was to escape. Hope
never seemed entirely to leave them;
and not a chance of effecting it es-
caped |them. Very many attempts
had been made during the years pre-
ceding our arrival. The first I actu-
ally saw was as now described :
The boat-shed was built within a
short distance of the water edge—a
sort of tramway ran from the beach to
the shed doors, which, at night, were
carefully locked and a sentry placed
over them. The guard house lay be-
tween the sentry and the water ;
the guard usually consisted of a ser-
jeant and about a dozen rank and file
—another sentry being stationed also
at the guard-house door, and both
men were relieved every two hours.
I must here explain that while a
residence at Norfolk Island was by no
means, as I have before said, unpala-
table to the officers, by a majority of
their men the restraint was felt to be
almost unbearable. They certainly
had amusement enough provide i for
them during the period each day be-
tween the ten o’clock parade and an
occasional afternoon's drill. The 96th
foot were in garrison at the time I now
refer to. I don't know how it came to
pass, but on a certain night the boat-
shed guard consisted of a number of
soldiers who would risk life almost in
escaping from their rigorously-en-
forced duty. These mein, as events
subsequently proved, had been in sys-
tematic league with some few of the
convicts similarly affected. That same
night, at the usual muster at the pri-
son gate, half-a-dozen of these latter
class, strangely to say nearly all boat-
men (one, the foreman boat carpenter)
were missed, and an immediate search
was commenced in and around the
settlement for them but without suc-
cess, and several parties were sent
out into different portions of the
island likely to afford a safe hiding,
in the hope of securing the absentees.
About midnight the serjeant of the
guard was surprised at some unusual
noise in the neighbourhood of the
shed, and at once aroused his sleeping
subordinates, but found more than
ono missing. His first act was to
rush to the door, but he found himself
securely locked-in ; and, as the guard-
room doors were all constructed with
the strongest fastenings, he, in plain
terms, was a prisoner in his own
castle.
From the side windows, however,
he saw enough to convince him of the
treachery at work. There, beneath
him, and before his very gaze, he saw
over a dozen men. amongst them
some of his own messmates, running
the best of the whaleboats down the
tramway, and rapidly “making tracks’'
for the sea. From the window he
opened fire on them, with what success
was never known. Of course, the dis-
charge of firearms roused all the
settlement. Officers hurriedly jumped
out of bed, bugles sounded the alarm,
and in a few minutes over a hundred
rank and file were at the “ double,”
en route to the boat-shed, where they
found the gates burst open, a boat
gone, and a few yards off; the guard-
house securely locked-up. The door
was soon burst open, and hastily the
serjeant made his report. The narrow
pier inside the “ bar” was soon lined
with soldiers, many, it will be remem-
bered, thorough sympathisers with
their escaping comrades. In the
moonlight could be seen the whale-
boat rapidly approaching the breakers
—the crew pulling like lions. A hun-
dred flashes told out their tale of
death —(how many of the bullets went
purposely wide of the target?)—the
steersman was seen to lift up his arms
and suddenly fall; another in an in-
stant took the oar. A second volley,


but the surf hid the beat from view
as she fell in the trough of the sea.
No crew was at hand to man another
boat to set out in pursuit. After
another parting salute a distant though
faint cheer was heard as the bar was
safely cleared, and away went the boat
free from further danger, with a dozen
hearts leaping at the thought of a
glorious freedom—(oh! how cruelly
fallacious) —on the placid waters of
the Pacific.
No more musters—no more chains
—no forcing to labour—farewell to
“ salt junk and corn meal” on the one
side, and good-bye to parades, adju-
tant’s drills, early closings, and marti-
nets onj the other. Hey for liberty
and pleasant times !
The excitement was intense ashore.
What were things coming to when
Her Most Gracious Majesty’s troops
had so far committed themselves ?
Officers looked at one another and
thought, no doubt, of how “Head Quar-
ters would think of it.” But the
affair was done. So were they ! and
the order was given—“Right about
face to bed again.”
At dawn boats were sent out to ex-
amine the rock-bound coast, while
“looks out” kept vigilant gaze seaward
throughout the day ; but whether the
escapes went to the southward, under
the protection of Phillip Island, or
pulled direct to sea, east or west, no
ODe then knew.
It was found out by some of those
“ confidential ” whisperings, we all
wot of, that the men were not unpro-
vided with food and water; so that
their chances of reaching either New
Zealand, New Guinea, or, what was
more likely, picking up a Yankee
whaler, who would, in those days of
scurvy, during long voyages, which
oftentimes decimated their crews, —be
only too glad tc accept their services
and ask no questions.
In a few days the wonderment died
out, the “ reports ” were duly sent io
the authorities in Sydney, and I doubt
not drew some expression of regret at
the somewhat extraordinary disgrace
the Queen’s soldiers had saddled the
army generally with. But otherwise
j the settlement and its occupiers fell
I back into their normal every-day con-
! dition ; and so far as the convict por-
tion of the crew were concerned, why,
“ there were half-a-dozen less mouths
to feed.”
Some long time after the occurrence
tidings of the fate of these un-
happy wretches came to us, and we
were all saddened at the know-
ledge that on reaching the shores of
New Caledonia, they were set upon by
the islanders, and all were cruelly
murdered, and, I dare say, eaten.
This was about my first little bit of
excitement. We soon became more
inured to it ; and really, when no lives
were sacrificed, it was almost wel-
come as a reasonable amusement and
a break [upon the monotony of our
lives,
(To be continued .)
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY.
Mr. Driver’s sympathy with the hope-
fuls incarcerated in the Berrima Gaol
tended to a somewhat lengthy debate.
If what the honourable member sets
forward be founded on strict fact, all
I can say is that Messrs. Treeve,
Marshall & Co. cannot be said to
enjoy a pleasurable existence by any
means. Some members were evi-
dently impressed with the legality, if
not the positive expediency, of Mr.
Smart’s (the gaoler) “ knock down ”
system, as he applies it to the refrac-
tory portion of his charges, while the
exhibition of a sample of the “ Berrima
patent gag ” caused some little emotion
on the part of the more tender-hearted
legislators. But, as it was explained
that the “ exhibit” was rather sensa-
tionally ornamented with brass binding
and metal adjuncts—while the real
gag was but sirfiple wood—incipient
indignation cooled down very con-
siderably. Hanley Bennett amused
us very much by a quaint narration of
the circumstances of his inspection of
the gaol—the most reliable evidence


collected by that astute gentleman
having been obtained, as he stated,
from listening to a conversation going
on between “the coachdriver and a
passenger” on the subject! One fact
Hanley really did discover by his own
indefatigable research, and that was
the purchase of lean horses by the
gaoler, at low rates, and the fattening
of the animals up to a value of £2O on
spare hommy! The Sydney ’Bus
Company might accept this as useful
intelligence. He wound up his story
by commiserating with the contractor
for the gaol refuse, who, notwithstand-
ing he pays £8 a year for those
luxuries, had not received any supply
for three weeks ! However, a writer
in the Sydney Morning Herald has
declared that the gag is not wholly an
uncomfortable method of punishment.
This gentleman declares that “ if sub-
mitted quietly to, there is no torture
in the .matter,” but it is only produc-
tive of “severe inconvenience!” whilst
he is not above the admission that, “ of
course if the wooden tube be too large
for the mouth it ma / be very painful,”
<&c., and winds up his very eulogistic
“ gag” by regretting that so “simple”
aud “ effectual” a means of keeping a
man’s tongue at rest should be d sused.
I would suggest that accompanied by
that irrepressible philanthropist, the
“Vagabond,” Mr. T. M. should try
the effect of a month under Mr.
Small’s gag—ment.

of tbe late House differed most dis-
tinctly as i o the principles of debate.
The honourable member is perpetually
called to order for injudicious refer-
ences to matters wholly foreign to the
question at issue, and is as often ruled
to be “out of order.” Sir George
Allen has borne with it somewhat
patiently, but Sir John, of late, has
added insult to injury by contem-
tiously “bowing to the decision”—
stating he does so “ whether it is right
or wrong.” This is, of course, going
a little too far, and one evening last
week the Speaker resented a repeti-
tion of the compliment very smartly,
and with not feigned indignation—and
the knight, somewhat reluctantly,
“knuckled under,” and, let us hope,
will profit by the temperate counsel he
received.
The Commons of New South Wales
have at last determined to provide a
remedy for their own unruliness, and
will in all probability secure to them-
selves more consistency of demeanour
in future—by assimilating the pro-
posed “ household good conduct bill ”
to that in force in Victoria. Some of
the speeches on the second reading of
Famed's proposed bill I cannot pass
by without brief reference. M'Elhone,
who has been un-amusingly orderly of
late, took occasion to refer to chat
memorable night when he challenged
creation to a free fight. He said he
had merely called Terry “ another,”
and wouldn’t stand to be called a liar
by any man, much less the New
England representative. Mr. Jacob
evidently entertained serious mis-
givings as to the “ drunkenness
clause”—with its (italicised) penal
obligations of £IOOO fine or a couple of
years incarceration. He never (said
poor Mr. J.) had been drunk in his
life, but he couldn’t see the force of
such a price or alternative should he
see fit to “liquor up ” too persistently
in the chamber. Mr. Copeland was
perplexed as to the definition of
“tightness!” “One man,” says C.,
“ would tell you he was not intoxicated
when holding on to a lamppost!” and
his experience had taught him that
“ where one man would get drunk with
one glass another could take half-a-
dozen”—(though the hon. member
didn’t say what the effect would be)
but I took personal exception to
his extraordinary assertion that “ with
one or two exceptions he believed that
the members were a reflex of the
yeojple of the country .” I was well nigh
being committed for contempt, for
“ God forbid it” was upon my lips and
I, with difficulty, smothered it!
The extraordinary pertinacity with
which some few members of the House
air their insignificance by handling
every subject of supposed public inter-
est, ever has amused me ; but I sub-


mit, there was not necessity or
consistency inMr.Roseby advocating a
public funeral to the remains of the late
Mr. T. S. Mort. His demise caa be,
and no doubt ig, deeply regretted by
the colonists generally—none more so
than by myself—(for I knew him inti-
mately for over a quarter of the pre-
sent century.) But his own special ap-
preciation of the system of funeral re-
form now coming gradually into effect,
should have saved his name from this
unnecessary interference of minor
members of the Assembly’ or the ne-
cessity of Fitzpatrick or Robertson’s
rejoinders. He rests in peace—buried
quietly and in the presence of his
family—without ostentation, in the
neighbourhood of the country he loved
so well.
THE LOUNGER.
THE DEVIL’S ELBOW.
The road over which Cobb’s coach
travels from Brisbane to the Gym pie
gold fields, now in tolerably good
order, was, a few years ago, a caution
to stage drivers. The greater part of
it is through a mountainous country,
traversing the spurs of ridges in-
numerable on either side of the main
dividing range, which it crosses by
making a detour of about three miles
from the straight line then follower by
horsemen, over what was called the
Postman’s Gap. The ascent of the
mountain at this spot is as near an
approach to the perpendicular for about
three-quarters of a mile as the most
enterprising equestrian could desire.
It is hard work to keep your footing
when struggling up it leading your
horse, and next to impossible to ride
up it, from the difficulty of keeping in
the saddle and keeping the saddle on
the horse at the same time. The
drivers of Cobb’s coaches are the most
daring and indefatigable pioneers, and
the most expert whips to be found
anywhere. Give them any apology
for a road and they will take a four-
horse coach over it in the face of
obstacles which would daunt most
men. At the time I write of there
were a few hastily constructed bridges
spanning the creeks which intervened
between the mountain spurs. These
creeks, winding their way in a serpen-
tine form among the hills, are for the
most part narrow, with high over-
hanging banks, and having a very
slight fall to the rivers they feed, hold
the flood waters to such an extent that
an ordinary thunderstorm, with a pro-
portionately heavy fall of rain is suf-
ficient to render them impassable.
The traveller during the dry season
who may have to walk a mile up the
bed of one of these creeks or gullies to
find a drink of water may, if he be
sufficiently observing, obtain proof
that they are not always in the same
state of inactivity.
High up, often as high as thirty
feet from the bed, he will see clumps
of leaves and sticks left by the flood at
high-water mark in the forks of trees,
shewing what an enormous volume of
water had been temporarily imprisoned
between the narrow walls of t ( >e gorge.
Some of the worst of these crossing
places had been, as I have said, bridged
over and approaches to them formed,
but the heavy ground on each side, the
number of steep and sideling pinches,
and the numerous obstructions in the
shape of stumps and fallen timber
alongside of the narrow road, were
sufficient to call forth all the dexterity
of the drivers.
On the occasion I especially refer to
there had been a heavy thunderstorm
over night, and when the up-coach
with passengers from Brisbane arrived
at a very ugly crossing-place called the
Devil’s Elbow , it was found that the
wooden bridge had been carried away
by the flood.
There they waited for some hours
until the down coach from Gympie
pulled up on the opposite bank.
A conference now took place across
the creek as to the possibility of ex-
changing passengers and cargoes,
which did not seem the impracticable,
as although the bridge had been
broken up and the main portion of it
carried away by the flood, there was


a good deal of the debris left, which
formed a partial footing for active
men, and there were no women or
children among the passengers on
either side, with, alas, one solitary
exception, out of which the great
difficulty arose. In the up-coach
there were two or three male residents
of Gympie returning to their homes.
In the down-coach there was a bank
manager and three other men, but
there wds also an old blind woman
who had been sent down from Gympie
to the Brisbane Hospital under the
charge of the driver. To persuade
this old lady, who was infirm, and as
blind as a bat f to leave the secure
shelter of the inside of the coach in
order to perform a series of acrobatic
feats, in the course of which she was
sure to get wet, and more or less
bruised and knocked about, in order
to expedite the journey by a few
hours, was the task to which Ned Mur-
dock, the driver of the down-coach,
manfully addressed himself. What
arguments he used I am unable to
say, but he succeeded in persuading
his solitary female passenger to en-
trust herself to him in the dangerous
passage. By this time the male
passengers had all got across with
their traps, and had contrived to re-
adjust the scattered logs so that they
formed an unbroken link across the
creek, the last portion of the temporary
bridge, however, consisting of a
solitary log about a foot in diameter
level with the water’s edge.
Arrived at this point with his help-
less charge, Ned Murdock deliberately
set the old woman astride of the log,
with her legs dangling in the water,
and then taking up a similar position
himself on the log immediately be-
hind her, gallantly achieved the rest
of the journey— a distance of about
twenty feet—-by a series of hitches—l
believe that is the correct term—until
the opposite baiik was reached, when
the transfer being complete, the up
and down passengers went their
several ways, the blind woman taking
her seat composedly in the return
coach apparently none the worse for
her exertions. I obtained these facts
from Ned Murdock himself, and I
give them as a proof of his ingenuity
and perseverance. This was the only
hitchj he assured me, which occurred
during the trip.

For despite low critics, good fellows admit
That my whole is a gentleman perfectly fit
To represent majesty, with the address
And bland savoir faire of innate courtli-

His duties gets through with consistent

Not the least (shall we say) of his manifold

In the eyes of plain-thinking and high-

Who saw with regret that the turf was

To a field for rascality, touting, and

When my whole by example showed swell

PRIMITIVE RIDDLES.
We clip the subjoined from the
Saturday Review :—
When they were first propounded,
the human mind must just have
wakened to the knowledge of the fact
that there are analogies in nature.
Only a few very witty persons had dis-
covered that there may be metaphors
and similesAtmd that human relations
may be preaicated of inanimate things,
in jest or earnest. When people were
in earnest they constructed poetry, a
poetical jargon, and perhaps some
myths. When they were in jest, they
made riddles by the same process, and
out of the same materials. Thus the
Recueit de palemhours has this capital
joke:—
“ Uu pere a douze fils, chacun d’eux en a trente,
Moitie blancs, moitie noirs ?
L’an, les mois, les jours, les nuits.”
What can be more elemental ? It is as
simple as the myth of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, as explained by a learned
Dutchman and an impulsive young
Hungarian student. Again, “What
runs faster than a hors?, crosses water,
and is not wet?” The sun. Does this
not sound like the very earliest meta-
phorical thought of primitive man?
The humour of the Wolofs does not
rest on more simple combinations of
ideas. The old Alsatians have the
same puzzle, the Moravians (not the
religious sect) revel in it, the honest
Germans never tire of it. “ Quid peut
passer en face du soleil sans faire
ombre? Le vent.” This problem is
of Norman origin, and when the first
Norman wag thought out the riddle,
he must have been in the mental con-
dition of a Zulu. In a collection called
Rolissoniana, the wit asks, “ What is
the hair of the earth, and what is the
comb that combs it ? The grass is the
hair, and the wind i 3 the comb.” On
the coast of Senegambia the natives
ask, “ Who has his hair in disorder,
and asks God to comb it ?” The
answer is, le roncher, a kind of palm-
tree.
When the stars, the sun, and the
wind do not furnish the early wit with
topics, he falls back on periphrastic
statements about other ordinary ob-
jects of every-day life. The old
Northern style of poetry, in which
it is a point of honour to call
nothing by its proper name, might
have sprung from minds that
liked these riddles. The sea, in the
Northern lyrics, is the swan’s bath,
gold is the serpent’s hoard, the ship is
the sea-horse, and so forth. The same
sort of taste shows itself in the poems
of Hesiod. Reverse the process, cease
to call the ship the sea-horse, and ask
what is the horse that carries men
over tbe sea,andyou havethe primitive
riddle. They are often as easy as the
riddles for hot weather suggested by
the hero of Happy Thoughts— my first
is a boot, my second is a fish ; but
these mild diversions suit unsophisti-
cated people—the Eskimo, for ex-
ample—even in cold weather. Thus
the humourists of Morbihan revel in
our nursery riddle, “Two legs sat
upon three legs,” and the rest. The
old Alsatians were alive to this jest,
the wits of the Netherlands are tickled
by it. “ Tweevoet lagop den Dryvoet,”
they say in their honest dialect, to
which one’s heart warms, it is so
thoroughly Teutonic. The jokes about
eggs are extraordinarily dull. Here is
an enigma from Auvergne ; a pig
driver as primitive as Eummus may
have invented it: —
Pendillu pendillava
Barbillu le veillava;
Pendillu tumbeit
Barbillu le masseit,
Pendillu is an acorn : Barbillu is a
porker. Here surely we have the very
germ of the riddle. In Languedoc
they have refined on it and spoiled it.
In German patois
Hucke-pueke henk
Hucke-pucke tel
reminds one of our old friend Humpty
Dumpty who sat on a wall, and whose
catastrophe is fresh in every memory.
The people of Moravia know this joke
well, and it was probably current in
Ithaca in the time of the much-endur-
ing Odysseus.


TIT FOR TAT.
HOW A PUBLICAN GOT LAMBED
DOWN.
BY AN OLD BUSHMAN.
£ heading was well-nigh over in the
Mosquito Downs district. At two or
three sheds the men had been paid off,
yet Phil Bloxam had not as yet seen
the colour of a cheque,
Phil kept the Bushman’s Delight,
a rough hostelry which, during ten-
twelfths of the year scarce knew what
it was to shelter a guest. As the
Bushman’s Delight had to reciprocate
by keeping Phil, that worthy was
anxiously looking forward to his an-
nual harvest, the season for which had
at last arrived.
He leaned over his little bar counter,
gazing with most anxious glances out
through the open door upon the wide
extent of plain country which stretched
away for miles in front of his house.
Suddenly his looks brightened.
Under a heavy swag, borne horse-
collar fashion, he noted a traveller
making slowly for the inn.
As the weary, dusty wayfarer neared
the Bushman’s Delight, Phil was
pleased to recognise an old acquaint-
ance—a certain Dick the Cobbler,
whom he had severely “lambed down”
the preceding season.
“ This is luck ! ” chuckles Phil in
his sleeve, bethinking himself, though,
that he would have to be wary in his
approaches to Dick, who had not taken
his last cleaning out kindly.
Dick sauntered up to the verandah,
put offhis swag, and laid it by one of
the posts ; and then with a sulky
“ Well, mate,” to Phil, who had come
outside, sat himself down upon it,
making no sign of entering the bar,
“Well Dick, how goes it ? Making
for another shed ? ”
“No,” replies Dick, abruptly.
“ Been at Gordon’s this year, or
Affleck’s ? ”
“ At both. - ’
Thinks Phil, “ Two sheds and that
long job at fencing at Macleoffls ought
to have swelled his ‘ blanket’ to a good
round sum.”
Presently Dick rises and goes into
the bar and calls for a glass of rum,
“What’s yours?” adds he, as, to
Phil’s horror, he puts down, not a
cheque but a half-crown.
“ Oh, mine’s rum,” says Phil; “ and
which way are you bound for ? ”
“ This year,” and Dick emphasises
the “ this,” “ I mean to see a bit of
life. I’m off for Sydney.”
“ Well! it’s my turn now ; just wet
your other eye, and then we’ll have a
bit of supper. It’s getting on that
way.”
“ No,” replies the Cobbler, “not a
drop more ! I’m going to make Woo-
rollogo this blessed night! ”
“ Not you! ” says Phil.
“My word, but I am, though, and
here goes ; ” and out of the bar Dick
strode. Haying accoutred himself
with his swag, he marches off with a
surly “ So long” to the evil-looking
host of the Bushman’s Delight.
Phil, though he felt the justice of
the proceeding, was hot with wrath.
What a fool he was not to have used
the doctored bottle! He consoled
himself with the thought that there
were other fools in the world besides
himself and the Cobbler. Providence
(no one can help seeing) keeps up a
supply of fools in the interests of the
licensed victualler!
About au hour after Dick’s depar-
ture, and when it was close upon sun-
set, two more swagmen arrived at the
public.
Phil was not agreeably taken with
their coming, for Bill Peters and Jack’s
the Lad were counterfeit bushmen.
fellows who never did a hand’s turn
from year to year, but loafed about
bars when cheques were being knocked
down, or prowled about stations when
(as they were won’t to say) there was
no corn in Egypt.
The empty look of the inn seemed
to discourage them.
“Are you good for a ball,” says
Jack, with an insinuating grin, which
made him look like a hyena.


“ Blank you, no! I haven’t seen
the colour of coin for I don’t know
when. You can stay the night, of
course. The Cobbler’s only just left,"
“The Cobbler?’’ cried both the
new arrivals; “no! you don’t say
so ? ”
“ I do say so."
“ Why man ! he’s good for a thun-
dering burst! He’s got the total of
three good cheques, as I know of,"
remarks Jack’s the Lad.
“Well, he’s off and away, for all
that,” says Phil. “ He just had a
ball, and no more, and then made a
pash for Woorollogo.”
The two men sat down on the ve-
randah bench. Both had a dispirited
air.
All of a sudden Bill Peters points
out the smoke of a camp fire on the
plains to the east, where a few trees
formed a small clump standing black
against the horizon.
“ The Cobbler’s camping there this
blessed night, I’ll take my colonial
oath,” says Bill, looking at the gloomy
landlord.
“Ye.,, I daresay that’ll be him,"
growls Phil.
“ Perhaps you’ll be good fora bottle,
nowV suggests the Lad, insinuatingly.
“ What the devil do you mean ? "
“Just this, Mr. Bloxam, —give us
a bottle ; and if we don’t fetch the
Cobbler back again, blank my eye."
The idea was so good that Phil’s
hopes revived. He filled a square
bottle with rum, and started the two
worthies on their mission, with pro-
mise of good quarters and pickings if
the Cobbler’s “ burst ’’ came off at the
Bushman's Delight.
The rum acted iike a charm on Dick,
who, having drank a finger or so down
into the bottle, was easily persuaded
by his brother topers to return to the
comfortable shelter of Phil Bloxam’s
house, where a substantial supper
awaited them.
After supper glasses round were
filled at Bill’s order ; and then refilled
at Jack’s. Thereupon Phil proposes
another shout at his own expense, but
Dick, upon whom the liquor was be-
ginning to tell, insisted upon “stand-
ing Sam." W hen the drinks came in
he pulled out a one-pound note and
threw it down on the table.
“ That’s my blanked sort," says he ;
“ take for my supper and bed and
another round. You’ll get no more
out of me, Mr. Phil Bloxam, though
you are such a blanked sharp ’un.
Oh, I ain’t forgot you, believe me."
Phil took the note, promising the
change in the morning.
In another hour Dick and Bill were,
to all appearances, hopelessly drunk
on the floor. Jack’s the Lad, seem-
ingly well disguised in liquor, was
quavering forth objectionable ditties
from the seat underneath the veran-
dah, whence, however, he could keep,
an he were disposed, an eye on his
mates.
At about ten, Phil finding that the
shouting had ceased ; and seeing that
Dick was quite helpless, made arrange-
ments for getting him to bed. He
lifted him up, and dragged him to a
guest chamber, a little skillion in
which was a stretcher. Jack’s the
Lad staggered after them, much to
Phil’s annoyance.
“Help me to take his boots off,"
says the landlord.
“Ay, ay, Shir! ’’ replies Jack, with
a drunken leer.
“ I’d better take any money he's on
him, hadn’t I ? ” asks Phil and with-
out waiting an answer he commences
to search his guest. After a long
scrutiny of pockets and lining, he dis-
covers, carefully wrapped up in a
piece of rag, a cheque, signed “ Archie
Gordon," for £69 17s. lid.
“ D’ye see this, Jack ? ’’
“Ay, ay, Shir."
“Well, you’re witness I’ve got it.
Come along and have a ball before you
turn in."
Betimes in the morning Dick and
Bill were clamouring at Phil’s door
for a “ doctor," and, as may easily be
imagined, got a good stiff one. In
other words, the “burst" had been
successfully initiated, so successfully,


indeed, that when Dick learned that
his cheque was in Phil’s hands, he ap-
peared to be quite satisfied, and what
was more pleasing to Bloxam, quite
ready to shout against it.
During the day or two that followed,
the “ burst ” continued. One or two
other shearers dropped in, and the
prospects of Phil’s harvest looked
good.
Dick’s special monomania during
this particular bout, was to traffic
with Phil, from whom he purchased a
horse, saddle, and bridle, and a silver
watch.
On the fourth night of the “ spree”
Phil made up bis mind that the fol-
lowing morning he would give the
Cobbler notice to quit, by letting him
know that he was “lambed down.”
“Then, if he doesn’t see it,” calcu-
lated the worthy publican, “ I’ll take
back the little mare and the watch.
They’ll last him another couple of
days, after which he may go to
* * * *
But when the morning came, what
was Phil Bloxam’s surprise to find no
Cobbler, no little mare, no watch, no
Bill Peters, and no Jack’s the Lad ?
The men’s places were vacant in the
dead-house—the little mare was gone
from the stable.
“ Blank them for a blanked lot of
blanked thieves,” roars Phil when he
had satisfied himself they were gone,
“to return no more again, no more.”
The only consolation Phil possessed
was that £69 17s. lid. would,
liberal deductions for mare, watch, and
rum consumed, go a long way to-
wards satisfying even his greed. Still
he had been awfully sold; so he
blanked the Cobbler heartily when-
ever he came into his thoughts, which
he did continually.
But, alas for Phil, his consolation
proved a “ shicer.” Horribile dictu !
the cheque for £69 17s. lid., bearing
“ Archie Gordon ” a» plain as could be,
was returned to Mr. Phillip Bloxham
by his bankers, marked “ forgery !”
Then Phil felt down to his very
marrow that he had been got at. For
hours the universe was to him a
blanked blank.
The Cobbler never showed on Mos-
quito Downs after that year, nor did
Bill Peters or Jack’s the Lad ever
again proffer to help Phil Bloxam to a
good thing.
A PERSON OF VERY REGULAR HABITS.
Some twenty-five years ago, or per-
haps a little more, an aged and highly
respected physician departed this life
in one of the counties of Massachu-
setts. In fact, this worthy gentleman
had reached at the time of his decease
the extraordinary age of one hundred
and five years. No little interest, as
may be imagined, had hovered around
his slowly declining days, and this
was naturally awakened to fresher
concern at the period of his lorg-de
ferred death. He had always enjoyed
the full esteem of his fellow-citizens
and of the medical profession, which
naturally looked up to him as its
father and guide. The period of his
death was one of great excitement with
regard tp the temperance question,
and it was felt that most important
lessons for the benefit of the cause
could be derived from an investiga-
tion of the ordinary habits of a
gentleman of education and scientific
attainments, whose life had been pro-
tracted to such an advanced period,
doubtless owing to the rigorous
adherence to the laws of health, as
promulgated and enforced by the total
abstinence advocates of the day. Ac-
cordingly, after the lapse of a due sea-
son, a committee was deputed on the
part of the temperance societies to
wait upon some near relatives of the
old gentleman deceased, in order to
learn positively what had been the
course of his life, and by what means
he had so long preserved an existence,
in the possession of mental and phyid-
eal vigour, until at length it yielded to
the absolute decay of bodily powers,
without the intervention of any acute
disease. The deputation having pro-


ceeded to the ancient physician’s
late place of residence, waited upon a
gentleman who was his grandson, to
obtain from him all the particulars
concerning his aged relative. After
due sentiments of condolence had
been expressed, the suitable inquiries
were propounded.
“Doubtless,” said the chief interlo-
cutor, “your grandfather, enjoying
such a remarkable spau of existence,
was a strict observer of the rules of
temperance, and we need not express
our confidence that he indulged in no
excess in the use of hurtful kinds of
drink.”
“ Oh no, sir,” said the person in-
quired of; ” “ you may be quite sure
of that. My grandfather was a person
of very regular habits.”
“ But we should like to know, if
you please,” pursued the questioner,
“ something in particular regarding
his mode of life; how, for instance,
he began, and passed, and ended the
day.”
“ Well, sir, when he first rose in the
morning he took about half a glass of
pure Jamaica rum; my grandfather
was a person of very regular habits ;
this was his uniform custom.”
“ This, I suppose,” said the in-
quirer, “ was to give a sort of fillip to
his system after the lethargy of
lengthened repose, made requisite as
an exceptional case by his very ad-
vanced period of life. Please tell us
what his practice was during the rest
of the day.”
“ My grandfather, gentlemen, was a
person of very regular habits, and
took nothing else of this sort until
eleven o’clock, and then only a glass
of Jamaica rum.”
“ Indeed; did he drink anything
with his meals ? ”
“ Not exactly with his meals; but
about half-an-hour before dinner he
drank a mixture to which he was par-
tial, consisting of half-and-half of
cider and rum,” replied the man.
“ After drinking that it was his cus-
tom to go out for a short walk and re-
turn to dinner. When dinner was
about half through he would then
drink, say, a glass of rum or whisky,
as the case might be, and another
when dinner was over. Dinner was
always punctually on the table at one
o’clock ; he took no more until four
o’clock, and after that a small quantity
in his tea. His practice was not to
drink anything else until near bed-
time, which was always nine o’clock,
when he had a glass or two of whisky
or rum ; unless, indeed, some neigh-
bour or friend came in to join him.
He was very hospitable always, and,
as I have remarked, my grandfather
was extremely regular in his habits.”
The committee looked at one another
and hesitated about pursuing the in-
quiry any further. It occurred to
them, however, that it would be well
to save themselves, if possible, in re-
gard to the use of tobacco.
“Did the doctor ever smoke?”
asked the chairman.
“That,” said their host, “ was one of
his most regular habits. He was not
often without a pipe in his mouth
when not engaged professionally ; but
he did not smoke in his bed.”
“ Surely, then, he used tobacco in
no other way ? ” suggested the inter-
rogator.
“My grandfather every Saturday
afternoon, gentlemen, purchased a
certain quantity of pigtail tobacco, say
from twenty-one to twenty-three inches
in length ; this he cut up into seven
different portions, one of which per
day, aud no more, he used for chewing
in the course of the seven days of the
week. My grandfather’s habits, as I
have observed
“Oh, confound your grandfather
and his habits ! ” broke in the ques-
tioner, out of all patience. “ I beg
your pardon, Sir, but it is not neces-
sary to pursue this subject any
further.’* —Boston Courier.
An epigram, if smart and good,
In all its circumstances should
Be like a jelly-bag.
Make it at top both wide and fit
To hold a budgetful of wit,
And point it at the end.


NARRARA CREEK.
(Written in 1874.)
From the rainy hill-heads where, in starts
and in spasms,
Leaps wild the white torrent from chasms
to chasms—
From the home of bold echoes whose
voices of wonder
Fly out of blind caverns struck black by
high thunder—
Through gorges august in whose nether
recesses
Is heard the far psalm of unseen wilder-
nesses—
Like a dominant spirit, a strong-handed
sharer
Of spoil with the tempest, comes down the
Narraia!
Yea, where the great sword of the hurri-
cane cleaveth
The forested fells that the dark never
leaveth—
By fierce-featured crags in whose evil
abysses
The clammy snake coils and the flat adder
hisses—
Past lordly rock-temples where Silence is
riven
By the anthems supreme of the four winds
of heaven—
It speeds with the cry of the streams of the
fountains
It chained to.its sides and dragged down
from the mountains!
But. when it goes forth from the slopes
with a sally—
Being strengthened with tribute from
many a valley—
It broadens and brightens, and thereupon
marches
Above the stream-sapphires and under
green arches
With the rhythm of majesty—careless of
cumber—
Its might Jin repose and its fierceness in
slumber—
Till it gleams on the plains, where the
wind is a bearer
Of words from the Sea to the stately
Narrara!
'
Narrara, grand son of the haughty hill
torrent!
Too late in my day have I looked at thy
current—
Too late in my life to discern and inherit
The soul of thy beauty—the joy of thy
spirit!
With the years of the youth and the hairs
of the hoary,
I sit like a shadow outside of thy glory;
Nor look with the morning-like feelings,
O river,
That illumined the boy "in the days gone
for ever.
Ah | sad are the sounds of old ballads
which borrow
One-half of their grief from the listener’s
sorrow;
And sad are the eyes of the pilgrim who
traces
The ruins of Time in revisited places ;
But sadder than all is the sense of his
losses
That cometh to one when a sudden age
crosses
And cripples his manhood. So stricken bv
Fate, I J
Felt older at thirty than some do at
eighty.
Because I believe in the beautiful story—
The poem of Greece in the days of her
glory—
That the high-seated Lord of the woods
and the waters
Has peopled His world with His deified
daughters—
That flowerful forests, and water-ways
streaming,
Are gracious with goddesses glowing and
gleaming—
I pray that the singing divinity—fairer
Than wonderful women—may listen, Nar-
rara.
O, Spirit of sea-going currents—thou
being
The child of Immortals all-knowing, all-
seeing—
Thou hast at thy heart-the dark truth that
I borrow,
For the song that I sing thee, no fanciful
sorrow ;
In the sight of thine eyes is the history
written
Of Love-smitten down as the strong leaf
is smitten;
And before thee there goeth a phantom
beseeching
For faculties forfeited hopes beyond
reaching.


Thou knowest, O sister of deities, blazing
With splendour ineffable —beauty amaz-
ing, .
What life the gods gave me—what largess
I tasted —
The youth thrown away and the faculties
wasted !
I might, as thou seest, have stood in high
places
Instead of in pits where the brand of dis-
grace is:
A by-word for scoffers —a butt, and a
caution,
With the grave of poor Bums and Maginn
for my portion.
But the heart of the Father Supreme is
offended,
And my life in the light of His favor is
ended;
And, whipped by inflexible devils, I shiver
With a hollow “ too late ” in my hearing
for ever;
But thou, being sinless, exalted, supernal,
The daughter of diademed gods—the
eternal,
Shalt shine in thy waters when Time and
Existence
Have dwindled like stars in unspeakable
distance I
But the face of the river—the torrented
power
That smites at the rock while it fosters the
flower—
Shall gleam in my dreams with the sum,
mei -look splendid,
And the beauty of woodlands and water-
falls blended;
And often I’ll think of fai; forested noises,
And the emphasis deep of grand sea-going
voices;
And turn to Narrara the eye of a lover
When the sorrowful days of my singing
are over.
HENRY KENDALL.
A (rood Templar went one day to the
races, and when he returned home his
wife screamed and declared he was not
her husband. “My Jim never had a
nose like that, ” she cried; “and then your
eyes.” The neighbours came in, and the
husband exclaimed, “Oh, yes, I am her
husband, and I’ll prove it. Her teeth are
false; she has a bottle of brandy under
her pillow: her hair is dyed.” “That’s
sufficient,” replied the wife, “I believe
you. Come in.”
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMANS FERRY ROAD.
CHAPTER XI.
“ I know, too, where the geni hid
The jewelled cup of the King Jamschid
With life’s elixir sparkling high.”
“ Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another’s being mingle,
Why not I with thine ?’’
As Caldecott wended his way back to
camp his thoughts were full of his un-
expected meeting with the bushranger,
with the man who if his words were
true, and they assuredly were, was the
husband of his cousin Florence. Deve-
reux evidently had complete faith in
him. He had exacted no promise, had
not so much as asked him not to reveal
his whereabouts to living soul—so,
consequently, for honour’s sake, his
secret must be scrupulously kept. Be-
sides, was he not a relation by mar-
riage—hardly a desirable one, per-
chance—but still one of the family ?
This idea vexed George profoundly.
He liked old Hart, bore him great re-
spect, and not a little gratitude, but
certainly had never contemplated him
as a family connection. And then,
too, by what a sorry link was the con-
nection made ? By a desperate outlaw,
whose hands were stained with blood,
and on whose head was a price set !
Yet, for all that, there was a some-
thing in the fellow which Caldecott
felt had had the effect of attracting
him—something made up of rough
bluntness, piquant, though rudely ex-
pressed, cynicism, and vague pictur-
esqueness. Above all, Devereux knew
his mother’s secret and could help him
materially in his efforts to solve it.
What a pity it was Reynolds had not
been thought of that night at Yarra-
mundra when Devereux revealed to
him he had read the letter which re-
ferred to Aldridge’s escape! Yet there
had scarcely been an opportunity on that
occasion, as Devereux (with the police
almost within arm’s length of him) had
been too hurried to do more than
promise that he would do what he


could to aid him in solving the mys-
tery. The contemplated visit of Rey-
nolds, as just determined upon, might,
however, lead to his finding the wished
for clue. The question was, would
Reynolds speak at Devereux’s sugges-
tion ; might he not rather wrap him-
self up in his dignity as a respectable
licensed victualler, and decline to go
into particulars which would have the
effect of lowering him in the estima-
tion of a stranger ? Caldecott remem-
bered that when he had addressed
himself to Reynolds on the subject of
Devfereux, that the sly old publican had
professed to know the bushranger
merely as a man to whom he had let
some fencing, and who had taken him
in to the tune of several hundred
pounds.
On his return to his tent, George
found that Mr. Kenny had just re-
turned from Sydney, with news of an
exciting character, to say the least of
it. On the following day Mrs. Kenny,
a young and charming matron of the
correctly frisky order, was to arrive in
camp with a posse of ladies and cava-
liers, intent on a three days’ sojourn
under canvas. Mrs. Cosgrove was to
be one of the party, and, in all likeli-
hood, Miss Lucy Walton another.
George’s heart jumped at the prospect
before him, and in imagination he re-
hearsed many a tete-a-tete ramble with
the girl he loved.
There was, however, an immense
amount of work before the survey party,
in order to get things ready for the ex-
pected guests. Tents had to be pitched
and stores sent for. Kenny, however,
was a liberal employer, so his men
went at it with a will, and in ample
time had everything ready for the pic-
nicers.
Caldecott and Kenny rode out to
meet their guests, whose cavalcade
they met near the junction of the
Maroota road with the old northern
causeway.
To the immense delight of the for-
mer, Lucy Walton, looking simply
perfect in a close-fitting habit and
plumed riding-cap, was of the party.
A tell-tale blush and happy smile re-
vealed to George that she was glad to
see him.
“ There are other old friends to
shake hands with, Mr. Caldecott,” says
Mrs. Cosgrove, who smilingly witnes-
sed the meeting of the two she guessed
to be lovers. “ Have you quite for-
gotten Florence Cosgrove V ’
“Is it likely ?is it possible cries
George, reining his horse to that lady’s
side ? “ and how is Mrs. Cosgrove ?”
‘•Oh! in splendid health, and fit
for any amount of fun ; but so are we
all, ain’t we, dear?” This question to
Mrs. Kenny, who gave an affirmative
nod, which was quite superfluous, as a
glance at her face revealed the frolic
disposition of its lovely owner.
The other ladies of the party, the
two Misses Neville and a Miss Craw-
ford, and the gentlemen, Mr. Craw-
ford, Mr. Denne and Mr. Wilson were
then introduced to George, or he to
them. With Mr. Cosgrove he was al-
ready intimate, having, since the stick-
ing-up of the mail-coach, stopped a
few days at his house on the road to
town.
As they walked their horses slowly
towards camp, Caldecott rode between
Lucy and Mrs. Cosgrove.
“ Don’t you think I deserve great
credit for planning this ? ” asked the
latter.
“ What, were you its deviser ?”
“ Yes, Mr. Caldecott ; alone I did
it! I even chose the party to save my
indolent Blanche, that’s Mrs. Kenny,
the trouble of writing. Crawford and
Kate Neville, Denne and Fan Neville,
little Mr. Wilson and big Miss Craw-
ford, Kenny for Blanche, my lord
and master for Lucy, with you, Sir,
for me ; don’t you think the selection
does infinite credit to my heart and
head ?”
“ You’re a brick,” he whispered.
“Don’t call me names, Sir! Ido
believe that Locker is right after all,
even in your case. Eh, Lucy ?”
“Right? Oh, yes ; I think Locker’s
always right,” said Lucy, in warm sup-
port of one of her favourite authors.


“What? when he says that the
young man of the present day is a slave
to slang and cutty pipes !” asked the
elder lady.
“ I deny the soft impeachment as
touching the cutty pipes,” said
George.
“ What do you both mean ? What
are you referring to ? apropos to what
was Locker dragged in ?” inquires
Lucy in amazement.
“He called me a brick. Didn’t you
hear him ?”
“ Well,” says George impetuously,
in a rapid appeal to Lucy, “ isn’t she ?
Am I not right ?”
Quoth Lucy, “If you mean by the
term brick a most awfully clever, nice,
jolly ”
* ‘ Old woman, ’ put in Mrs. Cosgrove.
“Bar that , and it’s just what I do
mean,” pleaded the young fellow,
pleased to find Lucy on his side, even
in the playful pastime of a sham fight.
“ Oh! I see, here we have a new
definition of the term brick, common
noun, third person, very singular,
meaning, a most awfully dear, nice,
jolly, old woman. Yes, Locker is de-
cidedly right.”
At this juncture Mr. Cosgrove rode
up to join the trio. As the tract was
fast narrowing so as only to accommo-
date two horsemen abreast. Lucy rode
on with the elder gentleman who,
with his good lady’s cheerful consent,
was her devoted admirer.
Mrs. Cosgrove, seizing the oppor-
tunity afforded her, turns to George
Caldecott, and whispers,
“ I’m so glad about all this. Ido
really think you’ll suit our Lucy admir-
ably, and she’s as good as gold, and
such a sweet temper; but you must
give up all your wild habits, sir, dig-
ging, flirting, and so on.”
“Under certain reservations, yes,”
is the answer.
** Oh, of course, with me, but, mind
you, with no one else. She’s our dar-
ling, Mr. Caldecott, and if I didn’t
think that yon were worthy of her I
wouldn’t have proposed this little es-
capade of an outing by way of push-
ing on your fortunes. I suppose that’s
our destination ?” (this, as the road
suddenly turning, afforded them a full
view of the camp). “ I hope you’ll
be fortunate, dear cavalier. I know
you are brave.”
On arrival at camp, the party dis-
mounted, when the ladies were at ©nee
shown to their common quarters, a
large tent, carefully pitched on the
level crown of a gentle rise. The
entrance had been gaily decorated
with waratah and palm, and presented
a most aesthetic appearance.
About an hour afterwards the
dining-room or booth doing duty as
such presented an appearance charm-
ing enough to have furnished Boc-
cacio a hint for the scenery of his
Decameron.
(To be continued.')
THE MAN WHO “EAT SO
LITTLE.”
BY ISABEL.
When Clare and Millicent Leighton (two
particular friends of first became
acquainted with him he was a passenger
on board the Waratah for Sydney.
Tall, somewhat thin, there was nothing
especially remarkable in his appearance
except the size of his mouth, which was
about as large as a Clarence Liver oyster.
Not long after the Waratah started he
devoted himself to Milly, and entered into
conversation with her. The first subject
of any importance they discussed was, I
believe, sea-sickness; the second, shell-
fish ; the third —I forget what. Anyhow,
it was not exhausted when supper was
announced.
“ I feel so hungry, Clare,” Milly whis-
pered, as she took her place at the table.
“ The sea air has given me an appetite. ”
‘ ‘ Ah! excellent sign that. Good ap-
petite. Excellent sign, ’ ’ observed the man
who “eat so little,” as he seated himself
beside her. “ Nothing gives some people
an appetite, though, unfortunately. I can
hardly touch anything myself. Indeed
it’s a miracle, positively a miracle, how I
exist, I eat so little.”
Having been the auditor of the above
assertion, Milly was somewhat astounded
when a few minutes after she perceived
his plate piled up with good things, and


still more so, when those were devoured
and others occupied their place. Pile No.
2 suffered a similar fate to that of its
predecessor, as also did No. 3, and when
No. 4 was placed before him, and he pre-
pared to attack that with apparently
undiminished appetite, Milly put down
the biscuit she had been eating and stared
at him —she really couldn’t help it.
“Pardon, did you speak?” he inquired,
perceiving that her face was turned to-
wards him
“ Yes—no—that is—no, Sir, I —l didn’t
speak,” stammered Milly, adding, as Clare
rose hastily from her seat, “Is anything
the matter, dear ?”
“ Yes, I feel sick. I must go on deck,”
and Clare, who was a very bad sailor,
hurried away, leaving the toast on her
plate untouched.
“ Dear, dear!” murmured the man who
“ eat so little,” pausing in the act of con-
veying the oyster on his fork to his mouth,
“ Dear, dear, the young lady hasn’t
touched a morsel —not a morsel. Less
appetite than I. Poor thing, poor young
thing!”
Milly, saying something to the effect
that Clare would want her, left her seat
and followed her sister with unusual
celerity.
She found Clare, whom the air had
revived, walking the deck.
She smiled as her eyes met Milly’s.
“ Milly, I sadly fear that poor fellow
will die of starvation.”
“ I entertain the same apprehensions,”
Milly responded, as she linked her arm
through her sister’s. ‘ ‘ Surely to good-
ness he won’t eat as much at breakfast and
dinner!”
But he did. To every meal on hoard he
regularly went down, and as surely as his
plate, heavily laden, was placed before
him, so surely did he dispose of its con-
tents and deplore his want of appetite, and
lament that he “ eat so little !”
At the last meal on hoard at which they
had an opportunity of witnessing his per-
formances with a knife and fork he es-
pecially distinguished himself by the
quantity and variety of the edibles he con-
sumed. He was not, however (apparently,
at least), ungrateful for the good things so
liberally supplied to him, for he was heard
to mutter, as he rose from the table,
“ Thank God for those few mouthfuls!
many persons would have made a hearty
meal. But, alas, I have such a poor
appetite and ‘eat so little ’! ”
TOWN GOSSIP.
As we have all along pointed out,
the dignified conduct of Russia, tinged
as it has been so largely with modera-
tion in the hour of triumph, has con-
tributed more to the present happy
prospects of peace, than the blustering
conservatism of the British Cabinet.
Both Turkophile and Russophile ad-
mit that the Beaconsfield policy has
been as weak as it has been blatant.
Even London papers of strong anti-
Russian views admit this. One oT
them, while explaining the present
status of the Powers to be as follows :
Russia, plunder ; Turkey, under :
Austro-Hungary, asunder; adds that
of Britain as blunder to the remain-
der’s wonder. Of what use will the
Sepoys be among the Balkan snows,
on the Crimean steppes, or the Polish
plains ? What effect can the calling
out of the reserves have, when all
Europe knows that England, on her
own showing, cannot set one corps
d’armee in the field, with its full
quota of horses and war material ?
The Horse Guards people evidently
*• funk ” the thought of war; yet know-
ing all this, Beaconsfield, with a
fatuity which the happy periods of his
graceful oratory cannot veil, would
precipitate the Empire into a war, in
the Emile Ollivier fashion, forgetful
that the time to boast is on putting off
one's armour.
* * *
The old adage, “ Let not the cobbler
go beyond his last,” received increased
significance from the sentence passed,
on Wednesday last, upon an errant
shoemaker, who was charged at the
Water Police Court —first with being
on enclosed land, and, secondly, for
giving a false name aud address. It
appeared that he had a cage in his
hand, aud it was evident that there
must have been a trap following him,
since he was taken flagrante deiicto .
The land upon which the trespass
was committed belonged to Mr. Walter
Bradley, and the cage, it was surmised,
was intended for the capture of birds


imported from England by that gen-
tleman. For the two offences the poor
shoemaker, who pleaded guilty, had
to pay fines ana professional costs,
amounting altogether to £8 11s. Bd.,
the punishment being thus appor-
tioned —for carrying a cage on the
wrong side |of a fence, £5, with 4s.
lOd. costs, and £1 Is. professional
costs ; and for giving a wrong account
of himself, £l, with 4s. lOd. costs,
and one guinea ditto professional. We
hope this severe sentence will act as a
warning to shoemakers generally, and
that when ever they indulge an unlaw-
ful penchant for imported birds they
will not cage upon other people’s pro-
perty, but put a little salt in their
pockets, for what says the poet ?
Observe yon plumed biped fine,
To effect his captivation
Deposit particles saline
Upon his termination.
Moral to birdcatchers—“ Don’t tres-
pass ; [a clause in the act may bring
you under the beak.”

Affairs at Stamboul are in great
confusion. The old distich possibly
defines the position with tolerable
accuracy :
Conturbabantur Constantinopolitani
Innumerabilibus sollicitudinibus.
Four good “ jawbreakers.”
* * *
We note that “tip-cat” is in. When
a civic dignitary has had an eye or so
knocked out, the police will perchance
interfere.
* *
*
News for heads of departments. It
does not look well to see the office
messenger closing the envelopes of
letters on his way to the post. Sonm
lettters are confidential, you know, and
even trustworthy old fogies, as the
majority of messengers are, should
not be exposed to temptation. We
should not write these words but for
having witnessed an unedifying spec-
tacle on Wednesday last in the outer
corridor of the G P.O.
* *
For the honour of the State we
regret that the bill to relieve Dr. Beer
of his disabilities fell through. Peoples,
like individuals, have occasionally to
make the amende , and when it has to
be done (as in this case it will yet
have to be done) it should be done
without reservation. Dr. Bowker was
the occasion of its being lost.
* * *
Talking of Dr. Bowker, the lines of
Prior will come to our recollection:—
“ I sent for Bowker; was so ill
That other doctors gave me over;
He felt my pulse, prescribed his pill,
And I was likely to recover.
But when he sought Jlacquarie-street,
And dinned away as politician,
Cured yesterday of my disease,
I died last night of my physician.”
* *
*
We trust that the movement on foot
to pay a tribute to the worth of the
late Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, will be
carried to a successful and sensible re-
sult, and that the appreciation which
is universally .expressed of his unas-
suming efforts to promote the welfare
of the community in which he lived,
will take some lasting form more suit-
able than the empty pageantry of a
public funeral.

Our canvasser complains bitterly of
the apathy exhibited by advertisers
to the attractions of “ Once-a-Week ”
as a medium for announcements to the
public. He says, that becoming quite
tired of the monotonous and stereo-
typed reply, “Thank you, we’re full
up,” received from each advertiser
upon whom he called, he went last
week to two large Chinese mercantile
houses at the bottom of George-street,
and waited upon the principals,
hoping, if not to obtain an advertise-
ment, at least to find some variety in
the Celestial mode of refusal. Imagine
his surprise when they both promptly
replied, “No tank you, fullee up,
fullee up.”

Railway official: “ Passengers, please

sham, Ashfield, Croydon, Burwood,

Passenger: “When does the train

We have received from Messrs.
Knight and Co., the publishers, a
serio-comic illustrated map, purport-
ing to be emblematic of the attitude of
the various nations interested directly
or indirectly in the Russo-Turkish
war. Russia is represented as a
gigantic octopus, having Turkey and
Poland in the grasp of its powerful
feelers, one of which is stretched forth
in the direction of the route to India.
The map also shows the attitude taken
up by various advertisers, whose an-
nouncements form the border. We
should have had more pleasure in
noticing this production, if the pub-
lishers had assumed a similar attitude
towards us, and reserved a space for
the attractions of “Once-a-Week.”
The design is grotesque, and cleverly
carried out by the printers, Messrs.
Hampson and Gibson.
ECONOMICAL COOKERY.
(From the Middle C/ass Cookery Book.)
HOW TO COOK FISH.
Salt Fish. —Generally when in season
this fish is bought and eaten the same
day, and is only soaked in water a few
hours before boiling, the consequence
is that it is generally tough. Now if
you eat salt cod to enjoy it, you must
first of all observe if the flesh is white,
and not of a yellowish appearance, for
if ic is it must eat stringy and _ harsh,
therefore soak it in water, placing the
skin uppermost, for at least twenty-
four hours, but if not very salt less
time will do ; then divide it in two or
three pieces, boil it on a slow fire, put-
ting ii in cold water ; when it begins
to simmer, draw it off the fire, leaving
it on the hob for half an hour, and
serve it with capers, or a good butter
sauce made as follows :—To a quarter
of a pound of fresh butter, put half a
teaspoonful of salt, a quarter ditto of
white pepper, dessert-spoonful of
chopped parsley, the juice of a small
lemon, with a teaspoonful of flour,
beat the whole together, and use the
whole or half, which you now put into
a stewpan. When hot and melted
pour it over the fish, or serve it in a
sauceboat, and plain boiled potatoes.
Flounders, Plaice, Soles, and
Bream. —These fish are generally
fried, and after being scaled and
well washed, must be rubbed dry with
a cloth, then pass the knife along the
back-bone, flour them, and fry in very
hot fat on a clear fire, recollecting
that slow cooking makes them eat
flabby and greasy. They should be
served in a cloth, and if a sauce is
desired, use caper or anchovy, or oil;
vinegar, salt, and pepper, mixed on
your plate, which also makes eat very
nice hot or cold.
Whitings. —After they have been
drawn, washed, and rubbed dry, leav-
ing the liver in, give them three or
four cuts on either side, roll them in
flour, and fry them on a sharp fire,
and for a change serve them up with
either caper or anchovy sauce, or dress

Phil Macaulus. — We regret that we can-

however, need not interfere with your
kind intentions.
Several contributions under con-
sideration.
