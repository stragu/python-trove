PERSONAL.
The circumstance of Sydney “ Once-
a-Week” having successfully entered
upon the commencementof the second
quarter of its existence will, doubt-
less, be held to justify us in making
a few remarks of a directly personal
character.
Encouraged by a support un-
expectedly liberal, we have made
arrangements for enlarging the scope
of Once-a-Week. As will probably
have been noticed, we appear in this
number in a new and more appropriate
garb. This step has been taken in
compliance with the suggestions of
several subscribers—one of whom,
referring to the first unattractive and
almanac-like look of this serial, flat-
teringly remarked, “ Until you read
Once-a-Week, you don’t know how
good it is.” With the desire to appeal
to the eye as well as to the intellect,


we took the hint, altered our dress,
and, as we would fain hope, materially
improved our appearance. The design
on the cover represents our little bark
fairly launched upon the waters, with
sail full set to catch the propitious
breeze that shall waft it surely to the
desired haven—the object of our hopes
—the goodwill and kindly favour of
the people of Australia.
We would next mention that in
future numbers we intend to provide
space (if found requisite) for an
“open column,” in which questions of
social, political, and general interest
may be discussed temperately and
good-humouredly; and also, that in
order to make Once-a-Week tho-
roughly domestic in tone, we propose
to publish regularly, for the especial
behoof of mater familias , practical
cooking receipts of approved cha-
racter.
We cordially invite our younger
friends to help us to make the riddle
and enigma columns quite original.
Charades, conundrums, etc., happily
composed on local subjects, will always
be welcome.
The attention of business men is
called to the considerably reduced
scale of advertising charges, as well
as to the fact that Sydney Once-a-
Week is a medium peculiarly well
suited for bringing “ new lines” under
the heads of families.
While on our side we pledge our-
selves to the unremitting task of
endeavouring to amuse and entertain
the public taste to the best of our
ability with a judicious mixture, in
fair proportion, of “reason with
pleasure and wisdom with mirth,’'
we would ask in return for confidence
and support, the latter (though para-
doxically as it may sound to say so) of
a punctually remitting kind.
Before concluding these remarks,
we would respectfully solicit the
subscribers already on our list to
recommend Oace-a-Week to the
notice of their friends, as a magazine
honestly deserving of support on these
grounds: that—
1. It is Australian.
2. It is of good report.
3. It is original.
4. It is cheap.
A PILL FOR THE PILGRIMS.
When grand old Dry den lashed the race
By whom his fine free blows were felt,
He looked his foemen in the face,
Nor ever hit below the belt.
With all his faults, he never made
An unoffending spirit ache :
Impostors only were afraid,
And titled fools with brains opaque.
He, armed with a surpassing wit,
With humour, passion, scholarship,
Knew whom to spare and whom to hit.
And hewed the latter, “thigh and hip.”
But you —you skulk behind a gate,
With feeble arrows tipped with pins,
And ventilate your little hate—
The Lord forgive you for your sins!
The Lord forgive you for the trash
You palm on the unlettered mope!
The rancid, old, Byronic hash —
The musty dregs and lees of Pope!
You know your weakness — that you do;
And, hence, you find your only chance
Is with the blear-eyed tap-room crew,
Who cannot see for ignorance!
These grinning idiots think you gods!
And, if you mumbled Double-Dutch
Instead of school-boy’s French, the clods
Would stilt believe in you as such.
Who envies you ? —indeed, not I,
N or any man who has a spark
Of that fine British honesty—
That hates a dagger in tbe dark!
Your only strength is in abuse —
A fickle strength, like that of fire;
And all the weapons that you use
Are patent with the brand of liar.


If you were noble, and equipped
With gifts authentic, you would spare
The weeping woman who has “ tripped”
And has no home-love anywhere!
You would not turn aside to hurt
The hearts and hopes of helpless men;
Nor grovel in the back-street dirt
For reeking topics for your pen.
But, as you are, you are a blot
To men of letters—and a shame!
I tell you this who fears you not,
And dare to sign in full my name.
HENRY KENDALL.
CATCHING A FLATHEAD
I enjoy a day’s fishing as much as
anyone when the fish bite, which on
most occasions they obstinately refuse
to do; and even when they don’t, a
few hours in an open boat with a nice
breeze blowing does me a world of
good. But lam only an amateur, and
know very little of the gentle art; and
so when I indulge in this recreation I
generally contrive to get some ex-
perienced sportsman to accompany me.
I did not know Growler personally,
but his fame as a fisherman had
reached me. I was continually hear-
ing stories of his [skill and prowess.
It was he who started the Nimrod
Club, and published those admirable
hints on the subject of deep sea fish-
ing which appeared some time ago in
the Daily Thunderer. He knows every
reef and good fishing ground in our
beautiful harbor, and at what turn of
the tide they should be fished. He is
also great on the subject of bait suit-
able for different kinds of fish, and
different seasons of the year.
4< If you want to ensure a good
day’s sport,” said a friend to me, “get
old Growler to go with you ; he’ll put
you on to a good ground, and you will
be sure of a haul.” Acting on this
hint I obtained an introduction, and
succeeded in prevailing upon that dis-
tinguished individual to form one of
the party, on the understanding that
there were only to be three of us, two
to pull the boat and one to steer.
“If you go in for sport you can’t
have a boat load of fellows,” said the
great man. So I merely asked Jones,
my neighbour, to make up the trio.
Jones is a man of rather a studious
turn and no fisherman, but a very
pleasant companion.
Growler has not attained the undis-
puted right to the title of a crack
fisherman without some corresponding
advantages. No one who asks him to
join a fishing party ever expects him
to contribute anything beyond his ex-
perience. The value of this com-
modity was soon apparent to Jones
and myself in the minute instructions
he gave us on the subject of bait and
other necessaries. He was good enough
to tell us the sort of boat we were to
get and where to hire it, and the exact
hour at which we were to start to save
the tide. He also added in an affec-
tionate manner some confidential re-
marks on the subject of luncheon, and
especially with regard to the nature
and extent of the drinkables.
It was eight o’clock in the morning
to a minute when Jones and I arrived
at the Circular Quay, in a cab laden
with the stores which we had procured
under orders from the chief of the ex-
pedition. These consisted of a cold
round of beef, a chicken pie, materials
for a salad, two loaves of bread, a
tart, and some cheese, half-a-dozen
pale ale, tsvo bottles * * * brandy,
two Royal Blend whisky, and one doz.
bottles soda water, besides cigars.
I mention the bill of fare in detail
as a hint to other sportsmen who may
be glad to know the scale of provisions
which, in the opinion of such an emi-
nent authority, should be provided by
three persons for a day’s fishing.
Unfortunately Jones drinks nothing
but tonic water, but this peculiarity
was overlooked or unheeded by our
chief, when the things were ordered.
We had not been more than three-
quarters of an hour at the wharf, and
had got the stores safely on board the
“ Marianne,” together with a basket,
which was carefully placed by itself,
in which was an assortment of bait on
a similar scale, to wit:—2 quarts of
prawns, 1 crayfish, 1 large squid, 24
yellow tail, 6 mullet, 6 mackerel, 2


lbs. stiff paste, and 3 red herrings,
when Growler appeared, with a small
bag containing his tackle, and with an
air of easy familiarity took his seat in
the stern of the boat.
“ I’ll steer,” said he.
This appeared so reasonable that
Jones and I at once took the oars,
leaving it to the man who knew every
inch of the bay to guide us to the fish-
ing ground.
Our start had been arranged with
much forethought to suite the tide,
which was running in as hard as it
could. It struck me that it would
have been better if it had been ar-
ranged to suit us, as it would have
been far pleasanter to drift with the tide
than to undergo the two hours’ severe
exertion with the oars which followed,
but I dared not express my thoughts
in language. It did also occur to me
that Growler’s steering was of a very
eccentric nature, and that, as we had
both wind and tide to contend against,
it would have been wiser to keep in
shore as much as possible, instead of
taking a serpentine course in the very
centre of the stream, but I said no-
thing, and watched Jones anxiously as
the perspiration streamed down his
face.
Our leader having purposely, or
accidentally run us aground near
Bradley’s Head, we took the opportu-
nity of recruiting exhausted nature,
in which process our commander ex-
hibited so much interest that it was
fully half an hour before we started
again.
During the remainder of the voyage
we were entertained by inspiriting
accounts of the various capital days
which Growler had enjoyed at the dif-
ferent feeding grounds we passed. At
one place he had, singlehanded, caught
seven dozen bream and a dozen flat-
head, none of which weighed less than
5 lbs. At another he had hauled in a
schnapper which topped the scale at
22 lbs., besides whiting and mackerel
by the score. We got quite excited
at the prospect before us, and pulled
away for another hour. }
“Now, boys,” said Growler, “ we’ve
got to get the lighthouse in a line
with that rock. Easy now, and when
I give you the word over with the kel-
lick, and I’ll promise you a first-rate
day’s sport.”
After a good deal of manoeuvring
we contrived to get the “ Marianne ”
in the required position, and Jones,
who was stationed in the bow, by
great exertion managed to lift and
cast into the sea an enormous piece of
sandstone which served as an anchor,
and then sank down exhausted with
the eflecG.
The first step taken by Growler was
to uncork a bottle of brandy and take
a regular norwester by way of luck.
He then ordered the basket of bait to
be set in the centre of the boat, and
prepared to commence operations.
First he unwound from an oblong-
shaped piece of wood about the size of
an ordinary knifeboard, what appeared
to be a clothes line on a small scale,
about 50 yards long, and having at the
end of it a lump of lead as big as a
hen’s egg, to which was attached a
hook strong enough to hold a shark.
To this he fastened a bait sufficient to
last any ordinary fish for a week.
That, he informed us confidentially,
was for flathead. Then standing up
in the boat he whirled the formidable
object round and round his head at
the imminent risking of braining me,
and suddenly letting go, skilfully de-
posited it in the water about 40 yards
off; the end he securely fastened to
the boat. Next he produced a second
and smaller line, attached to which
was an elaborate assortment of hooks,
which he baited with four different
kinds of bait, and prepared to dis-
charge in like manner. In this he
would undoubtedly have been equally
successful if he had taken the precau-
tion of laying aside the long Ulster
coat which he wore, for one of the
four hooks caught in the folds of this
garment, and had to be cut out with
a penknife; this took about twenty
minutes. Then he rose again, and at
the next throw the line settled
on the surface of the water in one
large complicated tangle. But not a


muscle of his face moved, and drawing
in the line and refreshing himself with
a nip, he set to work calmly to disen-
tangle it. For five and thirty minutes
by my watch ho was engaged in this
laborious occupation, during which
time Jones and I caught two small,
but apparently very hungry red
bream.
The sarcastic smile which appeared
in Growler’s face as these diminutive
specimens of the finny tribe were taken
from their natural element, was refresh-
ing to witness. It seemed to say
“ Wait a bit, and I’ll show you the sort
of fish to catch.”
His second attempt was not a
failure, though it appeared to me as
the line touched the water that the
four hooks had somehow got mixed up
into one lump, but this was not observed
by Growler, who was now fully prepared
for business. There was not a trace of
levity in the calm and determined eye
which he kept riveted on his lines, now
feeling one and now the other,
ready to take advantage of any un-
guarded movement on the part of the
fish.
An hour passed in solemn silence
without any result. At least fifteen
times did this accomplished fisherman
haul in and examine his bait, coiling
his lines in the bottom of the boat with
a dexterity and ’precision only acquired
by long practice, and still no fish
rewarded his efforts.
We felt concerned for him. As for
myself and friend, we were but muffs
and were prepared to stand any amount
of chaffing if we came home with empty
baskets; but Growler’s reputation was
at stake, and it would never do for
Jones and me to have a monopoly of
the sport.
He was getting morose, too. The
generous liquor which he imbibed so
freely appeared to sour instead of
sweeten his temper, and he began to
justify his name. Now he growled at
Jones, because that guileless indivi-
dual, ignorant of piscine tastes, had
purchased the shrimps already cooked
nstead of raw; then he swore that the
yellowtail were at least a week old, and
that it was no use trying to catch any-
thing with such stuff. The fish ap-
peared to enjoy it, nevertheless, for
every time he pulled in his line there
was at least half a pound gone. Then
he tried herring paste, for which he
had not a single applicant for the space
of an hour and a half—during which
period I caught three whiting and two
bream, fishing with a fine silk twist
and a contemptible little hook attached
to it by means of a piece of gut—a line
which Growler would have disdained
to handle.
As for Jones, he had brought a novel
with him in which he was deeply in-
terested. He made a point, however,
of pulling up his line at the end of
every chapter; and if he only captured
three little bream up to chapter 17, he
had no one but himself to blame.
Suddenly our attention was arrested
by a gratifying metamorphosis in the
appearance of Growler. He was no
longer the moody savage looking indi-
vidual of the previous five minutes.
His countenance had suddenly become
animated, and his eye was lit up
with a positive glare of triumph;
kneeling down in the stern of the
boat, he was hauling in hand-over-
hand his big flathead line. There
was evidently something on it, which
Growler was slowly and gradually
bringing to the surface. Jones and I
looked on in breathless admiration.
The monster fish was within a few
feet of the surface ; we were all
three leaning over the side until the
boat was in imminent danger of cap-
sizing. Jones and I, ready to assist in
the capture or to witness the death
flurry, when up it came suddenly
to us, and securely hooked, a slimy
rotten branch of a tree.
For the next five minutes I was
busily engaged in restoring Jones to
animation. He had fallen on his back
across the thwarts in a fit of uncon-
trollable laughter, which threatened to
choke him.
By untying his cravat, opening his
shirt front, raising his head, and pat-
ting him on the back, I at last suc-
ceded, but every time he cast his eye


upon the leader of the expedition, who
sat in the stern, with a pensive sub-
dued smile in his face, in a fit of ab-
straction, he went off again.
By way of producing a diversion, I
proposed luncheon, and by dint of
urging, pleading, and perspiring, I
got my two companions into a more
sensible frame of mind, and we had a
tolerably pleasant meal.
Growler recovered himself to a cer-
tain extent, and even went so far as to
predict good sport as soon as the tide
turned. He even got quite jolly under
the cheering influence of the luncheon,
the pale ale and the brandy blending
with the whisky, that is to say as jolly
as his nature would allow him to be,
and volunteered a fishing song, which
he had himself composed. He then
set to work to repair his lines, and to
make up for lost time.
The tide turned, as tides have the
knack of doing at regular intervals,
but Growler’s luck never turned or
wavered.
About this time I noticed that he
did not rise to his feet to make the
magnificent casts with which he com-
menced his sport; the fact dawned
upon me that he could no longer keep
his balance in that position. His be-
haviour in other respect s too began to
be eccentric. Happening to look round
I saw him reclining against the side
with his head touching the water. I
thought he was watching the bait at
the bottom, but I changed my mind
when I noticed his hat floating away
with the stream some thirty yards
ahead of the boat.
I roused him up by suggesting that
a little brandy and soda wouldn’t be a
bad thing. His reply was “ Brarry
shoda whishky shoda all shametmee.”
He then took the composing draught
which I prepared for him, laid down
placid and bareheaded on the boards,
and was soon in a deep slumber.
By this untoward accident I was
forced into a responsibility which I
never The command of
the expedition devolved upon me;
thenceforth I was captain by promo-
tion vice Growler, drunk and incapable.
I immediately appointed Jones my
first lieutenant.
Our first step was to haul in and
wind up our own lines, which did no t
take very long. Our brains had not
been confused by the rays of the sun,
and we had no tangles to unravel.
Jones was rewarded for his patience
in not having looked at his hook for
five whole chapters by finding it se-
curely fastened to an extraordinary-
looking fish with wings like a butter-
fly, which barked like a dog, and
which we subsequently ascertained to
be a flying gurnet.
In a fit of generous enthusiasm he
immediately made up his mind to send
it to the Sydney Museum, but on my
informing him that there was an ob-
jection to open that institution on Sun-
days, he declared his intention to have
it embalmed and forwarded to his aunt
in Devonshire as a curious specimen of
Australian natural history. Jones had
expectations from his aunt, and hoped
by means of a sprat to catch a
mackerel.
Stepping over Growler’s prostrate
form, we took a line each and hauled
away. There was no difficulty with
the big line; it was too thick to get
entangled, and had been of no possible
use except to convey large joints of
mullet into a spot within convenient
reach of shoals of hungry bream at
intervals of a quarter of an hour. But
it was not such an easy matter to dis-
pose of the other, which seemed to
have a peculiar facility to get knotted
and looped from one end to the other.
Imitating the example of the illustrious
fisherman lying beside me, I pulled
away quickly and coiled it in as regular
circles as I could, and bringing the
hook out of the water with a jerk
I landed, to my great suprise—yes,
actually landed —a veritable flathead;
not a very large one, be may have
weighed 1 lb., but sufficiently large
to save Growler’s reputation and to
keep up the character of the fishing-
ground as being a first-rate place for
flathead.
The next thing we hauled up was
the kellick, after which we pulled,


still against the tide, but with less
exertion than before owing to the ab-
sence of a bad steerer and the presence
of 200 lb. of deadweight in the bottom
of the boat as ballast, back to the
Circular Quay.
The last thing we hauled up was the
insensible body of our Commander in-
Chief.
He had not been particularly appre-
ciative of the attentions we had shown
him, nor were we indebted to him for
anything out of the way in the shape
of sport; but we determined to be
generous, and to reward evil with
good.
We therefore called a hansom and
lifted him into it. We next stuffed all
the fish we had caught, as well as all
the bait left, which he had complained
of as being so stale, into the pockets
of his Ulster coat. We used the flat-
head line to bind him hard and fast,
hand and foot, until he was bodily as
well as mentally in as complete state
of entanglement as any fishing line
could be under the most adverse cir-
cumstances. Then wrapoing the flat-
head in the smaller line, which was so
thoroughly and irretrievably tangled
that it resembled a piece of seaweed,
we hung it round his neck, gave the
driver his address, put a couple of
empty bottles into the cab, and sent
him home adorned with the trophies
of the day’s sport.
I have not seen Growler since, but
I hear he often talks of the capital
day’s fishing he gave us.
“We did not take many,” he says,
when he refers to the occasion,
“ one fine flathead and a number of
email fish, but the fellows who were
out with me were not used to fishing,
and the bait was stale. But I have
taken some splendid fish on that
ground.”

HEART RELICS.
[An Easter-tide Reflection.]
A withered rosebud, a faded glove,
An auburn ringlet (still often kissed):
Are relics treasured by earthly love,
As more precious than pearl or
amethyst.
One waft of perfume recalls a smile,
Perhaps false, yet once ’twas a bigot’s
creed;
Ah ! why should we let a lie beguile,
Or lean for our rest on a broken reed F
The fires of passion a moment bum,
And then the ashes grow cold and grey ;
And who but a fool of fools would turn
To be cheered by a warmth that had
died away ?
* * * * *
Fond dreamers, gaze on these relics stained
With the crimson blood of a sweet heart
true—
Here’s a crown of thorns whose smart
obtained
The crown of eternal life for you!
Here are nails that pierced dear hands
which plead
In clasped entreaty for you and me !
Here beads of anguish which intercede—
And a bondman’s Cross which has made
all free!
And here the relic, sooth to say,
A rock-hewn tomb ! 0 empty prison ;
Yon mighty stone removed away,
Tells of a Saviour-God uprisen !

THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 12.
The observations which we made in
our issue of the 2nd of March, with
the replies to the inquiries made by
Mr. Terry, in his place in Parlia-
ment, which we then suggested, and
with the information afforded by
Mr. Alderman Oatley, have, doubt-
less, had some weight with the
thinkers upon sanitary subjects ;
how many are these thinkers, how-
ever ? Dare we hope that one out
of ten of those to whom, whether in
legislative, executive, or municipal
institutions, the government and
oversight of the wellbeing of our
fair, but foul, city belong, has be-
stowed a thought upon the points
which naturally arise to any unpre-
judiced (nose, we were going to
say) mind ?
And so there are at least forty-three
thousand calves and lambs illegally,
surreptitiously, done to death an-
nually in our city, of which the
butchers say (and they ought to
know, if neither the Inspector of
Cattle. ;nor the Inspector of Nui-
sances, nor the Mayor, nor the Al-
dermen, nor the City Solicitor, nor
the gentlemen, we beg pardon,
esquires, who attend the bench on
butchers’ cases, know) “ that the
dread of discovery induces them, to se-
crete the offal instead of carrying it
away!” and so “the murder is
out!” What wonder that we are
a stinking city, with the offal of
forty-three thousand calves and
lambs annually secreted on but-
chers’ premises instead of being car-
ried away!
The jubilant reception of the re-
mark of the bold butcher, at the
butchers’ meeting, that he not only
slaughtered in the city, but that he
intended to continue the practice,
suggests to thoughtful minds the
consideration of the necessity of
legislative provision for excluding
persons of this profession, nuisance
makers, in fact, from municipal and
magisterial chairs, a seclusion
which would afford them more time
to attend to their own business, of
which, we cannot help thinking the
removal of their offal to be an im-
portant part.
We think so much of the probable
effect of this illicit slaughtering and
hiding of offal in the city, upon the
health of the inhabitants, that we
are content to ascribe a very large
portion of our increased mortality
to this cause.
Not insensible of the other teach-
ings of Mr. Oatley’s return, which,
however, we must leave,. for the
present, to other hands; it is our
business, to-day, to deal with the
effect of the wholesale slaughtering
upon the drainage of the city.
Blood, it is known,, very quickly co-
agulates, and has a peculiar ten-
dency to choke drains; no doubt,
as much of the offal, including
blood,, as can be pushed down the
drains, is thus disposed of, and in
times of drought lies, nearer, or
farther from home, in the various
house drains of the butchers, de-
composing and emitting pestilent
odours, not only upon the persons
living in the vicinity, but upon the
successive victims of the knife,
whose bodies are prepared for those
customers who insist on having
veal and lamb (and pork—Mr.
Oatley said nothing about the
swine, “not a word about the
pig!”) All this meat must absorb,
therefore, the poisonous gases
emitted by the “secreted offal,
and, in a corresponding degree,
must be rendered unfit for human


food, unless, perhaps, the saving of
the fees on slaughtering has a pro-
tective tendency upon the meat.
How much money will be saved on
forty-three thousand head privately
slaughtered? Faugh! what assur-
ance but the butchers’ have we that
the meat or the live animal would
have passed the acute eye of Mr.
Oatley, had it been presented to him
for inspection ?
We see no remedy for these
things but in placing all inspection
in the hands of a distinct authority,
who, removed from all petty per-
sonal influences, should see that the
powers entrusted to municipal and
other local authorities are properly
exercised—and in the future that
some improvement in the character

to expect the executive officer of a
body comprising many eminent

cuting nuisances which butchers, in
solemn conclave assembled, ap-
plaud to the echo—and we have
breathed the wish, dare we utter it?
that our executive would be a leetle
more particular in decorating with
the magic letters J. P.!—or if, in
the present state of politics, faugh !
that particularity may be impos-
sible, then let us have certain per-
sons named “of the QUORUM,”
and let at least two-thirds of every
Bench requiring more than one
Justice, be composed of Justices of
the Quorum, and let such be chosen
from classes remote from nuisance-
makers, and superior to the infl-
uences inseparable from the parti-
alities acquired by those who, in a
sense, are “ born in the purple.”

THE JOURNAL OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL
EXPEDITION.
BY A LADY.
(concluded).
Wednesday, 2nd January, 9 a.m.
Did not awake till half-past six this
morning ; drizzly and cold, and we
were lazy and unwilling to leave our
comfortable bed of leaves, bark, and
blankets for quite an hour afterwards;
then we started for our bathe through
mist and rain and wet grass, finding
our bathing dresses soaking with dew
and rain ; the water was colder than
ever. We had a swim up and down
the hole, which was quite enough, and
we came back in a splendid glow.
After breakfast, more baking. (It is
wonderfully improving to one’s appe-
tite to live in this wild way, and while
we are enjoying this cool air and cold
water, I suppose the larger number
of our friends are suffering from ex-
treme heat) ; after which some of us
went again to the waterfall and took
some sketches. Whilst lam writing,
the “ children ” (for so they style them-
selves) are washing up the breakfast
things in the fryingpan ; the young
lady in a gentleman’s velvet smoking
cap looks very picturesque ; it is quite
evident from existing appearances that
she has not been in the habit ef in-
dulging in such a useful occupation;
the fryingpan has also to act as a
baking-dish, so has become rather
black; our bathing dresses, towels,
and blankets are all hung round the
fire. Freddy and Albert 101 lon the
grass beside the fire all day, except
now and then when they go to the
river and have a smoke ; they will not
move after dark without a torch.
Sometimes we want a pole cut to rig
a wet blanket on, and then Freddy
gathers himself up for the undertaking.
At about one o’clock we started for
the Cedar Brush, riding in our
dresses, with waterproofs pinned over
them—it being about half-a- mile from
the camp, and we rode through five
miles ot it, along a narrow track,
which winds through the most lovely
foliage and timber of enormous size,


tree ferns, nettle trees, and gigantic
arum plants (the blossoms of which
perfume the air), with nearly every
variety of fern, grow in profusion be-
neath the large bush trees, the
stems of which are all clothed with
moss, creeping ferns, staghorn para-
sites and bird-nest ferns. We wound
along the path in single file, the horses
slipping and sliding down the numer-
ous gullies, and our hands were m con-
stant requisition keeping obstinate
brambles that hung across the path,
from our faces. When ahout half-way
through we heard the sound of a water-
fall, & and dismounted —leaving our
horses in the path.
Forcing our way through the thicket,
we soon came upon the fall the hig -
est yet seen—and quite as lovely, it
not more so, than any.
I sketched it roughly ; we explored
a little, found some lovely ferns ; then
mounting our horses rode on till we
came to the river once more ; on the
bank opposite was a saw-pit, evidently
unused for many years, c r ee P m g
and moss flourishing upon the decay-
ing timber that was built up over it.
Fern trees, like soft green stars,
showed out against the dark shadows
of the brush foliage which grew thickly
on the river’s brink, and branched over
it, and the various sizeo stones that
checked the rapid current caused it to
whirl and eddy round each one until
the quietest part of the stream was
white with froth.
Below what had evidently been a
crossing for timber sledges another
waterfall foamed away, but it was not
so picturesque as the others we had
seen. ,
After spending about an hour col-
lecting ferns (new to us), we parted
on our homeward way. I thmKwe
must be near the coast, judging from
Sie Plants, which I have never seen
inlan? I wish we could go on and on
till we come to the sea.
The sportsmen caught us up on the
brush : they have met no success, n
having even seen a Wonga, though
we heard one far away.
On the way back the gum trees
struck us more than before; they are
so gigantic, and stand out from the
dark undergrowth like huge white
pillars for quite one hundred feet
before they branch out; when we
raised our eyes and saw, high against
the sky, masses of soft green fern
fronds drooping from their brown
baskets of staghorn parasites, and
enormous vines like magnified snakes
twisting round, over, and ‘among the
branches, we could help exclaim-
ing, il How beautiful! ”
Arrived at camp at about 5 o clock,
one young lady proved very attractive
to the leeches ; she found three on her
foot, but no one else suffered. The
weather is so heavy and threatening I
fear the table land is an unattainable
land for us. It would endanger the
lives of our horses. Before tea was
quite finished a misty rain came on,
and when washing up was accom-
plished it was heavy enough to drive
us into the tents; after ours was tidied
up and the lamp lighted we invited
the gentlemen to spend the evening,
and entertained them with songs, in
the choruses of which they sometimes
ioined. Before 10 o’clock we were so
evidently sleepy that they bade us
good night, and retired to their domi-
cile to rest. The rain* came on faster
and thicker; we were absolutely airaid
to take off our clothes, so slept m
them, the only dry part of the tent
being where our bodies reposed; heads
and feet were in jeopardy.
Thursday, 3rd.
Woke this morning to the sad fact
that everything in the tent was more
or less wet, our heads and feet being
decidedly damp, and waterproofs,
boots, &c., quite wet. Could not face
the heavy rain and wet grass, so a s-
pensed with our usual bathe, and had
water brought to us in a “billy can,
dressed in much discomfort, and had
breakfast brought to us by the gentle-
men, sardines, damper, and potted
ham being the sum total,md of c<ourse
some cold water ; even the black bo>s
failed to light a fire. Went to see the
river, which is rising fa it, crystal no


longer, and rushing through its stones
a yellow flood.
Horses collected, saddled, packs put
on, and a start effected by nine o’clock.
Rain still pouring down. The horses
trembled so when we first mounted
them that we went for a “ preliminary
walk” while packing was concluded:
got over the dividing range wonder-
fully, though it was so slippery; nearly
all dismounted at the steepest place,
but it was not necessary; arrived at
Stuggens’ (Sherwood) at about ten
minutes to twelve a.m., and were re-
freshed with a glass of hot brandy and
water.
The horses were put in the buggy
and we rode on, letting the driver have
the buggy to himself. We were ob-
liged to ride fast to get before the
river, which was rising rapidly, as
well as to keep warm, and galloped
helter-skelter through the mud, mixed
up with the packhorses, frightful
creatures ! when bearing down upon
us with tin pots, etc., protruding!
One of the buggy horses knocked up
when a few miles from home, but one
of the pack horses, that had never
before been in harness, took his place
very well and cantered the remaining
distance. Arrived at C between
three and four o’clock, very wet and
covered with mud, heads, hands, and
feet, as well as faces and habits, being
covered with it, but wonderfully little
tired, after having been in wet saddles
for seven hours. My old room looks
like a palace, and so says everybody.
Notwithstanding, we all thoroughly
enjoyed the trip, and feel all the better
for roughing it a little ; our only re-
gret is that we did not reach the
Table Land.

Twelve thousand furlongs, 7,920,000

We will now suppose the world

Fancies of Fact.
LOST: A PAIR OF BREECHES.
BY "FUSILIER."
I had scarcely finished reading aloud
to a party of youngsters Barham’s
ridiculous story, “The Spectre of
lappington,” wherein it is related how
Lieutenant Charles Seaforth lost his
breeches one by one or pair by pair,
and how it was subsequently discovered
that he had buried them in the garden
during fits of sonnambulism, when I
was met with the cry
“Is it all true, uncle ?”
“True to nature,” said I.
“It’s absurd and improbable, and I
w °? der you read such stuff to the
children,” said Aunt Triphena.
“ It may be absurd, but its impro-
babfiity 1 contest. If you’ll all listen
III tell you how I once lost mv
breech ” J
“ John ! said Aunt Triphena, re-
provingly.
“My breeches," continued I, un-
daunted, “ and how I had to walk a
less’’’ 8 JOurne y absolutely trouser-
“0 what for!" chorussed the male
section of the party.


t( Fire away, uncle,” said Tom, “tell
us all about it! Fancy his losing bis
breeches ! My eye, what a spree!
Aunt Triphena left the room, and
would have taken off her nieces with
her, only relying upon my support they
rebelled.
Well, children (quoth I), once
upon a time I was stationed in New
Zealand. It’s a good many years ago ;
when Gore Brown (on whose staff I
held an appointment) was Governor.
I had got leave of absence for three
months, and was 4 doing ’ a sketching
tour round the Northern Island.
One fine summer’s morning I left
Taranaki, where I had spent a very
jolly week with the detachment of the
65th, and started for Wanganui, which
I was anxious to make on the evening
of the third day. In those days there
was no road between the two places,
no bridges or punts over the rivers,
no inns. There was an accommodation
house of the roughest kind on the
banks of the Patea, where, for a con-
sideration, an old Scotch couple and
their daughter dispensed a wild kind
of hospitality to the few and. infre-
quent wayfarers who were their sole
customers.
My kit was small. In the shape ot
clothes I had only what I stood upright
in—laced up boots, knitted socks, Bed-
ford cord trousers, üblack cloth waist-
coat, English built shooting jacket,
Crimean shirt, and felt wideawake.
In a small Maori basket I carried some
fig tobacco, a colour box, a sketching
block, and a towel. I also had a re-
volver and a small field telescope.
Nothing else in the way of impedi-
menta. ,
The first night I stopped at a pah,
where an old chief named Aparahma
entertained me royally. In the morn-
ing he put me on the track, and would
not accept so much as a pipeful of
tobacco. I had thirty-seven miles to
do to make the accommodation house
on the Patea think it was the Patea,
but I won’t be positive); or, if I
didn’t care to make such a push, there
was a pah on the Waimate, where
Aparahma told me I was sure of a
hearty welcome.
About a couple of hours before sun-
down I made the mouth of the
Waimate. On the opposite bank stood
the pah. I cooed,” but received no
answer. I could see no one about.
There was nothing to do but to swim
the deep sullen stream, the waters of
which were cold and blask. X got
across all right, re-dressed myself,
and clambered up to the pah. There
was lots of food about, boiled fish,
dried mtissles, rancid and fishy pork,
maize in the cob, fresh peaches, but
not a Maori to be seen. I had a
“ feed,” left a fig of tobacco before the
hearth, in compensation for what I had
taken, and strolled off along the beach,
intending to make the Patea if possible
before the moon had gone down.
I had forgotten to ask on which side
of the Patea the accommodation house
was situated. All I knew for certain
was that it was near the mouth of that
river, and that there was a punt there.
When the sun went down I calculated
I had about four more miles to do.
I made a halt until the moon rose
(which it did about seven o’clock) and
then I moved on again along the hard
white sand. Presently I noticed a tall
post, just above high-water-mark. On
a little board nailed t' it, I could man-
age to read “To the accommodation
house.” Looking about, I saw that a
track, turning inwards from the coast,
ran to my left, through the flax and
sand-hills. I followed it. Ten minu-
tes’ walking brought me to a sheet ol
water, beyond which I could see a
light gleaming, not over bright, irom
a window. Whether the cottage was
on my side of the stream or the other
I couldn’t tell. There was just enough
licrht to distinguish reeds growing in
the water, so, hoping it was only a
lagoon, I prepared to wade through it
towards the light. I • cooed first of
all, and got a signal m answer. A
door was opened and a lantern waved,
but whether warning me not to at-
tempt the water or beckoning me
on across it, I could not tell. I pushed
on resolutely, feeling my way with a
grass-stick ; and, at last, very wet and


very tired, found myself on the edge
of the river bank, and at the door of a
low wooden building.
The only occupants of this place were
an old Scotch woman and her daught-
er, a fine strapping lass of about seven-
teen. The master was away with his
little coasting sloop, and would not be
back for two or three days.
“ Could I have supper?” of course I
could. There was pork with potatoes
and bread, and there was some rum to
boot. So I made an excellent supper.
That despatched, my clothes being
wet, I asked to be shown where I
could sleep. The old woman put me
into the guest chamber, and after I
was in the blankets, insisted on taking
my things away to dry them by the
fire.
In the morning, as I wanted to make
an early start, I called for my clothes.
The old woman thereupon brought me
my socks, my waistcoat and coat —but
no breeches!
“ Where are my trousers ?” said I;
“ are they not dry ?”
She made no answer.
“ Where are my breeches, woman,”
cried I, thinking she had not heard
me.
Still no answer !
‘‘Woman !” oared I, “ mybreeks.”
Still no answer.
I couldn’t well leave my room to
look for them ; and there was no man
on the premises. What was to be
done ?
A few minutes elapsed, and then the
old woman came to the door, and said
that she couldn’t find the breeches
anywhere, that I must have got them.
“Did ye no fetch them in the
night ?” she said.
“ I did not,” said I angrily I never
left the room. For goodness sake
bring them ; they must be where you
hung them to-day.”
“But they ain’t.”
And they wem’t. I wrapped a
blanket round me, and searched. Not
a vestige of breeches was to be seen !
“Could they have been burnt?” I
demanded, as I seized the fire-shovel,
and began to rake in the embers.
She scouted the idea —but they had
been burnt for all that.
In the ashes I found the buttons
! and the buckle of the waist strap.
The woman vowed she was inno-
cent. The daughter protested she had
gone to bed before I did the night be-
fore, and that so far as she was con-
cerned she knew nothing whatever
about the matter.
Discussion was bootless—or rather,
trouserless.
There were the buttons, but a man
wants more than buttons, though, if
in quality, and of size sufficient, they
go a long way, now-a-days, towards
satisfying a woman !
What was to be done ! The woman
had no breeches of her husband’s
to loan. She had not even enough
stuff to make a pair of.
I belonged to a Scotch regiment
which, however, was not a kilted one.
I had often sneered at the garb of old
Gael, but it seems as though fate
meant that I was to don it for once. I
would have as soon gone to a concert
of bagpipe music !
The old woman offered me the choice
of a blanket or a petticoat, for a kilt.
The petticoat, I thought, would be too
flimsy, too much of the garb of old girl.
I accepted the blanket, fashioned
thereof an impromptu kilt, made a
hearty breakfast of pork, potatoes, and
rum, bade my hostess farewell, and
secured the services of her daughter to
row me across the Patea.
I had some thirty miles to walk
before I could reach civilization and
breeches.
In the cool morning I found the new
arrangement of dress pleasant enough;
and as I walked along the shore and
watched the crested rollers breaking in
long white lines of spray-crowned foam
upon the yellow sand, and the red-
legged cardinal birds, and the soaring
screaming gulls, I came to the con-
clusion that the garb of old Gael was
all that its admirers said it was.
But, towards noon, when the sun
waxed hot, I began to change my
opinion.
Towards mid-afternoon, when the


sandflies came around me by the mil- I
lion, I had definitely changed it.
In “Alice in Wonderland” you re-
member the carpenter who wept be-
cause of the altogether too muchness
of the sand upon the sea shore. I
know I could have wept on account of
the too muchness of those accursed
sandflies. They attacked my trouser-
less legs. The kilt was no protection
to me. It was to them. Wrapped
round me normally as a blanket, it
might have saved me; but to make
Wanganui-wards wrapped up in a
blanket was of course out of the
question.
The sandfly was master of the
situation. He evidently liked the
garb of old Gael,
With legs painfully bitten, with the
slaughter of tens of thousands of sand-
flies on my conscience, not to mention
the utterance of hundreds of thousands
of terrible oaths, I slowly moved on.
At last I made Wanganui, and in
the quarters and breeches of my good
and fat friend Wemyss, made myself
perfectly at home. How charming
little Mrs. Wemyss did laugh as I
entered tne house! What fun we had
about it! Alas ! the fun’s all over
now. Wemyss died as a soldier should
before Magdala, and his widow sur-
vived the fatal news but a few hours,
dying before her time. There—that’s
the story.
“ But, the breeches, uncle,” asked
master Tom, “didn’t you ever hear
how they got burned ? ”
Oddly enough, I did. Several years
afterwards, long after I had sold out,
I met a women in Australia who told
me she had once lived on the Patea.
It turned out she was the daughter of
the old couple who kept the accommo-
dation house. She had married a well-
to-do young sheep farmer, who it
seemed had been courting her at the
time I visited her mother’s house.
On the night I was there, unbeknown
to her mother, he had ridden over to
see her from a run some miles up the
Patea. She had made up the fire in
order to make him a billy of tea, and
in her hurry had not seen my Bedford
cords hanging on the pothook where
her mother had hung them to dry.
Boys! always see to the drying of your
own trousers when you have but one
pair. There’s the moral! eh, Tom ?
“ I knew there was a woman in it,”
said Tom, who being fourteen was a
bit of a misogynist; “and the moral
I get out of it is never trust one far-
ther than you can see her.”
The girls retorted that even that
was twipe the distance anyone ought
to trust a boy, and as usual had the
last word.
SPORTING ADVENTURES
IN AUSTRALIA.
BY CARLEY CORNSTALK.
( Continued).
Nothing is more calculated to steady
a man and to dissipate useless repinings
or moody fancies than a fixed resolve
in a certain direction. Now that Jem
Curtis had fully made up his mind to
take part in the steeplechase, and saw
before him a prospect of success, he
was a different man. His despon-
dency gave way to hope, and his
cheerfulness of heart came back to
him. Acting on Bob Simmons’ advice,
he was early and late in his attendance
on the Mountain Maid, with whom he
very soon got on excellent terms. But
once did they part company, when one
morning he mounted her barebacked.
The absence of her accustomed trap-
pings probably suggested to her an
opportunity of playing off her old
pranks, and with one clean buck she
landed her rider cleverly on the grass.
But this was the third day after his
first introduction to her, and since
then he had exercised her with great
regularity, and she had proved herself
to be an unmistakeably good timber
jumper, and though somewhat self-
willed and hard-mouthed, perfectly
free from vice.
It was understood that the entries
for the race were not to be declared
until the day before it came off, and
Bob had especially enjoined secrecy on
the subject of the mare. Thus no one
except the parties immediately inter-


ested were aware that Jem had ob-
tained a mount which would render
him a dangerous competitor.
The race, as was expected, had been
put off for a week, and in the mean-
time the days passed very pleasantly
in excursions on horseback, in laying
out the course, and in other prepara-
tions during the day, and in music and
dancing and flirting after tea, in which
latter amusement the three girls were
no mean proficients. Jem’s easy good
nature, and a certain boyish air which
was natural to him, made the young
ladies treat him to an amount of good-
humoured chaff and banter which
women rarely address to anyone for
whom they have not an instinctive
liking. Jem never objected to any
commission, however troublesome,
imposed upon him by his fair com-
panions ; and the charm which the
society of three sprightly, unaffected,
and amiable girls threw over him made
him happier than he had been for a
long time. It was well-known to the
two Miss Burtons in what direction
his aspirations tended, and that this tall
strapping fellow was “ spooney on
Georgie” was a subject of no end of
merriment. If Jem had been ten
times more bashful than he was, he
would have been compelled to let the
state of his feelings appear, so artfully
did these young ladies draw him out.
Georgie was well aware of the con-
quest she had made, although she
pretended to ignore it; but one morn-
ing a slight accident occurred which
brought these two young people nearer
to each other than they had yet been,
and revealed to Georgie Grant the fact
that she took a more tender interest in
our hero than she was herself aware
of. They were returning on horse-
back, Jem and the three girls, from a
short ride, the object of which had
been to inspect an artificial jump in
course of construction at the bend of
the course. A double trench had been
cut for about ten yards, and the dirt
from each trench thrown up into a
bank in the centre. Heavy sapling
rails resting on short forks increased
the height of the leap to about four
feet, which was the width of the ditch
on either side. The whole offered a
very pretty jump, but in Jem’s opinion
it was not high enough. He declared
he could clear it on the horse he was
riding.
“ You will find it quite high enough
Mr. Curtis,” said Fanny Burton, to
whom the leap appeared a very for-
midable obstacle; “ I did not know
your horse was such a highflyer.”
“ Are you going to ride Nebuchad-
nezzar in the steeplechase?” said
Georgie, who had given this nickname
to Jem’s horse the moment she set
eyes on him, “ Because I am afraid he
will never face such a jump as that ?
I’ll bet you a pair of gloves he’ll baulk
at it."
“ Of course, Jem, if you win you can
claim any forfeit you like. We’ll see
fair play, won’t we Lizzy ?’’ said Miss
B urton. “ Now girls, ride back a
little, Mr. James Curtis, mounted on
his celebrated hunter Nebuchadnezzar,
is about to take his far-famed flying
leap into the middle of next week. If
he fails to clear the jump he will be
adjudged to pay to Miss Georgiana
Grant, of Yarrawa, 1 doz. pair of
gloves, best Josephines, 61 size. On
the other hand, should he succeed in
covering himself with glory instead of
mud, and clearing the leap on his gal-
lant steed, he will be entitled, as he
doesn’t wear gloves, a fact, which I
may be permitted to add, is sufficiently
patent to the most casual observer, to
receive from the said Georgiana Grant
—a kiss, or one dozen kisses, if he
choose to take them.”
“Oh! Fanny, how can you talk such
nonsense.”
“And,” resumed the incorrigible
Fanny, “ we wish him well over it.”
The next minute Jem turned his
horse’s head, walked him about a
hundred yards back along the course,
then, wheeling round, shook him to-
gether, and crammed him at the jump.
The game old horse responded to the
call, and coming up with a rush made
his spring, struck the rail heavily
with his forelegs, and rolled over his
rider on the opposite side, then, re_


covering himself, scrambled to his
feet and stood quivering on the bank,
but without damage to life or limb.
But his rider lay motionless on the
bank, stunned by the shock.
The next moment Georgie was on
her knees beside him, in an agony of
fear and suspense. Women are apt,
in such cases, to rush to extremes,
and she thought he was killed.
“ Speak to me, Jem, dear Jem,”
she whispered, as she lifted his head
on to her lap and began untying his
cravat, while her two young compa-
nions were galloping off to the station
to get assistance.
Jem had only been momentarily
stunned, and was no more hurt than his
horse. So, hearing a low sweet voice
addressing him in such endearing
terms, he was quite content to lie still
for awhile.
“ Say it again,” said he.
“ Say what ?”
“ Dear Jem; and you might as well
pay me—you know what Fanny said.”
And Georgie, being a true-hearted
unaffected girl, and believing her lover
to be severely, if not dangerously hurt,
bent down her blushing face and im-
printed a kiss on his forehead. Then
did Jem raise himself from the ground
and, taking her in his arms, exact the
full payment of the forfeit, and for one
short moment Georgie laid her fair
head on his shoulder, and thus tacitly
admitted that she was won.
Then quickly recovering herself, she
sprang to her feet and began to upbraid
him in no measured terms :—“ You
ought to be ashamed of yourself, pre-
tending to be half killed, and then
taking advantage of me in that way.
I’ll never speak to you again.”
So saying, she mounted her pony
and galloped off to the station, closely
followed by Jem, who, if his bones were
a little sore, had the lightest heart of
anyone that day at Yarrawa.
“ Where have you been, child, and
what has happened ? ” said her aunt,
whom they met with the rest of the
party hurrying towards them.
“ Oh, it’s nothing worth mention-
ing,” said Georgie, with heightened
colour. “Mr. Curtis has been ‘play-
ing ’possum/ that’s all,” and away she
rushed to her room, leaving Curtis to
the condolence and tender enquiries of
the other Jadies, who petted him to
such an extent that he would willingly
have had a similar fall every day of his
life.
It is now time to make the reader
acquained with the other dramatis
personae, which we can best do by
publishigg a list of the entries read
out at the breakfast-table on the fol-
lowing morning by Miss Grant. They
were as follows:
Mr. A. M‘Lean’s b.g. Marquis (Owner)
blue cap and sleeves.
Mr. A. Ormiston’s c.g. Chevalier (Owner)
green cap and sleeves.
Mr. T. Burton’s bl.m. Proserpine (Owner)
green cap and sleeves.
Mr. R. Walker’s g.g. Moonlight (Owner)
orange cap and black sleeves.
Mr. T. Grant’s br.g. RoryO’More (Owner)
orange cap and black sleeves.
Mr. H. Grant’s g m. Mountain Maid (Curtis)
blue cap and sleeves.
The whole of that day was spent in
final preparations for the race. Flags
were put up to mark the course; gum
boughs were interlaced between the
rails of the fences, so as to allow as
little daylight to appear as possible ;
sundry objectionable stumps were re-
moved, and everything was done to
make the course clear for horse and
rider. A number of visitors from
adjoining stations arrived overnight,
secure of a hearty welcome and accom-
modation in the travellers’ room.
The sun rose on the morning of the
eventful day in a clear, unclouded sky,
and shone on the expectant faces of
about one hundred persons stationed
at various points along the course
where a good view of the jumps could
be obtained. All Australians, espe-
cially where cattle stations abound, are
essentially horsey, and what prettier
sight, can be shown than that of half
a dozen well mounted men displaying
their horsemanship in negotiating
some twenty spanking leaps in first-
rate style! The excitement was great,
and friendly bets were made by the


score on the issue of the race, M‘Lean’s
bay horse being the favourite, Moon-
light and Chevalier in about equal
estimation for second place. Tom
Grant on his clever little horse Rory
O’More, who was known to be a good
fencer, it was thought would make
a good third. Proserpine was not
thought much of; she was adjudged
too heavy for the work. As for the
Mountain Maid, her character as a
buckjumper was well known in the
district, and she was nowhere in the
betting.
“ Chance if that young fellow don't
break his neck," said an old fellow—
one of the new arrivals, as Jem can-
tered up to the starting point on the
grey mare, who had been turned out
by Bob Simmons in tip-top style, her
coat shining like a mirror.
“If he can only sit her," rejoined
another, I’ll back the M aid against
the lot of 'em.
Ah, that’s just it!
The Grand Stand was a hastily-
erected platform inside the garden
fence, immediately opposite the house.
The course, which was two miles in
length, comprised fourteen jumps, and
finished at the starting point. Mr.
Grant acted as starter and judge.
Bob Simmons’ advice to Jem was
this, “ Now, Mr. Curtis, if you can
only hold her so as she don’t bolt, and
keep her head between the flags,
there ain’t no fear of ye till you come
to the creek, and what you’ve got to
do then is to keep her well in hand
and let Mr. M'Lean or Mr. Walker,
or may be Mr. Ormiston’s chesnut,
for there won’t be none of the others
PP> give you a lead over it, for the
Maid don’t take kindly to water, and
that s the truth. She has plenty of
loot to bring you in three or four
lengths ahead on this side, for there’s
over six hundred yards to the winning
]x>st; I measured it this morning!
•but don t you take the lead over the
brook. Now mark you, repeated the
old man, there’s only two points I’m
afeard of. The mare ain’t vicious,
uV- 6 8 a mout h and an
obstinate temper, as you ought to
know by this time. She’ll bolt with
you at the bend of the course if she
can, and take you right across the
bush to M‘Mahon’s, if you don’t mind,
and she’ll do her level best to shirk
the water jump. But you’ve got a
strong pair of arms my lad, and I ain t
much alarmed for ye. Keep her head
straight, and don’t forget that Miss
Georgie ’ll be straining her eyes to see
how the Yarrawa mare carries her
colours.”

A GOSSIP WITH THE BOYS.
Football will soon be in again.
Would’nt it be a good idea if the
leading schools were to arrange for
the holding of a conference of dele-
gates to determine a reasonable code
of rules for football play? We say
“ reasonable ” because we must admit
to a belief that the Rugby system is
far too complicated. Play under its
regulations is dangerous to those en-
gaged in it, and by no means interest-
ing to those who are onlooking. Some
modification of the system is urgently
needed; but whatever is done in the
way of reform must be done with a
clear recognition of the principle that
a manly sport must be a healthy dis-
cipline every whit as much as a healthy
exercise. The “scrummage" developes
pluck, we may be told; well, so do a
hundred and one dangerous recrea-
tions we could name, but that is no
reason for introducing them. The
“scrummage" is unnecessarily dan-
gerous. A fellow in the thick of one
has no chance of exercising any judg-
ment.. Cricket in these fast bowling
days is dangerous, but by due use of
quickness of sight and heedful agility
safely is attainable. Now no amount
of skill or caution or activity will
avail a man in a scrummage ; nothing
will, indeed, except the barest chance!
For every player injured seriously at
cricket there are at least a hundred at
Rugby at football. ’Tis on that account
that a system of football play which
makes the “scrummage" an essen-
tial requires revision. The iie promt


juvenes which was addressed by the
old-world epigrammatist to Roman
youths, warning them from soft effem-
inate sports, may be repeated to-day
as a caution against the other extreme,
absurd foolh irdiness at football.
No. IS. of The Sydneian , the mag-
azine edited by members of the
Sydney Grammar School, is to hand.
It is most creditably brought out. We
learn from its pages that on the 29th
of march last school prsefects wer« first
appointed. “ Their duties,” we are
told, “ will be to stop any quarrelling
that may go on about the school, to
put down bad language, and to keep
up the moral tone of the school.” Mr.
Weigall deserves credit for introdu-
cing a practice which at Eton, Harrow,
Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, and
ocher great English schools, has always
worked successfully.
Oxford won the boat race this year:
“as usual,” says the Evening News .
The “as usual” is unfairly rough on
Cambridge, which, out of the thirty-
five contests since the first in 1829,
has won sixteen.
A young friend asks us what was the
greatest distance ever run in two hours.
Twenty miles was once made by one
George Hazael, at Lillie Bridge, Eng-
land, in two hours, on Dec. 10, 1877;
and we believe that is the longest trip
ever done in the time.
Another correspondent wants to know
on what principles double acrostics are
composed. First of all. think of two
words each composed of the same
number of letters. Then write a line
or so giving a clue (technically called
a “ light ”) to the words selected.
Next arrange them in acrostic fashion,
the letters of each word one under the
other, so that they may form the
initials and finals of a new set of
words. For instance, suppose you
have taken “ Plevna” and “ Defeat
for the two main words, —the lines
Russia, methinks, my first and last, of late
Together must, with grief, associate
will give you the needful clue to them.
Then arrange them acrostically, and
fill in between each initial and final
a sufficiency of letters to make other
words: thus—
1. P YRAMI D
2. L E A G U E
3. E L F
4. V i c E
5. N a u s e A
6. A m o v n T
You must next write a set of lines
descriptive of each word so obtained.
That done, your double acrostic is
made. It will now read after this
fashion:—
Russia, methinks, my first and last of late
Together must, with grief, associate.
i.
‘ Small by degrees and beautifully less.’
First see the point, and then the light
you’ll guess.
ii.
When it refers to emperors or miles,
’Tis strange it should be triple in both
styles.
HI.
A tricky being, that through darkness
roams —
Companion fit for goblins, sprites, and
gnomes.
IV.
’Tis but a substitute, yet it can nip,
And often causes man and horse to trip.
v.
This strange sensation surely has the trick
Of making every one who feels it sick.
VI.
I am the whole, and, as you’ll see of course,
A little mountain, and a borrowed horse.
This acrostic is from the World.
Others for solution will be found in
another column.
TERRIBLE ENCOUNTER.
CAUTION TO PEOPLE LIVING
ALONG TEE LINE.
BY "RUS."
Late one beautiful autumn evening of
this current year, I was seated in my
study at my cottage near the line,
with an old college friend whom I had
not seen before for many years. The
young moon shone horizontally through
the dark shade of the eucalypti: the
hum of insects was hushed, a gentle
and balmy air was wafted through the


doors opening on to the verandah, and
altogether the scene and the occasion
predisposed us to reflection.
As is usual at such meetings, after
long parting, we reverted to the days
of our youth,—
“The days when our hearts were volcanic,
Like the scoriae rivers that roll;
The rivers that roll t adown Yaneck,
In the ultimate realms of the Pole,
In the realms of the Boieal Pole.”
We rehearsed old adventures, and
as many as we could remember of the
comical scenes and occurrences with
which college life in our time was re-
plete. We remarked with a smile on
the discussions of our youth on fate,
free will, predestination, and other in-
comprehensibles, and laughed at some
of the conclusions at which our early
wisdom had arrived. Inadvertently
we fell into similar discussion, forget-
ting that time should have taught us
better. We discussed election and
reprobation, original sin, justification
by faith, and free grace. We reviewed
the most prominent religious systems
which have prevailed in the world, and
the endless variety of creeds and
superstitions by which Christendom
is vexed.
Our conversation was under no con-
trol, but wandered from one thing to
another as chance directed. From re-
ligious systems we passed on to politi-
cal systems. We examined and com-
pared despotism, monarchy, and de-
mocracy ; we fell upon universal suf-
frage, the rights of man, vote by
ballot, and free selection. From free
selection we glided into species, and
the descent of man. We passed under
review the various stories current at
different times as to the origin of the
world. The serpent in Genesis next
came before us, with a hot dispute as
to its identity with the Satan of the
New Testament. The next thing was
the Jewish Sabbath and its supposed
connection with the Lord’s Hay, or
Christian Sunday. We disposed of
this question summarily, and then
sank up to our knees in theology gene-
rally.
We dragged along through Pearson
on the Creed, Paley’s Evidences, and
Hoskins’ Ecclesiastical Polity. The
night was now far advanced, the moon
had gone down, the breeze had died
away, every leaf slept silently. Not a
sound disturbed the drowsy midnight
air but tbe faint and far off rumb ing
of some distant train. In traversing
this dreary wilderness of theology,
dullness overwhelmed our faculties,
and we fell fast asleep in our easy
chairs.
After an interval, the length of
which I do not know, our slumbers were
rudely broken by two men of formid-
able appearance and in strange attire
bursting through the open door with
wild and hostile looks and gestures.
My friend, who is as brave as a
lion, grappled at once with the tallest
and most dangerons looking, but how
he fared I was too much occupied to
observe.
The other was a short and thick-set
man, but with long arms like those of
a giant. His hair was coarse and
black, and his beard short and harsh.
He seized both my arms with a vice-
like grip and drew me forwards. His
wolfish eyes rolled about, seeming to
emit a brilliant but brutal kind of
light. His features were contorted
with rage, a horrible gurgling sound
issuedfrom his mouth, and he gnashed
his long projecting teeth, which were
evidently directed at my open throat.
With the strength and courage of
despair I endeavoured to keep him at
bay, and after a fearful struggle
for a few minutes he seemed to give
way. His hold relaxed a little, his
eyes drooped, and for an instant I
thought that I was saved. But sud-
denly with a bound, he roused himself
with redoubled strength from his mo-
mentary rest, and grasped me with a
fiercer grip. His teeth were now
within an inch of my throat, I could
feel his beard rasping my face, and
his fetid breath turned me faint.
All at once it flashed across me that
his garb was that of a lunatic from
the Asylum at Parramatta, and at the
same instant he uttered a terrific yell
which roused the echoes on many a
distant hill. His teeth were closing in


my flesh, my eyes were growing dim,
the blood was curdling in my veins,
I feit that my hour was come, but
made one frantic struggle to escape.
When I awoke I became aware that
the supposed maniacal yell was the in-
describable whistling, screeching,
fiendish howl of the American locomo-
tive, as it passes nightly along the
line.
Presently my friend awoke with a
yawn, and observing my troubled
looks, remarked that I must have had
a fit, and asked me how I liked it;
but being too sleepy to wait for an
answer, he took up a candle, said
“ Good night, old boy,” and went
to bed.
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMANS FERRY ROAD.
Chapter YIII. —( Continued.)
“Ah! I see you’re an early riser,
Mr. Caldecott, and don’t want calling.
That’s right! I hate to see young fel-
lows sleepy-headed of a morning.
Daylight’s no time for skulking in bed,
at least to my fancy,” said Mr. Walton,
as towel in hand, he walked to where
he saw George looking out from his
bedroom window.
“ Good morning,” says George,
“ and what a morning ! I’ll be out in
a minute. Is Mr. Hay coming ? ”
“ 0 yes, he’ll come. Hay never
misses, winter or summer. Ah ! there
he is ! ”
And the three men walked down
through the incense-breathing garden
to the murmuring brook which, “chat-
tering over stony ways in little sharps
and trebles,” bubbled over some
hundred yards below the house into a
quiet shady pool, out of which it again
eddied, to bubble once more on the
pebbles. What a glorious place for a
bogie it was ! The cold deep water;
the soft green sward; the grateful
shade.
After his bathe Mr. Hay walked over
to the woolshed, leaving Mr. Walton
to escort his young guest home. They
lingered in the garden as they went
towards the house.
“ I think yon said your father is
dead ? ” remarked the old gentleman.
“ Yes, he was killed at Sobraon.”
‘ 1 And your mother ? ” asked Mr.
Walton, glancing at George with a
yearning look of great tenderness,
which the latter noticed with a feeling
of surprise.
“ She is alive and was very well
when I last heard of her. She is the
sister of Mr. Powys, of Mitta Mitta.”
•‘So I have heard,” said Walton,
rather coldly. Then suddenly chang-
ing his manner, “and does she like
the idea of her only child being a
digger in Australia ? ” he asked.
“ Not very much I imagine,” re-
plied George, “ but then she was in
as great anxiety when I was away in
the Crimea or in India, and a fellow,
you know, can’t be always at his
mother’s bid and call.”
“ Pr’aps not; but don’t you think
she would side with Mr. Hay and my
little girl, and hold that though the
hazard of a soldier’s life maj be the
more, the honour which as it were
enwraps it, at least in imagination,
fully compensates for the extra risk ?
There are noble women still in the
world who would rather their sons lay
dead at their feet with wounds all in
front, than know of them leading
faineant worthless lives. Are there not,
think you? But breakfast must be
nearly ready, I hear Lucy singing to
I her birds.”
At one end of the verandah fronting
| the garden Miss Walton kept her pets,
some six or seven canaries, who in-
habited a charming aviary in which
they found provided for them bright
foliage, crystal water, and gravelly
floor. As her father and his guest
walked slowly up the garden path
towards her, she daintily finished her
task—the feeding of her feathered
favourites, and with the refrain of
“Over the Sea, over the Sea” still
upon her lips, ran forward to meet
and greet them.
“You’ve been dawdling, papa,” she
cried, “ I didn’t leave to get my bogie
till after you went down to the river


for yours, and see ! I’m back and
already dressed for breakfast.”
She looked fresh and fair as Hebe,
glowing, as she was, with young life,
health, and happiness. Walton saw
the impassioned glance with which
Caldecott beheld her, and he smiled.
Her answering blush he also noticed.
Did the old man know that the love
which lasts for ever is many a time
born of such chance glimpses, such
sudden surprises, and that fate is
cruel and as often minded to mar it as
to crown it, that he sighed ?
“ We’ll be ready for breakfast in
ten minutes, my dear,” were the-
matter of fact words which followed
his sigh.
And the two gentlemen went off to
their respective rooms to complete
their toilets.
Breakfast at Uralmindry was an
earnest detail of the day’s business.
On to Mr. Walton’s original English
notions on the subject of that meal,
his old friend Hay had contrived to
graft a good many most practical
Scotch ones, an interference which
Mrs. Arnott had not only accepted
without a murmur, but entered into
with heart and soul. She prided her-
self on the breakfasts to which her
master’s guests were asked to set
down, and ransacked all the resources
of the department she administered,
in order to keep up the reputation of
the establishment on that particular
Caldecott, when he entered the din-
ing room, was agreeably surprised.
The scene that greeted his ken was
one of wonderful cosiness mingled
with perfect elegance. The former he
attributed to Mrs. Arnott, the latter to
Miss Walton, and he was right in a
measure, though it was not until later
he learned to whom it was that Lucy
was indebted for an art-training sin-
gularly comprehensive.
As the breakfast bell finished ring-
ing Mr. Hay entered the room with
the mail-bag in his hand. Its sole
contents were a wool-broker’s circular
addressed to Mr. Walton, a copy of
the Molesworth Express and a letter
for Mr. George Caldecott.
“ I wonder what the Express has to
say about the sticking-up,” said Mr.
Walton, as he opened out the local
paper. After reading a few lines, he
ejaculated,
“ Well, this beats everything I”
" What do you mean, papa ? ” asked
Lucy.
“ Why, they’ve given the whole of
the credit of the affair to Neal, the
inspector. His vigilance, his pluck,
is all that is spoken of. He was
wounded in his first brush with them
so severely that he was unable to
follow up the bushrangers and save
the escort. Why, the man’s arm was
barely grazed! ”
“ And that was done by his riding
against a sapling in his terror,” added
George, intensely amused.
“It is just an ordinary)lying bul-
letin,” said Mr. Hay. “Neal wrote it
all himself, you may depend: and don’t
they say a word about our friend here ?”
“ Just a few lines, in which the chief
point seems to be not that he rescued
the mail and the coach passengers,
but that he is the nephew of Mr.
Thomas Powys, P.M., etcetera, et-
cetera.”
So much for fame as purveyed by the
local paper, in a garbled statement of
facts as they did not occur. “ Thrice
happy he whose name has been well
spelt in the despatch,” writes Byron;
he might have added, an he had lived
in the era of penny dreadfuls and our
own correspondents, ter quarterque
beatus is he whose deserving actions
have been writ down and printed as
they happened.
“ The scoundrel knows very well no
one will care to contradict him, and so
the lie will circulate to his honour and
glory/’ growled Mr. Hay.
Caldecott laughed at this ebullition
of the fiery old Scotchmau, and then
said, “You’ve heard of Harvey Nolan,
of course : the man they made such a
fuss about over the Sedan affair ? ”
Hay nodded an affirmative.
“ Well,” continued Caldecott, “the
j oke of the thing is that he got the


kudos for doing what poor Blundell of
the Buffs in reality did; and the mis-
take made him—got him the Victoria
Cross, his brevet majority, exchanged
for substantive rank at the first chance,
his staff appointment, and I believe his
wife into the bargain. Neal evidently
believes in the vires acquiret eumdo
power of a happy misrepresentation.”
“Of an infernal lie! I beg your
aardon, Lucy, my love, but I can’t
iielp it. It makes me mad to think of
it. And what of Blundell ?”
“ O, he got an exchange of another
kind soon after. He was killed at the
hiking of Sebastopol.”
“ The race is not to the swift,” said
Mr. Walton, sententiously.
When breakfast was over, George
Caldecott opened his letter, and found
to his immense surprise that it was
from Be Vismes. It was a very short
communication, stating that he was
stopping in the district with the Mus-
graves and expressing a hope, very
emphatically expressed, that should
they by any chance come across one
another they might meet, if not as
friends, at least not as sworn foes.
I owe you amends,” ran the conclud-
ing paragraph of the note, “ and some-
thing more substantial into the bargain
—part of which I may be able to let
you have shortly. With regard to
Coralie, I hope that in your calmer
moments you remember I had known
her long before you ever met her, and
that if she had not gone off with me
she would with some one else, not
that she didn’t like you, but that it is
her nature to be faithless. Musgrave,
of course you remember i Liinjuieeski,’
desires to be remembered to you.”
The very remembrance of Coralie
now that his heart had gone out to
Lucy Walton was as gall and worm-
wood to George. For what Be Vismes
had done to him in that quarter he was
content to let bygones be bygones.
He could never be friendly with the
man, but that was no reason why he
should pursue a senseless vendetta.
He determined to answer the letter in
a forgiving tone.
As the two elders had business to
transact at the woolshed and on the
run, Mr. Walton said to George—
“ Now, make yourself at home. I
shall be away until luncheon. You
will find books and writing materials
in the drawing-room. If you don’t
feel inclined for a stroll or a ride,
Lucy will, I dare say, do her best to
entertain you. I should recommend
perfect quiet until your arjn is com-
pletely right again, as in hot weather
one is never sure of that kind of wound
until the cure is absolutely effected.
If, however, you would prefer a ride,
say so, and I’ll look you up a quiet
horse.”
Of course Caldecott preferred the
drawing-room, and the chance, nay,
the certainty of entertainment by Miss
Lucy Walton.
And a certainty it proved, for within
half an hour after he had finished his
letter to De Vismes, that young lady,
who had concluded her housekeeping
labours for the day, came, looking very
charming in light muslin, on the hos-
pitable care intent of making her father’s
guest at home at Uralmindry.

ECONOMICAL COOKERY.
(From the Middle Class Cookery Book.)
BILLS OF FARE.
There are two distinct ways of pro-
viding for a family ; firstly, that which
concerns the every day fare, and se-
condly, that which incurs a little more
expense in the proper reception of
friends; and it is with the notion of
giving an idea of what is necessary in
both cases that we append a daily bill
of fare for two weeks; and therein
state the extras requisite, as to make
our friends enjoy our board. It does
not always depend on the quantity, or
the variety of dishes, to enable a good
housewife to show her skill; but it
really consists of the choice made of
provisions, and, more important still,
in their being properly cooked.
Should a cook be employed to pro-
vide for the family, the mistress ought


not to show ignorance in herself mak-
ing a selection of what is required for
the dinner; and were she to go to
market to purchase these items, ano-
ther point would be gained, for instead
of having to pay something like
twenty-five per cent, more to those
tradesmen who have to send for orders,
she is unfettered, and with the money
in her hand, the option is gained of
going to the best and cheapest quarter,
and obtaining the requisite commodi-
ties, after a careful examination of their
exact worth.
In conclusion, we strongly advocate
the presence at table of a good plate
of soup; we trust that no dinner will
be given without it; so for a family of
six, consisting of the parents and three
or four children, we offer the follow-
ing bills of fare :
Sunday. —As this day is set apart
generally for a better meal than nsual,
we will commence our dinner by a
puree of turnips with rice (supposed to
be made from the broth of Saturday).
A piece of roasting beef, of about eight
pounds, with horseradish sauce, or
plain. Two vegetables, potatoes and
French beans. A plum pudding, with
or without sweet sauce.
Monday. — Fish, either fried or
boiled, with plain potatoes. Roast
beef, either cold or broiled, with
mashed potatoes, and salad occording
to season. Plum pudding cold or
warmed up.
Tuesday. —Beef broth ; four pounds
of either the aitch bone, buttock, or
flank, and the beef bones of yesterday
put with either ; the soup made with
bread and vegetables. Eat with the
beef tomato sauce, chutney, or simply
mustard. A roast chicken with water-
cress, or stewed with cauliflower. Po-
tatoes, greens, or peas. A rice or bread
pudding.
Wednesday. —Vermicelli, rice, or Ita-
lian paste soup, made from Tuesday’s
broth. A roast shoulder of mutton,
puree. Potatoes plain, to mix with
the puree on your plate. The remains
of the beef of Tuesday made into a
salad with a little lettuce, watercress,
or the usual herbs. Asparagus or
brussels sprouts. Apple tart or pud-
ding.
Thursday. —Boiled leg of mutton
and caper sauce. Soup made of the
broth, adding the proper seasoning,
bread or rice, and a puree of turnips.
Mashed turnips and greens. A frnit
pie or pudding.
Friday . —Rice soup, or puree of car-
rots, with Thursday’s broth. Fish,
fried or boiled; and the usual sauces.
Hashed mutton wtth the remains of
yesterday’s leg. Plain potatoes. Salad.
Fruit pie or pudding.
Saturday. —A leg, hand, or any other
part of pickled pork, with vegetables,
as per recipe. Soup to be made with
the broth, with a little bread cut up
with the vegetables. Spinach, brocoli,
or cauliflower. Apple fritters, or rol-
lys preserved fruit pudding.
COLUMN FOR YOUNG READERS.
CHARADES.
ON AN EMINENT SCHOLAR.
’Twixt new bread and butter —with of
mustard a dash on—
An exquisite sandwich my second will
fashion;
And though if too salty ’twill stimulate
thirst,
No epicure ’d ever pronounce it my first.
My whole is a “ don” of most elegant
learning,
A scholar ad unguem, sound, brilliant, dis-
cerning,
Whose fame for pure Latin and elegant
Greek
Is in latitudes southern considered unique;
P’raps who is among Britons, as Vollgraff
once put it,
“ Peritissimum unum” and who will
rebut it ?
S.
ON THE SAME.
My first he said—the word implied
One half his breakfast spoiled;
My second then he quickly cried,
Three slices nicely broiled;
My whole in ire he next exclaimed,
Disgusted with my second ;
And then a learned doctor named,
A scholar justly reckoned.


I’m Latin and English, hoth one and the
other,
And the Latin for one-half is English for
t’ other.
My first' s a girl; my second'% a hoy ; and
my ivhole' s nothing.
A word of one syllable, easy and short,
Read backwards and forwards the same;
It expresses the sentiments warm from the
heart,
And to beauty lays principal claim.

And then they decompose it, which they I
are quite free to do.
But why of the twelve letters should they
cut off the first three, I
And leave the nine remaining ones as sad

For though they seem to make it less, in
fact they make it more ;
And let the hrute creation in, that were

Let’s try if we can’t mend it. I think
perhaps we may,
If only we divide the word in some un-
common way.
Suppose, instead of three and nine, we
make it four and eight:
You’ll say that makes no difference, or one
not very great.
But only see the consequence! that’s all
that need he done
To change the mass of misery to unmiti-
gated fun.
That clears off swords and pistols, all guns
and howie knives,
And every horrid instrument hy which
men lose their lives.
That calls up nature’s voice ; and oh, how
joyfully is heard
The hearty sound of merriment that greets
us in the word!
Yes, four and eight. May that, my friends,
he ever yours and mine,
Though human pride and passion may
prefer the three and nine.

There was an old man of Juandah,
Who smoked a pipe on his verandah;
But some boys got a cracker
And put in his tobaccer,
Which soon raised that old party’s dander.

Who objected to cheese ’cause it smells so:
She took kindly to prawns,
Which she eat shells and horns,
That voracious young lady of Kelso.

TOWN GOSSIP
The “Evening News” was notone whit
too severe in its criticism of the first (and
let us hope the last) number of The Sydney
University Magazine , a publication evi-
dently named on the lucus a non lucendo
principle. No one can with reason deny
that the severe dressing given by our
contemporary to Mr. Sheridan Moore was
thoroughly well deserved. That gentle-
man tries to pass himself off as a man of
profound scholarship, but it won’t do !
The specious brilliancy which results from
an unlimited use of “ jaw-breakers ” de-
ceives no one. His lucubrations
Begotten without thought, born without pains,
The ropy drivel of rheumatic brains,
illustrate with surprising effect
Truth sacrificed to letters, sense to sound,
False glare ; incongruous images combine,
And noise and nonsense clatter through the line.
His “ Suspiria Animae”(a series of son-
nets, written during visits to the Went-
worth Mounds, Tamworth—query, to the
“Wentworth Arms,” if there be such a
tavern) may be taken as an average sample
of the wretched trash submitted by the
editor of the “ University ” magazine ” to
the “manof letters,” the “ schoolmaster,”
the “artist,” and the “ artizan who com-
bines science with practice.” In these
sonnets he outrages the Queen’s English.
For instance, take a couple of cases:—
He uses “comprend” for comprehend,”
while he gives to the term “sophist” a
meaning never attached to it by the
scholar. To classify the sophist with the
bard and the seer is to forget that the
sophist is truly, as Jowett says, “ a
creation of Plato’s, in which the falsehood
of all mankind is reflected. He is the
master of the arts of illusion, the charla-
tan, the prince of esprits faux , the hire-
ling who is not a teacher.” In Mr.
Moore’s “ Carmen Feriale,” in which,
bye-the-bye, there is quite a superfluity
of showers of amaranth, of diamond
specks burning in the candent ether of
eternal spheres, of diaphanous floral
worlds, of moonlit lilies, of shadow forms
flitting over meads of asphodel, and of
similar rubbishy word-jargon, we are
told in the two concluding lines that
Est oevum sempitemum ! —Fathers pray;
Est oevum sempitemum ! —Mothers hope !
With all humility we ask, were “sit”
substituted for “ est ”in the above lines,
would not the prayer of the fathers
and the hope of the mothers be
more correctly expressed ? Of the other
contents of this miserable publication
(excepting Kendall’s verses and the first
instalment of a serial story, “ The Battle
of Life we can honestly say that they
are equally pretentious and equally weak.
Concerning “ The Battle of Life in Aus-
tralia, by J. Sheridan Moore,” it is enough
to say that it was not written by that
eminent litterateur, and that it has been
published once or twice before !
The “Sydney Magazine” (Nos. 1
and 2 of which are to hand) is, on several
accounts, deserving of praise; yet in one
article we regret to find its Editor making
a senseless mock at Christianity, telling
us that “the religion of Christ is as dead
as Pontius Pilate; ” and, again, that
“ Christianity is a mouldering corpse.”
This may be free thought, but free
thought very rudely and quite recklessly
expressed. This publication also goes in
for. Protection and the platform of the
Political Reform League.
One would thought that the “ Va-
gabond,” who knows everyone and every-
thing, would not have spoken of an Earl
Forrester, when in reality there is no such
personage. He must have been thinking
of his friend Lord Forester, who forgot to
tell him he is only a baron. By the bye,
a friend asks what line of Campbell’s is
strongly suggestive of the “ Vagabond’s”
style ? D’ye give it up ? Well, then, the
flow of I, sir, rolling rapidly !
The wardenship of St. Paul’s is vacant
by the resignation of the Rev. Mr. Scott.
Several candidates for the post are in the
field, but, as rumour hath it, family in-
terest has along ago settled to whom it is
to go, the competition will be but matter
of form. The University is generally so
unpopular that it doesn’t much matter
who holds the wardenship of its Anglican


College, yet, for all that, its £SOO a-year
should go to the best man.
We learn that Sir James Martin has
resigned his seat on the Senate of the Uni-
versity. The Ultra-Protestant majority
of that irresponsible body will,, possibly,
take the opportunity of proving their
loyalty to their convictions by electing
Pastor Allen to the vacancy.
Though war is on the cards, we still
think that peace will be preserved; and
should it be so, the credit will be as much due
to Russia’s moderation as to anything else.
It is certainly humiliating to hear of the
doings of the British Government, of. the
indifference paid by Europe to British
views, and of the loss of prestige brought
about by the vacillation and bounce of the
Beaconsfield Cabinet. As the last Fort-
nightly to hand puts it—“ The Czar seeks
the assent of Europe now to a settlement,
which commended itself to him long be-
fore the court party, or the military
party, or any other mysterious phantom of
our alarmists, could have been ‘ flushed
with victory,’ or ‘ intoxicated with the
insolence of success,’ or otherwise driven
out of the course of sound and justifiable
policy.” What Russia asks for is no more
than the due of her who alone among the
nations ventured upon the invidious, but
necessary a task of stamping out Ottoman
misrule in Europe.
We think Mr. Hurley has fairly made
out his case, and that no reasonable argu-
ment has yet been advanced against the
opening of the Museum and Library on
Sundays. Every visitor to Sydney must
be struck by the unusually large number
of young men of idle dissolute habits who
congregate at the corners of the streets, to
the annoyance of passers-by. What do
these young roughs do with themselves
on the Sabbath ? To listen to their lan-
guage is enough to convince anyone that
they never open a book, much less the
Bible, and that they are subject to no
softening or refining influence. How do
they spend the Sabbath, we repeat?
Surely it is worth while to endeavour, by
offering them opportunities of. harmless
recreation, to lead them to higher and
purer thoughts in connection with the
day of rest. Then again, why cannot the
public houses be closed absolutely. Is
there anything to prevent it? Are the
Government so weak that they dare not
rigidly enforce the observance of the rule,
because by so doing they would offend
some of their supporters. Out upon such
a puny administration! It is idle to talk
about Sunday desecration in connection
with museums and free libraries when the
back doors of public houses are left ajar,
and those whose business it is to watch
over the morals of the citizens are content
to wink at the scenes of intemperance
which they know are going on under
their noses.
The Russians are coming, oh dear, oh
dear! is now the cry. War alarmists
have at last something tangible on which
to hang their fears and surmises. A sus-
picious-looking stranger in the shape of a
man-of-war has been seen cruising about
in the vicinity of Bateman’s Bay, no
doubt on the look out for a landing place
on our defenceless coast. Of course she is
a Russian, and of course she is here on a
warlike mission. Here is a sensational
occurrence ; it beats the burglar epidemic
all to fits. The alarm is spreading fast.
On Tuesday evening last the Ashfield
band gave a performance at Croydon, and
the sound of the drum was immediately
connected with the Russian ship. We got
into conversation with a gentleman the
same evening, and he proved to us con-
clusively that this is just the sort of game
the Russians have been playing for years
and years. They care neither for treaties
nor torpedoes, only territory and train oil.
So we are in for it it seems, unless our
gallant artillerymen can give a good ac-
count of the enemy. The mountain is in
labour, and we wait anxiously to see what
it will bring forth, with an uneasy feeling
that the office of “ Once a Week ” is in
just the position to receive favours in the
form of shells or cannon balls.

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers “ a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature.— S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says: —lt is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. GiVos, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine. — Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once
Week Magazine for Town and Conntry
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
Sydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
the day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house, and an
agreeable .ompanion to every reader. —
Southern Argus (Goulburn).
“Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
pearance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
Barlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a magazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands a better
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are bom but to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says: —The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.” —Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may be per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend that
everything in the shape of “ news items
should be omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
—Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo, a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some-comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the ‘ ‘ Paradise Lost ’’—intended for the use
of University candidates —a clever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and s hinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hop the new
oTrgan will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors. —Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains we’l written papers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health ” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary o
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Svdney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and t ie publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney.— Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week. —This is the title of anew
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure;” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Etcetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterfield Star says:—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says:—We have
looked the book carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages. — Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation. — Border Post (Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgce).
The Bathurst Free Press says: —-It con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. — Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers. — Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week ” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
local. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches —we
note specially “'the Best Hog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,”—
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
Once a Week we can conscientiously re-
commend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone,
i hose who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse our opinion.— Cumberland Mercury.
The Sydney “Once a Week ’’—The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and general
get up are equr 1 to those tfthe first
number which v had occasion to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light leading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. Altogethei the number does credit
to editor and printer. — S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says : —“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written—the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “Best log in the Colony.”
We have every confidence in recommend-
ing “Once a Week” to the favorable
notice of our readers.”
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
just received the eighth number of “ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might he lost to the general
public, and also established a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week. —This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. Ihe most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches. —
8. M. Herald.
The Sydney “Once a Week." —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now he looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may he congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
Sydney “Once a Wefk. —The new
number of this capital little serial quite
sustains the character of its predecessors.
Charley Cornstalk’s “ Sporting Adven-
tures’’and the “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry” are continued. The Rev. A. W.
Petre commences a new story, entitled
“ Aunt Rebecca’s Secret,” which promises
to he good. There is another article on
the “ Public Health,” and a variety of
useful and amusing contributions make up
a very readable and pleasant number.—
Echo , April 12.
