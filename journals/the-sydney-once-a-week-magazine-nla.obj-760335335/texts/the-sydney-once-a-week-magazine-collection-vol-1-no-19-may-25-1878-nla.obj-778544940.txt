THE OKE-HORSED CITY.
WE shall feel obliged to our Subscribers by an
early intimation of any irregularity in the
delivery of weekly numbers, that it may at
once be rectified.
N.B.—Advertisements for “ SYDNEY ONCE A
WEEK ” will be received up to ten o’clock on
Thursday morning.
Yes! it is a tl one-horsed ” city!
There can be no mistake about it,
-despite its beautiful harbour, and the
fact that ingenious essay writers have
proclaimed it to be the Queen City of
the Australias !
But the Victorian, whether conser-
vative or Berryite, who has hugely
enjoyed his annual trip to Sydney,
his run out to Rand wick, and his
pleasant cruise in the beautiful har-
bour, almost always qualifies his
praise by a suggestive shrug and the


acid remark that the place is abomin-
ably one-horsed.” The Queens-
lander has just the same story to tell,
and so has the South Australian ;
while even the New Caledonian (on
whom the use of the expressive term
<£ one-horsed ” has not yet dawned,)
if pushed to speak out is forced to
admit that la belle Sydney is alike
without verve or elan. Even genuine
Cornstalks are fast coming to the
conclusion that the metropolis of New
South Wales may fairly be charact-
erised as “ one-horsed.” Those of
them who have travelled with their
eyes open, however loath they may
be to confess it, have already come
to that conclusion. We repeat,
therefore, Sydney is a “one-horsed”
City.
For such a distressing state of
things there must be a raison d'etre.
What that reason may be, we not
only intend to make diligent search
after, but we would also invite our
readers to bear us company during
the investigation.
Why in all political and social
matters does the average Sydneyite
display such a somnolent apathy ?
Why, when even if a reform (how-
ever slight) be initiated is it almost
invariably left to perish of inanition?
Why is the would-be promoter of
reforms or advocate of progress for
ever having cold water thrown upon
his schemes by the bland denizens of
Sleepy Hollow ?
Why is all this, thus ?
Because, 0 reader, of the existence
of an overgrown j ournalistic monopoly-
in the metropolis of the colony !
Sydney is the “one-horsed” city it
is, because the S. M. Herald is what
it is. What is the S. M. Herald t
you may ask.
A very respectable journal, we
answer. A splendid commercial suc-
oess. A magnificent circulating
medium. A paper eminently con-
servative, wonderously didactic, de-
corously dull. But no more a lead-
ing daily newspaper of the healthy,
liberal, thoughtful, progressive type,
than the Australian Churchman or
the Weekly Advocate.
A newspaper should be the detailed
record of daily contemporaneous his-
tory, supplemented by comments,
critical and exegetical. It should
deal trenchantly with the personal—
to the exclusion of the abstract, the
general, the abtruse. It should up-
hold the dignity of the Fourth Es-
tate by loyally accepting the respon-
sibilities that the epoch has cast upon
the Press.
Can any one conscientiously say
that the S. M. Herald is a journal of
this type ?
Do we not all feel that in grave
cases it is pusillanimous—cravenly
biding its time to see the way the
tide will turn —never in the van,
leading a great following by the
magic spell of thoughts that breathe
and words that crown ?
Do we not all feel, more or less y


offended at the ultra-purism with
which it complacently ignores many
a stern fact, urgently demanding ex-
posure and incisive treatment at the
editorial scalpel—at the ostrich-like
sagacity with which it accepts as in-
visible the things it does not choose
to see 1 ?
In brief, do we not all feel that the
conductors of the S. M. Herald are
ever aping the cat in the adage,
“ letting we dare not wait upon we
will ?”
Should these queries require an
answer in the affirmative, is it difficult
to understand how it is that a com-
munity (to the majority of whose
numbers the S. M. Herald is the sole
journalistic pabulum) has drifted into
that state of one-horsedness all
thinking men deplore.
No other city in the empire of the
same size and political and commer-
cial importance is in a like predica-
ment : but we do not hesitate to say
that were any other great centre of
population subjected to the same
treatment for the best part of a quar-
ter of a ceniury it would reach the
same degree of wretchedness.
The light of political life—of social
life—of all Life in fact must be struck
out in the clash of forces. Absence
of competition monopoly—means
stagnation, and stagnation is death.
In our next succeeding issues we
shall proceed to show—l. how to the
peculiarly circumstanced journalistic
action of the S. M. Herald may be
traced the “ one-horsedness ” of
Sydney. 11. How urgent is the need
for the establishment of a
daily paper. 111. How the import-
ance of a journal does not depend
upon its size, but on its power to lead.
IY. The practical means by which a
leading journal may be economically
established with fair hope of success
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY.
I really did not think —even had they
taken counsel together beforehand —that
our sapient legislators could have pro-
vided such a wretched week’s amusement
for us as that terminating on Tuesday
last. Counts-out were the order of the
nights, and there appeared to exist, on
all sides, an almost indescribable tone
and manner of weariness on both sides of
the House of Assembly.
Not a joke was heard, not an insult given,
As over the business they hurried.
1 asked one honorable legislator what
was the real cause of the count-out on
Tuesday night. “Oh!” said he, “it
was all of Jack Robertson’s getting up.
He knew that TV indeyer wanted to push
his Toll Bill Recision through, and was
determined to prevent him getting a
chance of bringing the motion forward,
and so got his men to stay away.” It
was a candid! y-given statement, at all
events, though, if true, not an over-
reputable transaction, for, despite all the
manoeuvres, the Toll discussion did come
a night or two afterwards, when Win-
deyer gained his end by a very narrow
majority.
However, I did hear a few little
amusing remarks made in the gallery
that evening good enough for report.
There was a Volunteer Warrior-Major
present, who, with a friend, dropped into
the gallery, fully anticipating some special
debate, and they had cozily settled down
in the off-corner, with a business paper
on the knee of each, ready for the sport.
They had barely time to give the cushion
reasonable warmth when the Speaker,
with an air and voice of evident gratifi-
cation, after the usual ‘ ‘ Ring the bell,
Sergeant,” adjourned the House for lack


of a quorum (or, as some hon. members
delight to honor it, a “korum”). The
virtuous indignation of the Major ex-
ploded with, “ Did you ever?” “ What
a most disgraceful scene ! ” emphasizing
the adjective con amove ; and my friends
abruptly left the chamber. I have been
puzzled since as to what went they out
for to see.
Mr. Dillon argued, of course, as un-
blushingly as he well could as to the new
line of extension on the Northern rail-
way being carried via Inverell, instead of
that proposed by the Government, but
John Sutherland’s statistics, carefully
piepared, were too much for him, and he
subsided into a minority.
Neither Messrs. Hoskins nor Terry
relished Farnell’s explanation as to his
intention regarding the upset Privilege
Bill. The former gentleman doesn’t by
any means approve of the demeanour of,
and the language made use of in, the
Lords touching their brothers in the
Commons. The rejection of the Bill was,
said he, “a deeply-laid design on the
part of the Upper House to bring this
(the Assembly) Chamber into disrepute.”
t Terry was full of wrath at the “ Govern-
ment allowing the work of the Assembly
to be thrown out by the Upper House !”
As if it were in either Fitzpatrick’s or
Farnell’s power to force willing obedience
in the matter, and compelling the Council
to pass a measure already hacked to pieces
before it was handed on for approval.
Mr. Hungerford, evidently a .practical
man, while defending the Bill, and argu-
ing its positive necessity, couldn’t see for
a moment why, though the Council did
not possess such a “rowdy” element as
was to be found next door, they should
prevent such “disgraceful scenes” being
enacted there, and wished to goodness
that John McElhone could be transferred
as a real live out-of-door “Honorable,”
so as to shew the well-mannered Coun-
cillors a specimen of ‘ life below stairs.”
It wasn’t a bad idea of Hungerford’sr,
after all said and done, but it’s no use
spoiling the utility of a “ necessary evil, ”
such as is my friend Mr. Mac., by exalt-
ing him to a sphere in which his undeni-
able talents would be hidden under a
bushel, before his time. Liveliness of
debate, such as is his, may yet well be
confined to his present location.
Mr. Fitzpatrick made, as he onlj T can,
the best of a bad job, and honestly con-
demned the Bill, mutilated as it had
been. He confessed that he did not
regret the fate of their bantling, and said
it was too bad to condemn himself and
mates for the action of the Upper House
regarding the measure. All in all, it
struck me slightly that “old Fitz.” (as
his admirers mill persist in terming the
out-spoken Secretary) came through the
fire with little scorching, and could, as he
did, throw a few drops of dirty water at
the heads of those who after forcing him
to bring forward a measure, cruelly cut
it all to pieces, and then grumbled at the
fruits of their own handiwork.
Sir John. Robertson simulated the
Laodiceans, and the usually irrepressible
member was neither hot nor cold. He
bullied the Ministry for what he termed
their defeat, and, indeed, had a well-
aimed parting shot at them ; while, as to
the language used in the Upper House
respecting their neighbours —well, all he
could say was he ‘ ‘ wished he could get
in among ’em for half-an-hour !” What
to do when there, or what description of
enjoyable satisfaction to be given them
or secured to himself, I leave the readers
of Once a Week to imagine. Doubtless,
plain-spoken John would “wake” the
Honorables up a little, at all events. He,
like McElhone, should let well alone.
We can’t spare him from down stairs yet
awhile.
Farnell ought to have “ soft-sawdered”
Terry a little more than he did on Fri-
day night. Mr. T. is not an unsuscep-
tible man by any means, and a little oil
goes a long way in smoothing his troubled
waters. McElhone could not help a
little chaff escaping on the occasion.
“ You've got your answer,” says he to
Terry, when Farnell had finished, and
I don’t think the latter liked it.
In conclusion, I think the Premier
would have made another friend or two
if he had candidly said, “Now, boys, I
meant to present you each with a copy of
my new Land Act, a New fencing Bill,
and another little brochure or two next
Tuesday, as you leave the Chamber.
You can take them home with you if
you like. I would have done it before,
but I knew you would pester my life out
about them, so I‘11 get quietly out of the
way for a month or two and take a little
quiet rest, so adieu,” instead of the few
curt sentences he uttered.
THE LOUNGER.


NORFOLK ISLAND.
BY VIATOR.
No. 4.
In my last contribution to Once a Week,
under this heading I mentioned the cir-
cumstances attending a successful at-
tempt to escape from captivity on the
part of the prisoners confined on the
island, in which they were aided by a
portion of the guard placed over them.
To-day I shall attempt the description
of another more amusing, yet equally
successful get-a-way by a few clever
men, who can hardly be blamed for
thankfully accepting the extraordinary
opportunity offered, and who in escaping
spilt no blood. Instead of a hailstorm
of bullets saluting their departure, and
dead bodies hampering their energies as
they straggled through the surf, three
hearty, heartfelt, ringing cheers awakened
the echoes of the little nook which last
saw them.
In my previous chapters I have men-
tioned that among other recreations, the
military officers were in the habit of
forming shooting parties, and as the
neighbouring island (Phillip) was well
stocked with such animals as rabbits,
pigs, and goats, running wild, a few days’
excellent sport could be obtained by a
trip “ over the water.” It was, of course,
necessary to obtain leave of absence from
the commanding officer—nr, very difficult
task—and the period usually applied for
did not exceed a couple of days—or, at
the most, three. It was necessary, also,
to make ample provision for the inner-
man comforts of Her Most Gracious Ma-
jesty’s servants, even when on pleasure
bent; and, as we all took especial inter-
est in each others’ business (without
neglecting our own), the preparations
usually attendant Upon a Phillip Island
sporting trip caused just a little extra ex-
citement, especially among the young lady
element of our society, for, let me tell
you, we were by no means paupers in
that valuable commodity. Our unmar-
ried. and, very often, good-looking
“subs.,” deserved every procurable com-
fort in these hazardous exploits—and,
verily, never were pic-nicers more boun-
tifully provisioned than they.
It was necessary, also, to ship a boat’s
crew, and four or five of the best-con-
ducted boatmen among the prisoners
were usually selected for the trip. A
soldier may be good enough upon his
own ground, and with a rifle in his hand;,
but, as a rule, he is a poor “ pullist ” at a
heavy oar.
To look after the prisoner portion of
these crews, it was usual for each officer
to take his own soldier-servant with him,
so that if four of the former left head-
quarters, they and their boatmen formed
a guard double in number to the prisoner
portion of the party. Due precautions
were ever taken (or ordeied to be) on
arrival at Phillip Island, so as to prevent
any chance of escape by the prisoners.'
The boat was hauled up high and dry
on the beach of the only landing-place
there. The arms were to be retained in
the possession of the officers and their
men, while a couple of the latter kept
vigilant guard over the boat, provisions,
and general impedimenta. Indeed, it
was a matter of honor with the officers
to produce the bodies of the prisoners the
day after their leave expired.
I well remember the occasion I now
write about. There had been a little
legitimate ‘‘spooning” between more
than one of he excursionists and certain
young ladies of garrison celebrity, more
beauteous, I fancy, than £ven nature had
really made them—from the- fact that
the supply of the luxury then on hand
was rather limited ! To gratify a whim
on the part of these demoiselles, it had
been arranged that at a certain Lour each
night of the stay of the party on Phillip
Island bonfires should be lit, and the
palm awarded to the builder up of that
showing the most distinct glare to those
on the main settlement.
Weil, the day was fixed, and all went
“merry as a marriage bell.” Promises
of no end of boars’ heads and tusks ; a
live goat or two, for the benefit of our
fledgelings (for Norfolk Island possessed, **
especially, a procreative climate) ; and a
boatful of rabbits. The party consisted
of three officers and their servants, a
civilian, and four prisoners. They were
well armed, and also well provisioned for
a week, in case of rough weather coming '
on, and a re-entrance over the bar being
found impossible.
We saw them safely off, watched the
mixed crew (six) manfully pull through
the then moderate surf, and soon the
whaleboat was out of eyesight—though
with a good glass it could be seen near-
ing its destination.


Nine p.m. was the hour determined for J
lighting the bonfires, but, to the dismay
of all assembled on the settlement, at the
hour fixed upon, not a sign of a light was
visible. The ladies were disgusted, and
we of the tougher sex enjoyed the “ sell.”
Next day passed as usual with us, and
night again came on, but no fire appeared.
What could be the matter ? The
poor fellows surely couldn’t have been
drowned on the passage over —it
was such a calm day ! However,
to-morrow evening the leave expired,
and we would then see what had
reallv warranted these breaches of
promise ! The day closed, but no return
of our sportsmen, and the Major became
evidently annoyed at the “French leave”
taken by his subs., and determined on
giving them his mind when they put in
an appearance on the morrow. That
night, long before nine, a huge bonfire
blazed out ; a little later, some distance
off, another lighted up. and, after that, a
third ; moreover, as if to puzzle us all,
the fires were vigorously kept up till a
late hour, evincing, at all events, the
energy of the excursionists in collecting
material. The fires would go apparently
* out at one time, but soon after blaze
away again as brilliantly as ever ; and as
for deciding to whom the prize should be
given, that was out of the question, so
eccentric and varied were the “ spurts ”
put on.
As there was no appearance of our
friends next morning, shortly before noon
a well-manned boat was sent across to
order the truants home forthwith, with
heavy threats as to the consequences of
disobedience. As it was, there was no
end to the length of the rod in pickle for
them by their Major for overstaying
leave, on the one hand ; and the ladies,
for selling them so egregiously, in rc
bonfiring, on the other.
Towards dusk we saw the relief-boat
returning, and as she came within a mile
of our shore, it was" plain that the sports-
men were alive, at all events. The scene
on the pier as the boat came alongside is
worthy a far better descriptive pen than
mine. There, in the stern-sheets, sat the
four gentlemen, and on different thwarts
crouched those that remained of their
retinue of seven.
Sadness, humiliation, and disgust were
manifest in their faces. It was before
the age of beards, then, and the heroes
each rejoiced in a four days’ “ stubble,”
which intensely villified the already
hang-dog expression of their counte-
nances.
“ What the d has detained you ”
burst out the Major.
“ Why, we - we - we-co-o-o - ouldn’t get
back ? ” was the piteous reply.
“ Where the blazes is the boat ?”
swiftly followed.
“ They've gone off, boat and all! We
couldn't help it, either, as you will say
when you hear more about it!”
Explanation was deferred till they
were all ashore, when we got the follow-
ing account from them, which, I need
not say, caused merriment sufficient to
last us a month.
They had reached within twenty or
thirty yards of the beach at Phillip
Island when, owing to the water shal-
lowing, it was found to be impossible to
get ashore without jumping overboard
and walking the distance in some three
feet of water. The draught of the boat,
from its heavy cargo, prevented its fur-
ther progress—it having stuck in the
sand. Now. no one for a moment, even
to this day, imagines that British soldiers
ever forget that “ England expects every
man does his duty ! ” and in that belief,
and in laudable acceptation of the res-
ponsibility, these right trusty domestic
warriors each jumped over the side and
presented his back to his master, who,
leaping into the saddle, literally rode his
biped ashore ! I forget, now, how the
civilian reached terra Jirma. I daresay
one of the team did an extra stage.
When our friends dismounted, they
naturally expected the boat to have
neared the beach by several yards, but,
to their utter dismay, discovered she was
afloat and fifty yards further out 1
“ Now then, my lads, shove her ashore
and get the traps out.” was met with the
rejoinder, “ Not if we’re aware of it, gen-
tlemen ! You’ve given us a fairer chance
of liberty than we ever got yet and our
mates would only laugh at us if we
didn’t take it!”
“ But if you go, what’s to become oi
us ?” was the lament from the shore.
“ Why, you can knock along for a
couple of days, surely. There’s plenty of
rabbits.” , , ,
“But we’ve nothing to shoot em
w ith —you’ve got all the guns and ammu-
nition ! besides, there’s a great chance of


getting any water this weather ! ” said
the crest-fallen subs.
“ Well, as far as that goes, we don’t
•want to be too hard upon you ; so we’ll
let you have a couple of fowling-pieces
and a little of the water —you’ll have to
use that carefully, for we may want
every drop of it. So let one of your
chaps come out as far as he can wade
and get them. Hurry up, now, for time’s
precious, and the sooner we are out of
this the better But hold on a moment!
We had better draw the charges and just
pour a little water down the muzzles ; we
believe you to be honorable fellows, but
you might cripple us with a stray shot.”
This was all done, and, giving three
cheers, the prisoners pulled off round the
point and were lost to view. Here was a
pretty kettle of fish ! Six sworn-in war-
riors and an uncovenanted civilian regu-
larly “ done brown ” by these four pri-
soners of the crown. What on earth
could they do ? As to swimming over to
the mainland to give the alarm, that was
out of the question ; for Captain Boyton
and his example was as yet a thing of the
future.
No, they “bore it like men,” and sadly
marched up the path cut through the
dense scrub to the little hut with their
too-well wetted guns and a few quarts of
water. Bonfires were forgotten till the
third day, when it was thought that a
general “flare-up” would at all events
denote something out of the way. I
need add nothing else. The deed was
done, and there was no mending matters.
_ Nor need I say much as to the un-
limited amount of chaff they swallowed
without remonstrance, for some little
time afterwards. It was a caution to
future shooting parties ; and, if I re-
member well, Phillip Island was not again
patronized for a long period.
We never heard definitely as to the
fate of the crew. They had a splendid
boat, amply provisioned, and, no doubt,
were picked up by one of the numerous
whalers in the neighbourhood, or possibly
have—as some people asserted to be a
fact—reached New Zealand, some 450
miles to the southward.
Stand up for your rights ; never allow
even your watch to be run down.
A GOSSIP WITH THE BOYS.
We regret that so few of our young
friends have thought fit to aid us by
the contribution of local enigmas,
charades, and conundrums, or of solu-
tions to the riddles propounded by
ourselves. Perhaps it is because we
did not offer sufficient inducement.
In this too practical age boys as well
as men have to be bribed into exer-
cising their faculties. Of old it was
“ no song no supper,” now it is “no
supper no song. ” Will the following
be sufficient inducement ? We now
offer to our younger readers (of either
sex) a prize of books (to the value of
one guinea) to be taken by the sub-
scriber who shall furnish the greatest
number of solutions to the enigmas,
etc., appearing in this and the next
seven numbers of Once a Week, (Nos.
19 to 26 inclusive).
We said above this too practical
age. Can anything be too practical,
you ask. Most decidedly it can.
When in man’s eagerness to be prac-
tical he bares things down to the
actual and leaves no room whatever
for the play of imagination he com-
mits sacrilege. In modern history
books with all their vast improve-
ments on the old, with their mnemonic
aids, their philosophical analysis, we
are sorry to note a contemptuous,
ultra-rationalistic ignoring of the old
myths, as if anything could supply
the place of them. Buskin has
written finely against this rationalistic
mode of dealing with the past, this
paring down of history to that which
one has day and date for. He says:—
“ If Cincinnatus was never so found,
nor ever existed at all in flesh and
blood ; but the great Boman nation
in its strength of conviction that
manual labour in tilling the ground


was good and honorable invented a
quite bodiless Cincinnatus and set i
him according to its fancy in furrows
of the fields, and put its own words
into his mouth and gave the honor j
of its ancient fame into his ghostly
hands — this fable which has no foun-
dation, this precious coinage of the
brain and conscience of a mighty
people, you and I, believe me, had
better read and know and take to
heart diligently.” What Frenchman
is the better for knowing that Cam-
bronne did not say “ the old guard
dies bat surrenders not.” And who
with British blood in his veins would
like to think that on the eve of Ciu-
dad Bodrigo Picton never addressed
the men of the 88th with: —Rangers
of Connaught—it is not my intention
to expend any powder this evening,
we’ll do the business with the cold
iron.” Yes ; there is fear that our
age of doubting is too practical.
Perhaps when we have swept all ideal
surroundings away, the biggest lie of
all will be left!
A young grammar school friend
has sent us tbe following attempts
at parodying. As they seem to
have the right ring in them we sub-
join them. The first is a stanza
after “ Ironbark’s ” verses in the
“ Exhibition Annual ”:
Little scores at cricket
Make a mighty whole ;
Little runs at football
Bring one near the goal.
The second effort is a la u Casa-
bianca,” and we fear recalls a dis-
agreeable personal reminiscence :
Tbe youth was at the awful stand,
Where naughty lads are caned,
The lithe rod in the master’s hand
Bent round him while it pained.
The rod bent round —he could not go
Without his master’s word —
That master feigned heart rending woe
Nor yet his voice was heard.
The boy’s voice roared: “Say, master, say
If I may yet be gone,”
And but the sounding cane replied,
And fast the slaps came on.
ECONOMICAL COOKERY.
(From the Middle Class Cookery Book).
HOW TO COOK FISH.
Aromatic Bloaters. —After you have
taken off the heads and tails of six her-
rings, soak them in water for four hours,
and after this for two hours in a gill of
milk, take them out, drain and rub them
dry; then take an ounce of butter, half a
bay leaf, a little thyme and basil chopped
very fine, adding the yolk of an egg, a few
grains of whole pepper, and make all
these hot, then pass the herrings in this
preparation, and bread crumb over, grill
ing them on the gridiron.
Bloater Salad —Grill the herrings,
when half-done extract the bones from
the flesh, and let them get cold ; then
chop up finely one onion, lay it over with
oil, vinegar, and pepper, stir all up. This
will be found a very appetizing dish.
Whitings. —After they have been
drawn, washed, and rubbed dry, leaving
the liver in, give them three or four cuts
on either side, roll them in flour, and fry
them on a sharp fire, and for a change
serve them up with either caper or
anchovey sauce, or dress them as flound-
ers or plaice.
Another way. —Put six whitings in a
flat enamelled dish, with a little butter,
chopped parsley, and salt, lay over some
bread raspings, let simmer until done,
and serve hot in the dish.
Hashed Oysters. —Open twelve oy-
sters, put the liquor in a vessel, and the
oysters in a saucepan, and when nearly
boiling, take them out and put them in
cold water, strain them off, cutting off
the hard part of the oyster, which you

fish, putting this with the liquer you have
saved into the same pan with two ounces
of butter, one tea-spoonful of chopped

A RAT.
BY A. DE FONBLANQUE.
The Rat is skin and bone, and nervous
as a cat. He has lost more blood than
he could spare from that slighter wound
on his arm. He has no constitution to
fall back upon, and to hold him up whilst
Nature fights the shock and the fever
which follow his more grievous hurt.
Grievous, indeed! though the ball did
not quite pass through his body ; better,
perhaps, if it had. It has pierced the
lower lobe of his right lung, and is lodged
somewhere in the muscles of his back. If
he could sleep, or even be brought to
remain quiet, he might have a chance.
He cannot be quiet; whether it be pain,
or whether it be surprise at such wonders
as being fanned, having lemonade to sip,
and so on, I cannot say. He is inces-
santly on the turn and on the watch ;
nor will any drowsy syrup in the doctor’s
chest quiet him.
When the lady comes early in the
morning, the Rat is sinking slowly. His
face brightens up as he sees her, and he
begins to ask about Charley.
“ Oh, my poor boy,” she says, “ let us
talk of better things. Let us talk of
God.”
“ God ? ” he repeats, with a look of
wonder.
“ Can it be that you have not heard of
God ?”
“I’ve heard,” Dick replies, “you bet !
When it rains, it’s god-dam wet; and
when it shines, its god-dam hot; and
when the boys don’t get their money
regular, its a god-dam shame.”
The lady stands aghast before this
awful ignorance. He only knew the
name of God in curses !
“Wicked men take His name in vain,
Dick,” she says. “ God made this world,
and all that is in it; God is all that is
good and merciful. God sent his only
Son to save us. ”
“ He didn’t save me much,” is the Rat’s
commentary.
“He will save your soul, Dick. He
called little children to Him, and wel-
comed them to heaven.”
“Was that afore the war ?” asks Dick,
gravely.
“ Long, long before the war.”
“Well, things has got mixed since then.
Ain’t He coming no more ? ”
“ It’s no use, Jennie,” says her husband,
who had followed her into the cabin, and
overheard Dick’s struggles with his first
and only lesson in divinity. “ These
things cannot be taught all at once.”
“Oh I but it seems so terrible,” she
cries ; “ and he dying ! If I could only
teach him to say a prayer ! ”
“And do you really think that re-
peating a form of words which he would
not understand, could do any good ? ”
asks her husband. “ No. Let me try it
I can rouse a thought to work upon.” So
Mr. Austen takes his wife’s place at the
head of the cot.
“ Dick,” says he, “ the doctors tell me
that unless there comes some change—
and they don’t much expect any—before
night, you must die.”
“ Will it hurt bad ? ” asks the Eat, a
spasm of fear passing over his pinched
face.
“ That I cannot say. Some people die
quite quietly—go off in their sleep, as it
were. Well, Dick, what do you think
happens then?”
“The funeral,” replies Dick, promptly.
“ Some has a fireman’s funeral and music;
and some gets took off in the City van.
Shall I be took off in the City van ? ”
“ No, my boy ; I’ll answer for that.
But let us go back to the death. Where
will you go when you die 1 ”
“ Into the coffin.”
“ Your body will—but your soul ? ”
* ‘ What’s that ? ” asks Dick.
What indeed ? See here, the immense
power of ignorance. It has silenced
Theology—it has stumped Philosophy.
“ Pray for him, dear,” says Mr. Austen
to his wife, down whose face the tears
are streaming, “ that is all you can do.”
*****
“ I say—don’t you cry like that,” says
Dick, when she resumes her seat by his
side. Child-like, he puts up his hand to
withdraw hers from her eyes. He touches
it with awe. It does not break or fly off,
and nothing is done to him for his daring.
Encouraged by such immunity, he ven-
tures to give it a little pat, and then the
face which he is watching intently is lit
up with a smile through its tears. Into
his unloved life—into his half-savage
mind, dawns the first idea of a caress!
He clasps the lady’s hand, and draws it
down upon his heart. He draws it down,
and presses it there with both his little


brown puds. Then he leans back with a
long-drawn sigh, and shuts his eyes.
*****
Three years have passed, and Captain
Gilbert’s steamer is again at her wharf,
at the foot of Jackson Street; and again
Mr. and Mrs. Austen are going to lunch
on board. As the lady is stepping down
from the gangway, a well-grown, hand-
some boy, in a blue flannel knickerbocker
suit, and straw hat with the ship’s ribbon,
comes shyly forward.
“ Why, that is never Dick ! ” she
exclaims.
“Dick all over,” says the captain,
proudly.
“Oh, Dick, how you'have grown, and
how improved ! ”
“ There was plenty of room for that,”
laughs the quondam Rat.
Then the captain takes her aside, and
explains. “ He’s been at school ever
since he got well, and he has learned
more than other boys do in double the
time. Oh, he’s smart! I’m educating
him now for my own profession, and I
believe he could pass for a mate to-
morrow.”
‘ ‘ What name have you given him ? ”
asks the lady, drawing circles on the deck
with the point of her parasol.
“My own. My wife thinks as much
of him as I do ; and as we’ve no children
of our own, why ”
‘ ‘ Captain Gilbert, you are a good man!”
“ A lucky one, anyhow,” he laughs,
“ and,” lowering his voice, “ a grateful.
Now, then, Dick,” he shouts, “ see if Mr.
Austen won’t have a cocktail.”
This is the end of the Rat’s tale.
Some scraps from a lunch table, kindly
given, stood between a man and ruin ;
and the tender touch of a woman’s hand
saved a boy’s life—that’s all! -Temple Bar.
The picture in a late Graphic of Mr.
Gladstone looking on at the work done
by Ransome’s tree felling machine sug-
gested to a correspondent of the World
the following :
“ He yields the helm of statecraft, owns
he’s beat
By one who has more power to his pro-
peller ;
Tis hard indeed to have to own defeat
In woodcraft, too, by this new-fangled
feller.”
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 16.
The Legislative Assembly having
twice rejected resolutions brought
forward by private members to vote
the sum of money (£20,000) asked
for to construct a sewer along
Bourke-street, it may be interesting
to show what evidence has been
placed before them to enable them
to arrive at their decision.
On the 13th July, 1875, the
attention of the Sewage and Health
Board having been drawn to the
high death-rate prevalent in that
locality, they appointed a sub-com-
mittee, of which Mr. W. Bennett
was the chairman, to examine into
the condition of Shea’s Creek, who,
after personal examination of the
district, and careful enquiry, re-
ported the result of their observa-
tions to the Board.
We quote the second and third
clauses of the report:
2. The Eastern head of Shea’s Creek
is the immediate recipient of the drain-
age from Moore Park and from a low-
lying swampy neighbourhood between
Moore Park and Bourke-street, now
being rapidly covered with houses. The
drainage water stagnates in pools on
private ground, as well as on the water
tables and unformed portion of Bourke
Terrace, Jamison and Arthur streets, in
front of many of the dwellings.
3. The whole of the subsoil of the low
ground appears to be saturated with the
sewage, giving out most offensive fumes.
Many of the houses have been con-
structed in what are now green foetid
pools, and complaints of illness and mor-
tality during the hot weather of last
summer were general. No language can
adequately describe the foul and noisome
■filth of the drains in the immediate
vicinity.
The Board also appointed, on the
24th November, 1875, a sub-com-
mittee, of which Dr. Alleyne, the


Health Officer, was chairman, “ to
enquire into the prevalence of scarlet
fever,” several alarming and fatal
cases having been brought under
their notice. The following extract
from the report of that sub-commit-
tee will shew that the evils com-
plained of were traceable to the same
cause—want of drainage works :
We subsequently visited a number of
houses in Bourke-street and the neigh-
bouring streets, and inspected the open
spaces adjoining them, and found that
the existing conditions were such as, in
our opinion, would cause such a disease
as scarlet fever to be developed in its
worst and most fatal form. The damp,
ill-constructed houses—the total neglect
of all provisions for ventilation or drain-
age —the state of Bennett’s Paddock,
which may be described as a swamp of
putrid organic matter, supplied by the
houses adjacent to it —the filthy condi-
tion of the so-called street to which
Blanche Terrace faces, which is so satu-
rated with waste material of various
kinds from the residences in its vicinity
as to be converted into a bog, together
with the accumulation of decomposing
animal and vegetable substances almost
everywhere around—are the efficient
causes of the reported unwholesomeness
of a locality which, under proper sani-
tary conditions, would be undoubtedly
one of the most healthy and delightful
in the city.
The reports of these committees,
with the evidence taken by them,
were submitted to the Government
by the Health Board in their Eighth
Progress Report, on the Bth Febru-
ary, 1876, in which they urged that
not a day should he lost in carrying
out the necessary works.
In the Ninth Progress Report of
the Board, adopted on the 4th
April, 1876, they again drew
the attention of the Government to
the urgency of the case, appending
to their report some further evi-
dence taken by Mr. Bennett's com-
mittee, on an alleged gross nuisance
in connection with Messrs. Alder-
son’s tannery, which aggravated the
evil. This evidence, said they—
Discloses a state of things requiring
immediate attention. There is but one
way of setting things right, and prevent-
ing the continuance, or, more probably,
an aggravation, during the next summer
of the disease and excessive death-rate
which have prevailed during the present,
and that is to provide at once the neces-
sary funds for the construction of the
sewer recommended in the former report
of the committee.
These important recommendations
were repeated by the Health Board
in their Twelfth and final Report,
on the Bth February, 1876; and
they also pointed out that whatever
scheme for the disposal of the
sewage of the city might be deter-
mined upon, this sewer would he
necessary , and would harmonize ivith
it.
Such were the opinions held by
the engineers and members of the
Board appointed “to enquire into
and report as to the best means of
disposing of the sewage of the city
of Sydney and its suburbs, as well
as of protecting the health of the
inhabitants thereof.”
To have carried out the works
referred to during the present
winter, so as to avoid the possible
outbreak of an epidemic in the un-
wholesome district next summer,
would have been the natural sequitur
to such repeated and forcible appeals.
But sanitary legislation does not
find favor with members of the
Legislative Assembly, or they could
not in feuch careless fashion reject
the proposal to expend a compara-
tively small sum of money when
their thrice-uttered refusal may be
attended with such disastrous con-
sequences. It cannot be because
they have no confidence in their


advisers, since they have adopted
the sewerage scheme, of which this
sewer would form a part, submitted
to them by the Health Board, that
scheme having received the approval
of their consulting engineer, Mr.
Clark.
In the meantime the residents in
the most unhealthy quarter of
Sydney may live in hope, but they
may also die of typhoid or scarlet
fever.
A LIFE’S REGRET.
Turning the leaves in an idle way
Of a book I was skimming the other day,
I found a line at the end of a song,
Which keeps on haunting me all day long
With its sweet and mournful melody.
“ O love, my love, had you loved but me!”
Sadder a burden could never be,
Than “ love, my love, had you loved but
me! ”
Few words and simple; but 0, how
much
The singer has told in that little touch !
How hard a story of chances lost,
Of bright hopes blighted and true love
crossed,
Is heard in the whispered melody,
“ 0 love, my love, had you loved but me!”
To many a sorrow the key may bej
That love, my love, had you loved but
me! ”
I don’t believe in wh&t poets have said
Of hearts that are broken and lives that
are dead ;
Lives well ordered will stand to their
course,
And hearts of true metal ring little the
worse,
But—they vibrate still to that melody,
“0 love, my love, had you loved but me !”
My life is well; but what would it be,
Sweet “ love, my love, had you loved but
me ! ”
The world rolls on and the years roll by,
Day-dreams vanish and memories die ;
But it surges up with a restless pain,
That fond lost longing ever again,
Breathed in the passionate melody,
“ 0 love, my love, had you loved but me!”
It might have been, but it cannot be !
Yet “ love, my love, had you loved but
me !”
H. C. M.
SPORTING ADVENTURES IN
AUSTRALIA.
BY CHARLEY CORNSTALK.
The second day after the steeplechase,
the party at Yarrawa broke up, the gentle-
men forming an escort to Miss Grant’s
young lady visitors, who had a journey
of some forty miles before them.
Jem Curtis felt that he must also say
his adieux, but before doing so, he deter-
mined to have it out with Georgie, and
see if he could wring a promise from that
capricious young lady.
He thought, however, he was bound in
honor to speak to Mr. Grant on the sub-
ject nearest his heart.
To this task he set himself in rather a
despondent mood : for, although his pros-
pects were fairly good, and he would
shortly be in possession of money enough
to purchase a share in a station, or stock
any new country he might take up, he
felt that the wealthy squatter would con-
sider him but a poor match for his only
daughter. But Jem was buoyed up with
a hope that Georgie would be on his side,
and he had found out already that oppo-
sition to that young lady’s wishes from
any quarter had very little chance of
success.
So that afternoon he took the first
opportunity that presented itself of
talking to his host alone.
Mr. Grant’s first words encouraged
him. “ Well Jem,” said he, “ so you are
going to leave us, too. Well, it can’t be
helped. Come over whenever you can
spare a day or two, we shall always be
glad to see you. And, by-the-bye, you
will give me great pleasure if you will
accept as a memento of your visit, the
grey mare you rode so pluckily yesterday.
You have managed to get on such excel-
lent terms with her, that it would be a
sin to part you. ”
“ Oh, Mr. Grant ”
“ You need not thank me for her : for,
to tell the truth, the oiler does not really
come from me. My daughter suggested
it, and insisted that you should ride the
Mountain Maid in place of the horse you
brought with you ”
“ Oh, Mr. Grant, I am exceedingly
obliged to you ; but your kind present,
which I willingly accept, makes it more
difficult for me to speak. The fact is, I


have fallen in love with Miss Georgie,
and—and—
“ Whew ! So that’s how the land lies ?
And pray, what does the young lady her-
self say ? Have your feats of horseman-
ship gained her favor ! Do you speak to
me with her sanction ? ”
“ No, indeed, sir. I may have uncon-
sciously betrayed my admiration for her ;
but I could not take advantage of your
kindness to ask her downright. 1 am
not at all sure, if I did, that she’d have
anything to say to me.
“ Well, Jem, don’t be dismayed. ‘ Faint
heart never won fair lady. ’ I like you
for the manly and straightforward way
you have spoken to me, and if you had
asked me for anything else, I should have
been disposed to grant your request off-
hand. But Georgie is my only child.
She is my pet and my darling, and the
man who takes her from me, must have
my full confidence. I must be thoroughly
assured that he is fitted by temper, dis-
position, and integrity in thought and
action, to make her happy. He must
also be in a position to provide for her
and for any family she may have. Now,
let me hear what you have to say for
yourself.”
Jem thereupon launched into an account
of himself and his prospects ; of his love
for Georgie, and his determination to
achieve a fortune for her, giving to his
words such a rose-colored tinge that Mr.
Grantcould not help smiling at his earnest
hopefulness, and recalling the days gone
by, when he, too, with much more slender
prospects, had pleaded the same tale.
“ Mr. Curtis,” said he, I have no wish
to play the part of the stern parent of the
melodrama. That my daughter should
marry a man engaged like myself in
pastoral pursuits, apart from the frivolity
of town life, has always been my wish.
Her tastes are healthy and natural, and
when she leaves my home, I hope it will
be to settle in a similar home of her own,
where she will be, as she is here, the
centre of a circle of devoted friends and
protectors. But I will never part with
her until I can place her hand in that of
a man whose character I have sufficiently
studied, to be sure that, humanly speaking,
her happiness is secured.
“ So you see I do not reject you as a
suitor for her. I repeat that I like what
I have seen of you, but I require a longer
probation than your short visit has
afforded me. Winning a steeplechase
and winning my Georgie are two very
different things. I can give you no
stronger proof of the good opinion I have
formed of you, than by saying that I
place no veto upon your visits. I believe
that the pure love for a good girl is the
best spur to a young man’s exertions. I
have the greatest confidence in Georgie ;
so much so, that if you can win her heart
I shall almost think you worthy of her.
Treat me always with the candour you
have shown to-day, and you will not find
me unreasonable, if in a year or two’s
time things should shape towards the
fulfilment of your wishes.”
Jem was, of course, profuse in his
acknowledgments, and left his host,
hardly knowing whether he was standing
on his head or his heels. To tone down
the exuberance of his spirits, he took out
the Mountain Maid for a spurt, and for
about an hour exercised her in jumping
a number of low fences in the neighbour-
hood of the home paddock.
Then he sought Georgie. But the
young lady who had probably (who had
can tell) an inkling of his object, took
studious pains to thwart him. In vain
did he try, now on one pretext, and now
on another, to get a moment’s private
conversation with her. She was resolved
that there should be no tete-a-tete that day
at least. Perhaps she enjoyed the power
she knew she possessed of tyrannising
over such a devoted lover.
However, the next morning at break-
fast, Georgie announced her intention of
walking over to see Mrs. McMahon, one
of whose children was sick. McMahon
was a splitter and fencer employed at
Yarrawa, who lived in a slab hut on the
run about a mile from the station.
Jem was not inattentive. Here was
the opportunity he had been looking for.
So the young lady had not got more
than a couple of hundred yards on her
way, before he overtook her.
“ My goodness, Mr. Curtis, what brings
you here, on foot, too. You are the very
last person I expected to see.”
Now, the little flirt knew very well
that Jem would follow her, and had pur-
posely taken a walk in that direction to
give him an opportunity of talking to
her.
“I thought, perhaps,” said Jem, you
wouldn’t mind my walking with you,


especially as I may not see you again for
a long time.”
“ Why, you don’t mean to say you are
going away ! ”
“I must leave to-morrow morning, Miss
Grant, and I have been trying all the day
to get a chance of speaking to you. ”
“ Dear me ! how mysterious. Well, you
had better make haste about it, for when
we get to Mrs. McMahon’s you won’t
have a chance to get a word in edgeways,
unless you understand all about children’s
ailments and rheumatism, and all sorts
of domestic troubles, for_her tongue goes
like the clapper of a* bell from the
moment she sees me until I leave. ”
“ Perhaps there are other people who
stand quite as much in need of a little
kindness from you.”
“ I am always happy to do what I can
for any fellow sufferer, said Georgie, with
the most innocent air imaginable. Who
is it? ”
“ Oh, Georgie, you know well enough
who it is. Don’t you care for me a little
bit?”
And this was all that poor blundering
Jem Curtis could say, albeit he had been
for hours rehearsing an eloquent and
passionate declaration, which he felt
must convince his lady-love of the fervour
and sincerity of his devotion. But in
these cases the self-possession is all on
the side of the woman.
“ Indeed, Mr. Curtis, we shall be very
sorry to lose you. My aunt is very fond
of y< u, and the way you rode the Moun-
tain Maid ”
“ Mr. Grant has made me a present of
the mare,” said Jem.
“ Oh, I’m so glad ! that was so nice of
Papa. Of course you accepted her ? ”
“That was not all he said. We were
talking about you, and he said I might
hope ”
“ What! you have been talking about
me to Papa, without asking my permis-
sion. Oh, Mr. Curtis, I will never speak
to you again.”
“ But, Georgie ”
“ Don’t Georgie me, sir ! Oh, how
could you ? If you had cared for me as
you pretended to do, you would have
spoken to me, and not to Papa. What
has Papa got to do with it ? ”
“ Then, of course, I can’t accept the
mare, and I shall leave Yarrawa this
afternoon. Good-bye, Miss Grant.”
“But you must have the Mountain
Maid, I insist upon it. ”
“I thought you were not going to
speak to me again.”
“ Then you had no business to think
anything of the sort. Will you, or will
you not accept Papa’s present ? ”
“ I will ride the Mountain Maid with
the lightest heart in the world if I take
her as a present from you, but not other-
wise. Oh, Georgie, if I don’t gain your
love, I don’t care what happens to me.”
“ Well, I never. You need not speak
so loud. Do you expect a young lady to
bawl out to a gentleman in a 24-acre
paddock, ‘Love me, love my horse.’ I’m
ashamed of you, Mr. Curtis ! ”
And that was the nearest approach to
a serious answer which Jem could obtain
from the little tyrant. She teazed him
and chaffed him to her heart’s content
during their walk of two miles, and finally
they parted in anger—feigned on her
part, but more or less real on his. Jem
not being sharp enough to perceive the
tender interest in him which underlay
the saucy rejoinder of the belle of Yar-
rawa.
Still sore at heart, and angry with her
for her mockery of his pretensions, but
more than ever in love, Jem took a formal
parting of his friends overnight, and
swore by all his gods that he would leave
Yarrawa at daybreak, returning on his
own horse as he came, and giving up at
once and for ever the Mountain Maid and
all the delicious hopes which his acquaint-
ance with her had given rise to.
The next morning at daybreak he went
to the stables booted and spurred, deter-
mined to carry out his resolve.
There he met Bob Simmonds; and in
the stall where he should have found his
own horse which had been run in the
day before, in readiness for the journey,
stood ready saddled or bridled —the
Monntain Maid.
“ Where is my horse ? ” said Jem.
“ What, that bay stock horse of yours,
Mr. Curtis? Why, he’s pretty well on
thirty-five miles from here by this time.
He’s gone with a mob of cattle down
town.”
“ Miss Georgie gave me particular
orders about the mare. She said you
was death on the Mountain Maid, and
wouldn’t ride no other, which stands to
reason ; and I was to Ire sure and have
her ready for you this morning. And


there she is, a pictur ; she’s had an hour’s
grooming, and you needn’t be ashamed of
her.”
Now, Jem had sworn in his wrath that
he would only ride the grey mare upon
certain conditions, and with him an oath
was not to be lightly put aside ; yet even
upon his unsophisticated mind, it dawned
that these conditions were likely to be
fulfilled. Hesitating, and with his heart
torn by conflicting emotions—half pique,
half tenderness—he sauntered back to
the house, and had hardly put his foot
on the verandah when he was accosted
by a silvery voice which said,
“ Oh, Mr. Curtis, won’t you take a cup
of coffee before you start.”
And there was Georgie with a pair of
blushing cheeks in a bewitching morning
costume, waiting to say good-bye.
“ Oh, Jem !” she whispered, as he took
her in his arms and kissed her sweet lips.
“ Do you forgive me ?”
“ My darling, you know I love you with
all my heart and soul.”
“ And you’ll promise not to forget me.
And you will ride over at least once a
week to see me.”
It would be idle to repeat Jem’s pro-
testations of eternal fidelity. Five
minutes later, and Georgie got a glimpse
of her lover on the Mountain Maid taking
a flying leap over the slip-rails which
enclosed the station buildings.

THE ULSTER:
PAST AND FUTURE.
In dealing with this subject we may at
once admit that we are not of those who
derive the Ulster from the tabard of Ul-
ster King-at-Arms. That sleeveless gar-
ment seems to us to afford scanty mate-
rial for any such derivation.
It would be more reasonable to go back
to its origin to classic times, and regard it
as a modification of that “ Blanket in the
alarm of fear caught up” by Hecuba. The
only objection is that the Ulster is not
“caught up,” but allowed to draggle in
the mud.
Perhaps the more reasonable historic
theory derives it direct from Moses-
greatest of Israel’s dii Minories.
As a wrap-rascal, the Ulster naturally
was early appreciated in the City. When
it extended at length to the West-end, it
soon found favour over all other garments.
The Ulster meets all requirements. “ A
coat by day, a counterpane by night; ”
and readily available as a corner-cup-
board to keep food and other delicacies
in. The new fashion of check patterns
also renders it useful as a chess or draught
board.
The addition of the hood was a stroke
of genius; drawn over the high chimney-
pot hat it presents an appearance of ex-
treme elegance. Its chief use is, however,
to catch the water during heavy rains,
and so prevent the coat becoming satu-
rated.
It is in the hood that we see the great
capacities for developement which the
Ulster presents. The hood fitted with a
little tin arrangement, and planted with
flowers, would be an exquisite novelty.
The early crocus may be looked for in
perfection in this form.
The fishing Ulster is another novelty.
The live bait are conveniently stowed
away in the hood, calming the fisher-
man’s natural fears about leaving them
behind.
Other ingenious adaptations will be
hit upon. No barrister’s Ulster will be
complete without its brief-bag.
On the whole, the Ulster is likely to
last as long or longer than any garment
we have had experience of. Every one
likes it ; and it may be truly said in the
slang phrase of the day :
“ It suits them down to the ground.”


THE MYSTERY OF WISEMAN'S
FERRY ROAD.
CHAPTER Xl Continued.
The supper table, surrounded by its com-
pany of fair women and well-looking
men, lit up by Chinese lanterns suspended
from the roof of greenery, and groaning
under the weight of good things which
Yorky had felt it to be his duty to pile
upon it somewhat prodigally was soon
the centre of fun and laughter. Yes,
Yorky had surpassed himself, aided as
he was by several hampers from Com-
pagnoni’s, and two or three large cases
from Peate and Harcourt’s. Not that
the old fellow conceived for a single
moment that he owed aught to those
celebrated metropolitan purveyors—at
least in the way of the substantial—for,
as he had growled to one of the chain-
men when unpacking the baskets and
boxes, “Where’s the cleverness in opening
a tin of salmon, or warming up a
potful of mulligatawny ? Any fool can
do that much ! But you show me the
fallow who can bake you light rolls like
them over there, or boil you a round of
beef to the eighth fraction of an affi-
graphy, and there’s a cook for you though
I says it as oughtn’t to ! And pertaters.
too, Dick ; there’s art required to boil
’em, even in their skins ; there is
me ! Not but what some of these crin-
cums sets off a table ; only where would
the whole blessed thing be without a
round ?”
When supper was over, Mrs. Kenny
sent for old Yorky, and told him he
deserved a cordon bleu.
“ Your round was perfection, Yorky,”
said she.
“ I wish I could get such a cook,” added
Mrs. Cosgrove.
“ Well, mum,” quoth Yorky, modestly,
“it ain’t so easy. You see you’re all for
women folk, or else these ere blessed
Chinese, so what can you expect ?”
“ Now, Yorky, mind you and the men
make yourselves as jolly as you can. I
know you despise the tinned kickshaws,
as feminine fripperies, but perhaps you’ll
condescend to give me your opinion of
the couple of bottles labelled Y, which 1
filled for you with my own hands, and
which are for your own especial use.”
“ Thank’ee ma’am.” This was said
with effusion : then he added, musingly,
“ Lor ! I don’t wonder at it.”
“ Wonder at what ? ” asks his master’s
wife. ,
« Well, mum, at the fools a set of pretty
creatures like you and Mrs. Cosgrove and
them girls are able to make of a man.
Why. If you'd ask me to throw myself
down one of them there blessed gorges I’d
doit.”
“ Oh ! Yorky, I didn’t think you were
so impressionable. Will you drink my
health ? ” and Mrs. Kenny, as she spoke,
handed him a tumbler of port.
“Drink your health, mum ! My word
and I will, and many of ’em. Here’s-
yours, and these ladies ; and kind hus-
bands and children in galore to the lot
of you ; (this remark raised a little con-
fusion) ; and I’ll do it again by-and-by
before turning-in in a ball of the rum
you brought me. God bless you, ma am.
And Yorky departed from the pre-
sence.
“ Are you not afraid that Blanche will*
repent her of her generosity ? ” asked Mrs.
Cosgrove of her host.
“ Oh, no ! there’s not the least fear.
Yorky will be loyal to duty, only when
you’re all gone away, he’ll ask for two
clear days on which to be happy and
glorious.”
“ The wretched old man ! ”
He’s quite an original, I assure you.
Did you ever hear how he served the
clergyman, when he was living up on the
station ? ”
“No ! I don’t think I ever did. Prob-
ably not very politely,” replied Mrs..
Cosgrove.
“It was on this wise. Littie Glibly,
who was then incumbent at Merriton,
had ridden over one evening to hold
service. All the hands turned up except
Yorky. The next morning after break-
fast, Glibly, when bidding us good-bye,
said he would just call in at the men’s
kitchen and say a word or two to the old
fellow. Blanche suggested that he had
better not do so. However, he would go,
and he did with but poor result: for
Yorky listened to his regrets and advice
in sulky silence ; while to his pastor’s
request to put him on the right road to the
slip-rails —the men’s hut, you know, lies
a good bit off the beaten track—he blurted
out, “Why can’t you learn your own
business afore you come a’ meddlin’ and
a’ muddlin’ with mine. You’re a pretty


fellow to pretend you can teach us the
way to Heaven, when you can’t find your
way out of the blessed paddock.” And
Glibly had to find the road the best wav
he could.”
“ What a terrible old heathen ! ” said
the younger Miss Neville, who rather
affected unmarried young clergymen, and
whose pretty fingers had deftly toiled at
many an altar-cloth.
“For my own part,” remarked Mr.
Cosgrove, “ I rather like a staunch old
heathen of the Yorky type. As for
parsons—”
“Blanche,’’cries Mrs.Cosgrove,”hadn’t
we better leave it to the gentlemen to
abuse the clergy ?”
“ I think so, indeed. Come, my dears !
when the gentlemen want us, they’ll find
us at the waterfall. ”
“ Don’t stop too long,” whispered Lucy
to George,” or else it will be too late to
have any singing, and I am dying to hear
the effect of Miss Neville’s voice in that
lovely ravine.”
. “ And I.”said Geerge, tenderly, “would
give worlds for you to show the running
brook a music sweeter than its own.”
“ Don’t be absurd, sir.”
When the ladies were gone to get their
wraps, little Mr. Denne rose and said
that, as he perfectly well knew they
couldn’t find their way to the waterfall
without male assistance, he would seize
the very few minutes which could be
-spared him to propose the jolly good
healths of their host and hostess.
“ Here you are old fellow ? ” cried he,
raising his glass as signal to his con-
vives, whose response was cordial, and
given with all the honours, though the
party was but six in number, all told.
Kenny’s reply was brief. “ Thank you,
heartily, boys,” said he ; “it’s all right.
Let’s enjoy ourselves. What says the
bard—
“ If life an empty bubble be,
What fools are those,who cannot, see
The rainbow in the bubble!”
Do any of you say more wine ? ”
A chorus of Noes.
“ Well, then, light up, and prepare to
escort the women.”
The order was not given a moment too
soon, for even as Mr. Kenny spoke, the
ladies came out of their tent ready for their
moonlight ramble, chanting (to the great
.amusement of the men) the stirring I
Yankee chorus—“ As we went marching
through Georgia.”
“ I thought that would bring you out,”
said Mrs. Cosgrove, as the young men
ran up to the fair choristers, “ Come, now,
boys, join in.”
Which the boys did with considerable
effect.
When they reached the waterfall, music
of a higher character followed, Miss Kate
Neville and Miss Lucy Watson rendering
(as the reporters say) some very fine old
ballads in a very exquisite fashion. And
coffee followed the music, for Yorky (and
it was a fact that they all treasured to
his credit) unsolicited and wholly of his
own proper motion brought some coffee
down in a jug, and then served it round
out of a cup to each in turn. No one was
fastidious enough to despise the mode
of service ; indeed, the general impression
was that the old heathen was a trump.
And then there were more songs and
whispered tendernesses beneath the
moonlight, in the mellow gleams of which
“ soft eyes looked love to eyes which
spake again.”
The next day, all the pic-nicers were
up betimes. The ladies were shown a
retired bogie-ing place, which they gladly
availed themselves of ; while the men
clambered further down the gorge to a
glorious pool into which the “ header ”
was a possibility.
At breakfast, the plans for the day
were discovered ; when it was arranged
that the gorge to the right of the ridge
should be thoroughly explored and
botanized.
When the party were all mustered and
ready for a start, “ I hope you girls are all
properly shod,” said Mrs. Cosgrove (who
considered herself to stand somewhat in
loco parentis ).
A very captivating display of neat
Balmorals, thick enough to satisfy the
most anxious mother, was the answer to
the question.
As an enterprise in the interests of
botanical science the day was not exactly
a success, though in all other respects,
notably including flirtation, it was
delightful. Nothing of any particular
importance in the way of the sensational
occurred; and saving that during one
brief hour of its sunshiny existence, big
Miss Neville contrived to land little Mr.
Denne, no more need be related of it.


On the following day Fate brought
about an adventure which was to exer-
cise an eventful influence on the fortunes
of the pair to whom it befell. A second
so-called botanical ramble had been
arranged, and after an early breakfast
the party had started to prospect for ferns
the gullies and watercourses that fell
from the western side of the main ridge
of hills along which the old northern road
meanders to the Hawkesbury. The
chain-men were instructed to prepare
luncheon for the explorers beneath the
shelter of a clump of rocks, a little way
off the road and distant some three or
four miles from camp.
Before noon, the unmarried portion of
the party was split up into several pairs,
in exactly the same order as that given
by Mrs. Cosgrove, when, on the day of
her arrival at the camp she had told
George the principles on which she had
persuaded Mrs. Kenny to select her guests.
Mr. Crawford was gathering ferns for
Miss Kate Neville in one gully ; in
another, Denne was trying the effect of a
wreath of the bright scarlet berries of the
Eleodendrum as a foil to the dark glossy
tresses of the lady of his love. Elsewhere,
Miss Crawford was listening to what her
companion had to say on the subject of
involucres and fronds, not without a
secret hope that she might be able to
lead the conversation to a more personally
interesting topic. A man, she thought,
who could talk fern in her blithe, buxom
presence would
“ peep and botanize
Upon his mother’s grave.”
Into yet another of the many gorges
that led by precipitous and broken paths
to the wooded bays below, George Cal-
decott and Lucy Walton had managed
with that affected carelessness which is
the grace of true art to wander all alone.
The basket he carried was by no means
heavy with weight of floral spoil. The
happy minutes had not been spent in
hunting for specimens of fern or lichen,
but in the charming conversation which
ever constitutes the intercourse of lovers.
Far more of these happy minutes had
gone than they had reckoned, and even
at the slow pace with which they had
threaded the ravine they had reached a
greater distance from the spot appointed
for a rendezvous than Caldecott had any
idea of, when suddenly they came upon
the verge of a cliff, and —
“ Behold
Beneath their feet a little lowly vale—
. Even as if the spot
Had been from oldest time by wish of theirs
So placed to be shut out from all the world.
Urn-like it was in shape—deep as an urn,
With rocks encompassed.”
“Oh ! ” cried Lucy, “ how lovely !
How I should like to get down there.”
“You never could manage it, said
George. . T ,
« Yes ! I think so ; you know i m a
Hawkesbury girl, and am surefooted
among the rocks. And look there, sir,
pointing to the place as she spoke, “ we
could manage to get down by following
the edge of that break in the cliffs. At
le "V^ a i' think it’s possible by that
track, as long as you don’t get giddy.”
“ Oh, I’m never giddy ; not, at least,
in that way, Mr. Caldecott. But it will
never do for us to go down there. Why,
look at the sun ; it’s close on luncheon
time. Let’s turn back.’ .
“ What, on the brink of an enterprise /
Never! As for being late, we are late
now ; so we may just as well be hung for
a sheep as a lamb.”
“ I accept your philosophy ; we will
visit the bay. It was that gleam of sun-
shine on the trees down there that decided
m Many difficulties hindered their descent.
Sometimes they had to leap ; sometimes
to proceed cautiously on a narrow ledge
of rock : sometimes to aid their progress
by taking hold of roots and branches of
trees. But as Lucy’s pretty little feet
and hands were quite equal to the task,
the bay was reached in safety in a very
few minutes. „
“It will be an awkward pull up,
remarked George, scanning the cliff from
the grassy sward, on which they were
taking a breathing spell.
“ Yes,” said Lucy, it will put us in
mind of our classics, and the sed revocare
which follows the facilis descensus . Now,
don’t think me an awful blue
“ I didn’t notice they were blue, as you
were going down./
“ Now, don’t be absurd, Mr. Caldecott.
I was going to say that all my Latin is
comprised in that one quotation. It
came out quite apropos, though ; and if
I wasn’t a very honest girl, I might have
passed muster as a Virgilian scholar.
But how dark it’s getting ! ”


Sure enough, the sky was darkening
over with cloud.
“ We’re going to have a change of
weather. We had best revocare at once,”
said George.
But the wind that had suddenly risen
made him reflect that possibly it would
be dangerous in trying to make the ascent
at that moment.
“We must wait for a lull. Look at
that piece of rock falling, what a crash
it will make ! ”
Waiting for the lull, and feeling that
chill both physical and moral which ever
follows a sudden change from bright sun-
light to cloudy weather, the tone of their
conversation sympathetically altered. It
became tinged with melancholy.
In reply to a remark of Lucy’s, George
was speaking of his mother’s lonely life.
“Ah ! ” said Lucy, “ you are happy in
having a mother to talk about. I never
knew mine.”
“ No ? ” asked Caldecott.
“No ! I cannot recollect mine ; nor
does Papa ever talk about her. It is the
only secret he has from me ; but isn’t it
a terrible one. I never see the word
mother in a book or hear it spoken with-
out a little heart spasm. I do envy
people so who can remember their mothers.
But it’s wicked to talk like this, for Papa
has been father, mother, all to me.”
“ We must look for cover,” interrupted
George. “ The wind has fallen only to
prepare for heavy rain. It will soon be
down.”
Beneath the rocks there was any
amount of shelter, and as the wind had
gone down as quickly as it rose, there
was but little danger of falling stones
and pieces of rock. A comfortable spot
was soon selected wherein to remain till
the heavy shower was over.
They hadn’t been there a minute or
two before Lucy, who had been atten-
tively scanning the formation of the
rocks, said'hurriedly to George,
“Look there !” pointing as she spoke
to a large mass of rock, a little way from
them, which ages before had been de-
tached from the main wall of the cliff.
“ Well ?”
“ Don’t you see there’s a regular pas-
sage between that huge boulder and
the wall, and, what’s more, a cut step
just inside the entrance. Let’s go and
explore. It may be a hermitage !”
And before George could dissuade her,
Miss Walton ran off, intent on Leiug the
discoverer of the mystery, should there
by good chance happen to be one.
Passing between the boulder and the
main cliff, she ascended the stone step
evidently cut by the hand of man.’
Closely followed by George, she con-
tinued along the narrow wav, which
apparently, after two or three score of
yards, led out again to the clear, until, to
their mutual surprise, an opening to the
right disclosed to view a large, well-
lighted cave, in which, littered about,
were the evidences of its being tenanted
by civilized man.

COPY OF MY FIEST POEM, PUB-

Ah ! here it is ! I’m famous now.—
An author and a poet!
It really is in print ! Ye Gods !
How proud I’ll be to show it !
And gentle Anna ! What a thrill
Will animate her breast,
To read these ardent lines and know
To whom they are addressed.
Why, bless my soul, here’s something
strange :
What can the devil mean
By talking of the “graceful brooks
That gander o’er the green ?”
And here’s a T instead of R,
Which makes it “ tippling rill ;
“ We,ll seek the shad ’ instead of shade,
And ” hell ” instead of “ hill.”
“ They look so”—what ? I recollect
” Twas “ sweet” and then ” twas “
KIND
And now to think the stupid fool
For “ bland ” has printed “ blind.”
Was ever such provoking woik ?
” Tis curious, by the bye,
How anything is rendered blind
By giving it an eye.
“ Hast thou no tears ?” the t’s left out,
“ Hast thou no ears ?” instead:
“ I hope that tlmu art dear,” is put
“I hope that thou art dead.”


Whoever saw in such a space
So many blunders crammed !
“ Those gentle eyes bedimmed ” is spelt
“ Those gentle eyes bedammed.”
“ The colour of the rose is nose,”
“ Affection” is affliction
I wonder if the likeness holds
Hn fact as well as fiction ?
“ Thou art a friend,” the R is gone
Who ever would have deemed
That such a trifling thing could change
A “ friend ” into a fiend ?”
“Thou art the same” is rendered “lame,”
It really is too bad ;
And here, because an i is out,
My “ lovely maid ” is “ mad
They drove her blind by poking in
An eye —a process new ;
And now they’ve gouged it out again,
And made her crazy, too.
“ Where are the Muses fled, that thou
Should’st live so long unsung 1”
Thus read my version ! here it is—
“ Should live so long unhung.”
“ The fate of woman’s love is thine.”
And h commences “ fate
How small a circumstance will turn
A woman’s love to hate !
I’ll read no more ! What shall Ido 1
I'll never dare to send it :
The paper’s scattered far and wide,
”Tis now too late to mend it.
0 Fame ! thou cheat of human bliss !
Why did I ever write !
I wish my poem had been burnt
Before it saw the light.
Let’s stop and recapitulate:
I’ve damned her eyes, that’s plain—
I’ve told her she’s a lunatic,
And blind and deaf and lame.
Was ever such a horrid hash
In poetry or prose ?
I’ve said she was a fiend, and praised
The colour of her nose.
I wish I had that editor,
About half a minute,
I’d bang him to his hearts content
And with an H begin it.
I’d jam his body, eyes, and bones*
And spell it with a D,
And send him to that hill of his—
He spells it with an e.

TOWN GOSSIP.
Wf are glad to notice any gympton
of vitality in suburban municipali-
ties. Dare we hope that our re-
peated warnings of the danger of
neglecting the ordinary precautions
against sickness in the shape of pure
water, and cleanly premises, are
awaking a little attention ? Be
that as it may, the Burwood Muni-
cipal Council deserve the thanks of
the rate payers in the district, for
the active steps they are now taking
te put down nuisances. Our atten-
tion has been drawn to a placard, in
which they announce, that they have
appointed an Inspector of Nuisances,
whose duty it will be to see that
their bye-laws are carried out in re-
spect to uncovered wells, unclean
premises, riding on footpaths, allow-
ing animals to stray, etc., etc.
Better late than never. It will be
recollected, that not long ago, a
little girl, 12 years of age, was
drowned in an uncovered well, on
some premises belonging to Mr.
Anthony Hordern. Several other
wells on that gentleman’s property
have long been uncovered, in the
neighbourhood of Croydon station,
and he has hitherto turned a deaf
ear to all requests to cover them
over, braving public opinion under a
false security that the local Municipal
Councils have no power to enter
private property, and that an open
two-railed fence, through which
children can run without stooping,
is a sufficient enclosure. We are
glad to find that the Mayor of
Bnrwood has a correct comprehension
of the scope of his bye-laws, and is
resolved to protect the heads of fami-
lies residing within his boundaries,
from the continual, daily, hourly,
danger created by these child-


traps. While on this subject, we
would call attention to the brick-
making machine, now in course of
erection, on a piece of land, also
the property of Mr. A. Hordern,
facing Grosvenor-streeet. Surely
that gentleman cannot be so san-
guine as to imagine that such a
gigantic nuisance as this, will be
allowed to exist in the centre of an
inhabited district.

In the interests of the Croydon
people, we also call attention to the
absence of all drainage systems in
connection with new houses being
built in that suburb. They need not
go beyond the platform to see a
notable instance of this deficiency.
For our part, we shall fearlessly
expose every abuse that may be
brought under our notice, and
shall never rest satisfied until some
measure becomes law, under which
owners of property shall be com-
pelled in the arrangements of their
buildings to include those ordinary
conditions of healthy living, the
absence of which so largely adds to
the mortality, even under the most
favorable circumstances.

An Irishman invited a friend to
dine with him. After dinner he
produced the materials for whisky
punch, which he pressed upon his
guest. The punch was excellent,
and was duly appreciated. Two or
three hours passed in friendly con-
verse, and glasses were filled and
refilled, until the number reached
seventeen. Suddenly the visitor,
looking at his watch, said he must
go, as he had an appointment.
“ Take one more glass before you
go, said the host.
“ Faith an I would with all the
pleasure in life,” was the reply, but
I‘ve got to meet the Bishop, and it
would never do for me to have even
the trace of liquor about me. This
argument was unanswerable.

A sad accident, resulting in the
death of a railway porter, occurred
during the week at Croydon. No
blame can fairly be cast upon the
officials. It was a sheer case of
recklessness. Due warning was given
to the deceased that a train was
approaching, and yet he wilfully per-
sisted in crossing the line only a few
yards in advance of the engine. A
senseless outcry has on the strength
of this accident been raised against
the Railway authorities. The scene
was the level crossing where carts
and horses cross at all hours.
It is suggested that bridges for foot
passengers should be erected at all
these places, but how about the carts
and horses, are they to go over the
bridges, ahd where are the bridges
to be put ? Will any one take the
trouble to go over them when they
are put up ? Very few we fancy.
There are certain stations where the
traffic is large at which bridges would
be an immense improvement, but in
this instance the complaint is idle.
Considering that an approaching
train can be seen and heard for some
hundreds of yards in either direction,
and that the line is only five or six
feet in width, that there are printed
boards cautioning passedgers not to
cross when a train is approaching,
and that the officials are always on
the alert to warn travellers of the
danger, it seems absurd to rail at the
management because some foolhardy
person chooses to throw his life away
in defiance of such precautions. By-
the-bye what a splendid piece of com-
position is the aforesaid printed warn-
ing on the boards exhibited on each


platform. Instead of saying simply
“ Passengers are cautioned not to
cross the line whenatrain is in sight,”
it states impressively but mysteriously
“ Persons crossing from one platform
to another are requested to do so with
great caution, and to first satisfy
themselves that both lines are clear
of approaching or passing trains.”
Why that is a complete bridge—a
sort of pons asinorum —in itself. But
some persons are never satisfied.

The Border Post furnishes the most
sensational story of the season. We
are delighted with it. Hitherto jour-
nalists in slack times have depended
too much upon the eccentricities of
the snake as the foundation of a tough
yarn. Now the kangaroo has hopped
in and shown what he can do. The
story goes that a boy was recently
walking along the high road—where
the writer does not say, probably
somewhere between the Border and
the Post —when a kangaroo came
bounding up to him, and without
saying “by your leave,” took the boy
—who weighed 65 lbs.—up in his
arms and hopped away to the Mary-
land Co.’s ground, a mile and a half
distant, at full speed without spell or
spill. A large mob of kangaroos
joined the pair by way of escort, but
none of them appeared to have made
the offer to bear the burden, “ turn
and turn about.” On arriving at the
Company’s ground the kangaroo set
the boy down carefully and stood for
a minute looking at him sorrowfully,
evidently expecting to he thanked,
but the boy was too frightened to say
a word, and the animal left him in
disgust and rejoined his companions.
The correspondent of the Post says
the boy’s name was “ Willie,” but
that is clearly a mistake, “it must
have been Joey,” and the “old man”
who had probably missed one of his
own family mistook him for the truant.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Help Hope. —Shall be glad to receive
your views anent Bridget; but on the
recognised journalistic condition that you
supply us with your name and address
as a guarantee of bona Jides.
F. L. G. —Begin with Macaulay’s
Essays (for prose) and Byron’s “ Childe
Harold” (for poetry). Those works read
and digested, you might with profit take
up one or two of Shakspere’s plays, say
“King Lear,” and “As you like it.”
You should also, as a groundwork to these
studies read Stopford Brooke’s excellent
little manual, “ English Literature ” (one
of Macmillan and Co.’s shilling literature
primers.)
