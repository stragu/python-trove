MOVE ON!
In these days of hot spanking Pro-
gress, when we so jubilantly
“ throw out acclamations of self-
thanking, self-admiring, with, at
every mile run faster, ‘O the won-
drous, wondrous Age!”—in such a
time one would naturally think that
the especial function of the man of
the period, more particularly of the
fast man of the period, would be to
move on. Yet it cannot have es-
caped the notice of the attentive
observer of the habits and customs
of a certain class of men, that the
condition of fastness is by no means
dissociated from the reprehensible
and slow practice of standing at
street corners, blocking-up hotels, and
even church doorways in an insou-
ciant insolent sort of way, that is, to
say the least of it, extremely
offensive.
Any one who will take the
trouble to make the necessary obser-
vations in the afternoon, at the in-
tersection of Pitt and King Streets,
will be in a position to endorse the
above remarks. At these four cor-
ners will he be able to note many a


choice specimen of the wealthy
lower order snob. There will he
observe the expansive loafer, all
shirt front and loud jewellery, the
Asian bookman, redolent of Hounds-
ditch though clad in apparel of
price and greasy with costly un-
guents. There will he see, in all
his glory, the obtrusive “ Georgia.”
Yes, mobs of such loiterers will he
be able to note, each and all with
blatant self-sufficiency, advertising
their foolish naughtiness and
trumpery bravery to all and sundry
at the expense of the bond fide
wayfarer. The public streets are
quite narrow enough in all con-
sciousness. They are bad enough
at the best of times, under the
ordinary conditions of traffic ; why
are they to be made next to impas-
sable to the man of business, intent
on his business, and absolutely ob-
jectionable to the decent woman, of
whatsoever degree, that may have
occasion to pursue her walks abroad
without a protector %
Cannot the police interfere to
check this nuisance? We observe
that the ordinary constable is ever
active to exercise his potent sway over
the little arab, or the limp withered
drab, or the broken drunkard.
When, however, there is but a sus-
picion of wealth—even of plated
wealth—your constable waxes very
prudent. There is hesitation, per-
haps the hesitation of expediency
rather than of connivance, but still
hesitation. Too frequently offences
in a policeman’s eyes
“ With a small estate
Are damning crimes ; but venial with the great—
Venial? Nay graceful, worthy, gallant, brave,
And such wild tricks as gentlemen should have.”
Oh, Mr. Fosberry ! Mr. Fosberry !
Oh! Cannot you see into this, and
strain an Act or so, to meet the
case.
“ Can you with your physic
Take away our phthisic ?”
should you answer—
“ I cannot-with my physic
Take away your phthisic; ”
remember also to add, with the
epigrammatist—
“ But I can with physic
Take you from your phthisic.”
Apply the principle of change of
action to the street-corner snobs. If
they can’t be induced to use the
streets as gentlemen should, don’t
let them abuse it. If they won’t
keep themselves from the streets
as nuisances, keep the streets from
them. If they won’t move on
bon gre , move them off mal gre !
HUMOURS OF VERSIFICATION.
A Stammering Wife.
I.
When deeply in love with Miss Emily
Pryne,
I vowed, if the lady would only be
mine,
I would always be ready to please her.
She blushed her consent, though the
stuttering lass
Said ne’er a word except “ You’re an
ass—
An ass—an ass—idious teazer !”
11.
But when we were married, I found,
to my ruth
The stammering lady had spoken the
truth ;
For often, in obvious dudgeon,
She’d say, if I ventured to give her a
jog,
In the way of reproof—“ You’re a dog—
Dog—dog—matic curmudgeon. ”
111.
And once, when I said, “We can
hardly afford
This immoderate style with our mode-
rate board,”
And hinted we ought to be wiser,


She looked, I assure you, exceedingly
blue,
And fretfully cried, “ You’re a jew—
jew—
A veryjju dicious adviser !”
IY.
Again, when it happened that, wishing
to shirk
Some rather unpleasant and arduous
work,
I begged her to go to a neighbour,
She wanted to know why I made such
a fuss,
And saucily said, “ You’re a cuss—
—cuss—cuss —
You were always ac —cus —tomed to
labour.
Y.
Out of temper, at last, with the inso-
lent dame,
And feeling the woman was greatly to
blame,
To scold me, instead of caressing,
I mimicked her speech, like a churl
as I am,
And angrily said, “ You’re a dam—
dam—dam—
A dam—age, instead of a blessing.”
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
With reference to the subject of
overcrowding, as one of the condi-
tions inimical to health, and to its
prevalence in our lodging-houses and
schools, we proposed, in our last, to
give in our issue of the present
week, some particulars of the Model
Lodging-house of Melbourne, intend-
ing to return to the schools on a
future occasion.
We read in the Argus of 17th
October, 1872, that on the previous
day the foundation stone was laid of
a building which “is intended to
supply a want long felt in Mel-
bourne—viz., the providing proper
and cleanly accommodation, at a low
price, for the large number of poor
persons, who, without houses of their
own, and without the means to pay
for lodgings of the higher sort, have
been hitherto forced to put up with
the scanty accommodation allowed
them at the cheap common lodging-
houses of the city. These dens are
notorious for dirt, filth, overcrowd-
ing, and want of ventilation. The
report proceeds to state that “a num-
ber of gentlemen who visited these
common lodging-houses, discovered
such a prevalence of overcrowding,
want of cleanliness, and general dis-
order, necessarily producing disease ,
immorality, and social degradation,
that the importance of establishing a
model lodging-house at once occurred
to them, in order to check these
evils, and, ultimately, to supersede
the wretched dwellings in which
they have their origin.” ....
“ Steps were accordingly taken to
form a company, having a capital of
£SOOO in 400 shares of £l2 10s.
each, limited liability; for erecting
and furnishing a house for men ex-
clusively, having 200 beds, baths,
reading and smoking rooms, with
other appurtenances The
public having taken up the mat-
ter in a very warm manner, the
whole of the 400 shares have been
subscribed for The
scheme, while primarily having in
view moral results, is not of an
eleemosynary character, but is essen-
tially commercial, and will be
worked out as a self-supporting en-
terprise.” Such having been the
scheme, let us see what our neigh-
bours have achieved before we con-
sider how nearly our circumstances
resemble theirs, and how it may
be possible to guide ourselves
by the lights of their experience.
We read in the Report of the Direc-
tors, for the half-year ending 20th
July, 1876, that in the period then


elapsed 37,156 beds had been pro-
vided to persons who otherwise
would have endured the horrors of
common lodging-houses; and that,
after paying a small debt to the
bank, spending over £250 in fumi-
niture, £l2B in interest of money,
a balance exceeding £l4O remained
in bank. The report for six months,
ending 20th January, 1877, is even
more favourable, showing 37,485
lodgers accommodated in the six
months, and a sum of £SOO profits
invested on a fixed deposit for the
purpose of paying off the mortgage
upon the building. We learn that
the cost of the land was £1,737
18s. lid.; cost of building, £6,225
17s. Bd. ; furnishing, £1,250 —
£9,213 16s. 7d. ; that the weekly
cost of management, including wash-
ing, is £l2 10s. ; that the building
has a frontage of 69 ft. 4 in. Base-
ment—Com prising, superintendent’s
quarters (three rooms), entrance
hall, office or committee room, two
best bedrooms, eight beds at Is.
per night; second-class, divided into
small rooms, four beds in each—
total, twenty-seven beds at 9d. per
night, with lavatory, &c. Bead-
ing-room (50 ft. 6 in. x 28 ft.), sup-
plied with daily papers, chess,
draughts, dominoes, and solitaire,
pens, ink, &c. First and second
floors—Two dormitories, containing
in the whole 193 beds, at 6d. each,
per night; a lavatory, and other
accommodations, at each end of each
floor. Out offices: Back yard—*
Swag or store-room, smoking-shed,
fumigator, &c., &c. ; kitchen, where
lodgers cook their own food (wood
and water being supplied gratis);
laundry and drying-room over, re-
volving clothes’-drier; a plunge bath,
and three shower-baths.
We regret that our limits do not
allow us to devote more space to
this matter, particularly to the
admirable rules for the working of
this excellent institution—a credit
alike to the intelligence and energy
of Melbourne; but we are enabled
to refer such of our readers as may
be interested in endeavouring “to
go and do likewise ” to the source
from which we have obtained our in-
formation. Meanwhile, we have now
only time to inquire, Have we not
among us five thousand pounds that
will be content for a year or two
without return to set a-going such a
Model Lodging-house here 1 The
adventure will give a fair return for
money, when fairly launched; the
condition of our common lodgings
in Sydney appears, by the evidence
taken by the Commission, to be on
about the same level with that
which stirred our active neighbours
to erect their Model Lodging-house
—a condition fairly accountable, in
part at least, for our increased mor-
tality.
SCHOOL DISCIPLINE.
Upon the walls of Winchester Col-
lege are inscribed admonitions and
rules for the government of the scho-
lars. On the west wall are painted,
upon a large tablet, a mitre and
crosier—the rewards of clerical learn-
ing ; a pen, an inkhorn, and a sword
—the ensigns of the civil and military-
professions ; and a Winton rod—the
dullards’ quickener.
Beneath each symbol is its apt
legend—“ Aut disce ,” u aut discede ,”
“ manet sors tertia coedi. ”
Either learn, or depart, or, in the
third place, be flogged.
Nonsense Proverbs.
A clear soup and no flavour.
All rind and no cheese.
Short pipes make long smokes.
A flower in the button-hole is worth
two in the bush.
It’s a wise dentist that knows his
own teeth.
Too many followers spoil the cook.


SONG.
They bid me forget thee; they tell me
that now
The grave damp is staining that beautiful
brow;
They say that the sound of thy gay laugh
is o’er;
Alas! shall I hear its sweet music no
more ?
I cannot forget thee ! Thy smile haunts
me yet;
And thy deep, earnest eyes, bright as
when we first met;
Thy gay laugh returns in the silence of
sleep—
And I start from my slumbers, to listen
and weep.
I listen and weep ; but my sorrow is vain,
Like the shadow that flies as my eyeballs
I strain.
All round me the night pours its ominous
gloom,
And 1 tremble lest that which I wish for
should come.
Yet arise thee, dark spirit! appear to my
view!
Ah ! I knew that the tales which they told
were untrue;
Thou art here, and will bear me away to
thy home.
This world shall not hold me !—I come !
yes, I come !
E.B.
A PENNYWEIGHT OF JUSTICE.
COUET OP MINES.—MUSHEOOM FLAT.
(Before Mr. Warden Jenkins and a Jury of four.)
O’Hoolahan y. Hooney.
This was an action for trover, brought by
Mary O’Hoolahan to recover certain goods
and chattels, to wit, an irregular piece of
quartz and gold, value one pennyweight,
of which she was seized and possessed in
virtue of her labour, alleged to have been
found in the possession of defendant.
The defence set up was that the defendant
found the specimen in question in his
tailings.
Counsel having stated the case, the
plaintiff and defendant, and several wit-
nesses on either side were examined.
The evidence in substance showed that
the disputed piece of quartz had been
displayed in triumph by the plaintiff as
the result of her day’s work, that she had
mislaid it, and that the next morning it
had been seen in the possession of defen-
dant by a neighbour and identified. The
cross-examination only elicited the fact
that “tailings” and “headings” are
synonymous terms.
The counsel for the complainant, Mr.
Gabbles, thus addressed the Court:—
“ Your Honor and Gentlemen of the
Jury,—My learned brother, the counsel
for the defence, with his usual eloquence
has attempted to prove that the defen-
dant, Pat Rooney, found the disputed
property in his own ground ; and the un-
blushing effrontery with which he has put
forward that line of defence does equal
honour to his head and heart. But,
gentlemen of the jury, my learned friend
forgot, for once in his life, that he was
addressing a high-minded, right-thinking,
intelligent and independent jury of dig-
gers, well acquainted with gold-washing
in all its various branches, whom no
ingenious sophistry, no amount of bounce
and audacity, no combination of cheek
and argument, no glaring distortion of
facts could divert from a consideration of
the simple equity of the case and their
plain duty to the public. Truth, it is
said, gentlemen of the jury, lies at the
bottom of a shaft, and it would have been
well for the defendant, if, instead of sur-
facing and washing other peoples’ tailings
he had sunk low enough to reach that
inestimable jewel. But, gentlemen of the
jury, you will probably be of opinion,
after the evidence you have heard, that
he has sunk low enough—low enough, at
all events, in your estimation—when he
has attempted to defraud my client, a
lone widow with seventeen children, of a
piece of gold which was the rightful
spoil of her tub and the legitimate pro-
duce of her cradle. Gentlemen of the
jury, my learned brother has fallen into
the great mistake of endeavouring to con-
fuse you with technical terms—he has
spoken of ‘hoppers,’ he has laid an
emphasis on ‘ mullock,’ and has been
facetious on the subject of ‘ tailings.’
But, gentlemen of the jury, his client will
find to his cost that no mullock was ever
sifted through a hopper as his statements
will be sifted by you, and that on no
occasion since he embraced mining as a
profession has he run such a risk of
having his tailings curtailed. It is laid
down, gentlemen of the jury, in ‘Coke
upon Trent,’ vol. 300, p. 2754, by Baron
Flummery, in the case of Soapy v. Chisel,
where the plaintiff, a washerwoman,
identified a shirt worn by the defendant


as having been mangled by her, that
although possession is nine points of the
law, the law must go hand in hand with
the possessor. In ‘ Chitty upon Petty
Larceny,’ vol. 99, p. 3301, the Queen v.
Graball, where the defendant was seized
of a cat proved to have belonged to the
plaintiff, and the counsel for the defence
claimed a nonsuit on the ground that
cats were erratic animals and could not
be considered property, yet the plaintiff
obtained a verdict with costs upon a clear
showing that the collar worn by the cat
was her property. Gentlemen of the
jury, my client positively identifies the
specimen produced in court as her pro-
perty. Three long years, gentlemen of
the jury, had she followed the honest
pursuit which finally rewarded her indus-
try. Three long years had she spent in
rocking and cradling, which I need hardly
inform you, gentlemen of the jury, are
the natural avocations of her sex. The
splash of her tub was a familiar sound to
the residents in Mushroom Flat, and her
cradle was continually on the (bed) rock.
Three years, I say, had my client laboured
to support herself and her large family
with credit, though at times she had a
hard job to get it, when at last her in-
dustry was rewarded—as industry invari-
ably is rewarded—and, to use a term
with which, gentlemen of the jury, you
are no doubt familiar, she ‘ struck it.’
A pennyweight of gold, gentlemen of
the jury—not much in itself it is true,
but possessing a peculiar value from the
circumstances of the case, as indicating
the possible vicinity of great wealth, —a
pennyweight of fine gold, embedded in
crystallized quartz, scarcely requiring the
the aid of the lapidary to transform it into
a brooch or other feminine ornament, was
the first tangible evidence of her good
fortune. She exhumed it from its natural
bed of clay or ‘mullock,’ as my learned
brother correctly terms it; she washed it
in her tub ; she rocked it in her cradle ;
she handled it tenderly as a new born in-
fant ; she exhibited it with honest
triumph to her friends, and finally wore it
in her bosom, the hard-earned trophy
of her labour. She received the congratu-
lations of her neighbours ; and visions of
comfort, and even of wealth, of which this
piece of quartz was a specimen, flashed
before her eyes. She saw her little girls
in new frocks and pinafores, and her
boys in knickerbockers. Her children
legard it with wonder and delight. Her
example stimulates them to exertion, and
they fossick with renewed energy in the
gully which adjoins the maternal dwell-
ing. But alas, gentlemen, for the de-
pravity of human nature. The peaceful
and industrious community of Mushroom
Flat contained one black sheep. The de-
fendent, Pat Booney, residing near my
client’s shanty—too near, alas ! for her
peace of mind, and the safe custody of her
piece of quartz, and too near as he will
find to his cost for his liberty, cast his
covetous eyes upon the little specimen—
the sole nugget of my client; the widow’s
ewe lamb, and sold his birthright gentle-
men of the jury, his honor and conscience
for = a pennyweight of gold.
Yes, gentlemen of the jury, prompted
by the demon avarice, he hovers about the
calm abode of the O’Hoolahans, and in
the dead of night when, fatigued with the
day’s exertions, my client is courting
“ Balmy sleep, tired nature’s sweet restorer.”
and her seventeen children are peacefully
slumbering around her, he seizes the
opportunity to abstract the much coveted
specimen.
And now, gentlemen of the jury, he
comes before you with a cock and bull
story of having found it in his tailings.
Gentlemen of the jury, if acts like these
are allowed to go unpunished, property,
nay, life itself will no longer be safe;
quartz mining will only be a question for
large capitalists, alluvial digging will
become a dead letter, our mining resources
will never be developed, our waste land
will offer no attraction to an industrial
population, there will be no inducement to
European immigration, we shall be over-
run by chinamen and coolies, and all
classes of the community will suffer.
Gentlemen of the jury, the defendant
seems fond of specimens, and I will
now leave him in your hands, convinced
that you will give him such a specimen of
the majesty of the law as will cause him
to regret the peaceful society of Mushroom
Flat, to bewail his fatal disregard of the
laws of mum et tuum ; and to rue, for some
months at least, his unhappy and unlaw-
ful penchant for crystallized quartz.

REVIEW. *
We have before us a collection of
hymns written by a native of the colony,
and published in this city. We wish
to deal fairly with this volume, because
so many Australian books have been
either “ damned with faint praise,” or
doubly-damned with praise of an ex-
travagantly loud character. A frank
criticism of Charles Harpur’s poems
has never yet been written ; but some
of them will lie green and bright with
dew in the memory when Far jeon’s
novels and Forster’s much-beloved tra-
gedies shall have been consigned to
dust and cobwebs. Mr. Docker’s mo-
dest little volume may be overlooked,
as Harpur’s best things were over-
looked ; but it is not likely to share
the inevitable fate in store for that
remarkable bundle of platitudes —The
Brothers. Hunting for a cool, green
leaf through a tea-tree wilderness of
commonplaces is not genial work even
for the most long-suffering critic, and
Mr. Docker deserves thanks for having
saved us that trouble. In his book
there is no lack of pleasant foliage—
not the less pleasant because it is
familiar. Our author gives us no in-
stances of great power or strange
beauty, but he writes like a gentleman.
Moreover, his scholarship is manifest
in every line of his volume. Better
than the tokens of his learning are the
evidences of manly piety obvious from
beginning to end of the collection.
Only an eclectic lover of poetry, with
some strong share of the poetic faculty
himself, could have written Hymns of
the Kingdom. The verses are more
surprising in view of the fact that they
were thought out in odd leisure mo-
ments, when their hardworking author
was resting from the labours of the law.
The grandeur distinguishing religious
poetry of the highest order is absent from
Mr. Docker’s work ; but many, indeed
most, of the hymns are full of dignity.
The sonnet prefixed to the volume,
and addressed to George Macdonald,
is a really stately piece of writing—
one that can justly be quoted :
“ True Priest of God ! who having seen His face
Behind the veil that hands of men have spread,.
And found Him, not in cerements of the dead,
But ever living in the lofty place,
Beholds’t His glory, full of truth and grace ;
The rays thou hast received thou now dost
shed,
And show’st to weary hearts uncomforted
The Love that seeks the wanderers to embrace.
If from thy thought, perchance, reflected shine
In these poor words some gleams of truth divine,
(Words of an unknown tongue and region far),
I lay them at thy feet, their source confessed,
As some dark pool returns with trembling breast
Its broken lights unto their parent star. ”
Mr. Docker shows everywhere in this
book the influences that Church music
has had on his mind. Some of the
hymns are saturated with its spirit.
The deep suggestive beauty of such
music, so luminous to the exalted
imagination, must always leave a power-
ful impression upon minds constituted
like that of our author’s. His verses
proceeding from this source of inspira-
tion are very pure, and, indeed, very
lovely.
Taking the other hymns of the col-
lection into view, there are two or three
of them at least that show power as
well as beauty. Here, for example,
are some verses on Easter :
“ To Jesu’s grave the mourners came
Before the morning broke,
And lo ! two stood in robes of flame,
And thus the Angels spoke :
‘ Ye weeping ones, whom seek ye here,
In this sepulchral prison ?
The Lord of Life at death’s cold bier ?
He is not here, but risen. ’
Unmindful of the Angels’ word,
We seek in creed and church,
As in the tomb they sought the Lord,
But all in vain oi\r search.
We turn and haste at every cry—
Lo ! here is Christ, lo ! there !
We see Him not, He seems not nigh,
His coming we despair.
To those of old who mourned for Thee,
Thy word of comfort came :
* Lo ! there am I, where two or three
Are gathered in My name.’
Oh ! breathe the comfort of that word
To us who need Thee sore;
Teach us in living temples, Lord,
To seek Thee evermore.”
The reader must not mistake the
artistic simplicity of the above for
boldness. The lyric—if we may call
it a lyric—is written, as all such things
* Hymns of the Kingdom. By Ernest Broug-
ham Docker, M.A. Sydney, Joseph Cook and Co.,
Printers, 370, George Street, 1878.


should be written, in pure unmistak-
able English. The same may be said
of the hymn headed “ Christmas ” —a
song glowing with the spirit of faith:—
“ The world of man, when lost in night,
Placed vain inventions on Thy throne,
In terror shrank from unseen Might,
Or blindly sought a God unknown.
Till Thou, in mortal flesh arrayed,
Didst shine upon the human race,
And Thy humility displayed
The brightness of the Father’s face.
To sinful mortals Thou didst bring
The glory of the things unseen ;
A Tenderness whereto to cling ,
A Mightiness whereon to lean.
And now, in heaven’s eternal glow,
Thou still dost bear Thy human name;
As Thou didst work and weep below,
Throughout the ages still the same.
Partaker of our joys and woes,
Thou art the Crown of all our love ;
The Circle, which shall all things close,
The Centre, whereto all things move.
So in Thy human likeness shine
Till Thou hast gathered all in one ;
Till all the human is divine,
When we shall know Thee God alone.”
There can be no question about the
piety disclosed in these verses so
characterized by clear white diction.
We have reason to thank Mr. Docker
for his book. There is nothing in it
that he need be ashamed of; he has
spoken from the depths of a healthy
heart, and the result is wholesome ex-
pression. Moreover, in face of the
modest statement made in his dedica-
tion, we are convinced that Mr. Docker
sings out of the fulness of his own soul
and not with the glib tongue of the
mocking-bird.

THE MYSTERY OF WISE-
MAN’S FERRY ROAD.*
Chapter H.
If one day’s sorrow
Mar the day’s morrow—
If man’s life borrow
And man’s death pay—
If souls once taken,
Tf lives once shaken,
Arise, awaken,
By night, by day:
Why with strong crying,
And years of sighing,
Living and dying,
Fast ye and pray?
For all your weeping,
Waking, and sleeping,
Death comes to reaping.
And takes away.
Though time rend after,
Roof-tree from rafter,
A little laughter
Is much more worth.
Than thus to measure
The hour, the treasure,
The pain, the pleasure,
The death, the birth !
Grief, when days alter,
Like joy shall falter;
Song book and psalter,
Mourning and mirth—
Live like the swallow,
Seek not to follow
Where all is hollow
Under the Earth.
SWINBURNE.
The new arrival on the scene did not
enter the gunyah. With his horse’s
reins hanging loosely on his arm, he led
Old Bill a few steps from the fire shed,
and hurriedly questioned him in a low
voice.
“ How are the horses ? ”
“ Fit for any amount of work.”
“Did Hamlin bring over the hide
surcingles ? ”
“ Yes, and I’ve fixed ’em.”
“ How about the maize ? ”
“ Oh, it came all right in the ration
cart.”
“Any strangers lately? and who’s in
there now ? ”
“ w ell, cap’n, I’ve been pretty lonesone
lately. What with your party all keeping
so plaguey striqfc to your fencing, and the
difficulty # of making the hut from yon
track, I’ye had it all to myself the last few
weeks. That young swell in there is
right enough.”
“ Square ? ”
“ No cap’n, not square ; but righteous.”
“ Do you know him ? ”
“ No, I don’t know him, but the likes
of him I knows, soft, haffable, plucky
fellows, running over with what they
calls honour which 'is good stuff
enough in its way. However, he’ll never
tumble to anything, and a yarn with the
likes of him—he’s not got rid of his new-
chummishness yet—will do you good, eh !
cap’n ? ”
“All right, Bill. I’ll just hobble out
Old Di, and then I’ll be with him. Boil
some water. I’ve a flask with me, and
some rum in it that I’ll make your old
eyes blink again, you precious old villain.
But before I give you a drain, you
must manage to give Old Di a feed of maize.
She’s got work cut out for her during the
next few days, I can tell you. And if
we’ve only luck, my hearty, Bill Heywood
will be able to do the grand tour with
the fattest soft-goodsman of them all.
Arrival at the Clarendon, William Hey-
wood, Esq., of Yarrajumbuk, New South
Wales—and all that kind of thing; eh!
you old scamp ? ”
The stranger—evidently no stranger to
Bill Heywood—led off liis mare to the
back of the sheep yard, and there hobbled
her. He then strolled over to the
gunyah.
Bill, having made up the fire, put some
water on to boil, in gleeful expectation of
a ball. Whilst doing this, he told Calde-
cott, who was lying at full length upon
the sheepskins, half asleep, that they’d
have another mate to share their sleep-
ing accommodation.
“ But, never you mind mate,” Bill
went on to remark, “he’s a plum, is
Harry Devereux—a blooming plum.”
By old Heywood the varying degrees of
approbation were expressed by “plum,”
“blooming plum,” and “blooming
plum.” Occasionally, to express admira-
tion of an extreme character for man or
beast (the term “ plum ” suiting either),
Heywood would add a “ blank,” or may
be a double-banked “ blank,” to his form
of superlative praise. This, however, he
so rarely did when sober, that it was evi-
dent he meant, by applying the simple
superlative form to Devereux, to intro-
duce that worthy to. Caldecott, as an in-
dividual whose acquaintance was unusu-
ally worth cultivating.
* The Prologue of this story appeared in No. 2.


“ Yes,” again remarked Bill, “ he’s
a blooming plum, is Harry Deve-
reux. He’s a fellow what’s upright and
downstraight, and no two words about it.
Why, such a fellow, he might be a regu-
lar ‘ toph,’ if he chose, why he should
take to fencing—and fencing, too, for
such a stingy old hunks as Hungry Key-
nolds—beats me, it does, all to pieces.
Harry can sing, and play every instru-
ment from jews’-harps to pianners, and
play ’em well, too—none of your tootle-
tooing, sol-fa-ing, but good square music,
like what swell organ chaps knock out of
cathedral wind-jammers. And he’s about
the handiest devil ever you see. Here he
is, though, and you’ll soon know all about
him*”
Devereux entered the gunyah as Bill
was speaking these last words.
“ Good evening, lad,” he said, nodding
to Caldecott. “ Don’t budge ; I shall be
all right on Bill’s bunk for a bit. He’s
got to go round his sheep. How’s the
water, Bill?”
“ Just on the boil. I’ll hurry it on,
though,” and the old fellow knelt down to
put a few dry chips beneath the billy.
“ None of your tricks,” cried Harry;
“be off with you round your sheep. We
won’t drink all the rum, What a
old schemer you are, when there’s a smell
of Jamaica about. Off with you! The
sooner you’re back, the sooner you’ll be
able to warm the cockles of that wretched
old blood-pump you call your heart.”
So off Bill went; and that he suc-
ceeded in his mission, was confirmed by a
happy whinnying which, within five
minutes from his leaving the gunyah, was
wafted through the moonlit air from ches-
nut Di.
Harry Devereux, as he sat in the glow-
ing light of the fire-blaze, and with the
rich warm brown of the roof bark for
back-ground to his portrait, certainly
looked little like a man who earned a
laborious living by taking fencing con-
tracts. His crisp dark hair, his quick
black eyes, his full aquiline nose, his thin
coral-red lips, his slight, but nervous and
thickly-corded hands, his swarthy com-
plexion, were points which indicated that
some rich southern blood flowed in his
veins, and that either on father’s or
mother’s side he had the right to claim a
Gipsy ancestry. From the chest up-
wards he was just the subject Murillo
would have joyed to immortalise. His
lower man habited in the conventional
raiment of the nineteenth century was
out of keeping with the picturesque head
and well-formed, massive neck ; and yet,
conventional as it was, there was a care-
less grace in the way in which it was put
on that marked its wearer as one who
scorned to run in the ruck with ordinary
men. The tweed jumper, the Crimean
shirt, the corded breeches, the well made
jack boots, the heavy silver spurs, the
artistically slouched wideawake, all helped
to individualise this man—to make him,
even were he in a crowd, the cynosure of
surrounding eyes. He looked gentleman-
like, but there was too little repose about
him for his ever being taken for a gentle-
man.
“ Well, mate, a glass of grog won’t hurt
you, eh?” asked Devereux cheerily of
Caldecott.
“Not at all,” replied George.
“ Will you have it simplex munditiis,
as my old pedagogue used to say, or ‘ hot
with ’ ?”
“ I think ‘ hot with ’ is the correct
thing,” said Caldecott, somewhat sur-
prised to find old Horace quoted by a
back-bush fencer ; “the night, or rather
the morning, is chilly, and a jorum of hot
grog will be no unacceptable libation to
the god of dawn if taken inwardly by the
worshipper. ”
“ Good!” said Harry. “Hot it shall
be. And sweet ?”
“ Ay ! and sweet.”
So two stiff beakers of steaming grog
were mixed, and the two inmates of the
gunyah pledged one another with much
cordiality.
“ And, whither are you bound ?” asked
Devereux.
“ Well, I’m thinking of having a shy at
the Magenta. They say gold’s being got
there,” answered Caldecott.
“Do they?” said Devereux. “Who’s
they ?”
“Well, I heard so on the Blind Dog,
and thought I’d push over and see. Do
you know anything about it?”
“ I ought to do. I and a party were
the first on the Magenta, and we didn’t
leave it till it had proved a ‘ shicer.’ We
got stone broke on it, and had to take a
job of fencing to recruit the treasury
chest.” .
“ That’s not lively work, is it?”
“ No ! it’s not; but what would y#u
have ? Despite the philosophic sneer, a
fellow must live, and beggars can’t be
choosers. We knock very good times out


of old Reynolds, and, in strict confidence,
are doing some very satisfactory prospect-
ing, outside of sticking up his posts and
rails. If you find Magenta no good, and
like to cast back on this track, you might
call and ask old Bill to lay you on for
finding me.”
“ Thanks. I’ll remember the invita-
tion.”
“Right you are,, mate. And now tell
me this, What brings you, with that
general appearance of heavy swell, which
sits not unpleasantly upon you, into this
infernal country to dig for the perilous
stuff—the irritamenta malorum ?”
“ Oh, the old story—a too strict belief
in the Lutheran creed—in woman and
wine—not to mention the other delights
of advanced civilization. Given a bad
book on the Derby, a bank account fear-
fully overdrawn, credit with the Hebrew
nil; and the sequitur for your Frenchman
is Algeria; for your Englishman, the
diggings. Isn’t that the idea ?”
“ Not far off it. Now tell me some-
thing else, What was the number of
your regiment ? I too have had a word
•or two with advanced civilization, and l
can tell the up-bringings and professional
antecedents of most fellows I come across
by just inspecting the cut of their jibs.
Am I right ? You were at Sandhurst,
and in a good line regiment—say the
seventh, or the sixty-eighth. Eh ?”
“By George ! You’ve hit it; at least,
’tis a devilish close shave to a centre. I
was at Sandhurst, and did serve, but not
in either of the regiments named. I was
in the Rifles. But how on earth did you
guess about Sandhurst ?”
“ Oh, to me it’s easy. I’ve had expe-
rience with army men, and the Sandhurst
tone is as distinct from Eton or Harrow
as the bouquet of Chablis from that of
Sauterne. Both good, but different.
And so the pace was too hot ? Like the
rest of us worth a curse, you purchased
•pain, as the poet says, with all that joy
can give, and died of nothing but a rage
to live. Died socially, that is to say.
-Game to unmitigated grief. Well! ’tis
better to have lived—lived fast—and lost,
than never to have lived at all, isn’t it ?
What ho ! more burgundy ! Have an-
other jorum, though it ain’t burgundy,
it?”
They each brewed another pannikin of
grog, Devereux taking care to save enough
rum to make a stiff mixture for old Bill,
whose return to the gunyah he expected
'every minute.
They then went on talking about
lost delights of London and Paris life ;
not, however, along the same lines, for
Devereux’s fling had been cast full fifteen
years earlier in the world’s history than
Caldecott’s, hence the men and women
the one referred to were but rarely known
to the other. Fifteen years in fast life is'
a generation—“ The angels in pink and
the angels in blue, in muslins and moires
so lovely and new,” that are the attrac-
tion of to-day, what will they be in fifteen
years? Scarcely angelic. And the fast
men, too—fifteen years brings them up !
Look at Eglamour! In that seedy look-
ing clerk in the Lands Office can you
recognise the dandy who fifteen years ago
dazzled George-street with his waistcoats ?
Eheu! how the fugitive years do slip
past one, my Eglamour. In their swift
course they have landed you high and
dry on a paltry two hundred a year, on
which to support a grumbling, slatternly
wife and half a dozen children—you who
were wont to give delicate suppers to ex-
quisite actresses, to contest with Tait for
the blue ribbon on the turf, and other-
wise in many another pleasant way to
burn the candle of existence at both ends.
Talk of a generation—there are genera-
tions upon generations between poor
Eglamour’s to-day and that gilded past,
the mad frolic fashion whereof so soon
took wings unto itself and flew away,
Heywood’s return to the gunyah was
heralded by a nasal sound, by the sniff
with which he inhaled the balmy presence
of the rum’s aroma. As he entered, he
threw a quick glance to the rough bush
table which stood at the end of the gun-
yah between the two bunks. What he
saw there reassured him There were a
good four-fingers left in the bottle. Satis-
fied that such was the case, he allowed
himself to lapse into an apparent state of
unconsciousness as to whether there was
any such thing as ardent spirits in the
world. Bill lacked the art to conceal art.
In the presence of his god, the true wor-
shipper must pay his reverence. In an
atmosphere of rum, what could old Hey-
wood do but obj ectively adore ? Smilingly,
Devereux took pity on him.
“Help yourself, old man,” said he.
“Don’t be afraid,” he added, as Bill
with mock modesty helped himself too
moderately; “don’t be afraid. Take
what’s in the bottle. Our mate here and
myself, we’ve each had a couple of tots.
Get outside the lot of it; it ’ll do you no
harm.”


Bill took him at his word. Emptying
the remaining contents of the bottle into
one pannikin, and putting about a couple
of spoonfuls of cold water into another,
he tossed off first the spirits and then the
water with a rapidity utterly incapacitat-
ing him from exercising his taste upon
either of the two articles. The effort
brought tears into his eyes.
“What are you crying for, you old
crocodile ? Is it because the stingo’s
finished ? ” asked Devereux.
“My word, it’s good; the right tack,
and no . mistake! It does a fellow
good ; now, doesn’t it ? ”
“Well, it’s not amiss,” admitted Calde-
cott, “but it’s getting close on cockcrow,
so you’d better let me make up my dos
outside, and leave you two fellows to en-
joy your bunks.”
“ No, no ! ” said Devereux, “ I shall be
off presently, and until I go I’ll squat at
the foot of Bill’s bed. He won’t let us
sleep now that he’s got some grog aboard.
You must be prepared to hear him sing
the full, true, and particular account of
how bold Jack Donahoe came to an un-
timely end at the hands of certain ‘ parlous’
traps ; and to listen to his rather mixed
account of the adventures of the heroes
of the last two or three sensational novels
he has been spelling his way through,
Isn’t that about the size of it, Bill?”
“Well, p’raps you’re right, cap’n;
leastways, you’re not often wrong. But
Donahoe was a plum, and no mistake,
though you do laugh at Frank the Poet’s
lines about him. There’s good men in
the world now, as you, cap’n, and I know,
and as my old towny here knows too,
most likely; but Donahoe were worth a
whole bilin’ of the niminy-piminy, flash
counterjumpers, that calls themselves men
nowadays. Men, indeed! Why, when I
was at Newcastle ”
“I told you so,” said Devereux, laugh-
ing. “ With potent necromancy, the rum
spirit has wound himself into Mr. Hey-
wood’s heart, and hugged him into snares,
opening his lips that they may discourse
folly. But what d'ye mean, Bill, by call-
ing my honourable friend on the opposite
bunk a towny of yours ?”
“ ’Cause he is one, Mr. Cap’n,
that’s why,” replied Bill, in high disdain
at having been stopped at the commence-
ment of his favourite yarn.
Turning abruptly to Caldecott, Deve-
reux asked, “So you’re from Kent?
Here’s a shot at random. Do you know*
the Oxendens ?”
“Yes.”
“ The Powyses ?”
“ Rather ; they’re my own kin.”
“ What ? you a Powys! No, sir! there’s
no Powys about you; not to my fancy,
anyway. You’re too Saxon.”
“But there is; my mother was a
Powys.”
“ What, are you a Caldecott, then?”
“Yes, I am George Caldecott, with
devil an ilk left, at your service. But
when did you know the Powyses?”
“ 0, years ago, when I was a youngster,
and used to go down to Buckhurst to
study landscape scenery, drink home-
brewed ale, and flirt with the head game-
keeper’s daughter. But, undo your swag,
man, and lie down; it’s as cheap as sit-
ting, and you must be wearied of my con-
founded chattering,”
“Not a hit; but I’ll take your advice
notwithstanding, and prepare for a dos. ”
As he opened his swag and unrolled his
blanket, George Caldecott could not help
wondering in what capacity it had been that
the gipsy-looking fencer had visited Buck-
hurst. Had it been as guest in the pain-
ted chamber, or as attendant on a guest
in the servants’ hall, or (for there was
something about the man that raised the
suspicion) as poacher in the well filled
preserves? There was something about
him which gave the idea that though he
had mixed at some time of his life with
gentlemen, yet that he himself was not
one. He was apparently well educated.
His manner was that of a man of the
world who had in his time seen much, and
done much, but it wholly lacked that
peculiar indescribable tone which is the
eminent characteristic of the English gen-
tleman, even when that gentleman may
have fallen from his high estate. He did
not appear to know what either sensitive-
ness or reserve meant—those two dis-
tinguishing qualities of true gentlemanli-
ness. He was not the first man whom
Caldecott had met since his arrival in the
colonies that had called forth speculations
as to his possible antecedents, but
Devereux’s case was certainly the especial
one which most excited his curiosity.
It chanced that while arranging his
blanket, a small block sketch book, which
Caldecott always carried with him, tum-
bled upon the floor of the gunyah between
the bunks. The quick eye of Devereux
instantly observed it.
“ Do you do anything in that line ?” he
asked of Caldecott, pointing as he spoke
to the book which lay open beside him.


“ A little; I find it comes in handy
occasionally.”
“ Let’s look. Haven’t you any bit of a
sketch you can show me ? ” and Devereux
picked up the sketch-book and commenced
to examine the pocket to see what it con-
tained.
Old Bill by this time was sound asleep.
Finding that his attempts to magnify the
illustrious actions of his hero, that pre-
eminent “plum,” the bold Jack Donahoe,
were snubbed point blank by the “ cap’n,”
as he called Devereux, he had laid him-
self down on his possum rug and gone off
to sleep, while crooning in an undertone
the ballad in which Frank the Poet has
preserved the legend of that noted bush-
ranger.
Devereux searched the pocket of the
sketch-book without success. It contained
not so much as a scrap of Caldecott’s
handiwork.
“What’s your line? landscape?
portrait ? caricature ? what ? Come, sketch
me ! ” cried the fencer.
Caldecott glanced at the man as he sat
in the fire-blaze, and seeing that he would
make an admirable study, he said, with a
laugh—
“ Well, mate, if you’re not tired I will
just take you. Don’t move! there!
that’ll do.”
Taking the sketch-book out of
Devereux’shand, George Caldecott rapidly
roughed in with swift-telling strokes the
outlines of his wild-looking, handsome
features; while he was at work doing this,
it suddenly flashed across Caldecott’s
mind that the face he was working at was
familiar to him. Where on earth was it
he had seen it before ? Under what
circumstances ? He couldn’t remember
for his life, and yet, that the features
were not wholly strange to him, he was
as certain of as of his own. existence.
“ There, that’ll do for the night,” he
said, handing the book to Devereux, as
he spoke.
“ By the Lord, that’s good—masterly.
I know good work when I see it. I
wasn’t for years at old Leigh’s studio in
Fitzroy Place, for nothing, I can tell you.
Why, man, you’re an artist! ”
Caldecott laughed.
“ I like you, by the Lord! May Ibe
if 1 don’t! Look you, now ! You’ll
stop here and finish that sketch to-morrow,
or rather to-day. I’ll ride over to the
public and get some grog, and something
t asty for grub. Yes, you will now. Turn
in, and I’ll go and get my mare and be
off. I’ll be back before the sun’s an hour
high. Don’t tell Bill, else he’ll hang
about for the chance of a ball_ before
taking his sheep out, and if -ire’ gets one,
he’ll never leave the hut while there’s
a smell in the bottle.” And off Devereux
ran to get his chesnut.
He was not long before he returned.
Having saddled his mare, he mounted,
and with a “ so long ” to George, rode off
into the breaking dawn at a long swinging
canter.
Caldecott, with his easy philosophy
resigned himself to the position, and
laying himself down upon his bunk was
soon in the land of dreams.
(To be continued.)
MUFF CRICKET MATCH.
The muffs of Manly Beach having
promptly accepted the challenge of the
Ashfield eleven, the match came off on
Saturday last on the Ivanhoe Park ground
at Manly. Barely have we seen a more
picturesque spot, or one better adapted to
athletic games. Although rather cir-
cumscribed it is prettily situate, being a
natural amphitheatre enclosed on two
sides by rocky banks, flanked on the
third by the Ivanhoe hotel, and on the
fourth by a pavilion erected by the
proprietors for the accommodation of
visitors. This pavilion contains a
circular bar, from which cooling drinks
were on Saturday freely dispensed to all
who cared to partake of them, and opens
into a large hall capable of holding 700 or
800 persons. Here was laid out in
tempting array a sumptuous repast such
as might have graced an aldermanic
board; and here, when the twenty-two,
together with their umpires, scorers, odd
men and friends were seated, loyal toasts
were drunk, speeches made, and bumpers
of generous wine quaffed to manly
sentiments. Mr. Thos. Bowe, the Mayor
of Manly, presided. Owing to ignorance
as to the hours at which the boats leave
Sydney on Saturdays, our representative
did not arrive on the ground until half-
past two o’clock, thus missing the
opportunity of recording the eloquence
which the occasion called forth, as well
as the play on either side during the first
innings. We would willingly have given
one guinea, the price of a year’s sub-
scription to Sydney “ Once a Week,” to
have been able to hear Mr .’John Pope’s burst


of oratory when he rose to respond to the
toast “Our Guests.” We could only
gather from those who listened to him
the briefest outline of his speech. After
a masterly review of the Itusso-Turkish
war, and a lucid exposition of the past
and present financial position of New
South Wales, together with a few pertinent
remarks on the land question, education,
the public health, immigration, and free
trade, he proceeded to descant in
glowing terms upon the hearty and
hospitable reception which had been
accorded to the Ashfield team. Looking
back into futurity he found that the pages
of ancient history gave numerous
instances of the beneficial effects which re-
sulted from the encouragement of national
pastimes. Games played with balls in
various ways were a favourite amusement
with the Romans, and those who declined
to take part in them were held to be
indolent and effeminate. Even Caesar
himself, while holding the position of
Consul, which was equivalent to that of
Premier in this colony, used to forget the
cares of Government in the cricket field,
and was stated by historians to have been
an excellent bowler —“ optime pila lusisse
traditur ” (sensation). It was, however,
unnecessary to go back beyond the annals
of Great Britain to shew the esteem in
which the game was held. The peers of
England were *among its staunchest
supporters, and the example they set was
followed by Australians, high and low,
rich and poor. (Cheers). He was proud
to have seated on his right hand, in the
person of the Captain of the Manly
Eleven, a peer of Australia, a full-
blown M.L.C., and to congratulate
him upon the “cultivated mediocrity”
which had characterised his play, and had
fairly earned for him the additional title
of M.C.C. (Cheers). Looking at the hon.
gentleman, his face wreathed in smiles,
skipping across the field in pursuit of the
ball, he had likened him to a lamb frolick-
ing in the pasture, secure from the perils
which surrounded the peers of a neigh-
bouring colony, where the obdurate
butchers were sharpening the sacrificial
knife in the legislative slaughter-house.
(Applause). In the words of the Irish
historian, Plato, some were born great,
some achieved greatness, and others had
greatness thrust upon them. The last-
mentioned process was usually followed in
the colonies, and although his friend, Mr.
Hilder, when he had completed the
erection of a jetty on a water lot he had
lately purchased, would always have a
pier in the family,—in his opinion, that
gentleman had achieved a far higher dis-
tinction by the excellent play he had
just exhibited. (Hear, hear). He must
also award the meed of praise to those
two energetic cricketers who bore the
distinguished names of Fox and Pitt.
The astuteness evinced by the former, and
the depth of strategy exhibited by the
latter, stamped them at once as muffs of
the first water. He had no words to
express his sense of the cordial and manly
welcome which he and his friends had
met with.
“ If you belong to Brentnall’s band,
Why here’s my heart, and here’s my hand ;
Welcome to Manly : now I think
We’ll go inside and have a drink.”
had been the universal sentiment on the
part of their hosts and a more manly sen-
timent or one more suitable to the occa-
sion or the climate could not well have
been expressed. (Deafening cheers.)
Our limited space will not admit of
any lengthened review of the play as
shewn in the second innings; the more so
as we did not catch the names of many of
the players on the Manly side, and strange
to say, upon reference to our list of sub-
scribers we could only find three of them
recorded. This is evidently a mistake on
the part of our bookeeper, and must be
looked to. Were we to express our
opinion as to the merits of the players we
should award the palm to Messrs. Pitt
and Hilder. The first named player
might indeed have been pitted single-
handed against the Ashfield eleven,
since he scored more off his own bat than
they did altogether in their first innings,
and the fact that they won the match by
two runs may be attributed entirely to his
modesty. It is true that he was stumped
out once or twice in the course of his
play; but the umpire fortunately was
asleep at the time, or his career would
have been cut short. Hilder’s perform-
ance was also a neat thing in cricket, espe-
cially his bowling, which offered great
temptations to the batsmen, and resulted
in several catches. Peters would, no
doubt, have shewn some spirited play if
he could have been prevailed to leave the
swing in which he gracefully reclined dur-
ing the greater portion of the afternoon.
Bubb’s batting was magnificent, and we
regret that we are compelled to hurry
over our description of it. This gentle-


man has been the first to originate a
practice which we hope to see followed by
other muffs. He brought his son into
the field to run for him, believing that
He who hits and does not run,
Gets half the work and all the fun.
Messrs. Bubb and Son scored fourteen
by a series of well-directed hits, the senior
member of the firm playing out the game
barefooted in face of the swift bowling of
Hayes. Bennett defended his wickets
with his usual skill, neither giving or
taking a chance, and carried his bat off
the ground in triumph. We have never
known an instance in which this cricketer
was fairly put out. The score at the con-
clusion of the match stood thus :
Ist innings. 2nd innings. Total.
Manly .. 49 .. 83 .. 132
Ashfield .. 70 .. 64 .. 134
Ashfield winning by two runs.
On the whole the muff match was suc-
cessful, but we have the same objection
to make which we have before ad-
vanced. Cricketers are invited to play
whose acknowledged skill should have
caused them to be utterly rejected and
black-balled without a hearing. What
business, for instance, have such men as
Moses, Hammond, Rattray, and other
athletes to take part in a muff match ?
What muff cricketer can be expected to
defend his stumps against the vigorous
onslaught of Hayes, well versed in the
exchanges which discomfort a batsman.
How can a weary muff reach his ground
in safety with the agile Webb at “long-
on,’’who throws up the ball with such
precision that the bails disappear before
the wicket-keeper has time to look round
him.
In our opinion, all players should be
disqualified from taking part in a muff
match whose scores are usually repre-
sented by more than one figure. Swift
bowling should also be prohibited ; and
no balls ought to be delivered with a
twist—as in the case of Sutton—as this
kind of bowling tends to upset the calcu-
lations of the batsman, and cannot be
called a straightforward proceeding.
Some variety in the number of balls
given in an over, we think, is desirable,
it being a great bore to be continually
dividing without any result. The unneces-
sary exertion to which muffs are put by
the practice of going from one side of the
field to the other on a hot day shows
it to be at once senseless and indefensible.
We entirely approve of noisy demonstra-
tions, whether they take the form of
vociferous applause, clamorous censure,
or sarcastic chaff. They are gratifying to
the private feelings of the players, and
amusing to the audience, besides having
the inspiriting effect of martial music in
a battle. It is possible that, in the above
imperfect account of the match of Satur-
day last, we may have, for the reasons
we have given, made some mistakes. For
these we apologise, and plead a liberal
interpretation. It is asserted, by some
commentators, that the Hebrew word in
the second chapter of Genesis, translated
“ apple,” really means “ peach.” Verbum
sap.
WALKER.
A REMINISCENCE OF RIVERINA.
Sydney has changed most amazingly
since 1853 ; cela va sans dire : and so
also, for the matter of that, has New
South Wales generally. The man who
built a lofty warehouse in Pitt-street
circa 1855 finds his effort completely
dwarfed and eclipsed by the erections
which bear the date of 1865; and
these, in their turn, make no show by
comparison with the more palatial edi-
fices of 1875. In other words, Sydney,
as we have said before, has progressed ;
and the date of 1841 which appears
on Lyons’ Terrace shows how far back
they began to build roomy and costly
houses in this fair city. But our
theme lies outside of this metropolis
all so changed since 1853, in which
year we journeyed, on a pastoral
errand, through Wellington, Dubbo,
and the Lachlan, to the Lower Mur-
rumbidgee River, and found ourselves
located at the then embryo township
of Balranald, now a noted crossing-
place, and a depot of some fame in the
stock line.
Things were primitive on the sta-
tions then, and a great change was im-
pending. The gold discovery of 1851
had (as the war correspondents term
it) “interrupted the communications; ”
the old-fashioned bullock-dray used to
drag the flour and stores wearily adown
the Lachlan from far distant Bathurst,
or even Maitland, mills to W. C.
Wentworth’s great lake stations of
Paika, Tala, and Yanga ; or it might


be that from Melbourne the u cobbawn
wheelbarrow” would face the weary
Loddon Plains and mallee scrub of the
Edwards River, and deliver its dust-
smitten and mud-daubed flour bags, to
say nothing of casks and cases, at these
then far north pastoral ultiw.a thules.
But Hargreaves had made a discovery
at Summerhill Creek in 1851, and
something still greater in the “ jewel-
ler’s shop ” line befell at Ballarat in
the spring of 1852, eclipsing the glories
of Mount Alexander and Bendigo ;
and, as before stated, the communica-
tions were interrupted. What carrier,
we ask, would be “ bothered ” to take
a smaller price per ton for loading from
Melbourne to the Murray and Mur-
rumbidgee junction, when he could get
a higher one for the much shorter
trip to Sandhurst or Fryer’s Creek?
The matter was altogether one of Sam
Weller’s “ self-evident propositions,”
and the question needs no answer.
And so it came to pass that Went-
worth’s great cluster of sheep and
cattle runs—nestled amongst the
big lakes which here lie north and
south of the giant Murrumbidgee—
grew very short of flour. Their ave-
rage stock on hand of the article was
twenty tons ; which was kept up to
that standard, and not allowed to fall
below it, for fear of flood years and
like contingencies ; and they needed it
all, in order to supply the out-stations
which were watered on the lakes Tauri,
Gunarwe, Macormen, Makoombi, and
the great lake Betarponga, eighteen
miles across and fifty-six round it,
none of the others being more than
nine in diameter, and all fed from the
main river by ana branches ; inland
seas, which were dry also, like Lake
George, at seasons, and forming then
mere depressed basins of grassy country,
which, at such times, displaced the
heavy surf and rolling “sea” which
would ruffle great Betarponga when
the wind blew hard. As we were say-
ing, Wentworth, or rather, his man-
ager, Christie, wanted plenty of flour
to keep these places going; and it,
being the biggest property round that
part of the country, was looked up to
by smaller runs in the vicinity as a
sort of garrison of provender to borrow
from in times of scarcity, when travel-
ling by teams was “bad.” But even
Wentworth’s stock of flour had felt the
strain of the one or two years’ siege
which had befallen the station since
the gold discoveries of New South
Wales and Victoria had diverted the
traffic, and practically cut off these
runs from all but horse, foot, and
buggy approach ; and what was worse
than all, the same cause which kept
the flour from coming up kept the
wool from going down the country, and
the clip of last year, and the year be-
fore it, lay stored in the shed. The
“ wheelbarrow ” and bullocks no
longer greeted the eager and joyous
eyes of the fine race of blacks—who
still, in 1853, held their own in these
parts —with the sight of the ever wel-
come tobacco tierces, sugar, and flour
bags. Things were getting straitened,
like the garrison of Plevna ; brandy
was £l2 a dozen at Balranald ; bottled
beer was £5 a dozen at the town of
Swan Hill, by the Murray reed-beds ;
saddles and boots were any price you
liked ; there was no getting them at
all, unless they came on pack-horses,
for drays had given up the district,
save those which came with overland
sheep and cattle mobs, and these at
times had a few spare articles in the
leather line for sale. We were living
at Paika, a small, but deep and per-
manent, lake on the north side of the
Murrumbidgee, above Balranald, and
we were out of flour. None remained
in the district, save in the well levied
on, but still unexhausted, store at the
head station of Tala, across the river,
which was now (November, 1853) in
full flood, and covering its banks for
five miles on each side. We sum-
moned to our aid one Jacob, a sturdy,
sterling, and faithful black, who knew
the country and river well. We bade
him make ready his bark canoe, and
take us across from Lake Paika to
Lake Tala, and bring back a bag of the
needful farina. Away went Jacob,
and soon returned and told us that all
was ready, and to follow him. We


found his canoe to be some ten feet
long, cut out from the bend of a stout
stringy-bark tree, a lump of puddled
clay acting as breakwater and caulking
for an ugly flaw in the bow of the
canoe, which defect was owing to
some rent or fault in the bark itself.
In this frail structure we set out on
our long ten-mile punting expedition
through the flooded forest and the
reed-beds. Jacob must have had a
wonderful instinct of locality. The
day was wet and cloudy, and the sun
invisible ; the silent, still water, gene-
rally about two feet deep (except in
places where small, dry creeks or
ravines had once been), afforded no
track; nor did the tall reed-beds,
through whose interstices Jacob would
at times drag the canoe with ourself
in it, possess a landmark; yet
he never faltered for a moment
in his course. Here was no sun, nor
shadow, nor hill, nor track to guide
him, and the dense reed beds were, at
times, very wearisome to push through,
as well as high on each side of us,
shutting out all view beyond, at the
time when he hauled us and the canoe
through them ; yet he kept straight
on, almost in a bee line ; the water-
weeds were green, beautiful, and deli-
cate, in their branchings, and I gazed
down with delight over the side of the
canoe at them, as we just brushed
their tops, and sent them moving in
the clear shallow beneath us ; the
solemn forest trees, with their butts
imbedded in the still water, formed
almost a canopy overhead. The beau-
tiful nankeen crane, or bittern, sat on
the trees and uttered its deep sono-
rous boom, which has perhaps given
rise to the bunyip fable, and the
largest eagles I ever saw “ hung out”
in this locality also. On we went,
Jacob working the canoe along with a
long pole, which touched bottom every-
where, except when we came to the
main river itself, which was here not
very wide, and only distinguishable
from the surrounding flooded country
by the absence of trees, by its slow,
clear, onward current, and its immense
depth between its narrow banks, here
filled to the brim, and several feet over
it into the bargain. I was wondering
how Jacob would get across it, as he
could not touch bottom, but he used
his pole as a paddle, and soon nego-
ciated that little difficulty, whilst we
were nervously expecting to experi-
ence a helpless drift down the stream.
Five miles more of submerged grass,
intricate and filiform aquatic sponges,
reed beds, and watery forest, having
been traversed, under the watchful
care of our Palinurus Jacob, we
arrived at the landing place of Tala
head station, and sent in a requisition
for the bag of flour for Paika. Jacob,
the next day, took us and the flour and
canoe back to the very tree and moor-
ing we had started the bark conve-
nience from just thirty-six hours
before, and we certainly consider it—
much as we admire and appreciate
the tracking power of the Australian
black on stony and unimpressionable
ground, as something beyond mere
tracking, for in this water wade there
existed no guide whatever, no current,
mark, nor sign (unless it were that
the aboriginal knew every single gum
tree by its bark) to keep him going
right. A few days after this event
found us bound down the Murrum-
bidgee, on its north bank, via Kunghi,
to Wyndomel, the junction of the
great rivers with the still grander
Murray—their clear, pellucid waters
forming a great contrast with the tur-
bid stream of the Lachlan. Why are
some rivers so clean and some so
muddy, in places where there is neither
dredging nor traffic going on ? We
arrived at Canally then, and possibly
still, the head station of John Leckie
Phelps, Esq., and he invited us, one
fine day, to take a ride with him
across from the Murrumbidgee to the
Murray, which here lie close together,
and not far from the j unction at
Wyndomel ; and when we got there
we saw a sight, a very unaccustomed
sight in that part of the world—more
wonderful and unexpected than even
a bunyip—that nightmare resurrection
of the extinct plesiosaurus would
have been. There, on the waters of


the Murray, and fastened to the bank,
lay what looked at first like a huge box
afloat, but which a closer inspection
shewed to be some sort of a steamer.
Yes, there she was ! the pioneer that
had come to metamorphose alike the
destiny and the appearance of the
Murray and Riverina country —a com-
mercial evangelist in those watery soli-
tudes. Sir Henry Young, the Gover-
nor of South Australia, was a passen-
ger by the first trip, and the “ Lady
Young,” this box-like steamer, with
the hurricane upper deck, was brought
up by Captain Cadell, a ruddy, hardy-
featured explorer of the marine type
for whom this was neither the first nor
the last feat of the kind. The day
was “ wondrous hot,” for, in those
December weeks the thermometer on
the Lower Murray, and all about
Riverina, does some tall climbing ; so
Mr. J. L. Phelps and ourself ac-
cepted the Captain’s invite to a little
brandy pawnee in the cabin of this
paddle-wheeled novelty. What a flood
of ideas poured through our brain as
we watched the river bank and saw it
covered with the clean, white, and
newly-tumbled-out-from-the-hold bags
of Adelaide flour, boxes of sperm can-
dles, crystal sugar, and the distilled
waters of Martell and Hennessy, all
fresh and neat from the Adelaide
stores —no dirty dray dust nor mud
about these, no breakage nor damage ;
and the whole cargo in such liberal
quantities as no wretched vehicle de-
pendent on axle-trees, yokes, and soft
black plain soil, could ever hope to
deliver ; and then, again, the wool, so
long stored and despaired of as a realiz-
able asset, here was its outlet brought
to view. No more short rations, no
more leather patching, no more inter-
est accruing upon unavailable bales
of wool ; the reign of terror was all
over ! Captain Cadell and Sir Henry
Young had arrived in the pioneer
steamer of the Murray, the wilderness
awoke to life and to wealth—Riverina
stations were no longer a drug in the
colonial market, and one great corner-
stone in the development and wealth
of New South Wales was firmly placed
in situ by the first successful navi-
gation of the Murray, a matter
whose present extent of operation ren-
ders this, its maiden effort, worthy of
record, in our opinion, in this journal,
by the pen of an eye-witness thereof.
N. B.
A GOSSIP WITH THE BOYS.
All of you have by this time, we
suppose, settled well down into good
steady running for the 1878 stakes.
The holidays are all over and done.
How were they spent ? Are they ex-
erting an influence over you now ?
For remember that a holiday is some-
thing more than a mere relaxation of
the past toil. It should be a prepara-
tive for future toil. Holidays should
not merely refresh but strengthen.
What does the word mean ? A holy
day. What does holy mean, outside
of any religious signification you may
choose to tack on to it ? Does it not
mean “ healthy,” “ full of haleness ? ”
You know very well that it does. And
the true use of the thing, the season
holiday is thus shadowed forth pretty
distinctly by its strict etymological
meaning. Holidays should be days
consecrated to health-giving pursuits.
The statesman, weary with weight of
responsibility and anxiety, finds in sim-
ple rest his best health-giving, health-
keeping days. He can yearn with
Horace of old.
“ Nunc somno et inertibus horis
Ducere solicitor jucunda oblivia vitos .”
The literary hack, grinding under
the burden of ungenial taskwork, may,
perhaps, sigh for a holiday in which
skittles and beer shall not be wanting.
On the other hand, the mechanic,
wearied with manual labour, longs for
a quiet holiday, on which to enjoy a
hard day’s reading.
To bring into full natural play all
the muscles of the frame, is the aim
of the true trainer. Now the man or
lad who uses his holidays on the prin-
ciple of trying to preserve the equi-
librium which should exist between
his moral and physical nature, will be
applying them to the best purpose.


You should, therefore, have a pur-
pose in all your holiday-making. Just
as you set apart this whole, or that
half-holiday for a boating excursion, a
cricket match, or what not, so should
you set apart your longer vacations
for the performance of some definite
task. Don’t be frightened by that
word task. We don’t mean an impo-
sition, or a hundred lines or so to
prepare ; we mean nothing more than
this, that before any of the longer
vacations commence you should have
fully made up your minds what (the cir-
cumstances of your position being well
considered) you intend to do in them.
During school-time you will have had
enough of school work—enough of
grammar and mathematics, and all
that style of work ; and, unless we
are much mistaken, you will have had
a very fair share of play—that is, of
cricket, football, and all that style of
play. What, therefore, remains ?
Well, we think this, that you lads
might do much good for yourselves
by devoting no small proportion of
your holidays to the study of
Nature. Now, we don’t want you to
take this advice as referring to the
scientific study of Nature, to going
about with hammers as precocious
geologists, or with pins and fly-
catchers as priggish entomologists.
Not a bit of it, but that you
should learn to know your country, its
physical configuration, its forest beauty,
its sea-girt coasts, your actual land, in
fact, as thoughtful boys, with eyes that
can really see, may easily learn to
know it, and to love it, too. In the
school days whether in or out of
school, whether in the class-room or
in the play-ground—you are impinged
upon at all points by this red-hot
civilization of ours, which is so
great and grand—but, oh ! so cruel !
In holiday times get away from her—
go angling, go hunting, climb all the
hills within twenty miles of you, go
to Nature ; or else, the fable of
Antaeus will repeat itself ; and you,
another wrestler like him of Libya,
will be lifted from your mother earth,
man’s best refresher, and strangled in
the barren upper air of that cruel
civilization which exacts so much and
confers so little.
If, during the holidays, you satu-
rated your minds with the lore of
wood and field, hill, river, and sea-
dashed cliff, not acquired from book,
but by actual observation, how ready
would you be for the scientific teach-
ing to which it is now the fashion to
subject youngsters in the class-room !
How you would almost come to enjoy
the lecture which systematised your
out door experience and gave you rea-
sons in answer to the many won-
dering whys and wherefores which had
pleasantly perplexed you in your holi-
day rambles. Much might be done in
the way of extending the knowledge
of the natural history of any district
by the lads residing in it during their
summer holiday. And we cannot help
thinking that heads of educational
establishments might yearly offer prizes
for the best collection of specimens in
any branch of natural history made
by boys during their vacation. The
scientific arrangement could be done
in school-hours, the prize being offered
for the bond fide collecting of speci-
mens in some partiqulfir branch of
natural history, to be named before
commencing operations by the intend-
ing competitor. If your fond mammas
should object to our notion, on the
score that, if carried out, it will lead to
dead iguanas in the drawing-room,
snakes in the library, and an omnium
gatherum of beetles and coleoptera in
every bedroom of the house, tell them
that we can only say that even that—
ay ! all that—might not possibly be so
bad in its results on their boys’ futures
as holidays spent in the streets of the
towns and in the pursuit of purpose-
less amusements (as too many modern
amusements are), which neither give
tone to the mind nor elasticity to the
body—the mere amusements pour
passer le temps. No! no! “From
the dry dust of weary life, lave it clean
with Nature’s baptism. ”
Advice to Parties who Dye their
Hair. —Keep it dark !


THE WAR NEWS.
We repeat the remark which we wrote in
our second issue—“ the war as between
Russia and Turkey may be said to be
over.” If peace is not secured by the
promised conference, the renewal of hos-
tilities will be on a great and terrible
scale, with England and Austria engaged
in them, if not Italy, France, and Ger-
many. The fighting news of the past
few days may be thus summarised : Since
the evacuation of Adrianople by the Turks
the Russian hosts have been moved south-
ward upon two points—Gallipoli and
Constantinople. Sulieman Pasha sought
to check the Russian advance upon the
former point by interposing his corps d ’
armee between the mouths of the Maritzka
and the western waters of the sea of Mar-
mora. Being, however, recalled to defend
the capital, he left the extreme portion of
European Turkey at the mercy of the in-
vader. As Gallipoli is the key to the
Dardanelles, and as England was evidently
jealous lest Russia in securing that city
should be in a position to dictate terms to
Turkey without reference to the views
held by the States co-signatory to the
Treaty of Paris, Admiral Hornby was or-
dered to defend it, and he would have
done so had not his orders been counter-
manded, on its being learned that Russia
would regard the Straits question as a
European one. Though consenting to do
this Russia kept on advancing. By the
31st of last month her troops occupied
Rodosto (on the shores of the sea of Mar-
mora) , and Schatal Burgas—an important
position on the western slope of the Little
Balkans, some eighty miles west of Con-
stantinople. Her head quarters by the
same date had been removed to Adriano-
ple. It was evidently her intention to
endeavour to force her way upon Constan-
tinople. But immediately to the west of
Constantinople nature has designed what
has been called “ the most splendid defen-
sive position in the world,” thus des-
cribed by an eminent military authority:—
Two ranges of natural heights, one about twenty-
five miles west of the city, the other about nine
miles nearer—the outer or more distant called
Buyuk (or great) Chekmedje, the nearer, Kuchuk
(or little) Chekmedje—run nearly from sea to
sea, looking towards the west. On the south, the
backwater of Buyuk Chekmedjd, extending about
four miles inland, and the Kara-Sou river ruuning
into the head of it, together with the small river
of Kara-Burun on the north, still further narrow
the width to be defended down to about thirteen
'miles of front. Swamps and low ground still
further facilitate the defence. Two lines of re-
doubts, thrown up to occupy the crests of these
natural positions, and armed with the heavy
artillery of this day, would sweep the whole front;
while a fleet of ironclads, divided on both flan as
and crossing their fire with the redoubts, would
make approach all but impossible.
The position of Russia, hovering like a
hawk above Constantinople, warned Eu-
rope that the day of decision was come.
Now or never was the hour for interpo-
sition. Turkey was completely at bay.
Greece had declared war, and Hobart
Pasha’s fleet, so urgently needed to de-
fend the Capital, had to be sent to the
Piraeus to overawe Athens. Macedonia
and Thessaly were in revolt. Crete also
was in insurrection. Servia was waging
war successfully against her suzerain all
along her frontiers. Bulgaria was com-
pletely lost, Silistria and Rustchuk having
been evacuated by the Turks early this
month. It is easy to understand why, in
such evil case, Turkey was anxious to
treat for peace, and why Russia was equally
anxious to interpose delay. European
feeling seems to have been too strong for
Russia, and the balance of telegraphic
intelligence is in favour of the belief that
an armistice was signed on the 3rd or 4th
instant, and that actual hostilities have
been suspended, Greece even having been
persuaded to hold her hand for a time.
So much for the fighting news. Now
for the diplomatic : The terms proposed
by Russia (of her own part, though it is
thought with the sanction of Germany—
who, by the way, was not one of the co-
signatory Powers to the Treaty of Paris),
are hard, but as we think, just. They
are the independence of Servia and Rou-
mania; the cession of Roumanian Bessa-
rabia to Russia; the territorial enlarge-
ment of Montenegro; Russia to hold
Batoum, Kars, Ezeroum ; Turkey to pay
an indemnity of fifty millions sterling;
Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina to be
autonomised ; the Dardanelles to be open
to Russia; Russian troops, for honour’s
sake, to parade at Stamboul. England
and Austria, however, not consenting that
Russia should make what Sir John Robert-
son would call a “ one-horse peace ” have
insisted upon the meeting of a Conference
to consider the whole Eastern Question
once again. Russia has sullenly acquiesced,
and the next news will probably be of the
meeting of envoys extraordinary at Vienna,
Brussels, or Lausanne. In England the war
feeling runs high on the Conservative
side of the House of Commons. The
Liberals are for neutrality. Lord


Beaconsfield called down the cheers of the
Lords when he declared on the 27th ult.
that he would not permit British action to
be dependent upon the will of any
foreign Government. He has asked the
Commons by his Chancellor of the
Exchequer for a war vote of six millions,
but the result of the debate has not yet
come to hand. Lord Carnarvon’s
resignation of the seals of the Colonial
Office was not caused by any difference of
opinion on the war question, while Lord
Derby’s resignation of those of the
Foreign Office has been provisionally
withdrawn. The issue of the question is
now really in the hands of England,
Austria, and Italy—as Germany and
France have quite other business to
attend to.
FUSILIER.
WOMAN
(An ingenious specimen of Cross Reading.)
Happy a man may pass his life
If freed from matrimonial chains ;
If he’s directed by a wife
He’s sure to suffer for his pains.
What tongue is able to unfold
The falsehoods that in woman dwell—
Virtues in women to behold
Are almost imperceptible.
Adam could find no solid peace
When Eve was given for a mate ;
Till he beheld a woman’s face,
Adam was in a happy state.
For in the sex you’ll see appear
Hypocrisy, deceit, and pride ;
Truth, darling of a heart sincere,
In woman never can reside.
Destruction take the men, I say,
Who make a woman their delight:
Who no regard to woman pay,
Keep reason always in their sight.
Many persons, ladies especially, are so
perverse that they read the first and third

TOWN GOSSIP.
Parliament during the last few days
has been on its good behaviour—dull,
but decorous. The Morris question
has turned up again, the great McEl-
hone, ever the friend of the oppressed,
having taken Mr. Morris’s part and
sought to impress the Commons with
the notions that the Executive Com-
missioner at Paris needn’t know
French, and that the very fact of his
having been snubbed by the aristo-
cratic element was the very reason
why the Government should see to his
getting fair play. Mr. Driver was for
exporting a native Australian to Paris,
to give ocular and auricular proof to
Europe that we were a people that
paid attention to the humanities, and
were quite capable of breeding our own
French scholars. Neither were friends
of Mr. Sedgwick Cowper wanting to
point out how kindly Nature had emi-
nently endowed that gentleman with
all the qualities that go to form an
Executive Commissioner. Some hinted
at Mr. Mitchell, ’Tis strange how all
questions are discussed as affecting
personal interests. Mr. Combes
brought up the Railway question, and
abused Mr. Sutherland for standing
by Mr. Vernon and ignoring the evi-
dence of Mr. Whitton. Mr. Driver
denounced Lieut.-Col. Richardson in
terms which, in duelling days might
have led to coffee and pistols ; while
that gallant and lucky gentleman was
defended by his backers in terms as
laudatory as those of Mr. Driver were
contemptuous. Why cannot hon.
members speak to the question before
them on its merits ?
The Government intend commencing
the long promised Parliament Houses.
Wouldn’t it be as well to call for fresh
competitive designs, in order to secure
the best available talent and a building
suitable to the actual requirements of
the day. State architecture in Sydney
just at present is a trifle too mono-
tonous in style, Mr. Barnett’s concep-
tions being a trifle too toujours perdrix.
The Italian sailors are fluttering the
dovecotes. Mr. Holt is very angry
that the Cristofero Colombo got into


the harbour “ all unbeknown like.”
We think he has reason for his wrath.
What is the commodore’s duty ? Are
the Wolverine and her sister cruisers
here for ornament or not ?If not , the

vantage.
Speaking of the weather, one remi-

There are two unclaimed telegrams
at Weston’s offices, one commencing
“merciful renewing Bannian,” the
other, “ delay Patriot 100 Bills.” We
imagine there is some connection be-
tween the two. One asks for renewal,
the other for delay. But what a glut-
ton ! a hundred bills ? Merciful, in-
deed, is at times the renewing of one ;
but fancy a fellow asking for delay for
the holding over of a hundred, and
calling himself a patriot, too !
It must have been refreshing, espe-

the general indications of heavy wet.
The frogs are now in the height of
their enjoyment—the recess is over
and the session has commenced, as is
evident by the large assemblage of
these amphibious creatures, and the
animated tone which characterizes
their debates. If “ Froggy would a
wooing go,” he could not have a better
opportunity than the present. An
adventurous frog, starting from the
Liverpool Road, might sail down to
Five Dock, through the Ashfield new
cut, without let or hindrance —passing
whole colonies of his countrymen in
the lowlying lands on either side.
WANTED a Potter. To a good thrower a
liberal wage. Also three good boys as
above.
Above what—above the potter ? That
would be a subversion of the rule
seniores priores, little boys last. Or
are the three boys expected to throw
above the senior workman, and thus
stimulate him to increased exertion.
Or is virtue to be its own reward, and
boys only are invited who are above
the “ liberal wage ” offered to the
adult thrower. If so, they will be
good boys indeed, though it is doubt-
ful how long they will remain so if
they are asked to potter about the
place in this indefinite way.
If, as we are told by sages, truth
is to be found in the bottom of a well,
the question at issue between Mr.
Burton Bradley and the Mayor of
Manly will be easily solved. That a
public pump has been sunk in the
market place at Manly, on a triangular
piece of ground surrounded by closets
and flanked by a slaughter-house, is
admitted ; and we think the public
are indebted to Mr. Bradley for the
public spirit which prompts him to
call attention to any violation of sani-
tary laws. Mr. Rowe, in our opinion,
has no reason to feel aggrieved, as his
explanation will no doubt be consi-
dered satisfactory. The well in ques-
tion is to be reserved for the use of
the Fire Brigade. The water is not
to be drunk on the premises, and
householders on the flat are to provide
themselves at the trifling outlay of £4
each with generally brackish water by
means of an Abyssinian pump.
A correspondent attempts to be
facetious at our expense, by inquiring
the size of a lump of chalk ? In
reply we would say, the size of an
ordinary missile, the term being used
in much the same way as a man’s brain
might be spoken of—that is to say, if
he possesses any, which is not always
clear. The same writer, whose signa-
ture it is impossible to decipher, says
that although he is “willing to encour-
age literature in any form,” he
declines to pay in advance. Like a
good many others, he is very willing
to take all the credit he can get, but
not to give any. We don’t care very
much about this kind of encourage-
ment. The agents will, however,
be able to meet his views, and will
afford him —at 6d. per copy, cash—as
many opportunities as he may desire
of finding solutions to other puzzling
questions.
A match of a novel and interesting
character is, we are informed, to come
off at Ashfield, on Monday and Tues-


day next. The competitors are Messrs.
Sivier and Lucas, and the prize (£10)
is to be given to the one who turns
out the largest number of bricks in
ten hours. The bricks are to be made
by hand, and the match is to be played
—or rather worked—on the premises
of Mr. C. Anderson, builder. N.B.—
No bric-a-brac work to be admitted,
and no straw allowed. When the
bricks are laid, top-feeding will com-
mence.
Professor Hamilton’s lecture at the
Temperance Hall, on Monday night,
must have been worth listening to. In
the course of his review of the various
crises which have occurred in this
colony and in Victoria, he expressed
his opinion “ that the present action
of Mr. Graham Berry, astonishing
though it was in its effect, is far pre-
ferable to the offensive sluggishness
heretofore characterising the proceed-
ings of legislators in New South
Wales.’, We are not disposed to
quarrel with the Professor for this
pertinent remark. Mr. Berry has done
something—good, bad, or indifferent.
What have our statesmen done during
the last ten years, in the direction oi
public health, railway extension, edu-
cation, electoral amendment, water
supply, sewage disposal, or any of the
important questions which have been
so persistently urged upon their notice
by the Press of this colony. It is high
time that the Legislative Assembly
should awake from their lethargy and
set themselves steadily to work up the
arrears which have been so long accu-
mulating.
A young lady, of sweet sixteen,

MODERN SPIRITUALISM.
In the investigation of any pheno-
mena, be they ordinary or extraordi-
nary, which appeal to the senses, the
method to be pursued should be a
strictly scientific one. The inquirer
should divest his mind of all precon-
ceived notions, lay aside all prejudices,
and approach his subject equally pre-
pared to discover either that there is
nothing new under the sun, or that
there are more things in heaven and
earth than have hitherto been dreamt
of in his philosophy. Until this state
of mind shall have been attained, it is
useless to expect that any great re-
sults will be achieved by inquirers into
any class of phenomena, but particu-
larly those which do not fall within
the pale of what are usually recognised
as scientific. The result of investi-
gations conducted according to a pre-
conceived belief, however satisfactory
they may be to the individual in
strengthening or nullifying his former
impressions, will be valueless to the
world in general, as no reliable data
will be elicited from which a theory
can be constructed—or in other words,
as the inductive method of reasoning
cannot be applied. What is required
is, a calm, thorough, and exhaustive
course of observation and experiment.
When certain phenomena have been
demonstrated to possess an objective
reality; when occurrences, however
marvellous to the uninitiated, have been
proved to take place with unvarying
regularity, and in accordance with
fixed rules ; when, in short, a chain of
causation has been established, then
we may venture to form a theory to


account for the many and varied effects
of which we have been witness. It
was in this way that the most exalted
discoveries the world has known have
been made. Newton, with gravitation;
Galvani, with the science that bears
his name ; Harvey, with the circula-
tion of the blood ; and, in fact, all our
truly great men have proved this to be
the one and only way to interrogate
Nature with any chance of success.
If it be admitted, then, that the in-
ductive method in philosophy is the
only satisfactory one, we would ask—
Has it been followed by investigators
into the so-called manifestations of
Modern Spiritualism ? To this ques-
tion we are afraid that a negative
reply must be returned. As a general
rule, what do we find to be the atti-
tude of persons who profess to inquire
into this subject ? Strange to say,
they are usually those most unfitted
for the task. They are destitute of
any scientific training ; are incapable
of distinguishing between the observa-
tion and the cause of phenomena ; and
are so deeply imbued with a belief in
the genuineness, or a conviction of
the falsity, of the very thing they are
going to investigate, that, after all
their labour, they become either vio-
lent partisans or absolute sceptics.
When a spirit medium, for instance,
visits a large city, the inhabitants,
like the Athenians of old—ever willing
to run after any new thing, flock in
crowds to see or hear marvels, which,
though in reality less than those which
surround them in every-day life, yet,
from their novelty, act with the attrac-
tive power of magnets, and draw all
within their influence into the magic
circle. And so the wonder spreads,
aided by numbers who believe in they
know not what, who presume to com-
prehend —perhaps, in a single night—
that which, if true, is one of the
most mysterious philosophies ever in-
vestigated by man, and one which has
taxed the powers of the highest intel-
lects to fathom —we mean intercourse
with the spirit world. To all sober-
minded individuals, such a course of
action is eminently distasteful; it in-
spires them with distrust, not only of
the would-be inquirers, but even of
the subject of their inquiry. Imagine
what the result would be were such a
course applied in any branch of science
—electricity, for instance. Instead of
the progress now visible, there would
be nothing but retrogression; that
which is already known would rapidly
become lost, and we should be pre-
sented with the lamentable spectacle
of a general decline of knowledge—
not only in this subject, but in all
others. Who can wonder, then, that
Spiritualism holds the uncertain posi-
tion that it does at present ? Its advo-
cates stoutly resist any inquiries into
its merits conducted in a scientific
spirit, and demand implicit belief as a
sine qua non before attempting to re-
solve its mysteries.
It appears to the writer, that the
importance of this subject—that is to
say, that intercourse with the spirits
of the departed, which the term is
supposed to denote—has been greatly
underrated, even by its most ardent
devotees. If such a thing is possible
—if such a truly wonderful occur-
rence as communication with a spirit,
which has become separated from its
attendant body, is an actual fact, then
the whole course of modern thought
and speculation must be reversed;
the apparently stable fabric which
science has been slowly erecting must
be overturned, and mankind will find
itself face to face with a problem
hitherto considered insoluble—to be
a matter of faith rather than reason- •
viz., the immortality of the soul.
What will, then, avail the reasonings
of a Tyndall, a Darwin, or a Huxley ?
These mighty men will lift up their
voices in vain against a fact—the stu-
pendous nature of which will eclipse
all other things under the sun. We
say this will be the case if the exist-
ence of a spirit world is demonstrated,
absolutely and certainly ; but, alas !
however such a consummation is to be
desired, we are as far off from it as
ever. From the earliest ages all appa-
rently inexplicable phenomena have
been referred to the agency of spirits;


but, through the gradual march of
science, these fancies have vanished
one by one, till now the whole current
of modern thought tends to show that
the supernatural has no existence.
In the consideration of Modern
Spiritualism, we must first inquire,
what intercourse with spirits really
is ? and this is no easy matter to de-
termine. The effects of drugs on the
human brain are well known, and
nearly all the “spiritual” expe-
riences, with which we are personally
conversant, may be referred to this
cause. Take, for instance, the action
of opium. In De Quincy’s “ Confes-
sions of an Opium Eater,” we read :
—“At last, with that, all was lost—
female forms, and the features that
were all the world to me, and clasped
hands, and heart-breaking partings;
and, then, everlasting farewells, and
with a sigh—such as the caves of hell
sighed when the incestuous mother
uttered the abhorred name of death—
the sound was reverberated—everlast-
ing farewells ! Whatever things capa-
ble of being visually represented, I
did but think of in the darkness, imme-
diately shaped themselves into phan-
toms of the eye ; and by a process
no less inevitable, when thus traced in
faint and visionary colours, they were
drawn out by the fierce chemistry of
my dreams with insufferable splendour
that fettered my heart.”
Again, the action of alcohol is the
same as that of opium, but in a lesser
degree—witness the terrible state of a
man suffering from delirium tremens.
The gas known as nitrous oxide, when
inhaled, also gives rise to the fancied
perception of spirits, as well as to
wild and incoherent actions, varying
with the peculiar idiosyncrasy of the
person experimented on. The action
of various poisons, such as aconite,
belladonna, &c., are all of a similar
nature ; but, not to multiply exam-
ples, the question suggested by all
these cases is—Has a man, under the
influence of one of these 'physical
agents, received the power of appre-
ciating spiritual things; or has the
physical influence of the drug given
rise to an automatic action of the
brain, by which, through the operation
of certain organs, the mind has be-
come impressed by unreal and unsub-
stantial visions of a purely subjective
nature ? We think that the latter
alternative will be generally accepted,
for it is plain, rational, and compre-
hensible ; the former, on the contrary,
is unsupported by experience, and
altogether visionary.
The great fact, then, to be deduced
from the observation of the action of
drugs on the brain, is the automatism
of that organ—that is, its capability of
action without the cantrolling influ-
ence of the mind. This is a subject
which has long engaged the attention
of scientists, and under the name of
unconscious cerebration, it has been
treated of in a more or less exhaustive
manner by various writers. But in
all these productions it appears to us
that the brain and the mind have been
regarded to a great extent as one and
the same —the fact being overlooked
that the brain is merely the organ of
the mind, just as the eye is of sight,
and the ear of hearing. What we
wish to affirm is, that the brain, be-
sides being operated on by the mind,
is also sensitive to extraneous influ-
ences— that just as any irritation
applied to the retina of the eye,
whether it be a blow of the hand, or
the flash of a cannon, produces a sen-
sation of light, and nothing but light,
so any irritant acting upon one of the
organs of the brain excites it to fulfil
its own peculiar function, and that
alone ; and the only difference between
the effect produced by.the stimulus of
the mind and that of any other agent
is that, in the former case, the mind
is conscious of it; in the latter, it is
not necessarily so. We may, in fact,
regard the brain as the bond of union
and communication between mind and
matter. On the one hand, mind acts
through the brain on matter ; while,
on the other, matter acts through that
organ on mind.
Now, in the cases we have men-
tioned, the individuals, during the
period of cerebral excitation, have been


as certain that they were communi-
cating with spirits as those believers
are who preside at a modern seance.
But in the one case, knowing the
cause of the phenomena, believers in
the supernatural pronounce them to
be illusory. They, with singular in-
consistency, when ignorant of the
cause, admit with the greatest readi-
ness anything whatever which appears
to coincide with their favourite theory.
For this reason we are justified in
saying that it is difficult to determine
what a belief in Spiritualism really
implies. It may mean the belief in
the reality of certain phenomena, or
in a certain theory which professes to
account for them, or a belief in both
the reality of the phenomena and the
truth of the theory. It is this latter
which, we suppose, prevails generally
amongst the most ardent Spiritualists.
Some there are who admit the pheno-
mena, but deny the inference deduced
from them ; and others who regard
Spiritualism more in the light of a
new religion than anything else.
After a careful study and examina-
tion of the evidence in favour of many
of the phenomena produced in the
presence of mediums, we are prepared
to admit that many of the minor
effects have actually taken place. By
minor effects we mean, the turning of
tables by some unknown force when
persons are seated round them, rap-
pings, and even movement of objects
without contact. Beyond these we
are of opinion that nothing but impos-
ture and charlatanry prevail. The
stories of the materialization of spirit
forms, the transportation of mediums
through the air from place to place,
&c., are so utterly unsubstantiated by
trustworthy evidence, that they may
be dismissed as beyond the purposes
of the present inquiry.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
Zamia. —Your prose contribution is
“rather of the ratherest.” The
idea (hackneyed to death by many
generations of sentimental scribes) is
good, but your treatment of it is far
too insipid. Did you never hear of
Vivian Grey’s receipt for mulling
Moselle ? Your lines are not poetry.
How can you imagine the earnest
minded ‘ £ reader ” recommending for
“copy ” such a stanza as—
“ Pill and bolus and nauseous dose,
These were my fare for many a day;
Who watched beside me so firm and close,
Driving my horrible dreams away ? ”
V. —In our next.
E. M. S. —We would rather have a
prose composition —if not too prosy.
A Regular Subscriber. —We are flat-
tered by your notice of our magazine,
and gladly avail ourselves of your
offer to obtain fresh subscribers.
T. D. —Declined with thanks.
Liryc. —Your verses are not of that
kind of poetry (if indeed they can
be classed as poetical) which fairies
would sing under any conceivable
circumstances. Fairies, who love
bright fancies and happy thoughts,
would surely never join hands in
frolic circle to carol forth such a
wooden chorus as—
“ For ’tis then we delight
To dance and sing
Where the rills ring
For each fairy and sprite.”
Student. —The line is in Clough’s
“ Spectator ab Extra.” The stanza
in which it occurs reads—
“jThere’s something undoubtedly in a fine air,
To know how to smile, and be able to stare ;
High breeding is something, but well bred or
not,
In the end the one question is, What have
you got ?
So needful it is to have money, heigho !
So needful it is to have money.”
Kappa. Yes, the following lines
(which with some difficulty we have
made out from the hieroglyphical
scrawl you sent us) will pass muster
as capped verses :
Lo ? the poor Indian whose untu-
tor’d mind, (Pope).
Drops the light drip of the sus-
pended oar, (Byron).
Remote, unfriended, melancholy,
slow, (Goldsmith).
We ne’er shall see him more,

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
“ Sydney Once a Week.” — It is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter, which
consists of short original papers, written
in a light free style, and of a few extracts
from other publications. Its purpose is
to give its readers “ a good sixpenny worth
of literary pabulum, composed of ingre-
dients at once sparkling, amusing, and
original, and so arranged as to avoid a
suspicion of dulness.” Taken as a whole,
the magazine, which is edited by Mr. C.
H. Barlee, is a very creditable produc-
tion, as well to the publishers as to the
authors, and if conducted according to the
plan indicated in the few words above
quoted, it will be an acceptable addition
to our colonial literature.— S. M. Herald.
The Echo says:—lt is a very read-
able publication, and, while it cannot
aspire to rank as the equal of the
most popular English magazines, it de-
serves to find favour on account of the
local interest which attaches to its papers.
The original papers, of which there are
several, are written in a light, easy style,
and with considerable ability. We should
like to see the magazine prove to be a
success, for the desirableness of building
up a respectable colonial literature will
hardly be denied by any one, and the
establishment of a good magazine is one
of the means towards that end. The
publishers, Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and
Co., are entitled to commendation for the
admirable way in which they have got up
the magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Country
Readers is the title of anew weekly, edited
by Mr.C. H. Barlee,issuedfromthe Sydney
Press,' which bids fair to secure a good
share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleasing
manner in which the various topics of the
day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house and an
agreeable companion to every reader.—
Southern Argus , (Goulburn.)
“ Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its
appearance in our city. It is edited
by Mr. Barlee, formerly a member of
the literary staff of the Melbourne Argus ,
and a humourist of some note. The
work contains sketches, tales, and articles,
along with the usual miscellanea of a
magazine. Judging by the contents of
the first number, we think the maga-
zine stands a better chance of succeeding
than many of those publications which
are born but to die, and which in some
cases are disgraceful to the literary efforts
of our city. —Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says:—The num-
ber is very readable, is well printed by
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Go., and
contains a varied selection of original
and extract matter. We wish the
proprietor every success with his ven-
ture, and trust that his efforts will do
something more substantial to encourage
a taste for colonial literature than those
of others who have trodden in the same
uncertain path, have succeeded in doing.
We hail with pleasure all respectable
efforts to establish a republic of letters
in this colony, which at present is too
much confined in its patronage to
newspaper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s
venture is the best effort in this direction
that we have seen for some time. — Single-
ton Argus.
“ Once a Week.”— Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we under-
stand, assisted by a numerous staff of able
contributors. The contents of this new
publication are varied and interesting—
too varied, in our opinion, for the space
at the disposal of the editor. If we may
be permitted to offer a suggestion with
regard to the future, we would recommend
that everything in the shape of “news”
items should be omitted. We heartily
wish the proprietors success in their
undertaking, and certainly are of opinion
that the excellence of “ Once a Week”
well deserves it. — Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes
of every class of readers are consulted.
Thus we have a trenchant article, short
and pithy, on the political status in quo ,
a couple of spirited domestic sketches,
some comic matter, and some chapters
especially intended for boys. Among the
last is a scholarly commentary on a
passage from the “ Paradise Lost,” —
intended for the use of University candi-
dates—a clever set of recurrent verses in
Latin, and an enigma in French. The


grams and sphinx-like puzzles which
usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend
the production to parents. We hope the
new organ will enjoy a longer term
of existence than some of its pre-
decessors.—Namoi Independent.
This serial contains well written papers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing,” “ Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary of
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether
Once a Week promises well; and without
country readers (who will probably
support it best), the 170,000 residents of
Sydney should keep it going—but we
doubt :it. The price is 6d., and the
publishing office 279 George-street,
Sydney. Molong Express.
Once a Week. —This is the title of anew
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as enter-
tained, with the writings ; there is such a
versatility about them that all must be
pleased. It is notified that a summary
of the events of the present war will be
given for the accommodation of its
readers, and so do away with the tedious
task of perusing the complications daily
appearing in our metropolitan journals.
Among numerous articles, in various
strains, there is a very humorous writing,
entitled “ My Balloon Adventure ; ” but
to our fancy, the most amusing is one
called “The best dog in the colony.”
There is a very good article, termed
“Et cetera,” which gives an abstract of
the events of the week. In next issue a
story will be commenced, under the im-
pressive heading of “ The Mystery of the
Wiseman’s Ferry Road.” It is a useful,
handy, little book, and well worth
patronage. The price is sixpence.— The
Australian.
The Tenterfield Star says :—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of
affording to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers.— Grenfell Record.
The Moruya Examiner says :—We have
looked the book carefully through and
can confidently recommend it to our
readers and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good
style, and well printed, containing
twenty-four demy octavo pages.— Albury
Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining: it is deserving of a
good circulation.— Border Post (Albury.)
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgee).
The Bathurst Free Press says :—lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting
reading matter—grave, gay, ponderous,
and light. The editorship is evidently in
good hands, and if the editor’s hopes are
realized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces. ’
For he makes his bold assertion : “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once a
Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “ Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. —Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up, and judging
from the matter which this number
(No. 1) contains, it is a magazine that
will no doubt receive a large measure of
support among Australian readers.—
Western Examiner (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes :—“ The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got-up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
local. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches—we
note specially ‘ ‘ The Best Dog in the
Colony ” and “ My Balloon Adventure,”—
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip ; and an
epitome of the week’s war news Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
The verses in the first number, entitled
“ An Australian Idyll ” are very far above
the average of contributions to the “ poets’
corner. ” It is an affecting story, well told.
After the custom of English magazine
conductors, the proprietors of Sydney
Once a Week offer prizes to successful
competitors in the riddle arena. In the
second number appeared the prologue of
a story called “ The Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry,” which is to be th q piece de resistance
inthe wayof serial romance. Once a Week,
which is edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, a
litterateur of lengthened colonial experi-
ence, and published by Messrs. Gibbs,
Shallard. and Co., we can conscientiously
recommend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
Those who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves We are certain they will
endorse our opinion. —Cumberland Mer-
cury.
