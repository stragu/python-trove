AUSTRALIANS AND THEIR
WINES
Notwithstadding what Mr. An-
thony Trollope was pleased to
call the “blowing” propensities of
Australians, they do not possess
any real belief in themselves. That
a thing is American is regarded as
actual proof by the American that
it is infinitely sup rior to anything
any other land can turn out: while
in any of the Australian colonies,
as we all of us have disheartening
evidence, to say that such or such
an article is colonial is, in nine
cases out of ten, to place a stigma
on it, to denounce it as inferior. It
is quite possible that the American
War of Independence and its re-
sults did much towards dowering
the Yankee with that superb belief
iu himself which, though at times
it may arouse our laughter, is, for
all that, a quality of tangible com-


mercial value. It is also probable
that few Australians would care to
“ cut the painter,” if it were only
by such a course that a more indi-
vidualised nationality could be
secured. Be that as it may, it is
extremely discouraging to the local
producer to find that in the average
colonial mind there is an unreason-
able antipathy to the colonial-made
article. This antipathy especially
affects the colonial wine market,
though we are bound to admit that
there are signs to be seen of its
abatement. A taste for Australian
wines is gradually growing in Aus-
tralia, but with nothing like that
stride which we should like to see
made. Why should it ever be with
regard to race settling nights, to
occasions of regatta prize distribu-
tions, or to intercolonial cricket
match luncheons, that the news-
paper reader, glancing at the re-
port of such festive meetings, in-
variably comes across an allusion
to “ sparkling Champagne,” or
“fiz,” or “Moet” or “Boederer”?
Surely, on such occasions, prefer-
ence might be given to local vint-
ages. The publican’s bill might
not be so large were Dalwood sub-
stituted for Cliquot, but what of
that ? Are we all so “ shoddy ”as
to calculate hospitality by what it
costs in cash, and to put down the
host who offers a second-rate Mo-
selle at half a guinea a bottle, as a
better fellow than the one who in-
vites us to drink deep of a sound
Hermitage at thirty shillings the
dozen ? Let us have done with
such arrant snobbery. They who
prefer “fiz,” by all means let them
have it. We simply protest against
an absurd conventional rule, which
is not only based on a false con-
ception of hospitality, but which
is calculated to affect the Austra-
lian wine trade most injuriously.
How can Australians expect to
push their wines abroad, if at home
they just barely tolerate them?
This is a question which we con-
ceive deserves the thoughtful con-
sideration of every truehearted
Australian. The subject has its
ridiculous side. The contempt dis-
played by the colonial mind for
things colonial, leads to trickery on
the part of the local producer,
which, if not excusable, may fairly
enough, under the circumstances,
be condoned. Colonial-made wines
are palmed off as port over half
the counters in the city. ’Tis the
same with the beer. Men who
affect to sneer at “ swankey,”
drink it as “English” with con-
descending approbation. The ways
of the bottler are past finding out,
and who can fathom the infinite
ingenuity of the label maker ? ’Tis
a pity that clever men should be
driven into forgery by reason of the
population of a large colony deter-
mining to act up to the wretched
principle of the proverb which says,
“a prophet is without honour in
his own country.” We wish that


the Legislature would remove all
restrictions from the Australian
wine trade, and allow colonial wine
to be sold as bread or cheese or
other produce is sold, without let
or license. We are convinced that
if this freedom were granted to the
wine producer, the result would be
most beneficial, socially as well as
commercially, as on another occa-
sion we shall seek to prove more
particularly. Our object this week
will have been obtained if we have
turned attention to the very ques-
tionable Australian practice of un-
derrating the products of Austra-
lian industry.
THE REAL
[Lord Broughton, in his recollections of travel
relates how once, when on a visit to a continental,
convent, he met an aged monk, who told him
that for years he had haunted the picture gallery,
gazing upon the portraits until they had become
to him more than paintings; how at times, when
alone and sad (the companions of his youth
having all passed away), the fancy would steal
over him that it was the pictures which were the
realities, and he, and such as he, the shadows.]
Which are the shadows, I or they,
I or they in their frames of gold ?
Never a wrinkle proves them old;
And I, alas! am worn and gray.
Which are the real ? I tell to few
This thought which strikes me, as I sit,
That I am the phantom, as I flit
From frame to frame, and they the true!
Friends, companions, have all departed,
Strangers throng me, yet those still beam
With the self-same smile, until I seem
To be neither old nor weary-hearted.
How they haunt me, those mystic faces
Of loved ones gone to the silent land!
Gone the greeting of hand in hand,
And the heart’s glad throb in fond
embraces!
Yet oft at eve when I feel forsaken,
As yon oriel glows with living gules,
This voice my sadness overrules—
“ They are the real whom God hath
taken!” S.
SPORTING ADVENTURES
IN AUSTRALIA.
BY CHARLEY CORNSTALK.
( Continued.)
The young lady whom Jem Curtis
encountered so unexpectedly was the
daughter of a neighbouring squatter,
whose station was about twenty miles
from us, Miss Georgiana Grant, or, as
her admirers, and she had not a few,
were wont t© call her, the pretty G. G.
Rather below the middle height, but
perfectly proportioned, her dainty little
figure shewed off to advantage in her
close-fitting riding habit, while her
chestnut hair, worn after the fashion
of Australian girls au naturel, a
roguish pair of eyes, a saucy little
mouth, and a nose slightly retrousee
completed a very attractive picture, at
least so thought Jem, who took them
all in at a glance, and there and the n
fell desperately in love with their
owner.
As usual in such cases, he was
sheepish and awkward, while the
young lady was as cool and self-pos-
sessed as if she had just stepped out
of her father’s drawing-room.
“ Well, you see,” she said in reply
to Jem's enquiry as to the cause of
the accident to her pony, “Gyp stu-
pidly put her foot into a hole, and I
came down a cropper, and when I
mounted her again, I found she could
hardly put one foot before the other.
My brother Tom was with me, but he
has gone on ahead, and he’s hall-way
home by this time. What am I to
do?”
Jem protested that there was only
one thing she could do under the cir-
cumstances, and that was to come to
our station for the night; and as that
appeared to be the only thing to be
done, the pair proceeded, Jem leading
the pony, in that direction.
“But you might have been lost,”
said our hero, “ and it will be dark in
about an hour.”
“ No fear,” said Miss Georgie, giv-
ing him a glance from the tail of her


eye, which made him feel guilty of
having committed an impertinence,
* f what, with all these cattle tracks
running right straight down to your
place? If I had I should have been a
silly. It is evident that you have not
been long in the bush.’’
Jem confessed that he had only been
a few months in the country.
4t Oh, then you are the gentleman
living at Mr. Constable’s to get colo-
nial experience. What fun ! We had
a new chum at our place last year, and
one day I took him out for a walk and
lost him in a little bit of scrub, not
more than a mile-and-a-half from the
station. He didn’t find his way home
till ten o’clock at night, and then I
don’t believe he would have come back
only that pa sent a man after him, and
he answered his cooee; and would you
believe it, the stupid fellow had been
going round in a circle the whole time,
and wasn’t more than a hundred yards
from where I left him.”
The young lady then proceeded
very gravely to inform her companion
that although new chums might, and
commonly did, lose their heads on
such occasions, the natives of Austra-
lia were never at a loss to find their
way to a station.
* &.11 you have to do,” she said, “is
to go downhill. If you follow down
the smallest gully it will lead you to a
larger one; if you follow the larger one
it will take you to a creek, the creek
will take you to a river, and you can’t
go up or down any river within a hun-
dred miles of this but you will come
on to a station every now and then.”
Jem felt he was gaining colonial ex-
perience very pleasantly, and his shy-
ness wearing off a little, he ventured
to remark, “that although the down-
ward track might be the correct thing
in the antipodes, in the old country
young men who were continually going
downhill were not t nought much of.”
The ice being now broken, they chat-
ted away very pleasantly, with that
absence of reserve which is natural to
young prople, and before they came in
sight of the station buildings an inti-
macy had been established between
them which, under less favourable cir-
cumstances, it would have taken
months to bring about.
They had arranged all the details of
Miss Georgie’s return. She was to
ride Jem’s favorite horse, after he had
tried him with a s-ide-saddle and a
horse-cloth, in lieu of a habit; and a
stockman was to be sent in immedi-
ately to apprize Mr. Grant of his
daughter’s safety. Of course Jem was
to escort her.
This programme was carried out the
next lay, the young lady having been
handed over, in the interim, to the wife
of one of the stockmen (the only wo-
man on the station), who made her as
comfortable as circumstances would
admit of. Before she left us, which
was directly after breakfast, our fair
visitor had made a conquest of all
hearts by her gaiety and joyous spirits.
As for poor Jem, he was thoroughly
subjugated, and Miss Georgie ap-
peared to be fully aware of her power
over him, and to take it as a matter of
course. The little flirt took a mischie-
vous pleasure in treating him in all
respects as a new chum, and in quizzing
him on the subject of his hunting ex-
ploits. Just before starting, she in-
formed us that a grand gathering was
to take place at Yarrawa (Mr. Grant’s
station), when the annual kangaroo
drive was to come off, this institu-
tion being an absolute necessity, in
consequence of the damage to the run
caused by the increasing number of
marsupials. She made us both promise
to attend.
As this species of battue may be
novel to many of my readers, I will
skip over the intervening period, in
order to describe it in this chapter.
Advantage is taken of the natural
facilities which a run affords to force
a number of kangaroo in a direction
from which there is no outlet. In
this case the drive terminated in a
promontory or neck of land which
formed an elbow of the river. At the
extreme end a stockyard had been
constructed, the sides of which were


eight feet high, capped with strong
saplings hooped at either end, and
from this yard back for about three-
quarters of a mile a wing fence had
been run up forming a letter V, nar-
rowing towards the yard. The hunt-
ing party comprised, besides the
station hands, twenty-five young men
well mounted and all alive to the fun,
from surrounding stations, armed with
stockwhips with new silk lashes,
giving a report, to those who know how
to use them, almost like a pistol, and
about thirty blacks on foot with spears,
boomerangs, and waddies. The drive,
which was under the personal superin-
tendence of Mr. Grant, commenced
five miles back from the yard, so as to
take in a large area of scrub which
formed the great cover for the game
in the neighborhood. All the hunts-
men have to do is to range themselves
in a semicircle, and to crack their
whips, shout and holloa while they
beat the cover so as to send all game
before them, taking care, by adroit
horsemanship, to prevent the game
from breaking and regaining the
cover. No sport can well be more
exciting. At first the game appears
scarce. The kangaroo having wind of
the huntsmen, are off at top speed,
and it is only now and then that a
glimpse of the brown coats of the
flyers as they top the bushes is ob-
tained ; but as the circle contracts and
the mob of game are forced towards
the wing fence, the fun becomes fast
and furious. Droves of kangaroo and
wallaby show where a few minutes
before not a head was visible. The
space between the horsemen becomes
diminished, and the chances of break-
ing are reduced. Even the horses get
excited, and turn and wheel with a
willing alacrity they display at no
other time, while as for the blacks
they are like demons let loose—they
shout, they yell, and swear in the abo-
riginal language in tones which, with
the repeated crack of the stockwhip,
send the affrighted kaßgaroo on faster
and faster to their doom. Is there any
sport in the old country so intensely
sensational ? Now and then a rare
eight is seen wiiich alone repays the
visitor for the long journey he has
taken to be present at a kangaroo
drive. One of the smaller kangaroo,
yet a full-grown doe, such as bushmen
call “ a flyer/' who has probably
thrown her joey from her pouch when
pressed by the huntsmen, moved by
maternal instinct, suddenly checks her
speed, and not daring to face the ad-
vancing party of pursuers, wheels
round and clears the wing fence with a
bound which is the ne plus ultra of
spring and agility, and in another
minute appears but a spec in the
distance. At least fifteen out of
twenty of the mob are, however,
forced, under good management, to
the yard, and as the horsemen close
up they form a dense moving mass,
and the whipthongs fall on their backs
as they crowd into the trap, from
which they are never fated to escape.
Then up go the slip rails, and the
work of destruction commences.
Rifles are brought out, and the battue
takes place. The drive at Yarrawa,
on this occasion, resulted in the yard-
ing of one hundred and thirty-two
kangaroos and seventeen wallabies—
one hundred and forty-nine head all
told.
To Jem Curtis this was a day of
great enjoyment. Hunting on a scale
so grand he had never dreamt of, and
his pleasure was greatly enhanced by
the presence of his fair companion of
the previous day, whose attentions as
hostess were, however, so equally
divided among a number of beaux,
that the poor fellow's heart was racked
by a thousand conflicting emotions.
It was, however, somewhat consoled
by her scant notice of his endeavours
to attract her attention by the promise
she made, after a few minutes'
unmerciful quizzing, to give him a
lesson the next morning in cracking a
stockwhip, Jem's repeated attempts
having only resulted in a hopeless en-
tanglement of the lash round his
horse’s legs or his own shoulders.

THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 9.
The disposal of our sewage, as a
source of unhealthfulness, claims our
consideration to-day.
Some four or five thousand years
ago it was a law in Egypt, “ THOU
SHALT NOT POLLUTE THE
RIVER.” After the civilization of
those times, darkness overspread the
world ) and finding that the retention
of filth in their midst caused disease,
mankind, a wakening at length to the
necessity of doing something, con-
ceived the happy thought, each one
of throwing his filth upon his neigh-
bour down hill. The water was
appealed to as an auxiliary power,
and as the engineers found that
would run down hill, the arrange-
ment was soon made ; and every river
and nearly every stream in England
was made the vehicle of the foul
matter of which the towns flattered
themselves they had thus got rid, un-
til the shifting the nuisance from one
place to the other became manifestly
no relief whatever, and the legislature
interfered in 1876 with an Act to
prevent the pollution of rivers. This
measure, like many others of the
enactments of the Imperial legisla-
ture of the last thirty years, evinces a
deliberate recognition of the great
principle that the Health of a People
is one of the first concerns of every
Government. We are men, green
in the art of governing ourselves, and
having long sat, each under his own
vine, and under his own fig-tree, in
the good old days “ when Deas Thom-
son was king” —(there are some old
fashioned folk who venture to say we
were very well governed then). We
are disposed to rest complacently
under the assurance that the learn-
ing and ability shewn by our repre-
sentatives in their respective callings,
will suffice to guide the ship of the
State, though we know that hardly one
of them has had any training for the
work, and thus while propping up a
class whose voting power has been
large, or directing expenditure to
districts that have been most clam-
orous, no Glove rnment has until the
last few days ventured to admit that
something must be done to remedy
the mischief occasioned to the city
by pouring the excreta of a hundred
thousand persons into three or four
bays of our beautiful harbour.
The medical testimony given, in
1866, to the commission, declared
that the evil was, in a sanitary view,
of such “ magnitude as to warrant
a large expenditure to prevent it”—
that besides “ known cases (fever)
that had occurred, it is producing a
deterioration of health among the
people,” and the report of that com-
mission characterized the nuisance
“ as being as offensive as it is inju-
rious to the public health.”
Twelve years have passed, and as
a writer on sanitary subjects asks,
what has been done ? we reply as he


did, NOTHING by way of relief,
but much by way of additional nui-
sance, the Corporation have caused
many more connections to be made,
the filth of many more thousands has
been added to our cesspool—the
screws and paddles of our steamers
give it a stir up from time to time,
occasionally a dredge picks up a
bucketful or two, just enough to make-
believe, and we are fast becoming,
if we have not already attained “ that
bad eminence,” the filthiest city in
the empire ! * Is it matter of surprise,
then, that our Death Rate is nearly
the largest ?
It would be foreign to the object
of our articles upon the public health
to enter upon a consideration of the
relative merits of the different modes
of disposal of sewage, but we think
there is abundant evidence to show
that the mode which we have adopted,
expensive as it is, is no improvement
upon the system which, so far as it
has been introduced, it has displaced;
that, on the contrary, the spreading
our filth round our water girdle, has
cost us many lives, and reduced the
value and efficiency of many which
are still left, that in the words of the
verses which we last week copied
from the Echo, our sewage deposits
on the banks of the harbour have
caused
“ Wasting fever, shrunken limb,
Fading life to all that move
On the banks we used to love.”

A STRANGE PATIENT.
BY REV. A. W. PETRE.
Chapter I.
One big dark cloud and then another;
cloud after cloud, how quickly they roll;
the calm waters of the bay already begin
to show by their ruffled surface that a
storm is coming. The sea bird seeks the
shelter of the rocks, the sailor is making
fast for land, and still one cloud after
another comes up. Hark, one distant
roar, and all who can hurry for the dear
and friendly shelter of home. A few
large drops of rain give further warning,
and those who have no home near, seek
the safety of the bridges or archways; a
fierce quick flash of lightning, and the
storm has come. The little village of
Holtham is in the midst of a thunder-
storm.
Seated at the window of the Rectory
reading a letter, is the Rector of the vil-
lage, a grave, stem man. His dark hair
is tinged with grey, but his face seems to
say that this is not from years, for he
surely has not seen forty summers, but
that some care or sorrow has done the
work of age. Although an open letter
half lies in his lap and is half held by his
hand, he, too, has watched the storm
coming up as he sat in the window.
Flash after flash, roar after roar, and still
he moves not; the very rain seems to beat
harder against his window than against
any other, as though to drive him from
his post of observation. Black are the
clouds, but not as black as the edge of the
letter before the Rector, and yet no tear
stands in his eye, no look of sorrow is on
his face ; it is hard, cold, and stem. He
is thinking of another storm a few years
back. He can still see that lady rider
alone in the country lane, her horse, ter-
rified at the first flash of lightning, dash-
ing forward, its rider suddenly thrown
upon the grass; he remembers how he
carried, with the rain beating down upon
him, that unconscious form in his arms up
to the Squire’s house, and how for days
after, when the sun shone down and all
nature looked the happier for the storm,
he called again and again, when there was
no necessity to inquire how Miss Beans-
land progressed after her fright, for the
grass had prevented any wound or serious
hurt. And he remembers how the old
village church bells tolled as the late


Rector’s soul went forth to answer to
its Maker for life spent here on earth; and
how, not so very many months after, the
same bells rang out a merry peal as
the new Rector wedded Squire Beans-
land’s daughter. But even while the
rain-drops on the vsdndow seem to echo
those bells again nigh eighteen years
after, he remembers how one morning no
wife appeared, no dear fond voice
answered to his call, and only a tiny note
was there to say she loved another, and
had fled from home, husband, and child.
And now six years after amid another
storm, with thunder again pealing in his
ears and the rain beating on the window,
he learns that his wife is dead, her soul
has gone beyond the grave.
Why should the tear fall ? Why should
sorrow overshadow his face ? She he
adored, she for whom he could never do
too much, had, after twelve years of mar-
riage life, left home, husband, child, for
a stranger, a new, an untried home.
Why sorrow for such as her ?
Once more the bay is calm, the sea-bird
floats upon its surface, the boatman
spreads his sail, and friend meets friend
in joyous converse as the sun pours down
his welcome rays upon nature refreshed
by one of her grandest exertions —a
thunderstorm. And the Rector sits by
the window still, but the letter is gone,
and a y outh with light golden hair, bright
sparkling blue eyes, and manly bearing,
stands by his side, and the father feels a
heartfelt joy ; he is proud of his son.
An Eton Boy! What youth in all the
world is equal to an Eton boy ? I almost
hear some of my readers murmur a Har-
row boy. Well, perhaps; but after all I
say, for honesty and manly courage give
me, of all the world, an Eton boy. And
Charley Gordon was no exception to the
rule, honest, straightforward, brave, and
a perfect gentleman. England might
indeed be proud of such lads for her sons,
and the Rector of Holtham might well be
proud of him—this boy, his only child,
who walked the path of God and proved
one of the exceptions to the usual rule,
that parson’s sons are found anywhere but
in the ways of the Almighty. An English
boy who boldly and fearlessly treads the
Christian path, is certainly a character
the like of which all the world cannot
produce.
The Rector was much beloved by his
parishioners ; for the rich he had always
comfort, for the poor always help; but
strong as was the love of his people for
their minister, stronger and dearer was
the love of the village for their parson’s
son; and where the drunkard hearkened
not to the father’s voice, the son could
work reform; and perhaps if the Rector
had anv grief it was that Charley showed
no inclination to follow in his footsteps
and become a member of the Cloth.
Chapter 11.
We must now, from want of space,
jump over some years, and find the Rector
assisted by a Curate ; Holtham grown from
a village to a town; the chemist is no
longer medical adviser in chief to the vil-
lage, for there are two doctors, one an old
man, Dr. Crawford, and a young one, Dr.
Charles Gordon. We need hardly say
which is the favourite, for no matter how
the railway has helped to increase the im-
portance of Holtham, no matter how
much Holtham has grown, still the vil-
lage, now a country town, remains firm
to its old love, and Master Charley is first
favourite still.
One September evening, just at the
time when true gossips love to sit by the
firelight and talk, and when it is just too
dark to read, hut yet not quite dark, a
gentle knock sounded upon the door of a
house on which, a brass-plate told all
passers by, resided Dr. Gordon.
As the servant opens the door a lady,
for she is evidently a lady, dressed all in
black with a thick veil over her face,
enters. Having inquired for, and been
shown into, the Doctor’s sanctum, she lifts
the veil, and Charley sees before him a
fair woman of about forty years of age,
whose face, although much worn with
care, bears traces of great beauty.
“I am not ill, Doctor,” she began,
‘ ‘ not ill, that is to say I have no disease;
but I am weary and sick at heart, I cannot
sleep at night, I seem to have no rest—no
rest; I have travelled here from Paris, as
I am certain, of all the Doctors on earth,
you are the only one who can cure me of
my malady. Ah me!”
“Well, my dear Madam,” replied the
Doctor, ‘ £ the compliment you have paid
me is indeed great, and I only hope the
treatment I shall prescribe will have the
desired effect. May I ask your name ? ”
‘ ‘ My name is of little importance as yet,
Doctor, for I must first give you my his-
tory : but are we sure not to be dis-
turbed ? ”


“At least not fora full hour,’’remarked
the Doctor, looking at his watch.
“Really how your windows rattle,
Doctor,” suddenly said the lady visitor,
after a few minutes pause.
“ Oh, it is only a thunderstorm gather-
ing, we sometimes are visited with them
as late as September at Holtham,” said
Charley, returning from the window.
“ Well, now for my history, that is the
only symptom 1 can give you, Doctor. I
am a native of Holtbam, although I
hardly knew the dear old place again, for
it has ipiproved so much and become quite
a town. I passed by the dear old village
church in which I was made a Christian
and a wife. It was there I saw my son,
through the waters of baptism, made a
disciple of Christ. Ah ! what dear visions
came back to me ; how I remember coming
forth from its door in the white robe of
the pure young bride; the very organ
notes seemed to come back, and I remem-
ber, too, how glad, how proud I felt the
first Sunday I was there for Divine Ser-
vice as a wife. A few years passed by,
and a gentleman named St. Clair—have
you heard the name, Doctor ? ”
“No, never that I can remember,”
answered Charley.
“Well, as I was telling you, this Mr.
St. Clair arrived in the village as a lawyer;
his uncle and aunt lived in the neighbour-
hood ; he expected to get some sort of
practice out of our humdrum village; it
was not long before our house became his
evening resort; and somehow I began to
find that the evenings he came not and the
day time until he came, appeared long and
dreary; till some evil, some damned spirit
knew this too, and whispered in his ear
that I loved him. Alas! too soon, hus-
band, home, and my darling boy, became
less to me than Hubert St. Clair!! ”
Flash came the lightning, loud pealed
the thunder; an awful autumn storm had
again broken over Holtham.
The Doctor felt uneasy. His father had
never told him the story of his mother’s
flight, but gossip had, and somehow these
two stories were very like.
“Madam,” remarked Charley, “you
giye no names, nor do you say what makes
you ill now ? ’ ’
“ My dear Doctor, a wife who leaves a
loving husband, a mother who deserts her
only child, must always be ill, and —that
is my illness; and as to names, Rector
Gordon was my husband, and yon—oh!
do y ou not feel it—are my son.”
At this moment the door of the house
shook on its hinges as the knccker
thundered on its panel, and the bell
violently rung through the house. The
Doctor, by a natural impulse, rushed to
the door to find there a servant from the
Rectory, who came to say that the light-
ning had frightened a horse the Rector
was driving; he had been thrown from
the gig, and was in great danger. The
Doctor returned to his room.
‘ ‘ Mother ! If you are my mother, and
I believe you are, come at once with me
to your husband and my father’s dying bed. ’
A fainting form soon after was borne
into the Doctor’s carriage, and the rain
beat against the windows as if to say, ‘ ‘ we
claim a right to fall on her as we did so
many years ago.”
They were in the sick chamber: the
son had told the ‘ ‘ history of his strange
patient” to the father; she had proved
the story of her death to be false, and had
fallen on her knees sobbing at the foot of
the bed. One imploring glance for mercy,
one yearning look of love from the up-
turned, tear-stained face of the wife, one
answering look of pity and forgiveness
irradiating the pa'le features of the dying
husband; and as the storm cleared away
and the moon’s bright beams fell through
the chamber windows, the soul of the
Rector of Holtham took its departure to
meet its Heavenly Father, leaving the
widow and son to mourn with the people
for one good, boly, and sincere man who
had gone to his eternal reward—one who
had been stricken by a heavy blow, but
who had shown that he had learned the
Divine lesson to forgive—even as he
hoped to be forgiven.
Woman as a Stone-thrower— When
a woman throws a stone, she strikes an
attitude calculated to fill the breast of the
beholder with awe and admiration. She
raises her right arm perpendicularly in
the air, glares at the object she aims at,
bends back her body as far as she possibly
can, and then, with a terrific swoop of the
avenging arm, she sends the stone flying
into space. In the process her back ba.ir
comes down, some dozen hooks and eyes
are sacrificed, and she has s crick in the
back for the next two days. And the
stone—what becomes of the stone ? That
is one of those inscrutable mysteries by
which science is baffled, and conjecture
sinks powerless on wearied and exhausted
pinions.


SPIRITS ON THE STAGE.
(An Inspiration , on returning from a lecture
lately delivered in Sydney.)
“ You may call spirits from the vasty deep :
But will they come when you do call them ? ’’
Let us glance for a moment my friends at
the age,
In which civilization and science engage,
Not in conflict—Oh no! but in concord
and love,
Each giving to each quite a brotherly
shove,
Till at last by combining they hold such
ci swciy^
That before it both Heaven and Earth
must give way;
Such a governing power o’er natures and
souls,
That stretching from Europe away to the
poles,
From Society’s centre, for thousands of
of miles,
It now flourishes green in the Cannibal
Isles:
So that naught can we do in this civilized
time,
No matter the land, or no matter the
clime,
Upon earth, upon sea, or under the sky,
But that civilized fingers will be in the
pie.
Religion comes in, though ’tis most out of
date,
Retained as it were just for decency’s sake,
For ’tis needful as law, and must go hand
in hand
With science and skill for the peace of
the land,
No occasion for martyrs, or any such stuff,
Of this, the poor ancients had more than
enough,
No Holy Crusades our faith to uphold,
No blood freely shed for the Cross as of
old; , ,
No fires at Smithfield, no tortures endured,
In the hope of obtaining the promised
reward ;
Do not these all belong to the ages ob-
scure,
Before Education triumphantly bore
Her banner on high o’er the desert and
wave,
And national schools to the poor people
gave ?
Then she argued, and told us that can-
onized bones,
Would hardly repay one for tortures and
groans,
At first vaguely hinted, then holdly de-
clared,
That from sponges and jelly-fish all men
were reared;
That the legend of Adam and Eve, Cain
and Abel,
Was naught but a strange unreliable fable,
Which of course you may preach and
believe if you can,
But remember, I've found a pre-Adamite
man.
] n the days gone bye it might have been
well,
To preach to old fogies of Heaven and
HeU,
But we modems, so eager to find out the
truth,
Must have put before us some positive
proof;
Must indulge in free thought, know what
we’re about,
And will never believe if there’s room for
a doubt.
Of no use to tell us that such things
occurred,
In two twos we can prove what you say is
absurd.
What’s this ? You insist its in Holy
Writ written ?
Then have you not heard of the wonder-
ful Britten,
Who now in beneficence graces our shore ?
Alas! we shall ne’er see her like any
more!
A Britten, you say —Does the question
then vex ?
A Briton, I answer, of feminine sex,
She’ll lecture you well on the life that you
lead,
And shatter and scatter your foolish old
creed;
Just to hear her discourse —Ah, marvel-
ous charm,
The words that she uses, as long as your
arm,
The answers she gives to a questioning
mind,
Though incomprehensible, never unkind;
The eloquent stringing of syllables choice,
The pathos that dwells in that musical
voice ;
Ah ! who but the type of base antagonism,
Would turn from tins preacher of Spirit-
ualism.
But stay —let us hasten the seance to
share,
Nor shall I anticipate what you shall
hear.


Behold her ye whose anxious souls aspire
To tread the unknown paths of mystic
Fata?
Behold her all whose spirits would inquire,
To know what shall be in the future state.
See in what godlike majesty she stands,
Arrayed in trailing robes of azure blue,
With noble gesture now she waves her
hands,
As though invoking all her spirit crew.
Around her seated are a goodly throng
Of those who have embraced the ghostly
vow;
’Tis true in darkness they have groped
too long,
But rest at length, their eyes are open
now.
Note the respect and reverence they show
To her, the preacher of this new-born
law;
And mark the rapt attention they bestow,
On polysyllabic words ne’er heard before,
But come, let us delay no more.
Observe him, too, the seat of honour holds,
Upon the dais this [prophetess hath raised,
He who his mighty hands in silence
folds,
And seems, though happy, just a little
dazed;
Distinguished with an Hon. before his
name,
The matter then, must surely be of course,
That reticence can only be his aim.
But list to inspirations from above,
And try to fathom deep this hidden store
Of scientific learning—“ What is love ?”
Asks an old maid, in trembling accents
low;
Alas! too well she feels how human
hearts
Can beat at that fond word, too well doth
know
The magical effect of Cupid’s darts ;
A simple, mortal, question doth it seem;
A rather used-up, hackneyed one in fact;
But the Prophetess, so wrapt in spirit
dream,
Pours forth her answer like a cataract.
Not all the thunderbolts of mighty Jove
Could fall, with more chaotic wondrous
sound,
Nor more the trembling soul in terror
move,
Nor half as much the human mind astound,
As does that ponderous flow of lengthy
speech,
Like Johnson’s Dictionary on a learned
spree,
With which she tries her listeners to teach,
And makes one wish he were a Spelling
Bee.
<‘What ye, in ignorance, call love,” she
cries,
“ Is Bilateral, and Bifurcous in its kind,
“ A zoophyte of crytogamia that dies,
“ And by metempsychosis is left behind ;
“ But we, of course, by theopneusty know
“ That love is like the xylobalsamum, a
wood
“Than which none sweeter flourishes
below,
“ And none more strong the storms of life
withstood.
“ If we were plagiarists of other minds,
‘‘ Cryptographers imposthumate with
praise,
“We then might quote a thousand different
kinds
“ Of metaphysics tending tojthe case ;
“ But being merely superhuman thoughts,
“ Theologically substantialised in Spirit-
land,
‘ ‘ Philosophy kind sympathy escorts,
‘‘ Simultaneously to wander hand in hand;
‘‘ How easy then it is to subdivide
This zygodactylic, and threefold noodle :
So, all prevarication laid aside,
“We answer you that, Love is Yankee-
doodle /”
Was there ever such wonderful power of
speech,
The poor erring souls of us mortals to
teach ?
Was there ever such eloquence?—marvel-
lous—grand 1
Who’d dare to suggest that he don’t under-
stand ?
Who’d question the right of a zoophyte to
die ?
And who’d zygodactylic noodles deny ?
Saying ‘ ‘ Tell me, I pray you, your reasons
and why!”
You may, if you like, but oh dear no, not I.
It would look so remarkably foolish and
low,
These words of your own E lglish tongue
not to know.
And perhaps it might cause the good Pro-
phetess pain
If you asked her to go through it over
again;


And so, like the others, I’ll he quite content
To believe what she says is true and well-
meant, —
For surely no mortal could he so command-
ing,
So completely surpassing all man’s under-
standing,
As she who now waits for a riddle worth
guessing,
And assures us “ She’s finding this talk
QUITE REFRESHING.”
Then let us not linger a moment in choos-
ing;
But, other religions in toto refusing,
Let us boldly proceed to make humble
confession,
To this new-born faith of the Age of Pro-
gression.
The Scriptures must seem, to a being not
dense,
Quite antagonistic to science and sense :
But, here’s a Belief—here’s a Faith, to he
sure,
With a Prophetess handy, and Spirits
galore —
Which indeed is more worthy for Scholars
to hold
Than a trust in the records two thousand
years old!
For, surely, ’tis time that we had some-
thing new,
So we’ll turn our attention to spirits in
blue,
And hope that at last, when the dark
silent wave
Of Death shall have borne us on to the
grave,
From friends, and the dear ones we love,
far away —
And when fide itself is a faint yesterday—
When the joys and the sorrows are quiet
at last,
And when our actions are things of the
past—
We then may be drifted away to our
sphere,
For the purpose of rapping out what we
do there;
To move the planchette, or to spell, if we’re
able ;
And to jump from the floor in a drawing-
room table.
Yes, this is true wisdom; on this, let us
found
Our trust in the future, and faith most
profound !
THE OTHER JOHN.
BY THOMAS MOSER.
I have known him well for many
years, and he is outside my back fence
as lam writing. There should be no
excuse for my failing to draw a picture
of him, physically or metaphorically,
if I am able to do anything in either
line of art. Even if I could do the
first, I fear it would convey no par-
ticular impression, as my subject is a
Chinaman; and Chinamen, as far as
personal appearances go, are as diffi-
cult to distinguish from one another as
blackfellows. To draw a sketch of his
life and character is to a great extent
to turn over old ground, for during the
last ten years every “ newspaper man”
who has been hard set for a subject
has invariably tried his hand at Bal-
larat and the Chinese quarter, and
they know!
Now I am about to, colonially
speaking, “ boil John down,” from my
experience of him as a neighbour
and an acquaintance, and I know at the
outset that I am courting the scorn
and derision of a host of Mongolo-
phobists, who believe that “no good
can possibly come out of China,” that
John is an objectionable character who
ought to confine his attentions to grow-
ing rice and feeding ducks in his own
country, and by no means to come
here; that he is a depraved beast
morally ; and that women and children
have no business to be allowed within
miles of him.
I am certainly not about to argue
that John and his friends are desirable
colonists, because their little game is
simply “ plunder; ” they do not spend
a shilling in the country if they can
help it. Crowded in cities, they in-
troduce abominations of divers kinds,
not to be specified ; but lam not clear
that an odd John or two, principally
growing cabbages in a semi-tropical
part of the country is not rather a
useful institution.
My John is of this ilk, and my object
is to shew that not only is he a very
useful fellow, a decent, law-abiding


kind of man, but also to anyone who
has a sense of humour rather an enter-
taining subject. A little further down
the creek than John’s garden lives old
Bill Staggs. He has a dirty hut all
to himself, where he can spend his
spare hours in drinking rum and blas-
pheming. He works for me occasion-
ally, and needs a good deal of
watching. He stole my wood-axe the
last time he was here, and he is out
on bail now on a charge of robbing a
poor swagsman of his bnndle, after
drinking at his expense for several
days. I hope he will be hanged ! Old
Bill is a countryman of my own, and
should have all my sympathies ; but I
prefer John. May he live for ever !
Some years ago, when I frittered away
many nocturnal hours in the reporter’s
gallery of the New South Wales Legis-
lative Assembly, I remember, in the
course of a debate upon the question
of railway extension into the interior,
that highly gifted senator, the Hon.
John Bowie Wilson, informing the
House “ that the Murray Kiver dis-
trict was fertile enough, if people only
took the pains to cultivate it properly,”
and he instanced the fact by stating
that “ he had eaten some splendid
cabbages grown on the Murray.”
Some one said “ Credat Judceus ! ”
Others that he had been eating War-
rego cabbage, or “pig face.” Now,
if there was one subject more than
another, perchance the only one, on
which the honorable member was an
authority, it was vegetables ; for he
lived almost entirely on them. The
following distich was attributed to him
as a “ happy thought ” at the time
“ There’s curly kail on Warrego,
And caustics on the Murray,
At Hay the Spinach grows sae fine
And neaps at Murrumburrah!
I don't believe that he ever wrote a
line of it. But I fully believe that he
ate the right article on his trip to the
Murray, and that John Chinaman had
grown it.
I have tried competition with John
in the cabbage trade, and I confess to
humiliation. Old Bill Staggs digging
at “ six shillings a day and his grub,”
was not a profitable commencement.
Carrying ten buckets of water about
a quarter of a mile every night, water-
ing the plants, and at early morn
hoeing the same, is surely worth
something, for I did the first indus-
triously every night for a month. Old
Bill would have charged me about
three pounds for such duty. The
aphis paid me a visit when my nurse-
lings were just out of their infancy,
and about two-thirds came to an un-
timely end. The balance struggled on,
but they plainly “ had no heart in their
calling,” for they branched out more
like bananas than cabbages. I devoured
one as an experiment. It tasted very
bitter, and its consistency was that of
young rhubarb.
It really was a mean thing to apply
to John for a cure, seeing that I had
entered the lists of competition with
him. Fas est ab hoste doceri is not
always a good axiom to swallow ; but
I did. John smiled, and handed me
over our dividing fence a cabbage wich
a heart like a cricket ball, which he
pulled up within a few feet of where
mv abortions were attempting to grow I
“ Welly good this fellow I think,” said
he, “ you eat him!” I glanced first
at the cabbage in my hand, and then
ruefully surveyed my heartless bant-
liugs. “ This,” apostrophised I, 4 ' is
then a test of Anglo-Saxon superiority
—licked clean by a dirty Chinaman.”
I tookmycabbage indoors, and sat down
on my verandah to ruminate over the
cause of my defeat. We had the same
season; I think I “squared yards”
with John in the way of watering.
How, then, had I failed ? As I meant
to eat John’s cabbage, I made up my
mind, metaphorically, to “ eat the
leek ” likewise, so I put my hat on my
head and went over into John’s garden
to satisfy myself as to the cause of my
failure. I found him and three of his
countrymen with their bamboos and
water pots hard at work; but while
John’s lieutenants copiously drenched
the plants with plain water, I found
John very careful in distributing the
contents of his water pot. With a


small sharp pointed stick he made a
hole at the root of every plant, and
poured therein a good-sizedtablespoon-
ful of what may be termed “concen-
trated essence of cesspools.” I merely
imagined this from the smell.
“You give him this fellow! then
welly good cabbagee I think,” said
John, who seemed rather to relish the
aroma. Here was the secret of the
whole thing; and as a matter of smell
I would rather never see a cabbage
than have to personally supervise their
culture after this fashion.
Outside John’s hut in a sort of
skillion shed there appeared to be a
full manufactory or distillery of these
noxious compounds; and hard by three
pigs, who spent most of their time
wallowing in a mud-hole especially
prepared for them in their stye,
seemed to have a good deal to do with
the industry. How John and his
friends avoided a pestilence I can’t to
this day divine. A few ducks, a
mangy dog, John's horse and market
cart, were the chief objects of interest
about the place. His garden tools
were of the most primitive character;
and from a rough guess, the whole of
the goods and chattels of himself and
his men were not worth £25. His
object in gardening was plainly to get
as much as he could out of the small-
est plot of ground ; for there was not
over halt an acre altogether, and there
was barely a square foot of it which
was not in a high state of cultivation.
Every description of common vegetable
was growing luxuriantly, and John
had almost a monopoly of the vege-
table market in the township.
Now I was always fond of statistics.
When I get worsted in argument
I always dispute figures as being the
best way to get out of a dilemma, and
when I get the best I always say,
** But look at the figures !” There is
no line of argument better. As John
and his friends entered the hut, at the
door of which I had been standing, I
paused to collect some statistics for
use in case of future discussion.
“ How much ground here, John,''
said I, “ you plantee with cabbagee ?”
(It is always best to speak broken
English to foreigners, as there is a
better chance of their understanding
you.) After much trouble. I made
out that the plot was about 120 feet long
by 20 feet wide, “ And how many
cabbages you plant in this fellow," I
asked. John turned to a very stu-
pid-looking countryman, who sat on
a stretcher, and who. it appeared,
had planted the bed, and asked him in
Chinese. The stupid man evidently
knew all about it, for he promptly re-
plied, as interpreted by John, “nineteen
hundred seventy-eight. “ How muchee
you sell one fellow ?” “ Seven penny,”
said John. I put my mental arithme-
tic cap on at once to calculate the
gross return, and betrayed my scheme
instantly to the astute John, who said
“You not know how muchee all cab-
bagee! I tell you.” So saying, he
took down a small rack with a num-
ber of colored balls sliding on the
transverse wires, and after manipu-
lating them a few seconds, during
which time I had got into the third
figure in multiplying by seven, he
replied “ Fisty-sevennee pound tir-
teen shilling ten pennev.” I left in
disgust in being defeated in arithme-
tic, and came to a conclusion most
people have, by this time, who deal
with John, that he does not lose much
by arithmetical blundering.
I cannot say that I returned to my
home either a sadder or wiser man,
but I know that I was profoundly dis-
gusted, and from a survey of the
creases which developed themselves in
John’s parchment cheeks, I more than
surmised that he had “taken stock”
of me, considerably to my disadvan-
tage.
The drought was something fearful.
Nothing but profuse watering permit-
ted anything with a vestige o+ green
about it to exist in the botanical world
save gum leaves, and they were half-
brown. Still I worked like a second
Aquarius, and John and his satellites
set an excellent example. Things


could hardly be much worse, and the
advent of the weekly mailman was anx-
iously looked for in the hope that he
might bring tidings of rain some-
where.
“My word, master,” said Jemmy,
the mail-boy, as he pulled up one
evening to water his horse, “If this
wind holds, you’ll have ’em here by
morning.” From the tenor of the re-
mark, the reader might imagine that
Jemmy alluded to a fleet of over-due
ships ; but, alas, there was no water!
“What will be here, Jemmy ?” I asked.
“ Wh},” said he, “ them blarmed
grasshoppers ! I passed ’em down, at
Jerry’s Crossing, and the creeks as
dry as the road!” My acquaintance
with grasshoppers was very limited so
far. My wife had been in the habit of
rather hailing their advent with de-
light as the young chickens had lively
fattening times of it, but these small
squads we had been visited by mother
parts of the country were mere pic -nic
parties |of quite another variety, out
for pleasure, and not invading hosts,
bent on eating us up In fact the Mur-
ray grasshoppers are a species peculiar
to that delectable region. Nimble
fellows, with hard heads, that not
for a back fall, and who will jump head
first at the side of a house times out
of number, and not a crack in their
skulls. Apart from the muscular de-
velopment of their legs, which have
the power of a good sized clock-spring,
the latter are covered with thorns like
old rose bushes. They can hang on to
anything, and as for eating, their appe-
tite is insatiable, and of the most om-
nivorous character, grass, ladies’boots,
leaves, Chinese matting, flour, old
clothes, sugar and soft goods generally
they partake of indiscriminately, not
by any means arranging the courses.
I never saw them do anything but eat
night or day. Hard as it may be to
“ catch a weasel asleep” I’ll back the
grasshopper against him, weasels do
sometimes sleep, but grasshoppers
*CVer.
Now all this I learned since the me-
morable evening when Jemmy an-
nounced their anticipated arrival. As
a matter of fact, I knew very little
about them or their ways previously.
I remember reading a paragraph,
which went the rounds of the papers,
in which it was stated that an ingeni-
ous Frenchman had found out that
grasshoppers are good eating. Some-
how Frenchmen are always finding out
these things; but they merely give
the recipe, and never follow it. The
paragraph said “That they ate best
fried.” Now if that same man will ever
get a Murray grasshopper into a fry-
ing-pan and keep him there till he is
cooked, all I can say be will earn his
meal. Why not eat them grilled;
“a grilled gryllus!” There is grim
humour in the idea !
I had spent about three hours in
sweet repose by the side of my better-
half on this same night, when I was
awoke by one of those friendly digs
from her elbow a little to one side of
my spine. This is the particular “ dig”
which married ladies know so well how
to administer, and is used with marked
effect when “ something is wanted for
baby,” or they awake with the idea
that “ something is burning,'* or a
“stranger in the house,” or the “ ser-
vants want calling,” or any other thing
which proves a fallacy. In the hands,
or rather the elbows, of a proficient
matron, it is fully equal to awaking in
an instant “one of the Seven Sleepers, ”
or magically restoring a person in the
highest stage of catalepsy. I need
hardly say it awoke me. It always
does. “What is the matter ?” said I.
“Well,” was the reply, “how, when
everything is perishing for lack of rain,
you can lie fast asleep and hear those
glorious drops against the Venetians, I
can’t make out! Get up, and put a
jug under the spout, and let us have
some fresh water?” I arose and
opened the shutters. The night was
beautifully starlight, and I was about
to say so, when I got a bang in my eye
and then another on the cheek, and for
a few seconds stood a fire of what might
have been small shot. I shut the
wndow, and had a light in no time.


It took less to find out what the
rainfall was. It was raining grass-
hoppers. They had been hammering
with their heads for admittance, and
they, to the amount of some score, had
been gratified—for I had ‘ 4 risen and
let them in.” The pattering outside
which continued for some time —I may
say for about two days—was caused by
the heads of their friends, who possibly
missed their society. 4 ‘Well, I de-
clare,” said my wife (after I had been
a few moments in bed) who knew
nothing about grasshoppers, “won’t
this be splendid for the young chickens,
and we are nearly out of corn ? Waugh-
augh-augh! ” I cannot write this last
word: it means a scream like the
daughter of Madame Angot gives when
Pitou jilts her. “ What the deuce is
up, now ?” I cried. “ There’s a scor-
pionin the bed, and I’m bitten in the
leg. Get a light, can’t you?” (Screams
at intervals.) I don’t think I ever got
up or struck a light quicker; but I had
had hardly time to assist in a search in
the bed when I felt myself pinned by
the leg. Now, I didn’t scream, but I
am afraid I did something worse in the
way of using language which in legen-
dary jpwriance is supposed to be used
only by members of Parliament. I
brushed the fellow off one leg by
using the sole of the foot of the other,
and scrambling into bed I made search
for the grasshopper inside. Flea-hunt-
ing was nothing to it. Being disturbed
from the folds of my wife’s night-dress,
be first took a leap to the top of the
bed, and hung on to the mosquito-
curtains; knocked “out of that,” his
next leap was on the baby’s nose, at
which my wife screamed louder than
ever; then he got me by the back of
the neck; thence into my wife’s hair,
where I seized him, and squashing him
up, left her to comb out the fragments
of his broken limbs in the morning.
But what was the slaughter of one!
They had holes in the mosquito-
curtains the size of my fist before
morning. They ate another hole in
my wife’s boots ; several were found
dead in the baby’s food which had
been left standing overnight, and one
big fellow, a sort of Anak among them,
I discovered at daylight up to his
middle in a pomatum-pot and sawing
the air with his forefeet. I wrung his
neck like a shrimp.
But why dilate upon my own troubles
when poor John had spread such a feast
for the brutes next door ? One of my
first visits was paid to him at day-
light, and in so doing I passed through
my small garden plot. I need scarcely
say that my wretched cabbages were
things of the past. I should have
thought from my experience of trying
to eat one of them in it s youth that the
stalks of the older ones would have
withstood the teeth of anything short
of a white ant; but they were “a mere
circumstance” to the grasshoppers, and
had all but disappeared.
John had received an intimation of
the arrival of the grasshoppers, and
had put himself in readiness to defend
his garden. Me had fenced his plot in
with a calico sereen, which he evidently
thought would baffle them, and, more-
over, he and his friends had armed
themselves with long switches made of
brushwood with which they battered at
the foe right and left. But the grass-
hoppers were equal to the occasion.
They had only to jump on to the China-
men's hats and vault neatly over the
calico screen, which stratagem they
effected with great agility. “ One
week more,” said John, as the per-
spiration streamed down his face, “and
no cabbagee! Frenchy bean! —all the
same ! ” He might have said one day
and been nearer the mark. He fought
the grylli until eleven, and then sud-
denly struck his calico. He abandoned
the larger plants to their fate, and
devoted his energies to saving his seed-
beds. These he covered with the
calico, and he and his friends sat down
to keep the latter clean swept, other-
wise it would have been in holes in no
time. There was something grotesque
in the philosophical way in which John
and his friends treated the matter.
There they sat, with no more animation
in their faces than Dutch dolls, and


calmly swept off the grasshoppers as
they perched on the sheeting. The
same evening at sunset John knelt to
the setting sun, and one of his friends
let off a few packages of crackers over
his head, as I suppose, a sort of invoca-
tion to Joss, or the sun, or some deity,
to rid him of the pest. I say I suppose
so, for I know not what John’s creed is.
A census collector on the Rocky River
put it down as “Confusion,” and I dare
say he is right. I think I might by
dint of exertion have made out some-
thing about it, but in an evil hour I
read Wingrove Cook’s account of
Chinese polemics as gathered from his
interviews with Governor Yeh, when
conveyed as a prisoner to Calcutta,
and my mind has been a blank on the
subject ever since.
John made few complaints, though
he was all but ruined; but old Bill,
who owned two or three half wild
peach trees and a ragged banana,
swore horribly, and lay in wait for a
travelling shepherd like a great spider.
He captured one, and, after assisting
him to drink a considerable part of his
wages, decamped with him and the
balance. I am on the jury next
sessions, and possibly William and I
“may meet at Philippi.” I do not
wish to harbour ill feeling, but that
“ wood-axe ” has entered into my soul.
It is a pity to chronicle anything
reflecting on my wife’s sagacity, but
I owe her one for that “dig” I got
on the morning of the arrival of the
grasshoppers. The chickens might
as well have tried to eat horse-
nails as these Murray River grass-
hoppers. They were perfectly im-
pervious to pecks, and a patriarchal
Brahma-Pootra, after using his bill
like a pick-axe upon the head of one of
these big hoppers, gave it up as a bad
job, though the blows he gave were
strong enough to fracture road metal.
“ Sealyer,” our servant girl (I believe
she was christened Cecilia, but this is
what she calls herself), said to my wife,
“ It ain’t no use, marm, o’ they chickens
picking at ’em. They rears theirselves
on their hind legs, and fights ’em!”
I doubt this, but Sealyer sticks to it.
Be it, however, as it may, I maintain
it as a fact that no fowl in the colonies
short of an emu could kill a good
Murray River grasshopper, or digest it
afterwards. As regards the French-
man eating them, nothing short of two
days’ stewing in a Pappin’s digester
could ever soften them.
“They came, they saw, they con-
quered,” and now they are gone. Two
months after we saw the last of them,
John’s garden looked as well as ever:
mine looked better far , as it was
destitute of any weak-minded experi-
ments of mine. I buy from John now,
and am thankful.
Now, if the man is a benefactor who
makes two blades of grass, &c.—the
adage is too old to repeat —the question
is what is John who grows cabbages
and other vegetables where no one else
can afford to do it? I say he is a
benefactor.
People are rather too hard on John,
to my view. I hate figures, so I will
not say how many Chinese there are
in the colony; but I say this, that in
proportion to their numbers they are
less before our law courts than our
own people. John does not understand
law, and when he gets into court he
is at the mercy of an interpreter who
may tell the court anything. When
John is caught tripping, he is smitten
severely. Bill Staggs owned a vile
goat, which on the score of honesty
was worse than its owner. This brute
broke into John’s garden, and laid
waste his cabbage-bed. One of John’s
lieutenant’s stabbed it with a fork, and
it died, I am happy to say. For this
he had to pay five pounds for cruelty
to animals, and to this day he does not
know why. If it had been mine or any
other Englishman’s fate to have had a
visit from the brute, would we not
have destroyed it ? I know I would,
even to hewing it in pieces, only old
Bill “ stole mv wood-axe !”
Sealyer” has never been troubled
with offensive addresses from John or
his friends. He has been singularly
polite, in fact, and as a tribute of


esteem, for her rei head very likely,
he one day presented her with two
tomatoes, a cucumber, and an onion.
I know this because I caught her
crunching them, and no such veget-
ables exist anywhere in the neighbour-
hood save in John’s garden.
I have found him honest, industri-
ous, and sober, and I consider him a
respectable “ institution ” when in
limited numbers. He may have a way
of doing things which does not always
render him the most profitable labourer,
but at least he does work when he
undertakes it, and he never “ stole my
wood-axe
MISTRESS AND MAID.
TO TELE YOUNG LADIES OF AUSTRALIA
As a writer in Once a Week remarked
the other day in an article headed
“ Mistress and M aid,” “ the colonial
mistress and maid question is a topic
upon which every man, woman or
child who has lived any time in the
colonies has something to say in the
way of complaint, jest, or anecdote.’’
It is more than likely that you, young
ladies, have each of you something to
say, or if nothing to say, some thoughts
on this matter. As a contribution to
your material for thought on that
very important social question, will
you let us speak to you a few
words, mainly in the form of ques-
tions. Do not the great propor-
tion of immigrant female servants
come to Australia “ to better them-
selves ?’’ Is not their imagination
fired that they may do as others of
their class, by scores, have done before
them ; to wit, marry and developeinto
mistress without delaying long in the
lower sphere of maid? Is there not just
at present a desire in the units of each
class or caste to live in the style and
after the fashion of the class or caste
higher than their own by two or three
removes ? Is not there, just at present,
a desire in all classes to put show be-
fore comfort and aluminium in the
place of gold ? Is it not the f ict that
with mistress as with maid, dress is a
very taking subject, and that the ruth-
less decrees of fashion lead to viola-
tions of propriety and good taste by
the lady of the house quite as often as
by her handmaiden ? Is not household
work, especially cooking, considered
by many ladies as servile drudgery, to
which fine ladyism should not lend so
much aid as may be accorded by the
touch of a jewelled finger ? Is the kit-
chen in which Bridget has to do
her work always the clean, well drained,
well ventilated chamber that it ought
to be ? Is the average mistress me-
thodical, patient, skilled to teach her
servants in the orderly way she would
have them go ? Good gracious! You
ask, is this a civil service examination
paper for us girls ? Not a bit oi it. But
we would ask you carefully to con the
above queries, and apply tne result to
your reflection thereupon to the mis-
tress and maid question. So long as
domestic work is deemed servile , so
long will the domestic servant caste
be servile. So long as there are mere
“fine lady” mistresses there will be the
Bridgets of Punch. Sham and shoddy
in the drawing-room will breed inso-
lence and carelessness m the kitchen.
A loyal recognition by the mistress of
her common sisterhood with her m id,
has worked wonders in the past, aud
will do so in the future.
The Marchioness de Orequy, in her
Memoirs, tells of a nobleman of her ac-
quaintance who dismissed all his wife s
female domestics on the ground that
they gave his dogs flejS. He deemed
them quite inferior beings. And there
are mistresses who treat their female
domestic with the same affectation of
aristocratic contempt.
There is another point which de-
serves consideration from you the
mistresses of the future. You will hear
many mistresses talk of the ingrati-
tude of servants, that Bridget rarely
feels proper gratitude for those who
employ her. But why should there
be gratitude ? A girl contracts to do
certain work, does it, and gets paid


for it. What gratitude can she pos-
sibly owe ? The mistress has every
whit as much reason to be grateful as
she. The notion that the labourer owes
gratitude to his employer is the result
of an artificial condition of mankind,
a condition which tending to produce
fawning obsequiousness and servility
destroys all true manliness, all real
womanliness of character. Think this
matter out for yourselves. Don’t expect
gratitude, but try to win it. That is
tht secret of success in getting and
keeping servants. When you have
got one, don’t expect perfection. Be
patient, willing to teach, willing to
help. Seek, we repeat, to win grati-
tude, and it will very possibly come.
Even if it doesn’t, you will have de-
livered your own souls from one of the
most pernicious evils of our day and
generation, the sorrowful disregard of
the human, which is God-planted in
all men and women, high as low, rich
as poor, man as master, mistress as
maid.
By the bye, as a bonne bouche at the
end of these dry remarks, we submit
to your cogitative faculties this bit of
Ruskin’s anent cookery “What does
cookery mean ? It means the know-
ledge of Medea, and of Circe, and of
Calypso, and of Helen, and of Rebe-
kah, and of the Queen of Sheba. It
means the knowledge of all herbs, and
fruits, and balms, and spices ; and of
all that is healing and sweet in fields
and groves, and savoury in meats ;
it means carefulness, and inventive-
ness, and watchfulness, and willing-
mss and readiness of appimnee ; It
means the economy of your great-
grandmothers, and the science of mo-
dern chemists; it means much tasting,
and no wasting; it means English
thoroughness, and French art and
Arabian hospitality ; and it means, in
fine, that you are to be perfectly and
always ‘ladies’—* loaf-givers,’ and, as
you are to see, imperatively, that
every body has something pretty to
put on,—so you are to see, yet more
imperatively, that everybody has some-
thing nice to eat.”
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMAN'S FERRY ROAD
Chapter Vl.— Continued.
The girls showed by the way in which
they handled the remains of the dead that
their sympathies were not on the side of
law and order. The bodies of Hamlin
and Callaghan received much more tender
treatment at their hands than that of poor
Rumford, who had fallen in the discharge
of duty. One or two women, the wives
of shepherds on the adjoining station
having heard of the excitement at Nanny’s’
came in to hear the news, and to join*
their lamentations to those sent up by the
Misses Read for the death of two such
freehanded fellows as they one and all
declared the “ Cannibal ” and his mate to
have been.
“He never took so much as a farden,
did Tom, from a poor man ; hut he had a
mighty down on them big squatters, and
why not ?” quoth Mistress Gillespie, one.
of Mrs. Reid’s visitois; making for the
thief the excuse that in all ages men and
women of the lower class have fancied
would pass muster as moral logic; though
in direct opposition to the clear incisive
command that, leaving no room for eva-
sion nor loophole for escape, says with
simple sternness, “ Thou shalt not steal.”
Mrs. Gillespie’s sentiment was received
without further comment from her lady
friends than a waes hael pledged in neat
rum to the memory of the two miscreants,
who had so justly met with their deserts
the day before.
It was about one o’clock on the after-
noon following the day of the sticking-up
when Mr. Tom Powys, the magistrate
who had been summoned by Mr. Neal,
was driven up to the door of Nanny’s hos-
telry by that gallant inspector. Mr.
Powys was the Police Magistrate and
Commissioner of Crown Lands at Mitta
Mitta, a rather “fast” township on the
Murrumbidgee. In virtue of his com-
missionership, and on the strength of
his having served as a British legionary
in Spain, Mr. Powys affected a blue frock,
braid frogs, and strapped white trousers.
He wore two ‘ribbons on his breast, for,
as he was wont to tell his friends, he had
oft sought the bubble reputation e’en
at the cannon’s mouth. He prided him-
self mainly, though, not so much on what
he had done, as on what he was, or rather


thought he was—a splendidly handsome
fellow. He certainly had been goodlook-
ing, but now that he was passe, the very
pains he took to conceal that melancholy
fact helped to proclaim it. The padded
coat, the hyacinthine tinge of his raven
locks, both told a tale. As for the locks,
they were a palpable fraud; for, owing to
his convivial habits, Mr. Powys did not
apply the jet-black dye with such regu-
larity or method as the circumstances of
his case demanded, so the consequence
was that patches of grey here and there
betrayed the fact of his being an old man.
With the squatters of the Mitta Mitta
district Mr. Powys was not exactly a
favorite, though he worked hard to secure
their good will by invariably siding with
their interests. By all other classes he
was disliked, because under his apparent
bonhomie was a vein of superciliousness
with which he invariably seasoned his
deportment towards the lower orders, as
he denominated all who moved in the
world on a less exalted plane than that
of a distinguished public functionary and
of a whilome brilliant ornament of the
court and camp of Isabella of Spain.
“ So you say that the chief witness will
be my own nephew,” said Mr. Powys, as
the horses were reined up at Nanny’s door,
“ for it’s quite evident that the George
Caldecott you mention must be my nephew
—one of the Caldecotts of Caldecotts. You
see, my only sister married General Calde-
cott, the fellow they made such a fuss about
for the pluck he showed at Chillianwallah,
and there was an only child—this boy.
He’s made his fortune, already cash—he’s
made it spin, they say. But how the
devil it comes that he’s marching about
the country like a swagsman, I don’t know,
d dif I do! That girl of Walton’s will
have money; so, if as you say, the old
fellow —who, by the bye, I never met—has
invited George to stop with him, he might
do worse than pay court to the beaux yeux
de sa cassette , and so secure a second fortune
to play ducks and drakes with.”
“Yes, your nephew, Mr. Caldecott, will
be the chief witness,” replied the inspector.
“ I hope, Mr. Powys, you won’t forget
what I mentioned to you as we drove over
here from Reynolds’s.”
“ That’ll be all right. Let’s get down,
and have the affair over as soon as we can.
Nanny’s isn’t the most comfortable place to
hold an inquiry at, though she can give a
man a glass of spirits. How is that, Neal,
now ?”
“ How is what ?”
‘ ‘ Why, how is it that your shantvkeeper
can always give a fellow better grog than
a licensed hotelkeeper ?”
“ On the principle that the man who
stole his brooms ready made could afford
to sell them cheaper than the man who
merely stole the materials out of which he
made them. The shantykeeper’s profit on
the glass sold is all profit.”
“What! all profit, and police about?
I think, Neal, you forget you are address-
ing a police magistrate,” said Powys,
laughing. “Well! let’s see what she can
give us.”
Mr. Powys and the inspector had hardly
had time to drink-their glass of rum and
water before Mr. Hay drove up to the
house with George Caldecott and Mr. Cos-
grove. The driver of the coach that had
been stuck-up rode up a few seconds after-
wards. Things were now ready for a
commencement of the investigation, all
the witnesses that the police intended to
produce being present.
Before opening the proceedings, Mr.
Powys went up to George Caldecott, who
had been pointed out to him by the
inspector, and, holding out his hand, said
to him—
“So you’re George Caldecott, ehP my
sister Lucy’s boy P Yes; I can see you are.
Well, shake hands on it, nephew. I’m
glad to meet you. And what on earth are
you doing in Australia—and here, of all
places in Australia?”
Caldecott briefly explained to his uncle
that he had turned digger, and that this
adventure with the bushrangers had be-
fallen bim whilst making his way on foot
to the Magenta rush.
“ But, good gracious, sir, what a fool
you must have been ! —and with your
prospects, too ! I thought my case was a
bad one when I exchanged a majority in
the Legion for a commissionership in the
Colonial service, but from the Bifles to
digging—faugh ! ” and Mr. Powys ap-
peared as if he were quite oppressed with
the notion.
“You needn’t vex yourself about me, I
assure you, uncle. I’m perfectly con-
tented—in fact, rather like the life,” said
George, somewhat brusquely.
“Well, my boy, I’m glad to see you,
anyway. Your mother and I weren t
always the best of friends, but you and I
needn’t trouble our heads about that.
Come and take up your quarters with me


for as long as you like. I like the look of
you—by Jove ! I do. And so you’re poor
Lucy’s boy. Well, well! how the time
does go ! Let me think : I was in Spain
when you were bom.”
Mr. Neal, hearing the word Spain fall
from the lips of Mr. Powys, was sore afraid
that the History of the Legion was about
to be commenced in detail for George’s
special edification, so he came up to where
the uncle and nephew were talking apart,
to prevent, if he could, the realization of
any such intention.
“ Excuse me, Mr. Powys,” said he,
“ but I think you’ll best get the investi-
gation over as soon as possible. The
bodies are beginning to be very offensive.
It won’t take you long to rattle through
the affair.” And the inspector, by em-
phasizing the “you,” meant to imply that
the magistrate he was addressing was a
pre-eminently sharp fellow; one that could
rattle through an official enquiry with
extreme dispatch.
“Certainly, Neal, certainly. We’ll
begin at once,” said the commissioner,
evidently pleased with the compliment.
“But, nephew,” added he, “mind you
come back with me after this is over.”
“ Thanks, uncle, but I’m under engage-
ment to visit a Mr. Walton—Mr. Walton
of Uralmindry. I must keep my promise
there ; but when I leave, I’ll come over to
Mitta Mitta, where I believe you live?”
“Yes, Mitta Mitta’s the place; a just
bearable dreariness, I call it; very little
society, and that little devilish bad. We
have a kind of a club, though, and—well
—things ain’t quite so bad as they might
be. And, now I come to think of it, you’re
in the right about Uralmindry, quite right.
The little girl will have coin, sir, and hang
me! if I don’t think you’re the fellow to
win her and it. Try for it, George—for
the it. I expect you’ve got to realize by
this time how pleasant it is to have money!
Heigho! how pleasant it is to have money !
By the bye, do you want any ? I can give
you a cheque before we leave here, if you
do?” J
“No, thanks; I’ve enough for present
requirements. Don’t you know Mr. Hay,
though, uncle?”
“No; I never met him before, to my
knowledge, though I’ve heard of him often
enough. You can introduce him.”
Caldecott acted on the suggestion. Mr.
Hay was perfectly polite, but extremely I
cold, in his manner to Mr. Powys—so 1
markedly so, that George could not help
noticing it.
“You have reason to he proud of your
nephew, sir,” said the old gentleman; “he
has behaved with signal courage, and
deserves well of all honest men. He
has certainly done the district a great
service.”
“ Yes! there can’t be a doubt of it. It’s
more than the district would do for him,
though ! But, excuse me, Neal is waxing
impatient, and I think that noise in the
kitchen is likely to be a trifle more uproari-
ous before the end of another hour. I’ll
get to work at once. I suppose I must
have a look at the bodies.”
The examination of the corpses, though
performed in a most perfunctory way, left no
possible doubt on Mr. Powys’s mind as to
the cause of death in each particular case.
Constable Rumford and Hamlin had each
received their death-shot in the brain.
Mike Callaghan’s wounds were in his throat
and breast. Mr. Powys was so perfectly
satisfied with what he saw in the stable
that on leaving it he gave immediate orders
for the burial of the bodies.
“ I suppose,” he said to the inspector,
“that you and I ought to attend at the
funeral of Rumford. See that everything’s
ready; and as soon as I’ve examined the
driver, young Caldecott, and constable
Morgan, we’ll put the poor fellow under-
ground with all honour. I shan’t want
you.”
Mr. Powys then entered the room which
had been prepared for the occasion, and
opened the official enquiry.
“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “time is
precious. I’ve got to be in Mitta Mitta by
noon to-morrow, and there’s poor Rumford
to bury before leaving for Reynolds’s. You
that I call upon will just answer, as briefly
as ever you like, the questions I put to you,
and we shall get on like a house on fire.
Now, driver! ” And Mr. Powys plied the
driver with some two or three dozen ques-
tions, eliciting from the answers thereto
given the main facts of the s ticking-up.
Constable Morgan and George Caldecott
were next questioned with similar celerity
and brevity, but were not asked for any
statement.
As soon as these three witnesses had been
examined, Mr. Cosgrove came forward and
volunteered a statement.
“ Excuse me, Mr. Cosgrove, but I’ve got
all the facts I want. You see, my dear sir,
this is not a coroner’s court. All I have to


do is to satisfy myself of the manner in
which those three fellows out there came by
their death. I’m quite satisfied, thoroughly
satisfied, that my nephew there shot the
two bushrangers, and that constable Rum-
ford was shot by Hamlin, the younger ®f
the two scoundrels. Why, then, should I
waste any time? ”
“ But, your worship,” said Mr. Cosgrove,
“there are circumstances connected with
the sticking-up—the conduct of the police,
for example—which I think should be
made public.”
“ By all means, Mr. Cosgrove; make any-
thing you choose public, Why not ? But,
excuse me, not by me. The newspapers
are open to you. Or you can address the
Colonial Secretary. My course is clear.
The enquiry is over. And now, gentlemen,
what say you to a mouthful of rum and
water, as the initial step in the funeral pro-
ceedings ? ”
Mr. Cosgrove had been very anxious to
expose Mr. Inspector Neal’s conspicuous
cowardice on the day previous, more from
a desire to enhance Mr. Caldecott’s merits
than from any ill-will to the ungallant police
officer. Finding that Mr. Powys was his
rescuer’s uncle, Mr. Cosgrove did not
care to press the matter against Mr.
Neal, since he felt certain George’s
interests were safe in his uncle’s
hands. It thus happened that the in-
spector “pulled through” triumphantly.
The report of the magisterial investigation,
when sent in by Mr. Powys, bore testimony
to the gallant officer’s zeal, courage, and
tact. The manager of the Septentrional
Bank at Mitta Mitta remarked to himself
some days afterwards, when he noticed in
the S. M. Herald a paragraph referring to
the investigation, what a strange coinci-
dence it was that the date of the enquiry
held by Mr. Powys should correspond with
that on which the worthy commissioner
had obtained a promissory-note from the
bank —a form which was returned for dis-
count purposes two days afterwards, filled in
in such a way as to show that at four
months from date Charles Neal promised
to pay Mr. Thomas Powys, or order, the
sum of one hundred pounds sterling, value
received.

TOWN GOSSIP.
“ Next Session/’ like ‘•to-morrow/’
never comes. Man never is but always
to be blessed. Yes! next session it
shall be considered. Next session!
So, masters all, possess your souls in
patience till—next session. Then re-
form shall bourgeon and blossom, and
bring forth its fruits. Boards shall
drain and light and water the beauti-
ful city, to everybody's content. Gene-
ral schemes of sanitary reform shall
be done all at once, without commence-
ment and without end—next session I
The Land Act shall be amended—
next session ! The criminal laws shall
be consolidated —next session ! In
view of all these promises, we prog-
nosticate that next session will be
longer than the average one, and that
it will continue at its hard work de
die in diem Irom the day of its com-
mencement, the Greek kalends, until
Parliaments have ceased by effluxion
of time. Why could not the Assembly
have voted the needful to begin the
general scheme of drainage, approved
of by Mr. Clark, by constructing the
drain along Bourke-street to Shea's
Creek ? Why on earth postpone the
matter till next session on a vague
Ministerial promise. The scheme,
general or particular, will have to be
begun somewhere; wey not at the
point suggested by Mr. Davies, espe-
cially, as was clearly pointed out by
Sir John Robertson, as the Bourke-
street sewer is urgently wanted, and
is designed to fit into the complete
plan of sewerage approved by Mr.
Clarke ? Why put off the evil day,
until typhoid is raging in our midst!
Why ? Simply because, ‘ ‘ after me
the deluge ” is the motto of the poli-
ticians who consider themselves
statesmen.
One would be disposed to think that
the twenty-two cricketers who met in
the Ashfield ground on Saturday last
must have been either excessively
manly or downright lunatics to play a
match on such a broiling day. They
were probably in the proportion of six
of one to half a dozen of the other.


But all extremes meet, and these ex-
tremely rash individuals having met
for the purpose of again testing the
respective powers of the Ashfield and
Manly muffs, and the Ashfield club
having prepared a sumptous repast to
do honor to their visitors, as well as a
brass band to enliven the proceedings,
the match had to come off, and was
played out in defiance of the weather.
As we did not hear of any cases of sun-
stroke, we presume that no fatal con-
sequences ensued. A southerly buster
came on at about four o’clock, which
cooled the air to a great extent; but
the game was virtually over before
that hour, the Manly eleven finally
triumphing with two wickets to spare.
Where every man present risked his
life so freely, it would be invidious to
particularise.
The age of the “ Vagabond” is a
quosstio much vexata in town circles.
Gagliostro-like, he reveals to the
readers of his papers occasional hints
wherefrom to wing guesses at a solu-
tion of the mystery. He was present
at all the “strikes" of the past.
He was under fire in all the great
engagements of the War of Secession.
He has commanded South American
armies. He has enjoyed the intimacy
of all European diplomats, generals,
singers, detectives, and traviata. He
has owned circuses, managed theatres,
and edited papers ia all quarters of
the globe. Then he was for years a
railway superintendent. On the whole
we put him down at a hundred. Pro-
bably that’s about a square thing !
On dit that the disturbance which
took place on Sunday week in Hyde
Park was, in reality, not got up by
Roman Catholic roughs, but by “ Pro-
testant boys ” anxious to make it
appear that there was a necessity for
certain “ Loyal '* lodges to rally round
Pastor Allen on the following Sabbath.
This, however, may be only tall talk.
What a melancholy farce, in this land
of perfect freedom, is the keeping up by
Irishmen of opposite creeds of a feud
which, even in Ulster, ought tohave been
buried a couple of generations back !
Gentle Reader, —Bearing in mind
the while that there is a surplus at the
Treasury, note carefully the contents
of subjoined paragraphs clipped from
the Report of Dr. F. N. Manning on
the Hospital for the Insane, Gladesville,
for the year 1877 :— •* I feel called upon
to repeat the statement contained in my
report for the year 1876, that the num-
ber of admissions during the year is
now beyond what is either right or safe.
The reception and treatment of such a
number of cases in an old, overcrowded
and very imperfect hospital, is a task
beyond the powers of the staff; and
the congregation of such a number of
patients in the acuter stages of their
malady in a limited space, is productive
of turmoil and excitement, and fatal to
good management and successful treat-
ment It is a sad and striking fact,
and speaks volumes for the inadequacy
and imperfection of the present lunacy
statutes, that all the cases of a severe
and distressing malady admitted into
hospital daring the year, with the ex-
ception of 10 per cent., should have
been paraded in the Police Court and
confined in the prison. I regret
that I have once more to repeat the now
oft-told tale of distressing overcrowd-
ing. The opening of the temporary
asylum at Cooma gave a small and
temporary ; but by the close of
the year the numbers had again risen
to upwards of 600, and the condition of
the wards was as bad as I depicted in
my last one in several prior annual
reports. A large and important addi-
tion to the laundry has been carried out
during the year, and various minor
alterations and improvements have
been effected under the direction
of the Colonial Architect. The other
requirements mentioned in my report
for 1876 are however still unsupplied.
To one of these, means and appliances
for extinguishing fire, I attach a special
importance. It is now eight years
since I first forwarded requisitions for
this service, and during the past year
I have again addressed you specially
on this subject. I am importunate
because the danger to be apprehended
from fire in an institution of this


character is ever present and terrible.”
We would ask ; Is Dr. Manning to go
on asking year after year for the means
to make the Gladesville Hospital all
that it should be—in vain ? The mis-
chievous effects of party mis-govern-
ment require no more convincing proof
than the fact of a charitable institution
like that at Gladesville being allowed
to drift into an almost inefficient con-
dition through lack of men “ who can’*
at the Executive Council table.
A Melbourne telegram, dated last
Saturday, informed the good people of
this colony that Sir James M‘Culloch
intends to retire from the Victorian
Parliament at the close of the session :
it also went on to remark that that
eminent politician disavows any in-
tention of entering the New South
Wales Parliament.” Isn’t it kind of
him ? One would think that the people
of New South Wales might have some-
thiug to say in such a matter. The
Collins-street knight (if it be true that
he disavows such intention) might
reflect, without prejudice to his self-
esteem, on the pathetic burden of a
certain English ballad —“ Nobody axe i
you, Sir, she said l’ J
The Eastern Question seems ri-
pening for war. Austria and England
are terribly annoyed at being kept in
the dark as to the full terms of the
Russo-Turkish treaty, and are quite
likely to vent their spite at being out-
diplomatised by going to war. It is
quite possible that next week we shall
be compelled to continue our “ War
News.”
Some advertisers have a very vague
way of expressing themselves—
“ A dog followed a party—
Owner can have it on giving description,
&c.”
Now, if the dog had given a party, or
if he had, in any way, disturbed the
harmony of a party, or assaulted or
bitten a party, there might have been:
some ground for bringing his conduct
before the public ; but merely for fol-
lowing ? Perhaps, however, it
was a female party —one of the class
to whom “ no followers are allowed.”
When we consider the number of
parties who have dogs following them
every day, and the fact that the ad-
vertisement applies equally to every
kind of dog and every kind of party,
we feel lost in amazement at the wide
field of conjecture it opens up.
We call the attention of our readers
to the subjoined clipping from the
Bookseller (Jan. 18), as it relates to a
practice much in vogue at present in
this colony :—“ There are, however,
more rogues than one, who, with old
copperplates, old woodcuts, unsale-
able remainders, and half-spoilt oleo-
graphs, make a pretty penny out of
the British public. The celebrated
coupon trick, whereby a worthless old
plate is passed off as something to be
eagerly sought for, yet appears in
country papers, and booksellers will
do well, when possible, to enlighten
their customers as to these tricksters.”
The general public thoroughly en-
dorse the notion of giving Mrs. Plun-
kett a pension. Hers is so exceptional
a case that were an annuity granted to
her the circumstance could hardly be
twisted into a precedent. Let us hope
that the declining years of the widow
of a good and true colonist and loyal
public servant, who wore the white
flower of a blameless life through
good and evil report, may be smoothed
for her by a timely appropriation of
public funds to her need. The me-
mory of John Hubert Plunkett surely
deserves this of New South Wales.
All sensible men say “ Hear, hear,”
to the honest outspoken speech of the
Colonial Secretary, with reference to
the Hyde Park riots. The idea of
liberty of speech and Pastor Allen
being spoken of in the same breath!
It is absurd ; and we, as you do, Mr.
Fitzpatrick, trample upon the liberty
of speech that is employed to insult
large bodies of the population. To
Mr. Allen we would say with Gifford: —
“ Why should’Bt thou, with abortive toil
Waste the poor remnant of thy sputtering oil
In bigot raving ? Ignorant and absurd !
Pause from thy pains and take our closing word,
Thou ean’st not think, nor have we power to tell
How much we scorn and loathe thee —so fare-
well ! ”

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.”—lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers “ a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature. — S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says: —It is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
tor the desirableness of building up a
SL«spectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. GP_,os, iShallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine.— Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Country
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
bydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
-the day are touched in its columns, must
aaturally render the Sydney o)ice a Week
a welcome visitor in every house, and an
agreeable companion to every reader. —
Smthern Argus (Groulburn).
u Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
p ■ irance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
■ s.vlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a magazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands abetter
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are bom but to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News %
The Singleton Argus says The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and C 0.., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.” —Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may be per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend that
everything in the shape of “ news items
should be omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted, -thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo , a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the ‘ ‘ Paradise Lost ’ ’—intended for the use
of University candidates—a clever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sphinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hop * the new
organ will en j oy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors.— Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains wed written papers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary ot
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Svdney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney.— Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week. —This is the title of anew
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Et cetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterfield Star says:—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well j
written tales and humourous sketches, :
and other entertaining matter. The price |
is sixpence, and this moderate charge j
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it j ustly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says : —We have
looked the book carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages.— Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining ; it is deserving of a
good circulation.— Border Post( Alburyj.
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgee).
The Bathurst Free Press says:— lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper.— Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers.— Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element?”


“Sydney Once a Week” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine hearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
local. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches —we
note specially “'lhe Best Dog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,”—
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
The verses in the first number, entitled
* An Australian Idyll” are very far above
the average of contributions to the “ poets’
corner.” It is an affecting story, well told.
After the custom of English magazine
conductors, the proprietors of Sydney
Once a Week offer prizes to successful
competitors in the riddle arena. In the
second number appeared the prologue of
a story called “ The Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry,” which is to be the piece de resistance
in he way of serial romance, OnceaWeek
wl ich is edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, a
litterateur of lengthened colonial experi-
ence, and published by Messrs. Gibbs,
Shallard, and Co., we can conscientiously
recommend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
Those who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse our opinion .—Cumberland Mer-
cury.
The Sydney “Once a Week ’’—The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and genera
get up are equal to those of the firs'-
number which w had occasion to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light reading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. The “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry Road,” has reached the third chap-
ter. The interest of the story in no way
flags. The “War News” and “Town
Gossip ” are readable articles, and the
comic papers sparkle with humour. There
are several pieces of original poetry; and
two or three pages devoted to “Columns
for young readers,” containing charades,
puzzles, &c. Altogether the number does
credit to editor and printer.— S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers.— Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says:—“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written —the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “ Best Cog in the Colony.”
We wish the proprietor every success, as,
in our opinion, the publication, if well
conducted, will supply a want long felt in
Sydney, and add to the far too small stock
of Australian literature. We have every
confidence in recommending “ Once a
Week” to the favorable notice of our
readers.”
“Sydney Once a Week.”— We have
just received the eighthnumber of “ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might be lost to the general
public, and also established a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week.— This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most mter-
• esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches.
S. M. Herald.
