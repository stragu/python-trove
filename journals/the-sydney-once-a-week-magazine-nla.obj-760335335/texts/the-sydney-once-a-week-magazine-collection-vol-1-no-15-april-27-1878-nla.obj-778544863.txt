AUSTRALIA'S CENTENNIAL.
Wk shall feel obliged to our Subscribers by an
early intimation of any irregularity in the
delivery of weekly numbers, that it may at
once be rectified.
NB.—Advertisements for “SYDNEY ONCE A
WEEK’’ will be received up to ten o’clock on
Thursday morning.
If, as wise men from Solomon to
Martin Tupper have told us, there
be a wonderful prudence in taking
time by the forelock, Mr. Charles
Robinson deserves immense kudos
for warning New South Wales that
if she doesn't mind thn year of
grace 1888 will be here before
things are in order for holding
Australia’s Centennial. Assuming
that it is of absolute necessity, this
celebrating by exhibitions, wie her
triennial septennial, decennial, cen-
tennial, or what not, of national
birthdays, Mr. Robinson makes the
practical suggestion that now, ten
whole years in advance of the
hundredth anniversary of Phil-
lip’s proclaiming the foundation of


New South Wales—that now, in
1878, is the time for securing a
site for the Exhibition of 1888 : and
he shows to the complete routing
of the arguments advanced by his
friend, Mr. Reid, that between
Ashfield and Petersham is the
very spot that ought to be secured.
Mr. Reid is for a site in the
vicinity of Moore Park, a locality
witheringly denounced by Mr.
Robinson, who we imagine must,
at some period of his career, have
dropped coin at Randwick, as a
flat, sultry hollow. Supposing we
allow two or three, or even four
years for the necessary free fighting
over this question of site, time
enough will be left for going into
building and other details.
Will four years, however, be
enough for this battle of the sites ?
Will not the “dense populations”
of Parramatta, of North Shore, of
Manly, have something to say
why the Centennial should not be
held agin’ their place ? Then,
again, something might be said by
those who never like to offend any-
one’s prejudices or to cross any-
one’s views as to the advantages
that might accrue from holding the
worlds fair of 1888 on Garden
Island or Cockatoo. We should not
wonder much, though, if the discus-
sion start°d by Mr. Robinson led to
a free gift being made to the nation
bv some of our princely
say, by Sir Daniel Cooper or the
Hon. Mr. Lord, or other well
known patriots, of apiece of ground
of park-like proportions! At all
events, we may fairly assume that
the land will be got, duly dedicated,
vested, and all that sort of thing,
sometime within the next lustrum.
That being so, are there not other
steps to be taken to further Mr.
Robinson’s idea ? Certainly there
are. A committee —say a Royal
Commission —should at once be ap-
pointed ! Who can estimate the
results of ten years systematic
“ blowing” by some three or four
dozen patriotic Royal Commis-
sioners ? Just think of it! Ten full
years of advertising, circular send-
ing, and discussing! And, of
course, one can’t have a Royal Com-
mission without a secretary, or, per-
haps, even two secretaries, if one
comes to think of all that ought to
be said of our unparalleled climate,
our beautiful harbour, the loveliness
of our women, the prowess of onr
native youth, our coal, and so on.
Even if the Royal Commission were
appointed to-morrow, its members
would have their work cut out.
Would they not, inter alia , have to
train up a corps of decent waiters,
secure the services of someone who
understood how to cater properly
for large numbers, and nag inces-
santly at the ephemeral Government
of the day until the State railways
were adequate to the task of pro-
viding for the wants of pleasure-
seekers, and until prize sheep, in
healthy condition, could be per-
mitted unrestricted ingress to, and
egress from, the metropolitan dis-


trict? Then time is wanted for
foreign states to educate executive
commissioners to a knowledge that
there is such a place as the “ queen
city of the Australias,” and make
all other requisite preparations.
Should the “ native horn ” Minis-
ters act upon Mr. Robinson’s motion
and appoint a Royal Commission,
there is no reason why the labours
of such a body should be confined to
merely arranging things for 1888.
Why not for 1906 as well, the three
hundredth anniversary of the sight-
ing of the Great Southern Land by
Quiros, or for 1916 the three hun-
dredth anniversary of old Dirk
Hartog’s christening the Land of
Concord! A very little ingenuity
would keep the ball a-rolling. The
Commissioners could take order for
sub-exhibitions of a secondary cha-
racter; say, on the anniversary of
the gift to the people of New South
Wales of a Centennial Exhibition
Park by Sir D. Cooper, or on that
of the date of Mr. C. Robinson’s
happy thought Some arrangements
ought to be made about Trickett !
The Commissioners should certainly
secure him, alive or dead for the
Centennial. We trust sincerely our
great sculler may be alive in 1888,
but seeing he is but mortal, arrange-
ments should be made in the event of
his dymg before that date for having
him artistically stuffed! Similar-
arrangements might be made with
regard to Parkes, McElhone,
D. Buchanan, Pastor Allen, the
Flying Pieman, and other cele-
brities. As Mr. Kobinson says,
no time is to be lost. What
is ten years ? Is it not after
all, too limited a time in which to
do so great work as New South
Wales has to perform? Knowing
how little the colony has done
politically in the past decade, let
us be wise in time! Let us buy a
Centennial Exhibition site if we
can’t get one gratis, and see to the
appointing of a Royal Commission,
with Robinson (whom we opine to
be related to the
“J. P.
Robinson, he
Who said the world ’d go right if he
holler’d out Gee ! ”)
With Robinson, we repeat, as
Secretary; with Gh H. Reid as
Historiographer; and with Jules
Joubert and Augustus Morris as
salaried Executive Commissioners,
these steps, even if they did
nothing else, would give remunera-
tive employment to several very
deserving individuals, besides af-
fording to a number of self-sufficient
old gentlemen the opportunity of
indulging once or twice a month in
the twaddling purring which is made
by a clever fellow like Joubert or
Robinson, to mean this, that, or
the other thing, as it suits his
book.
By all means let us prepare at
once for the Australian Centen-
nial.


BY THE SEA.
The caves of the sea have been troubled
to-day
With the water which widens, and wid-
ens, and fills;
And a boat with our brother was driven
away
By a wind that came down from the
bays of the hills.
Behold I have seen on the threshold again
A face in a dazzle of hair!
Do you know that she watches the rain
and the main,
And the waves which are moaning
there ?
Ah, moaning and moaning there!
Now turn from your casements and fasten
your doois,
And cover your faces, and pray, if you
can :
There are wails in the wind, there are
sighs on the shores,
And alas, for the fate of a storm-beaten
man!
Oh ! dark falls the night on the rain-rutted
verge,
So sad with the sound of the foam!
Oh, wild is the sweep—is the swirl of the
surge,
And his boat may never come Home !
Ah, never, may never come home!
HENRY KENDALL.
ICHNEUMON V. SNAKE
ENCOUNTER BETWEEN AN ICHNEUMON
AND AUSTRALIAN SNAKES.
BY "RUS."
I have no knowledge of natural his-
tory beyond the little I have picked
up in the casual reading of popu-
lar books : but it is quite probable
that from ray own observation, I know
more of the habits of the ichneumon
than can be found in any published
work; and certainly I am able ti say
positively that some st dements on this
subject, which I have seen in works,
apparently of authority, are without
foundation.
The knowledge which I have thus
gained of the habits and characteris-
tics of this singular animal, may be
briefly stated as follows :
(l) It has no immunity from the
€ fleets of snake poison, but if bitten it
dies, like any other animal.
(2) It does not resort to any root or
herb as an antidote to the effects of
snake bit*.
(3) In contending with snakes it
owes its safety to its keenness of sight
and marvellous rapidity of motion.
(4) It never attacks a snake except
at the back of the neck.
(5) It knows at a glance whether
or not a snake is venomous, even al-
though it be of a species which it can
never have seen before.
Some years ago a friend of mine in
Sydney became possessed of one of
these animals, just brought from
India. It may be presumed that it
had been captured when young, and
that probably it had never en-
countered a snake, and that certainly
it h id never seen one of an Austra-
lian species.
I was invited to witness a trial to be
made at the Australian Museum of its
famed powers of snake-killing, and
gladly obeyed the summons. I have
never before committed to writing, or
made any note of what i then saw,
but the scene was so interesting and
so remarkable that its incidents re-
curred frequently to my mind and be-
came fixed in my memory.
I was surpnsed to see that the ich-
neumon was a harmless looking little
animal, about eight or nine inches in
length, without the tail. From the
hind-quarters to the tip of the mse,
which was long and pointed, its body
tapered away, thus forming a kind of
cone. Its appearance was gentle and
innocent, it was without formidable
teeth or claws, and might be handled
without danger of scratching or
biting.
In the presence of two or three spec-
tators it was introduced into a glass
case about 40 inches in length and 20
inches in breadth, where already had
been placed a non-venemous snake of
the carpet kind, about 20 inches long,
and of the usual proportions.
The gentle aspect of the little Ich-
neumon immediately vanished and


was replaced by one of caution quite
unmixed with fear ; for whilst keeping
at a respectful distance from the snake,
it hopped about watching for an op-
portunity for attack, apparently with
much enjoyment.
The demeanour of the snake was
very different. It recognised at once
the presence of a deadly enemy, and
retre >ted in terror to the farthest cor-
ner of the case, lifting its head as far
as it could, about six inches above the
floor, with its back in the corner, evi-
dently for the purpose of placing the
back of its neck as far as possible out
of reach of the ichneumon.
The position of things at this stage
of the encounter, presents some diffi-
cult, or rather insoluble problems. I
should like to know how the ichneumon
knew that the snake Was not venomous,
as shown by its playful demeanour, at
the same time that it took care not to
risk an attack until it could do so
without danger from the fatal coils and
formidable teeth of its antagonist. I
should also like to know how the snake
recognised at once as a formidable
enemy, this contemptible looking little
animal, whose size could hardly have
exceeded that of its ordinary prey,
and which apparently, it could easily
have crushed in its folds and swal-
lowed whole in an instant; and how
it knew that the back of its neck was
the part liable to attack. I fancy I
fancy I can hear these questions
answered instantly in a kind of asinine
chorus, with the words, “Oh, they
knew all this by instinct of course.’'
Now instinct is a word which I
abhor, and which ought to be for ever
expelled from every speech or writing
having any pretensions to accuracy of
statement. What do we mean if we
say that these animals knew these
things by instinct ?We mean that we
have not the slightest idea of how they
came by this knowledge, our ignor-
ance being accompanied by a strong
impression that the wh )le thing is be-
yond the reach of human understand-
ing. Then why not say just that—
why not say that we do not know,
instead of putting on a pseudo scien-
tific appearance of explanation by the
use of the word instinct ?
The snake having; raised its head to
the utmost extent of its strength,
could not maintain the position for
many minutes, but was obliged to
lower itself at intervals for temporary
rest. The ichneumon catching a
favourable opportunity, with a sudden
bound seized the snake by the back
of the neck and held fast. The snake
made no attempt to use its teeth, but
began slowly to wind its folds around
its unpleasant little enemy. When
the folds reached the hind quarters, it
seemed all over with the ichneumon.
One fold more and it would have been
completely enveloped and crushed to
death. The ichneumon seemed to
know all this better than he did, for
just at the critical moment it let go its
hold, slipped out of the folds, and
sprang to rhe other end of the enclo-
sure with a m irvellous agility like to
nothing on earth that I had ever seen
before.
The demeanour of the ichneumon
might now be described a< “ jolly.”
It seemed to enjoy the sport, r«nd
might a most be fancied to be saying
to itself like the Yankee under similar
circumstances, “ Well, this is an
exciting little game.
Over and over again the same ma-
noeuvres were repeated, the snake
growing weaker and weaker, and the
ichneumon bolder and bolder. Time
after time it was enclosed in the coils
of the snake, and every time it slipp d
out scathless, its escape being much
facilitated by the peculiar conical form
of its body.
After a time the snake became too
much exhausted to raise its head above
the floor, and endeavoured to protect
the back of its neck by enclosing its
head and neck in its own folds. Even
then the ichneumon, dancing proudly
about on the prostrate form of its
antagonist, disdained to adopt any but
its usual mode of attack, and watching
between the folds with its keen little
eyes, found occasional opportunities
of seizing the snake as usual by the
back of the neck. At last the snake


became too weak to squeeze off the
ichneumon, and after suffering a pro-
longed biting, it died.
The ichneumon did not gnaw or
attempt to eat any part of the carcase,
but took no further notice of it. To it
the whole affair seemed to be a mere
matter of sport.
After allowing the ichneumon a short
interval of rest, a death-adder, about
nine or ten inches long, was placed
under the glass case. The snake lay
torpidly in the middle of tho floor of
the case. The demeanour of the ich-
neumon underwent a complete change.
Its lively hopping about gave place to
a cautious and stealthy tread. It crept
round the enclosure with its eyes fixed
on the snake with a look of extreme
vigilance. The snake took no notice
of it. Suddenly the ichneumon made
a spring and seized the adder by the
back of the neck, and the snake at the
same instant attempted to bite its foe.
This part of the proceedings was too
much like sleight-of-hand, the motions
too rapid, for us to discern with cer-
tainty exactly what took place. How-
ever, the ichneumon had the snake in
its teeth, but did not, as in the former
case, hold fast, but merely lifted it up
and then, hurling it to the floor with
such strength as it had, bounded to
the other end of the enclosure with the
speed of thought. We could not be
sure whether or not it had been bitten
in this encounter. It worked its jaws
and licked its fips in a peculiar manner,
but the purport and intention of this
performance we were not able to con-
jecture.
The aspect of the ichneumon no
longer disclosed the keen enjoyment
of the sportsman, bub rather the des-
perate determination of the gladiator
centending for his life.
After this first attack the snake lay
quiescent as before. The ichneumon
renewed its attack, and, after a few
more encounters such as 1 have de-
scribed, the snake was killed. The
ichneumon, as before, took no notice of
the body. A second and, I think, a
third adder was killed in the same way
and then the exhibition closed.
The ichneumon was afterwards taken
by its owner to the country, where,
after killing a great number of snakes,
it was placed by some stfipid person in
a hollow log which a snake had been
seen to enter. It is supposed that it
had not room for its usual tactics, for
it was bitten and died.
SPORTING ADVENTURES
IN AUSTRALIA.
BY CHARLEY CORNSTALK.
( Continued).
Everything being ready, and it
being now 12 o’clock and the specta-
tors becoming impatient, after some
little trouble owing to the fresh con-
dition of the horses, a good start was
effected by the dropping of a hand-
kerchief, and away went the six com-
petitors in close order.
The first four leaps were over stiff
iron bark fences. Rory O’More led the
way over the first flight, closely fol-
lowed by Marquis, Chevalier, and the
Mountain Maid. Proserpine struck
the top rail heavily and came down,
but recovered herself and took the
next three fences in good style. Moon-
light refused the first fence, but nego-
tiated it on a second trial. At the
fourth fence Marquis, cleverly ridden
by M‘Lean, showed in front, with the
Mountain Maid hard held at his quar-
ter, Chevalier and Moonlight well up.
In this order they continued taking
their leaps without a baulk half-way
round the course, where a formidable
obstacle presented itself in the shape
of a log fence nearly five feet high
and about as.wide at the base. The
Mountain Maid rushed at this and
took it in a magnificent flying leap a
clear three lengths ahead of the field,
and it was all Jem could do to prevent
her from bolting at the turn. As it
was he took a circuit of a hundred
yards or more before he got her head
round again. This threw him back
fourth in the race, the Marquis closely
waited upon by Chevalier and Moon-
light having put a couple of sapling
fences behind him. Rory O’More


had refused the timber jump, and the
black mare was some distance astern.
The grey’s stride soon brought her
into elose quarters with the leading
horses again, and as they neared the
artificial leap where Jem s fall had
taken place the day before, they still
kept the same order with about a
length between each horse. Here
Miss Fanny Burton’s colors came to
grief, Chevalier going through a
second acrobatic feat at the double
jump, and bolting without his rider.
Jem being on the outside of the course
now came up with a rush, the mare
pulling hard, and giving Moonlight
the go by, landed the next moment a
good seven feet on the far side of the
cutting close on to the heels of
Mbrquis. The Yarrawa colors were
now both in front, and if Jem had paid
close attention to the advice of his
trainer he would undoubtedly have
pulled off the race. But he lost his
head altogether in the intoxication of
success, and instead of koeping the
mare in hand for the water jump and
then making play, he was racing for
place with his rival. Neck and neck
they approached the creek, when the
Mountain Maid, suddenly catching a
glimpse of the water, swerved to the
right, and in spite of all her rider’s
efforts cleared a low paling fence,
crossed the garden at the back of the
stand, leapt two set 3 of slip panels,
and galloped up to the stable door,
where she stopped of her own accord,
leaving Jem Cnrtis in the position of
John Gilpin at the end of his far-famed
race,
“Nor stopped till where he first got up
He did again get down.”
Marquis winning a well ridden race
by four lengths, Moonlight second,
and the rest nowhere.
Thus ended the Yarrawa steeple-
chase, not altogether to the discomfi-
ture of our hero, who had ridden a
hitherto notoriously unmanageable
horse, with great pluck and judgement.
Jem was, nevertheless, very sore
when he was chaffed for coming in at
the back of the stand where the ladies
could not see him, but Archibald
M‘Lean, who was a fine manly fellow,
and as we have seen, a splendid horse-
man, spoke in such high terms of his
riding, that it was impossible to
cherish any unkindly feeling towards
the winner, and when Georgie, who
was unusually soft and gracious in her
manner, whispered to him that even-
ing that her friend Archie was posi-
tively engaged to Fanny Burton, there
was not a particle of alloy in Jem’s
cup of happiness.
VIC HASN’T COT THE
COAL.
Bold Francis is a man of parts.
Which no one can deny ;
The fire of large causality
Twinkles in his eye.
The terminus in Vic. he got —
’Tis known from pole to pole—
But there’s no mistake about it
Vic. hasn’t got the coal.
He slaughtered Saul and Henry,
The Gentile and the Jew;
It was no use their trying
To cock-a-doodle do-o.
Black diamonds in the struggle
Never pained his soul;
But there’s no mistake about it,
Vic. hasn’t got the coal.
The Argus, whose philosophy
Is quite profound of late,
In classic language muttered—
‘‘What’s the odds if all is slate ?**
But slates are things to figure on
When totting up the whole ;
And there’s no mistake about,
Vic. hasn’t got the coal.
Here’s three times three for New
South Wales,
For Saul and Henry too ;
We’ll stick to her like cobbler’s wax
Till the blackest coal burns blue.
We are not proud, and do not wish
To put Vic. in the hole ;
But there’s no mistake about it,
Vic. hasn’t got the coal.

THE REVENGE.
A TRUE STORY.
BY A BUSHMAN.
James Oakland was the only son of a
wealthy squatter in this colony. His
father spared no expense on his edu-
cation in order that he might become
a useful member of society. Although
a n tive of Melbourne, James received
roost of his education at one of the
highest schools in England. A few
years ago he arrived in Sydney, when
he took charge of one of his father’s
stations, the Varalla, situated near
the charming town of Spotley. The
station prospered under his charge,
and his men loved him, for he was
gentle and kind to them. One day,
however, he had occasion to visit
Sp tley on business. At daylight he
started from Varalla for Spotley, a
distance of twenty-five miles, intend-
ing to be back by sunset. He reached
the township about nine o’clock, and
having stabled his horse at the Spotley
Inn, and partaken of a little refresh-
ment, he went on his way. Having
transacted his business satisfactorily,
he returned to the inn intending to
start for home as soon as possible.
He entered the dining-room, where
about a dozen men were assembled,
and sat down to dinner. He conversed
with them until the waiter came round
to collect the money. Oakland having
no small change, pulled out a roll of
bank notes and tendered one as
payment. The men looked aston-
ished, but said nothing. Presently
the waiter returned with the change
of the note, and Oakland started
on his journey to Varalla at three
o’clock. He rode on about ten
miles, when a man suddenly appeared
from the bush demanding “ his money
or his life,” and pointing at him a
loaded revolver. Oakland, however,
being a brave man, determined to de-
fend himself, and drawing his revolver
he shot the man in the head, causing
him to stagger and lie as one dead.
Oakland dismounted, and endeavoured
to revive the wounded man with some
bran iy out of his flask. He remained
with the dying bushranger until his
death, which took place about an hour
afterwards. He then galloped off to
the station, where he got two men and
returned for the dead body. Imagine
their surprise when, arriving at the
scene of the disaster, the body was
gone! There was nothing therefore
to do but to return home. A few days
afterwards a letter was found near the
house addressed to
“ Mr. James Oakland, junr .,
Varalla station
On opening the envelope a dirty
piece of paper was found inside, bear-
ing the following mysterious words, —
“ A friend warns you to be on your
guard to-night.” Fearing that some
evil was in the wind he collected all
his ow n men and as many as could be
spared from the neighboring stations.
These men having been we 1 armed
were posted on all sides of the house.
Morning came, however, and no at-
tack had been made on the house.
But on resuming their usual occupa-
tions, the men found all the home cattle
and horses lying dead on the ground,
having been stabbed with knives in
the night by the companions of the
unfortunate man whom Oakland had
shot in defence of his own life.
HOW A YOUNG MAN REMOVED
A CALF.
A Danbury young man who was once a
clerk, lately went on a farm to work.
The first night in his new position he was
detailed to remove a calf from the apart-
ment of its parent to another shed, and
while engaged, as thousands have been
before him, in shoving the contrary beast
aloLg, the mother reached under the tails
of his coat with her horns, and suddenly
lifted him up against the roof of the build-
ing with a force that threatened to shatter
every bone in his body. The first thing
he did on returning to earth was to rub
himself, the next thing was to throw up
bis place. He said he didn’t doubt that
agriculture was a noble pursuit, and that
the farmer needed an assistant in the dis-
charge of his multifarious duties, but he
didn’t believe the Creator designed him
for making sky-lights in cow sheds.


MR. THOMPSON'S SINGING LESSON.
How ready young men are as a rule—
when called upon to sing at a musical
evening—to comply with the request,
whether they are competent to do so
or not 1 They never think of the
infliction suffered by their hearers,
but screech and bawl away to their
hearts’ content; then sit down, having
finished the song very much to their
own satisfaction, and having caused
the most dreadful agony to their
audience.
Amongst other gentlemen who were
very often called on to exhibit their
vocal powers was Mr. Thompson.
This joung man felt thoroughly con-
vinced that within his manly breast
slumbered a talent which if once
brought to light would considerably
astonish the musical world. He be-
lieved that if his magnificent voice
were only properly cultivated, Sims
Keeves and all the other world-
renowned songsters would shrink into
insignificance before him. But, with
all this, he possessed the very un-
common quality of bashfulness, and,
although he was now three and twenty,
had never yet had confidence enough
to test his voice. An opportunity at
length occurred. He happened to be
staying at an hotel in the country
where at the same time an intimate
young lady friend of his was stay-
ing also. Bmng able to sing well
Ltrself, and knowing her friend’s
bashlulness, she offered, as they were
beyond the reach of criticism through
being so far from home, to teach him
to sing. “ Miss Brown,” said the
young man, “ I am afraid that were I
to try to express in words the gratitude
I feel for your kind and considerate
offer I should utterly fail. If I
searched the dictionary from beginning
to end to find a word to express my
feelings towards you at the present
moment, it would be useless. No!
Miss Brown, no words can express
what I feel. I accept your offer, and
I believe the world will have to thank
you for having brought to light a talent
which has so long lain dormant, and
which but for your kindness would
have continued so.” Miss Brown
stated her willingness to commence
and practice that evening. At about
eight o’clock the lesson began. She
gave him the scales to practice first.
Everyone in the house was quietly
engaged in their usual occupation
when they were all startled by hearing
the most unearthly sounds that were
ever listened to. One of the servants,
a girl just arrived, said she believed
the house was haunted. Another
stated it as her opinion some one was
being murdered. Suddenly a dreadful
yell, far more awful than any preceding
one, caused them to run to the place
whence the sounds proceeded. On
reaching the room they saw Mr.
Thompson sitting befoie the piano,
engaged in practising the scales.
Where Miss Brown was, I do not
pretend to say, but think she must
have fled on the production of the first
note. The girls had only just got to
the door of the room when in rushed
the landlord in a most exciteable state,
followed by a crowd from the street, all
eager to discover the iause of these
horrible sounds. Thompson had r.o
doubt in his own mind as to the reason
that brought these. What else could
it be but the charming power of his
voice, which they could not sufficiently
admire at a distance. He now felt
confident of success—confident that he
was born to be a shining light in the
musical world, and that his name
would be handed down through count-
less generations as the leading singer
of his day.
The crowd, however, did not stay
any longer than was absolutely ne-
cessary to discover the cause of the
noises that had alarmed them. But
Thompson continued at those scales
till 12 o’clock that night. He sang
them frontwards and backwards, side-
ways, and straight, crooked and all
other imaginable ways, and then re-
tired to rest. But sleep would not
visit his eyes. His mind was too ac-
tively engaged in thinking of where he
should make his debut —how much he
would charge for admission—what


would he do with all the money, &c.
These and similar thoughts filled his
excited brain, till at length he fell
asleep and dreamt—dreamt of singing
in a beautifully decorated theatre in
comp an) with a very beautiful lady.
He heard the applause of the audience
as the curtain fell, and he felt so de-
lighted that he actually kissed the
beautiful lady, who in return boxed his
ears for him; but he aid not mind it
in his joy. He was in love with her,
and determined to have her—so he
hired a carriage—hid himself in a place
she would have to pass —and waited
till she came, when he caught her in
his arms, carried her to the carriage
and was just stepping into it when he
fell on the ground and woke up to find
that he had tumbled out of bed, and
was lying on the floor with his arm
round his pillow.
The landlord next morning looked
at Thompson as though he would like
to eat him. But Thompson did not
notice it, and he practised again that
night, and the next, and the next.
But there was one thing he could not
account for, and that was that when he
had finished his practice he could
never find any one about the house
until about ten minutes afterwards,
when they slowly began to return.
The singing continued each night, and
Thompson at last began to perceive
that there were not so many people
coming to the hotel as usual; he also
noticed that the landlord had been
looking very gloomy lately, and that
whenever he saw Thompson he looked
daggers at him. But it made no
difference. Each night the sounds
became louder and more unearthly,
and each day the landlord’s face became
longer and longer, till at last he looked
the very picture of despair, and find-
ing that he could staud no more ef it,
he went to Mr. Thompson and said,
“Allow me, Sir, to congratulate you
on possessing such a remarkably power-
ful voice; it is a most magnificent
organ, but you would greatly oblige me
by not exercising it any more while
you remain in this house. You see,
the inhabitants of this town have >o
ear for good music, and cannot appre-
ciate it when they hear it, and since
you have been giving vent to those
melodious strains which nightly issue
from your manly breast all my cus-
tomers have discontinued their usual
visits to my house, and my trade is
ruined.” Thompson said he was very
sorry that the customers failed to re-
cognise the merits of his voice, but
that he intended practising for some
time yet, preparatory to giving a con-
cert in the metropolis. The landlord
looked at him for a few moments in an
imploring manner and then in a sup-
plicating voice, said Mr. Thomp-
son, say straight out what you will
take—ask any sum and I will give it if
you will only leave my house this
night.”
Mr. Thompson next day received an
invitation from a friend of his in
another country town to stay a week
with him. He immediately packed up
and started. The night he reached his
friend’s house there happened to be a
musical evening there, and he was
asked to sing—a request that he was
only too willing to comply with; but
he had hardly got three notes out
when his friend rushed up with a glass
of water and dashed it over him,
another friend unbuttoned his collar,
another placed the couch close to him,
and some of the others carried him to
it, and all this before Thompson could
realise what was the matter. When at
length he could sufficiently collect him-
self to speak, he asked the cause of this
treatment, when to his surprise simul-
taneously trom all around him came the
question, “ Weren’t you in a fit ?”
This was too much for Thompson.
He rushed out of the room, put on his
hat and coat, and fled, feeling tho-
roughly convinced that the musical
education of the people had been
shamefully neglected, and that his
powers were of far too high a class to
be appreciated by the vulgar herd.

SLEEP
Under cover of the darkness
Cometh sleep with noiseless tread.
Lightly as the falling snowflakes
Lies his touch upon each head.
Eyelids droop o’er eyes grown weary,
Tears are stayed a little while,
Hands in quiet rest are folded,
Free from one day’s care and toil.
Pain and sorrow, watches keeping,
Constant at our “ loved one’s” side,
When before them standeth smiling
Gentle Sleep, their faces hide.
With his wand he opens vistas
Into dreamland, and again
Happy scenes of youth we visit,
Friends we meet who loved us the:i.
Sleep is humble, like the sunbeams
Treats alike the rich and poor ;
Oftentimes he shuns the palace,
Enters some poor cottage door.
Welcome as the rain in summer
Ever comes this gladsome guest,
To the toilers, sick and weary,
With his benison of rest.
AGNES.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 13.
We address ourselves, in the present
issue, to the consideration of the
influence upon the health of the city,
of the manner in which our food is
kept in the shops where we pur-
chase it, or in the stores upon the
margin of our city cesspool, as well
as in the case of poor families fre-
quently, in the one only room which
such a family have at disposal for all
purposes.
We are too apt to disregard the
influences which make no immediate
appreciable mark upon their objects;
we can see dirt in its grosser form
upon the loaf which has fallen from
the baker’s cart, or upon the joint
which has contracted a palpable soil ?
and we cut off the one and wash off
the other, but we do not all recognise
the fact that as atmospheric air pene-
trates even brick and stone walls, so
the subtle gases of decomposition
are capable of penetrating all around
us, our own bodies not being excep-
tions. Clothing, furniture, food, ab-
sorb, probably in different degrees
but all absorb, the gases to which
they are exposed. Some have
more power of retaining than
other substances possess. Some
part with the poison by free
exposure to the sun’s rays. Im-
perfect washing fails to remove others
The human body retains the poison-
ous exhalation of a foul drain, in
specie , for three or more days, marking
in a peculiar manner, in its issues,
the identity of the poison with that of
the drain whence it was absorbed.
We were led, in the course of
meditation upon sanitary subjects,
to recall a childish incident. We
had taken bread and cheese for sup-
per, and carrying some of it upstairs
to bed, had 1 ft it until morning in
the bedroom, and in the morning
tried to eat it. There was a peculiar
flavour however which unmistakably
said “ don’t.” We have occasionally,
since that time, tasted food which
we have described as having the
flavour of being eaten in a bedroom;
enquiry of a learned chemist o
our acquaintance, confirms our im-
pression that very many kinds of
food, bread, meat, fruit, vege f ables,
cheese, &c„ are highly susceptible of
the gases of decomposition, and when
so impregnated become liable to cause
impaired health in those who partake
of them
It .is greatly feared that the de-
pression which many of the hand-
working class suffer here, and which
leads to an early and constant use of


stimulants, arises, in no small deg ee,
lrom the unwholesomene s of the
shops in which their food is kept,
before they purchase it, as well as
from being afterwards deposited in
the solitary chamE r which serves as
living room, sleeping room, store
closet, and larder, a room of ten or
twelve feet square, and not more than
nine feet high, in which husband,
wife, and as many as seven children
attempt to live ! can we say hope to
enjoy health ?
After all, where is the charmed
spot ? Point it out, oh guide hook !
in our city, where men can live, or
keep their food free from absorption
of poisonous gases; thanks to the
efforts of our philanthropic friends of
the Health Socieity, ably supported
by the weighty influences reigning
at the Glebe, one plague spot is
about to be removed from our possi-
ble future dwellings— '* BLACK-
WATTLE RECLAMATION” IS
NOT TO BE BUILT UPON; evi-
dence may we hope, of a little light
having obtained access to the minds
of our rulers, of a little recognition
that the chief wealth of a nation is in
its people! happy day-dawn ! fortu-
nate recognition! We are half-in-
clined to hope that the measures, to
which we made allusion in our open-
ing article, for remedy of our malady,
education, and legislation, may be
among the cares of those who have
set so good an example to the future
governments as to introduce and
carry into legislation ameasui e which
will prevent the coining this faecal
territory into “ the price of blood ! ’
The importance of our subject,
and the hope that our increasing
circulation will convey our words of
health to some who would not seek
their information in weightier vol-
umes, will lead us to examine, in an
early number, a potent cause of un-
healthfulm ss existing in the want of
provision against spread of infectious
disease; we quarantine (very pro-
perly) disease imported, hut disregard
our own infections at home. Modern
science teaches us that much disease
is preventable; modern British legis-
lation has been aimed at prevention
of infection. Our readers will, we
think, endorse, with us, the old pro-
verb which our Health Society have
adopted for their motto —PREVEN-
TION IS BETTER THAN CURE.

HOW JACK’S MATE PAID
THE DOCTOR.
A TRUE TALE OF THE DIGGINGS.
BY “VIATOR.”
Many years ago I resided in a popu-
lous mining district in the Province of
Victoria, not a hundred miles from
the Pyrenees. The “ rush ” had been
beyond the ordinary numbers who
were to be found flocking in thousands
to every newly-discovered field.
Gradually the whole of an extensive
flat some miles in length had become
thoroughly upturned, and but few
« shicers ” were heard of in the run
of the lead. Of course, the luck could
not last forever, and by degrees the once
coveted flat had become deserted, save
by a few Europeans and some hundreds
of Chinese, who are ever to be found
in the wake of our countrymen upon
these “rushes,” John Chinaman gene-
rally managing to “knock out” a
very comfortable livelihood from the
“tailings” left by his less satisfied
predecessors. Upon many of these
old workings there are to be found
scattered here and there some few
little homesteads, generally wooden-
framed domiciles, with either stringy-
bark or canvas roofing, a small area of
garden ground, and a roughly put up
outbuilding or two. Though the find
of the precious metal may have con-
siderably diminished, the breaking
up of the home, so long as “tucker”
is procurable, is put off as a dernier
ressort, and it requires some intelli-
gence of more than ordinary import-
ance to induce a shifting, more espe-
cially where a wife and family form
portion of a digger’s impedimenta.
Such a little crib as 1 describe was
occupied by a couple of stalwart well-
bronzed miners, who were best known
by those near them by the appellation
of “Lanky Jack” and “old Bill.”
The former was blessed with the pro-
prietorship of about as faithful a little
helpmate as could be desired in this
wicked world of ours. A real
“ homely ” one, as old Bill used to say,
when descanting upon her many ex-
cellencies. Lanky and Bill had been
mates ever since the marriage of the
former. Many a hard tussle for bread
had they borne with, but this last
“rush’’ had for a long time afforded
them really profitable employment,
and they had been enabled to lay by a
little for a rainy day. Lanky and his
wife and child occupied a large slab
and canvas hut, while within a few
yards of their abode stood old Bill’s
tent, with its “fly” and side rails.
There was a decided appearance of
settlement surrounding the little camp
which spoke well for the character of
its occupiers. Gradually, however, as
the original lead ran itself out the flat
became deserted, and even at last the
Celestial element decreased most
visibly in the neighbourhood. Still
our friends held on as long as
there was a shot in the locker,
hesitating to incur the great expense
attending a removal to a new find—
hoping for some better luck nearer
hand; added to which the fact that
“Mrs. Lanky” purposed, at no very
great period, to disorganise the joints
of her little two year old’s (Johnnie)
nose —by the advent of another
mouth to feed, was an additional rea-
son for the mates “ roughing along ’
as they were. I may remark that the
workings separated our friends’ home-
stead from the township, to reach
which nearly a couple of miles of very
“risky” or “holey” ground had to
be passed over. By night, especially,
it was impossible for a stranger to find
out the track through the now deserted
claims. Day by day wore on, and the
ill success of the mates never varied.
Gradually their little stock of money
lessened, till Lanky began to entertain
serious apprehensions as to the pay-
ment of the “usual” expenses con-
sequent upon the advent of the young
stranger. The doctor resid- nt nearest
their shanty was noted for being a
grasping member of his profession,
and though Lanky had managed as
yet to pay him with tolerable punc-
tuality for various little services per-
formed during the past year for


Mrs. L. was not a strong woman by
any means, —yet there remained a
small sura still due on the general
account, concerning which poor Lanky
had great misgivings. Pay it all
at once be could not, and he feared
fcha’, his indebtedness would perchance
stand in the way of that kind attention
he desired his wife should receive.
At last, Father Time, not waiting for
even Lanky’s convenience or the filling
of his purse, decreed that the doctor
should be sent for.
Poor Lanky had serious misgivings
as to the propriety of going himself to
the doctor’s residence, distrusting his
own powers of persuasion under the
circumstances; so he fell back upon
his old chum Bill, who possessed in a
far stronger degree not only the sua-
vit r but the fortiter in re. Bill, with-
out hesitation, accepted the mission,
and towards dusk started off to the
township, hatching up as he picked his
way through the old claims as courte-
ously worded a request as his rough
nature could dictate. As to payment,
he trusted simply to the doctor’s temper.
Bill duly entered the surgery in the
long and now deserted main street,
and stated the nature of his errand.
44 H’m,” answered Esculapius, 44 it’s a
nasty track, my man, for day work;
but I don’t like going out this dark
night, much as I am anxious to oblige
your mate. Besides, you must re-
member he still owes me a few pounds,
which I fear will never be paid while
your present luck lasts.” 44 Well,
doctor,” replied crestfallen Bill, 44 I’ll
guarantee you will be paid every penny
my mate owes you, if I work my nails
off for it. Our bad luck can’t last for
ever, and you remember that Lanky
has always paid you every penny when
he had the means of doing so ; so, be a
Christian, and come along, doctor!
I’ll show you the road.” But the
medico was inexorable, and stir out
he would not—till, at all events, the
balance of the standing account was
paid.
So our friend Bill returned home
thoroughly disheartened, and told his
mate how the matter stood. Lanky
was sorely troubled. There lay his
unfortunate little wife, comforted, cer-
tainly, as far as possible, by the kind
attendance of a near neighbour, who,
like her sex generally, was not at all
unwilling to be pressed intothe service.
He couldn’t muster twenty shillings,
much more a few pounds, and tho-
roughly gave in to the circumstances
of his unhappy impecuniosity. While
cursing his bad luck, old Bill silently
rejoined him as he paced restlessly
between their separate domiciles.
44 Look here, old man,” put in the
kind-hearted mate, “I can’t see the
poor little woman dead beat for a
pound or two. When we were in luck
I 4 planted' an odd 4 fiver ’ under my
bunk, thinking it might turn up handy
one day or another, and thit day’s
come at last; so you had better take it
at once to that stingy old sweep, Pills,
and bring him over. Now, hurry off,
and don’t get stuck up, for it’s all
we’ve got in the world.”
Lanky, full ,of real gratitude to his
generous friend, lost no time in ap-
pearing at the doctor’s shop and stating
his errand, produced the welcome
five pounds, which not only paid off
his previous debt, but tended consi-
derably towards the mitigation of his
fresh responsibility. Greedily pocket-
ing the notes, the doctor quickly made
preparations for his visit, and giving
Lanky Jack a bull’s-eye lantern, as
well as a loaded revolver, desired him
to walk a little ahead and keep a good
look out for the holes.
About the centre of the flat there
stood a small clump of wattle trees,
past which the track lay, and as they
came upon the spot they were both
staggered at a tremendously gruff
voice, with an outrageous oath order-
ing them to 44 bail up and put up their
hands.” Lanky, thoroughly frightened,
dropped the lantern, revolver, and,
knowing the road, ran for his life. Not
so Mr. Pills ! He begged for mercy,
protesting that he was on his way to
perform a charity to a poor woman,
that time was most precious, and that
he hadn’t a penny about his person ;
but the highwayman was not to be de-


ceived. He laid violent hold of the
terrified doctor, and his face being
wholly masked by black crape, ordered
him to turn his pockets inside out,
expressing very deep disgust at finding
nothing but a solitary five pound note
as his booty.
“ Look you here, you greedy old
devil,” said he, “ I’ve heard of you
and your extortion over and over again.
Get on to your patient as hard as you
can—hook it. I’ll put you in the right
track, and if I find you have been hard
on the woman’s husband, I’ll take it
out of your thick hide before you get
home again. Now shove along,
‘ Pills.’ ”
The doctor was, of course, compelled
to obey orders, more particularly as
the intruder had picked up the revol-
ver Lanky had dropped in his fright,
and steadily presented it at the profes-
sional bead. When the lights of the
little shanty came into view, “There,”
said the man, “is the place you’re
wanted at —keep your weather eye
open for the holes, and don’t forget
the caution I have given you,” and
he vanished in the darkness. In less
time than I take to write the next few
sentences, the medico reached Lanky’s
but in a most nervous frame of mind
and body, but, having the caution ever
before his eyes (being a thorough cur
at heart), got through the business
very satisfactorily, giving Jack the full
particulars of the outrage perpetrated,
and debiting him with the cost of at-
tendance as of old—never for a moment
mentioning the warning he had recei-
ved from'the man in crape. In due
course old Bill was called in to see the
baby, and, expressing his deep sympa-
thy with the unhappy doctor, in the
outrageous attack made upon him,
considerately offered to see him safely
home through the holes, as he (Bill)
“ feared neither highwayman or
devil,” and with many thanks from
Lanky and the wife, the two departed.
Bill saw his friend safely home, and
promised him the fee should be paid
again if better luck turned up.
Before turning in that night, Jack
told his mate the doctor’s stu'ement,
and really seemed concerned at the
unfortunate man’s loss. Not so, old
Bill, who, with a curious wink in the
weather eye, quietly replied ‘‘Why,
look ye here, Lank, you don’t mean
for to say you don’t guess where the
five pound note is. I knew your old
woman must have the doctor, and I
knew at the same time I could not af-
ford to lose the last bit o’ money I had
left in the world—what was I to do
then ? Why, to collar my own pro-
perty ! If the fellow had halved the
note with you, I’d a let him go, but
when I saw he had the whole of it, I
could'nt but ihink it was a fair bit of
sticking up. It’ll give him a good
lesson, and he’ll never be the wiser as
to who collared the note.”
Both mates keep their own counsel,
and I dare say that to this day, the
doctor, if alive, is in blissful ignor-
ance as to his assailant. The luck of
our friends still failing them, they left
the old flat as soon as the wife was
able to travel. When I last saw them
they were still the same sound old
friends, and many a laugh I have had
with “Old Bill” as to “how he paid
the doctor.”

GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL.
“ The cause of education be hanged,” he
muttered as he sat down on the curbstone
on Shelby-street, yesterday.
He was a lad of thirteen. He spit
through his front teeth, and he spit often.
His pants were supported by a piece of
wire clothes line girted around his waist,
his hat was ancient and greasy, and his
big flat feet seemed to be waiting for a
thunder shower to wash them clean
“That’s what ails me,” he went on, as
he pushed his feet into the wet sand. “ I
don’t believe in a feller difling in and learn-
ing all there is to learn, and not letting
other folks have a chance. There’s lots
of other folks in this world besides me,
and I ain’t going to be a hog and try to
learn all there is to learn.”
After a minute he went on :
“Don’t I know ’nuff now? Three
times two are six, four times five are
twenty, and four and four are eight.
That’s as correct as I could get ’em if I
went to school for a hundred years. And
don’t I know how to spell. C-a-t is ‘ cat ’
the world over, and I’ll bet on it every
time. H-e-n spells ‘ hen,’ and I know it
as well as if I weighed a ton.”
He rose up to throw a stone at a dog
across the street, and after resuming bis
seat, he went on:
“Jogerfy kinder wrestles me down,
but I don’t go much on jogerfy. What
do I care whether an island is entirely
surrounded by water, or whether there
ain t any water within ten miles of it r
S’pose I’m going to buy and sell islands
for a living ? 1 don’t care which is the
highest mountain or the longest river, do
I ? I’m going to keep a feed store, and
when I’m rolling bales of hay around will
I care about mountains and rivers ? I’ve
heard the boys go on about exports and
imports, and straits and seas, and capes,
but what’s them to me ? If a feller wants
a bag of oats, is he going to wait and ask
me when the Island of Madagascar was
discovered ? ”
He carefully examined the big toe of
his left foot and the heel of his right foot,
and gloomily observed:
“The old folks are making ready to
push me into school, and I’ve got to make
ready to keep out. I can’t take to school,
somehow. I could sit her« and study all
day, but the minute I get into a school-
house I’m nervous. Someth ing’s going
to happen to me this week. I’ll he taken
home in a wheelbarrow with a big gash
in this heel, or this toe almost cut off.
That will mean four weeks on a crutch,
and they don’t allow lame boys to go to
school and crutch up and down the aisles.
Or, sposin I go hortie with palpitation of
the heart ? The old lady has had it, and.
I won’t more than get into the house
before she’ll have me tucked up on the
loung \ the camphor bottle down, currant
jelly aud sponge cake in the distance, and
she’ll call out to the old gent:
“ ‘Father, it’s no use of thinking of
sending this boy to school. He looks
stoat and healthy, but he’s a mere shad-
der. The close atmosphere of the school-
room will kill him before snow flies.’ ”
The boy rose up. There was a grin all
over his face as he went for the old lady.

TALES OF THE GOLD MANIA.
BY OUR OWN MANIAC.
No. I.—THE CRAWLER.
Shortly after the discovery of gold in
this colony, when the rich workings on
the Turon River were attracting atten-
tion, a party of six Cornishmen left
Sydney for the new diggings. They
were experienced miners, and were
well provided with tents, tools, and all
the appliances n< eessary for their work.
They had also a supply of provisions
for the journey, and a sufficient stock
of money to last for a reasonable time.
Fine str pping fellows they were, well
versed in sinking shafts, tunn ling,
timbering, and underground ) ming.
They were steady aLd industri us, and
just the men one would have thought
who would be certain to succeed. At
that time the roads were infested with
a number of lawless characters, and it
was not altogether safe to make indis-
criminate acquaintances in going to
and fro. The Cornishmen, therefore,
kept to themselves as much as possible,
made their own camp atni.,ht, and
avoided public-houses and of ter places
of call, taking the journey in easy
stage.', trudging al ng on foot with a
packhorse carryirtheir swags and
tools.
When they had been two days on
the road, and were drawing near to
the place where they proposed to halt
for the night, these men overtook a
solitary pedestrian, sauntering along
at a careless pace, carrying all his
worldly goo s in a small bundle tied
up in a cotton handkerchief at the end
of a stick on his shoulder, wearing a
very ragged suit of clothes, and pre-
senting altogether the appearance of a
man who had been going downhill for
a long time. They got into conversa-
tion with this individual, an i finding
him, despite his tattered garb, an easy-
going, harmless fellow, and learning
from him that he was also bound for
the Turon, they for once relaxed their
rule and acceded to his request that he
might be allowed to sleep at their
camp. Not that the “Crawler,” for
so they christened him on the spot, had
any property about him which could
tempt the neediest bushranger and
render it unsafe for him to travel by
himself. They took him in as a fellow-
traveller, on the understanding that he
might avail hims elf of their companion-
ship to the end of the journey, and that
then he must shift for himself. How-
ever, by tbe time the party reached
their destination, the Crawler had so
far got into their good graces that the
Comishmen, seeing his evident poverty
and helplessness, had compassion upon
him, and told him that he was welcome
to continue camping with them and to
his bit and sup until he saw his way to
do something for himself, only that he
must work his own way in mining
matters.
Having established themselves in a
comfortable camping place, the six
miners commenced operations, They
divided themselves into three parties,
obtained the best information they
could, and soon three shafts were going
down in likely spots, and when those
turned out duffers they started three
more at once, putting in good honest
work and long hours.
Diggers on all sides of them noted
the business-like way they went to
work, and every one said that the
Cornishmen were bound to “strike
it,” as indeed they deserved to do, so
perseveringly and steadily did they
labour.
Meantime the Crawler, who, to use
a very common joke on the diggings,
was so little afraid of hard work that
he would at any time lie down by the
side of it and go to sleep, used to y*et
up a couple of hours after the Cornish-
men had gone to their work, and after
having boiled his quart pot of tea and
eaten his breakfast, would stroll lazily
to some shallow workings, where he
could fossick with a knife and wash a
few tin dishes full of dirt, earning by
this means a pennyweight or two of
gold, which seemed to satisfy him, re-
turning to the camp about four o’clock
in the afternoon, where he would be
found dawdling and smoking his pipe,
when the Cornishmen returned.


In this way several weeks passed.
The Cornishmen performed prodi-
gies of sinking; their perseverance
and skill excited the admiration of all
beholders, but no success rewarded
their efforts. Hole after hole was put
down, and one after another proved a
shicer. They were, however, still
very confident, and amused themselves
by chaffing the Crawler on all possible
occasions. This he took as a matter
of course ; nothing seemed to disturb
his easy indifference ; he was a great
source of fun to them, and the recipi-
ent of jokes without end.
One day when the party came home
to supper, the Crawler was missing.
This was a most unusual occurrence,
and after a time, when it was begin-
ning to get dark, they began to feel
uneasy. The protection they had ac-
corded to the poor fellow, together
with his imperturbable good nature,
had engendered a liking for him, and
they missed him more than they would
have believed.
Various were the surmises hazarded
as to the course of his absence. One
suggested that he had fallen down a
shaft and had been too lazy to call for
help. Another was certain he had
found a soft piece of grass and had
gone to sleep. While a third thought
it was probable that he had stumbled
over a nugget and gone out of his
seven senses at the sight of it.
Just as they were speculating upon
other possible reasons for his non-arri-
val, ,the Crawler hove in view, and then
and there gave birth to the only
or repartee which he was ever known
to utter.
“See,” said he “what the Crawler
has got.”
The spectacle he presented was an
unusual one. His arms were bare,
and he was carrying on his shoulders
the sleeves of his blue serge shirt,
stuffed as full as it could be and tied
up at each end, so that they resembled
two gigantic sausages. Each sleeve
was crammed with dirt, nuggets of
gold and pieces of auriferous quartz.
It appeared that in his usual lazy
way he had been fossicking in a shal-
low place in the bed of the river in
some old workings, and had come
across a small quartz feeder which he
had followed into the bank, and at a
depth of about six inches he had come
upon a perfect nest of gold, which he
had brought home in the way I have
described.
The battle is not always to the swift
nor the race to the strong.
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMAN’S FERRY ROAD
( Continued .)
Chapter IX.
In her utmost lightness there is truth
For the root of some grave earnest thought is un-
derstruck so rightly
As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers
above.
Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all
the chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, that trembling, passed
in music out of sight.
Lucy made a charming hostess. She
had considerable powers of conversa-
tion, and was perfectly free from affec-
tation. She had read many books
with judgement, and was singularly
well up in the literature of the day.
She was also an excellent musician.
“ Do you understand music, Mr.
Caldecott?” she asked, as she sat down
at the piano.
“No, but I am passionately fond of
it notwithstanding. I think I can tell
bad from good; though if asked to
give reasons for my decision, I’m
afraid I could’nt.”
“ I hope you won’t be too hard upon
my performance. lam going to treat
you just as though you were one of
ourselves. I always practice regularly
every day, so unless you think my
playing will annoy you, I shall take
my hour as usual.”
“ Annoy me, my dear Miss Walton 1
How can you say so ?”
“Well, what shall I play you?
Have you any preference for any parti-
cular style ?”
“ Do you know anything by Chopin?
Ther e is no music that affects me as
his does. I like its dreaminess and


woird suggestiveness. It is so intensely
poetical.”
“ Oh! I’m so glad, for he’s my favo-
rite composer. Yes, he is a true poet..
Don’t criticise my rendering of him,
mind!”
And Lucy Walton, to her compan-
ion’s great delight, played with exqui-
site taste and delicacy of touch several
of the dreamiest morceaux of the great
composer they had been speaking
about.
George wondered at her execution.
He asked her who had been her teach-
ers.
“ Papa taught me all I know,” she
replied ; then noticing that he looked
surprised, she added, ‘‘Papa, you
know, is a theoretical musician of no
mean order. He doesn’t play much
himself; though when he choses it
is a real treat to hear him.”
“ I suppose you sing ?” asked Calde-
cott.
“Only the simplest kind of ballad
music.”
“ Then do, please, oblige me, Miss
Walton, with a song—a Scoich or
German ballad.”
“Oh ! German’s beyond me. Ido
know one or two of Uhland’s, but I
can’t master the pronunciation, and it
always appears to me to be such a
barbarism to attempt to sing foreign
words with an English accent.”
“ And you can manage the Scotch ?”
“Yes, Mr. Hay drilled me into that
pretty fairly. What shall I sing
you ?”
Song after song did Miss Walton
warble forth to the complete fascina-
tion of her hearer. She was a great
actress, though she knew it not.
George thought of the lines—
“ Her mouth stirs with the song, like song; and
when the notes are finest
’Tis the eyes that shoot out vocal light and seem
to swell them on.”
Yes! he was completely fascinated!
It was not, however, until two or three
hours had elapsed—until he was left
alone, while Miss Lucy was away dis-
cussing the luncheon question with
Mrs. Arnott, that he began to reflect
upon his position.
Would he be doing right by this
charming girl and her noble-looking
old father to allow himself to be en-
tangled in a flirtation which could lead
to nothing ? What were his prospects
that he could encourage himself to
hope? He felt certain that two or
three more days iu the company of
Miss Walton would, to use the un-
spoken words that welled up within
him, thoughtlike, “ do his business:”
and then refusal must dash his desire
to the ground. How could he ask her
of her father ? He with his paltry
hundred a year, his purposeless life,
his folly-coloured past ? And yet, why
not ? Why not act on his uncle’s sug-
gestion and try to win her ? She would
have money—money enough for both.
Surely a Caldecott, though a pauper,
were good enough to mate with an
old sheepfarmer’s daughter? Such
thoughts passed through George’s
mind, and as usual, indecision won tbe
day. He would stop till his arm was
quite right. He would steel his heart
as well as he could against its tempta-
tion. Besides, why should he be
coxcomb enough to think that a young
lady of Miss Walton’s characterand
position should go down before his
sword and spear, as it were by a coup
de main. Likely enough she had
dozens of other admirers. This was a
thought, however, which George did
not care to dwell on.
George had quite made up his mind
before Mr. Walton’s return to luncheon
that “ sufficient for the day was the
evil thereof," and that there was lots
of time to think of beating a retreat.
Three or four more days passed,
many hours of each were spent by our
hero in the sweet companionship of
Lucy Walton, whose father seemed
rather to encourage this growing
intimacy than in any way to guard
against it. Mr. Hay also seemed to be
pleased with what was going on. As
for the young lady herself, she took no
pains to disguise her kind feelings
towards the man she looked upon in
the light of her rescuer from worse
than death. The consequence was


that when George's arm was perfectly
healed, and the time had arrived for
him to start for Mitta Mitta, he found
himself in such desperate case that he
could not tear himself away from Ural-
mindry and her, who despite his feeble
attempts to resist temptation had be-
come the absolute mistress of his
heart.
One morning, as he was returning
with Mr. Walton from their usual
bathe in the river, he said to the old
gentleman,
“ I must start for Mitta Mitta after
breakfast.”
“How’s that? You’re under no
promise to your uncle, I hope. Why,
you haven’t been here time enough to
see the place. I’ve lots of things to
show you, now that your arm ’s well
again, and you’re fit for riding.”
“ I’ve been here too long, sir,” says
poor George.
“ What! what!—too long ? Non-
sense, man, nonsense. If you tell me
you have business to attend to, well
and good. Go, and do it; and then
come back. If not, why leave us ? ”
“ I may as well out with it first as
last, Mr. Walton. I love your daughter,
sir, and I have no business. That’s
just the infernal part of it. Had I a
business —had I means, I would say to
you, ‘ May I try for her ?’ As it is, I
can only leave the place where I have
been too happy.”
“ I don’t see your sequitur exactly,
my dear boy. Why shouldn’t you try
for my daughter? I’ve no objection.
Has she ? ”
“Oh! sir, how can you ask the
question ? Do you think I could have
taken advantage of your hospitality to
that extent ? ” said George, flicking
with his towel at a bunch of lavender
that grew near the doorway to his bed-
room.
“ I believe you to be a gentleman,
George Caldecott. I’ll speak with you
after breakfast. Here—” and the old
man held out his hand. George grasped
it, and with a light heart went into his
room to dress.
As soon as breakfast was over, Mr.
Walton took George into his study,
his ‘ den,* as Lucy called it, a snug
little room in which the master of Ural-
mindry and his old friend Hay were
wont to take counsel together concern-
ing fluctuations in wool, the price of
beeves, and other far less bucolic sub-
jects. This sanctum was very plainly
furnished, but a fine engraving, a proof
before letters of Correggio’s “Man of
Sorrows,” which hung over the fire-
place, and a few well-bound, though
much worn classics, justified its name.
“So the long and the short of it is,
Mr. Caldecott, you love my daughter ?”
asked Mr. Walton, with an air of affec-
tionate interest.
“ I do.”
“ Well, you have my consent to win
her if you can. I know the race you
came of, and once knew enough of one
member of it to be glad at what has
fallen about. For mark me, young
man, I have not been blind to what has
been going on. I liked you from the
first. Hay, too, a shrewd judge of
character, told me he thought you
were clear grit, and from what I have
seen of you I'd be apt to endorse his
opinion; so you’ve my consent to make
the trial—but on conditions. Now,
don’t be impetuous. Listen ! Can you
support her ? What are your means ?
Caldecott blushed as he said, “I
have next to nothing—but I have ex-
pectations.”
“ May the devil run away with your
expectations l Of course my daughter
would not go empty-handed to the man
who wins her. But no man shall take
her with my blessing and consent ex-
cept one who, in possible stress of bad
fortune is able to support her. If you
(and I’ll aid you in the task) are pre-
pared to turn your hand to learn some
business, I’ll promise you this, that
whenever you can come and say, i Mr.
Walton, I can support a wife decently,’
I don’t say ‘ fashionably,’ mind you,
but ‘ in decent comfort,’ you shall have
my good word with my daughter.
What say you?”
“ What indeed but that lam im-
mensely grateful,” replied George,
who, to tell the truth, was slightly


taken aback by the turn things had
taken.
** Now, I’ll give you a bit of advice,”
continued the old gentleman. “ You’re
a Sandhurst man, and ought not to
have forgotten your mathematics and
surveying. Why not read up for a
surveyor! Do so, and the day you
pass, should Lucy like"' you, she shall
be yours.”
“I'll set about it at once,” cried
George, seeing a bright gleam of com-
fort in the suggestion. “ I wonder
what’s the right way to set about it,
though ?”
“ Nothing is easier. Send in your
name to the Survey Department for
preliminary examination; go for a short
time into the field, with a licensed sur-
veyor, and then pass the final test,
and there you are ! It’s a matter of
eighteen months or so. The means
you have are ample for the purpose?”
“Oh, quite,” said George; “but
during the eighteen months ?”
“Ah, I see,” answered Mr. Walton,
smilingly,—“well, I won’t be hard.
You shall make'this or my place on the
Hawkesburv your home when you are
not in the field# A friend of mine
named Kenny, who passed two or three
years ago—a fine young fellow as ever
lived—will be happy to take you at
once on my recommendation. So we’ll
consider the thing settled. But, mind!
not a serious word to Lucy on the
subject until after you have passed the
preliminary examination.”
“All right, sir. You may depend
upon me. But how shall I ever thank
you for this ? ”
“In one sense, easily. By remem-
bering who you are, and by bearing
your name worthily as a loyal, earnest
pioneer in the work of colonization.”

WAR RUMOURS.
Althotjgh matters in the East are
terribly complicated, and although
the action of Great Britain is cal-
culated rather to augment than
diminish the entanglement, we are
of the number who believe that
affairs will be adjusted between the
Courts of St. James and St. Peters-
burgh without their being put to
the cruel arbitrament of the sword.
It is too much the fashion with
Englishmen to imagine that their
own country alone possesses the
capacity for honest political work.
It is too much the fashion with
Englishmen to imagine that Aus-
trian, German, and Eussian diplo-
matists employ language only for
the Talleyrandian purpose of con-
cealing their thoughts ; hence there
is too little disposition to believe
that at the present juncture the
efforts of Prince Bismarck to bring
the question of the Dardanelles
before a Congress of the Powers
are thoroughly honest. We believe
that they are; and that unless Lord
Beaconsfield is absolutely infatuated
the long promised Congress will
assemble with fair hope of arrang-
ing the difficulty, if not perma-
nently, at all events, for another
quarter of a century. We per-
fectly agree with Mr. Laing, in
his “ Plain View of British In-
terests,” that it is a “ legitimate
aim of British policy that Constan-
tinople and the Dardanelles shall
not be occupied permanently by
Bussia.” But we fail to see how
the action taken by England in,
as it were, daring Eussia to occupy
those points, is likely to tend to a
settlement of the question ; whereas
at a Congress where European sym-
pathy would be almost wholly with
the sensible British view (which is
unfortunately not that of the
Queen’s Cabinet), all the probabi-
lities would be in favour of Turkey
in Europe passiug into the hands
of an independent Christian Govern-
ment. The war-scare got up by
the conservative party in the inter-


ests of a military-ism, which is too
stagnant for purposes of army pro-
motion, may also suit that particular
commercial clique to whom famine
prices and fat contracts mean more
than cent, per cent., but it cer-
tainly surprises us to find a
certain set in Sydney taking up
the same cry at second - hand
oblivious of the fact that to the
Australian colonies a European war
simply means increased freights,
higher insurance, and a crippled
British market. The removal of the
Sultan to Broussa in Asia Minor,
more likely to have been caused by
the action of his own people than
by the advance of Russian troops,
is, let us hope, the initial step of
that movement so long desired by
the European party of progress, the
return of the Ottoman caliphate to
its native Asian deserts.
TOWN GOSSIP
Taking a stroll through the Exhi-
bition the other day, we were
brought to a standstill at a stall
where vegetables of a Brobdigna-
gian character were displayed in
the most attractive order. Such
apples, such potatoes, and such
pumpkins! There was one gigantic
squash which was over three feet
in length, and thick in proportion.
How proud must have been the
proprietor of the garden which pro-
duced this vegetable monstrosity,
as he watched it day by day ex-
panding into such unnatural pro-
portions. It must have put him in
mind of the fat woman who used
to appear at fairs in England,
“ who measured 50 inches round
the neck, 150 inches round the
waist, and her weight couldn’t be
ascertained, she increasing some
pounds every half-hour.” The
difficulty which always met us at
the coach and four which came out
of a pumpkin for Cinderella’s
benefit, has assumed much less pro-
portions since witnessing one of
this size. As to the other exhibits,
which are a great deal, as the auc-
tioneers say, “too numerous to
mention,” being anxious to obtain
a fresh and honest impression as to
their merits, we put the following
question to a couple of youngsters
who had spent the greater part of
the previous day in the Exhibition
grounds, “ What did jou consider
best worth seeing? ” and they both
replied at once, “the things in-
side.” Now, considering the out-
side attractions comprised dancing
dogs, marionettes, bicycle racin',
shooting gallery, and other amuse-
ments, besides refreshments in
great variety, we looked upon their
opinion as a deserved tribute to the
exhibits within the building. We
can therefore conscientiously recom-
mend our readers to go and have a
look at the “ things inside.”

Quite a number of Civil Servants
were overcome by the heat of the
sun on the Leger day. At one
office where there are some eighteen
or nineteen gentlemen exployed, no
less than eleven had to send ex-
cuses for non-attendance on Easter
Tuesday, based on the ground of
indisposition. The Government
should look into this, and see if
they cannot devise some plan by
which the ill effects of the extreme
rarity of the public holidays may be
modified.

It was rather hard on the regular
travellers by omnibus to find the
company’s time-table deliberately


ignored by the company’s servants
during the earlier part of this week.
It is only the other day they raised
their fares, and at the same time
published a fresh time programme.
The races and the exhibition proved,
however, too much for the greed of
the management, who to secure the
exceptional harvest broke faith
with the general public in a way
which we trust the Transit Com-
missioners will make a note of.

Sundry merchants have addres-
sed the Government of Japan on the
subject of steam communication be-
tween the Treaty Ports and Port
Jackson. strange to relate, they
have placed their communication in
the hands of Captain Matsurra of
the Japanese man-of-war now in
harbour, and have requested that
gallant officer to deliver it to the
proper authorities at Yeddo. Are
not the aforesaid merchants aware
that the only correct way to address
a foreign power is through the
Government of one’s own country ?
A few reigns ago and this act of our
impetuous commercials would have
qualified them for the Tower.
* *

Apropos of the Japanese officers,
couldn’t some naval friend give
them a hint that the publication of
their names as patrons of a juggling
entertainment to be given in aid of
a peccant litterateur is a mistake
which, if their Navy Office is only
half as sharp as it should be, may
lead to official censure.
* *

The Government have passed the
Electoral Bill through the Lower
House, despite the croakings of doc-
trinaire Greenwood, high falutin
statesman Parkes, and the rest of the
discontented. Since party govern-
ment in an Assembly numerically in-
creased, should find the means for
securing the needful majority pro-
portionately increased, it is to be
hoped that the sea-saw-ism of the past
is over and done for ever and a day.
We note Mr. Lloyd looking very
blooming and jolly. Is it because he
finds being out of the House agrees
with him, or because he now has a
chance of once more gaining admis-
sion into the arena, where once he
earned a notoriety that tickled his
vanity ? Mr G. M. Stephen hopes
to get a seat this time, but the odds
are against him. Professor Hamilton
is feeling his bumps—no ! his way
cautiously, but we don’t think either
town or country electorate will have
aught to say to him. Even colonial
electorates must draw the line some-
where,you know.

Once-a-Week, both, externally
and internally, this serial shows marked
improvement. The success which has at-
tended the effort to establish a weekly
magazine seems to have encouraged the
promoters to make it still more accept-
able to the reading public. As the editor
remarks in his preface, “Encouraged by
a support unexpectedly liberal, we have
made arrangements for enlarging the scope
of ‘ Once-a-Week.’ A new design on the
cover represents our little barque fairly
launched upon the waters, with sail full
set to catch the propitious breeze that shall
waft it surely to the desired haven—the
goodwill and kindlv favour of the people
of Australia.” The original articles are
well written and spirited, the local sketches
are interesting, and the extract matter is,
and, indeed, the articles throughout are,
entertaining. There is a column for al-
most every taste, either humorous or
grave, while the juvenile portion of the
community is by no means overlooked.
With the present week’s issue is given, in
the form of a supplement, a neatly-litho-
graphed musical supplement, “The Syd-
ney Once-a-Week Schottische.” — S. M.

ON THE PREPARATION OF SOUPS.
In recommending serious attention
to this subject we do so on two prin-
ciples—those of health and economy.
As regards the first it is incontestible
that the broth made or extracted from
whatever materia] the science of cook-
ery has taught us is conducive to
health, and your medical adviser will
tell you that you cannot do better than
by commencing your dinner with a
plate of soup. Everywhere on the
Continent soup is the precursor of the
dinner.
What we wish to infer is that, by
having soup* a saving is effected in the
solid meat, and hence arises a ques-
tion of economy, and in the course of
our lessons we shall show how to live
well and at the same time cheaply.
Professor Donovan, in his “ Do-
mestic Economy,” pages 260-61, says
—“ In order to boil meat to perfection,
care must be taken that the heat shall
net permeate it too rapidly ; for heat,
too quickly supplied, would render the
muscular fibres tough. Hence slow
boiling affords the most wholesome as
well as palatable meat/’
“ The common practice of forming
soup by boiling large masses of meat
until its structure is broken down into
shreds is, therefore, decidedly bad.”
If you enter into the spirit of the
thing, and become an admirer of a
good and nutritious soup, and its com-
panion, the beef bouilli, take a piece
of the aitch bone, buttock, or thick
part of the leg, say, in weight, 4 lbs.
to one gallon of cold water ; place the
water and meat in a stew-pot, put it
over a slow fire, so that the ebullition
should take place gradually, to dilate
and dissolve the muscular fibres of the
meat; remembering that if you hurry
your boiling, the albumen of the beef,
like the white of an egg, gets coa-
gulated, which has the effect of hard-
ening the meat, and takes away the
succulence of the broth. As soon as
your pot simmers, skim gently as the
scum rises to the surface. When you
have all this extracted, put in a table-
spoonful of salt, and have the following
vegetables ready prepared: half a
head of celery, two leeks, one moderate
carrot and parsnip, tying them to-
gether and dropping them into the
pot; then add a small turnip cut into
quarters. Now roast a small onion all
round quite brown, and stick into it
three cloves; put this onion in, and
let the whole simmer three and a half
to four hours ; and if the water wastes
add more hot to it, so as to keep
up the quantity. You now have a
soup fit for a king. Have your


tureen ready and some bread cut up
in slices, using as much of the crust
as you can, and, in fact, if you have a
friend or two, use the crust only of a
tin loaf; but exercise your own judg-
ment, taking care that the quantity of
bread does not exceed the value of
two rounds of teast, which is enough
for four persons. Then pour two tea-
cupsful of the broth over the bread,
and cover over the tureen to allow the
bread to swell out. Take out your
beef, lay it on a dish, also the vege-
tables on a separate plate, either to
eat with the soup or the meat.
To Improve it. —If you happen to
meet with a tough fowl, not fit to roast,
you may put it into the broth-pot with
half a calf's foot, which will make the
broth richer ; and it may be used as
the foundation for sauces.
Now, with the broth remaining,
which you pass through a tammy, you
have the foundation of the following
soups:—
Rice Soup. —Take a quarter of a
pound of rice (enough for four persons)
wash it in warm water, rubbing it
with the hands, place it in a stew-pan,
covering it over with water, after
boiling two hours, strain it off, and
put the rice in your broth, which you
have already hot, and let it simmer
for another hour; season, if requisite,
wi +7 salt, and serve.
Rice Soup with Tomatas. —Take
either preserved tomatas or fruit: if
the latter, boil it in a small quantity of
water, wash and pass it through a
sieve; boil your rice as in preceding
receipt; and after having placed the
same in your hot broth, add, in a few
minutes before serving, the tomata,
which will be found a delicious adjunct:
season with a little salt, if necessary.
Vermicelli Soup. —A handful of
vermicelli broken into short stems and
thrown into your boiling broth, will be
done in fifteen minutes.
Italian Paste Soup.— Of these orna-
mental delicacies you have only to
throw in two ounces for each person,
in your hot broth; let them boil fifteen
minutes, and serve with grated Dutch
or mild English cheese.
Cabbage Soup. —The best cabbage
for this soup is the Savoy ; cut the
same into quarters, taking out the
core, and splitting the larger leaves
along the middle, upwards ; you then
put the cabbage in the already boiling
broth, adding half a head of celery.
Now place some thin crusty slices of
bread in the tureen, pour over it a
cupful of broth some few minutes be-
fore serving, add a few mashed
potatoes and then pour in your broth
laying the cabbage on the top.
Spring ob, Vegetable Soup. —Before
giving this receipt we must observe
that this is one of the nicest and best
soups of the season. Have ready
three pints of broth, having already
cut, washed, and shaped into small
dice, the following vegetables, namely,
one carrot, one turnip, two very small
onions, one dozen sticks of asparagus,
in lengths of half an inch each, half a
cauliflower, in strips, two dozen
French beans, cut diagonally, and half
a pint of green peas. All these must
now be blanched in boiling water and
salt, draining and passing them into
cold water, with the exception of the
carrot, turnip and onion, which at
once transfer into the hot broth, and
afterwards the other vegetables. Sea-
son slightly with salt, pepper, and
sugar. Twelve minutes boiling will
perfect this soup.
Turnip Soup Puree. —Proceed as
above, omitting the carrots ; but you
may add rice, which is an improve-
ment.

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.”— lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers ‘‘ a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will he an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature. — S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says: —It is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to he a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
he denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. Gibes, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Country
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
Sydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
the day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house, and an
agreeable jompanion to every reader.—
Southern Argus (Goulbum^.
“Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
pearance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
Barlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a magazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands a better
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are bom hut to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.” —Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may he per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend. that
everything in the shape of “ news ” items
should he omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
—Tass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo , a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the “Paradise Lost”—intended for the use
of University candidates—a ''’ever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sohinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hope the new
organ will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors. — Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains well written pacers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health.” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary o
the llusso-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Svdney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney. — Molong Ex-
press.
Oxce a Week. —Thisisthe titleof a new
pamphlet, e lited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
Jt is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Etcetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterfield Star says:—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says: —We have
looked the book carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages. — Alhury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation.— Border Post( Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgee).
The Bathurst Free Press says:—lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
bands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall he glad to see the
magazine prosper. —Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers.— Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week ” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
loca i. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches—we
note specially “ '1 he Best Dog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,” —
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
Once a Week we can conscientiously re-
commend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
r l hose who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse our opinion. —Cumberland Mercury \
The Sydney “Once a Week ” —The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and general
get up are equal to those cfthe first
number which w had occasion to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light i eading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. Altogether the number does credit
to editor and printer.— S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says : —“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written —the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “Best Dog in the Colony.”
We have every confidence in recommend-
ing “Once a Week” to the favorable
notice of our readers.”
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
j ust received the eighth number of ‘ ‘ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might he lost to the general
public, and also established a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week.— This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches.—
S. M. Herald.
The Sydney “Once a Week.’' —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now he looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may be congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one ; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
Sydney “Once a Wefk.— The new
number of this capital little serial quite
sustains the character of its predecessors.
Charley Cornstalk’s “ Sporting Adven-
tures’’and the “ Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry ” are continued. The Rev. A. W.
Petre commences a new story, entitled
“ Aunt Rebecca’s Secret,” which promises
to be good. There is another article on
the “Public Health,” and a variety of
useful and amusing contributions make up
a very readable and pleasant number.—
Echo , April 12.
Sydney “ Once a Week.” This
weekly magazine keeps up the reputation
it has earned for itself, as a well printed
entertaining serial. The local articles and
sketches are good, and there is a large
variety of interesting reading matter.—
S. M. Herald, April 13.
