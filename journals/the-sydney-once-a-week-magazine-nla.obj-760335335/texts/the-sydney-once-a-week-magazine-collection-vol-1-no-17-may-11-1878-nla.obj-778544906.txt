WEEK” will be received up to ten o’clock on

The anniversary of Her Most Gra-
cious Majesty’s birthday will soon be
here, on which auspicious occasion,
and in especial honour thereof, each
of her adult aboriginal subjects in
this territory of New South Wales
will, in accordance with custom, be
duly presented with a blunket of
very inferior quality. This princely
gift, this veritable regiurn donum ,
doubtless causes the aboriginal heart
to thrill with loyal emotion for the
House of Guelph ! Why should it
not do so when the present tells
them of the thoughtful care for their
wants and requirements in the new
conditions of existence opened to
them by contact with nineteenth cen-
tury civilization borne to them by the


benignant ruler of the Christian race,
which has supplanted them in their
old hunting grounds?
And what a fair exchange, if one
comes to reflect upon it! For the
old free life on the breezy downs, on
the grassy plains, or in the sheltered
dingles of the pleasant forest lands—
a beggar’s, nay, a dog’s existence on
the station outskirts, or in the town-
ship’s slums, haunted by hideous
forms of loathsome disease, com-
forted by the whiteman’s “ fire
water,” and sheltered by the white-
man’s blanket!
Charity, says a great authority?
covereth a multitude of sins, and’
perchance, under the “ birthday
blanket” we Christian white men
may continue to hide away some of
our sins against the black fellows.
Some of them only, for they are very
many, and the blanket very, very
small, and, oh ! so very threadbare.
Is it by the gift of such a miserable
rag (in which no trainer would
dream of wrapping even a fith-rate
“ plater ”) that we are to satisfy our
selves we are doing our duty to the
blacks ? The blatant rel gionist
is very bitter against Stanley, or
(to come nearer home) against
D’Albertis for having pulled the trig-
ger upon the warlike aboriginal
races of Congo-land or New Guinea
Has he no bitterness for the hypo,
crisy which by neglect kills annually
its scores of the aboriginal races of
Australia—no scorn for the somnolent
indifference of professing Christians
who imagine by an occasional dole to
satisfy their consciences for the
basest ignoring that ever a c n-
quered people were treated to by
their conquerors ?
Here be facts! There are still
several thousand aboriginals living
in New South Wales. There is but
one aboriginal mission school at
which are some twenty native pupils ?
The annual Government grant in
aid of this establishment is £400;
the amount of voluntary contribu-
tions from the general public is
less than £IOO.
But then there -is the annual
blanket! And, by-the.bye, we had
forgotten the cast-off clothes, and the
occasional assistance, an odd panni-
kin or so of flour, or dose of castor
oil, given through the medium of the
police to those who are akin to us
by Adam.
Is this state of things to last until
the aboriginal race has wholly died
out ? Are we to go on for ever
making believe that our Christianity
is vital because it is so keen to detect
the motes in the eyes of rough pio-
neers like Stanley or D’ Albertis ?
How about this monstrous beam in
our own—this race of fellow-men and
women, whom we did not first find
lying on the high-road stripped and
wounded by others, and with Leviti-
cal indifference thereupon passed
by on the other side having other
business to attend to, but whom we
ourselves for high dynastic purposes,
shall we say? have stripped and


wounded by our own proper act,
and left to linger a very death-in-life
existence, exposed to manifold temp-
tations of our devising, without
guide, philsopher, or friend?
There are, doubtless, difficulties in
the way of dealing righteously with
the black ; and of course our own
conduct in the past has unduly mul-
tiplied those which originally stood
in our way. There is the half-caste
difficulty —the grog difficulty —and
many another one. But is it for the
race which vaunts its capacity to
master material difficulties to avoid a
social one simply because it is intri-
cate and perplexed ? As a race we
Anglo-Australians owe a debt to the
aboriginal Australians, which, unless
our Christianity be a delusion and
a sham, we cannot leave unpaid with-
out the deepest stain upon our
honour.
To the philanthropists of the
colony we make appeal on behalf of
the black brothers belonging to us.
Do not let the claims of the be-
nighted islanders of the sea, of the
famine-smitten Chinaman, of the
war-desolated Bulgarian engross all
our attention. There are some
nearer to hand demanding our more
active sympathies—a people with
stronger claims upon us than Papuan
or Mongol, Roumelian or Turk—that
unhappy race whom we have inocu-
lated with the evils that follow fast
i n the wake of civilization, but from
whom we have hitherto selfishly kept
its good things.
NORFOLK ISLAND
(by “ VIATOR.”)
No. 2.
The first view of the island as
you near it from the westward,
is singular and puzzling. The
lofty Norfolk Island pine tops every
hill, [and long before the land can
be seen these tall tops appear like so
many boat-sails upon the horizon,
gradually increasing in height as
you approach them.
The “ Settlement,” as it was termed,
lay on the south side, and its appear-
ance from the deck of the vessel,
backed by hills covered with verdure,
with roads winding upwards to their
summits—the cluster of private dwell-
ings—the magnitude of the prison,
military and commissariat accommoda-
tion—indeed the air of tidiness per-
vading the whole view, was almost en-
chanting. A whale-boat at once boarded
us, pulled by half-a-dozen prisoners,
who were guarded by a sergeant and
three soldiers sitting aft and well
armed, the boat being steered by a
paid free coxswain. A hasty collection
of the mails, and necessary informa-
tion as to new arrivals, &c., the boat
soon returned to the shore, and the
day being fine we were soon visited by
a large fourteen-oared launch pro-
pelled by as many prisoners, and under
the surveillance of a stronger guard.
The ladies were lowered by the old-
fashioned “ whip” and chair, —their
better-halves scrambled over the side,
some to tumble headlong into the bot-
tom of the boat as she fell into the
trough of the sea, and in due course,
escaping a ducking, we got the
bar in sound order and condition,
not even “ stained by sea water”—
a favourite form of dragmans’ re-
ceipts on our Sydney wharves at the
present day.
At the date of our arrival the free
population consisted of a civil com-
mandant, two chaplains, two medical
officers, several assistant superintend-
ents, and a sort of agricultural director,


(the present Lord Limerick!) These,
together with a body of minor employ-
es such as overseers, boat-steerers,
gaolers, and the like, formed the
“civil ” element in our little commu-
nity. There were two companies of a
line regiment, with half a score of
officers, a couple of commissariat
officers, a eaptain of engineers who
directed the public works, and the
usual quota of military attaches in a
garrison town. From the great boon
of securing very desirable economy in
living so acceptable to married couples,
the great majority of Government
servants, including the military officers,
were possessed of marital encum-
brance, and there was abundance of
enjoyable society, aad a ceaseless
round of pleasant reunions, all tending
to dissipate any possible tedium con-
sequent upon our pitiable (!) isolation.
The ball-room of Government House
was thrown open to all, one evening
in each week: a good band was formed
from the ranks of our musically in-
clined prison prodigies ; indeed I do
not wander from strict truth when I
say that general peace, contentment,
and good will (very rare commodities
in limited communities), prevailed
amongst us all. Picnics were fre-
quent ; fishing and shooting parties
often formed ; cricket and football,
quoits, pedestrian exploits, as well as
all descriptions of manly exercise were
enjoyed by young as well as the middle-
aged.
To show more definitely the attrac-
tion of the island to even young and
single officers of the line, I can re-
member repeated instances in which
urgent requests were made to head-
quarters in Sydney for a further
detention at the island, a year or
eighteen months generally being fixed
as the period of supposed transporta-
tion, to be borne by juniors in the
regiments stationed there. There was
a total absence of constitutional re-
straint, and the commission of any act
of discourtesy to one was generally
resented by all. I don’t for a moment
mean to assert that now and then we
had not our little *• disagreeables.
All men don’t come down with the
same ring of pure metal ; but all in
all, the free population of Norfolk
Island were not by any means a dis-
contented or too selfish lot.
When I first arrived there the
prison population consisted entirely
of what were termed “ old hands,” men
who had grossly misconducted them-
selves originally at home, and subse-
quently in the colonies, and who in
many cases being found incorrigible
at Sydney were quietly drafted to
Norfolk Island, where they were well
out of the way, and without chance of
escaping. Some of these men had
from one to three and four sentences
of transportation or imprisonment for
life standing against them—unhappy
wretches, who by some special and
laudable service had received a re-
mission of the remainder of one life
sentence, immediately commenced the
tedium consequent on another ! There
were, doubtless, desperadoes of the
most dangerous and determined class
unhung there, familiar with crime in
its every phase, without a gleam of
hope of liberty before them—lost souls
in fact. The isolation of their position,
without a ray of hope to soften their
hearts, no doubt had its deteriorating
influence on very many. But where a
hope of future release could be
reasonably indulged in, I can assert
confidently it (in the large majority of
instances) had its good effect. The
restraint used, after all, was not so
great, while the inducements to good
behaviour were not to be lightly
esteemed. The great curse, I have
ever thought, existing there was, so
far as the old hands were concerned,
the absence of any distinct system of
classification. The utterly hardened
were massed together with the yet
semi-penitent and hopeful ones, and
the effect, it cannot be wondered, was
pernicious to the last degree. The
greater number of prisoners were, of
course, mustered as they left and re-
entered their prison barracks daily;
but domestic servants, gardeners,
cattle tenders, and the like, chosen
from the well conducted men, had


greater freedom from restraint, those
to whose service they were “told off”
being responsible for their quietude
and good behaviour. The induce-
ments to these “private billets” were,
of course, very great, and their receipt
highly valued. The boats' crews were
also selected, as far as possible, from
the well conducted men, as also were
the schoolmasters, clerks, &c., but
these latter were always kept in
barracks under lock and key.
The men were, at one time permitted
to cultivate small gardens on Saturday
afternoons, but were prompt to re-
appear at muster time. The truth is
that escape from the Island was im-
possible, so that were a man missed,
he must assuredly be “ run to earth”
in a very few hours, so little
chance of. or space, was there for
hiding himself. Still the great yearn-
ing being liberty , it must not be
wondered at that no chance of secur-
ing that precious boon was unheeded.
I have made possibly unnecessary
and too lengthy reference to these
minor matters, but the necessity of the
act will be seen during the perusal
of the few, I hope, interesting anec-
dotes of attempts at escaping in par-
ticular. I write relative to the
prisoners at Norfolk Island. The
military guards were strong, and
conveniently located, and sentries from
their barrack-wall towers could watch
the actions of nearly everyone.
Shortly after my arrival the Home
authorities considered it expedient to
forward batches of prisoners, con-
victed for tho Jirst time in the mother
country, direct from England to the
Island; and to prevent the evil of
contamination, barracks were erected
for their reception in two different
localities—one at the Cascade, dis-
tant nearly three miles, the other at
Longridge, nearly two—from the
“old hands” and their prison. The
new arrivals were of vastly different
calibre to the old. Many cases were
almost pitiable from the apparent se-
verity of the sentences awarded. It
seemed a hard matter to transport a
youngster convicted for the first
time of some petty larceny, for a
period of two or three years, yet such
was the case. The penal atmosphere,
I may almost say, of the place poi-
soned them ; and while many blessed
the advantages of the local isolation,
too many others became hardened in
their sin, from either remorse or de-
spair. I can recall, as I write, scores
of instances of the classes I refer to.
Their name indeed was legion. Civil
servants, officers in the service, barris-
ters, attorneys, medical practitioners,
—indeed representatives of every class
of fallen society, were to he found in
the ranks of these first convicted men.
Numbers of them died from dysentery
caused by a too plentiful partaking of
tropical fruit and vegetables after a
long sea voyage and their usual prison
diet of “salt junk” and mouldy bis-
cuit. A good many found some
occupations suitable to their former
capabilities. The mechanics, artizans,
and tradesmen had their own separate
employment; and all, as they arrived,
were, no doubt, kept as far as was
practicable, from any association with
their more experienced and case-
hardened fellow-sinners. Crime was
less frequent with them than the old
hands; and they, at all events, could
entertain a reasonable hope of future
restoration to the society they had out-
raged. Taking the new arrivals, as
far as I can now remember, I should
say that at one period of my stay at
Norfolk Island certainly 2400 or 2500
prisoners were under sentences, —those
of periods varying from a couple or
three years to Jive lives ! All heavy
offences were tried before a commis-
sion sent from Sydney, and a jury was
empannelled from the military officers
on the spot. It certainly bore a drum-
head court martial aspect; but it was
convenient and withal economical.
Sentences of death were confirmed by
the Governor of New South Wales,
and, as a rule, the law was carried into
effect at Sydney, whither the unhappy
condemned ones were conveyed; so
that a considerable period oftentimes
elapsed between the passing of a sen-
tence and its being carried into effect.


I have now, I hope, fairly stated the
condition and general character of
Norfolk Island up to the time it was
handed over to the Tasmanian Govern-
ment (in 1845, I think), shortly after
which date we returned to Sydney.
Some of my yarns I am inclined to
think will partake of the humourous,
others of a more melancholy turn ; but,
I again would state all are based on
fact. One in particular, was publicly
mentioned many years ago, and at the
time of its occurrence by one very
much loved and honoured by me, so
that I shall briefly repeat some por-
tions of it for the perusal of the
present generation. It will be noticed,
too, that nearly all are based on at-
tempts to escape from that little sea-
girt cage. There are many other
incidents, possibly worth writing upon,
but the efforts to secure liberty, their
success as well as failure, will give me
ample material for several numbers
of “ Once-a-Week.” So for to-day,
adieu.
(To be continued,)
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY.
I fancy that the sudden strangulation
during its progressive motion Mr.
Fitzpatrick’s amended Electoral Act
received at the hands of our Lords last
week, has not evoked much public
sympathy. It certainly was well nigh
hacked to pieces, lost much of its
original shape at its birth, and under-
went any amount of torture, and in
the end, indeed, its own mother would
scarcely have recognized it; indeed
report has it that that individual grieved
not greatly at the sudden collapse of
the much-abused bantling forced upon
hpr. No one could have more tho-
roughly ensured its condemnation than
its sponsor, Mr. Marks, for he de-
liberately sent it to perdition “ with
all its imperfections on its head,” and
literally ‘ 4 damning it with faint (the
faintest) praise.” Not even the At-
torney-General's special pleading
could prevent its extermination.
Therefore, I say, let it R.1.P.! We
will, in all probability, have another
shot at the game before the
year’s out.
Farnell, like a sensible man, has
promptly acted on the suggestion con-
veyed by Onslow’s tremendous ma-
jority of two , and is bringing in a bill
to define the exact length the tether
rope of parliamentary rowdiness may
stretch to. The faithful Treasurer
tried vigorously to put the evil day off
till next session, but the House
“didn’t see it.” If, however, John
M‘Elhone adheres to the quietude and
respectability of his present de-
meanour—since that eventful night—
there is ground for belief that the
present seventy-three members won’t
give the Speaker or Driver much
trouble.
I am told Moss Vale is a pretty spot,
and many of our Metropolitan Dives
are building cozylike snuggeries there.
The population, however, seem to re-
quire special looking after, for scarcely
a fortnight passes by without some
honourable member enquiring of the
Minister for Works when he purposes
commencing the new Court-house,
Lockup, &c., and now they require a
Telegraph Office. Captain Onslow
broke the ice again last week on the
subject. I can’t help oftentimes being
amused at the vast interest taken by
our legislators in the public welfare of
special localities in which they possess
private property!
Angus Cameron does’nt approve of
the increasing influx of Chinese. He
can’t even admit the expediency of
manning ocean-going steamships with
seamen and stokers at a quarter of the
wages demanded by white men, but
above all, his special grievance lies in
the fact that our Celestial friends
“ only support one woman for fifty
men !” lam curious to learn whether
he means that it takes the labour or
earning of the fifty males to supply the
requirements of the tender one ? If
so, Mrs. John must be an expensive


luxury, and the lack of the commodity
at < nee accounted for.
Mr. John Lucas (who represents
that flourishing outskirt, Canterbury)
prefers subsidising the overland tele-
graphic line to steamships. He de-
clares that half the English business
transacted by our Sydney merchants,
is carried on by wire, and he gravely
informed “ the 'ouse' that he knew of
cases where a merchant left his mail
correspondence unopened on his table
for days after the mail had arrived.
That statement, however, being hard
to swallow by those listening to it,
he, amid some laughter, unhesitatingly
gave the name of one well-known and
respectable citizen (Mr. Thomas Buck-
land), as a “case in point.” “I’ve
seen his English mail letters,” re-
peated the rotund “ member,” “ lving
three days on his desk, unopened, so
don't tell me they don’t use the tele-
graph for business!” I can’t tell
what Mr. B. says to this expose of his
unconcern as to his mail communica-
tion. I dare say he enjoys the joke as
much as we did, but I still think there
must be some slight error on his friend
Lucas’ sjde.
Mr. Windeyer, for some time past,
has evidently been suffering from a
severe attack of “common carriage”
on the brain, and at last has succeeded
in persuading the House to pass his
little Carriers’ Bill into committee.
All we could gather from the explana-
tions he made was that as the English
parliament passed a like measure some
47 years ago, we here in Australia
ought to do the same now! Some ex-
perienced commercial members favored
us with the positive information ,that
the railway porters and labourers
knock valuable goods about as roughly
as do the teamsters when they receive
them at the several termini, and that
it will be a matter of “ toss-up”
whether you will get. your consign-
ments an hour sooner under the “ new
Windeyer patent” than the system at
present in practice. Mr. Windeyer
while over and over again defining his
idea of “common carriers,” never
mentioned anything as to the “ un-
common-ers.” A wag near me quaintly
remarked, “one is ‘common' and the
other is not”—that was the total
amount of his deduction, and put me
much in mind of the old yarn of a
man, who being called upon for a comic
song, apologised by saying he only
knew two in the world, “ one was God
save the Queen, and the other wasn’t.”
It seems after all that the addition
to the chamber of the Assembly will
not be immediately necessary. I would
respectfully suggest that some accom-
modation be provided for drowsy
members. While Windeyer was mak-
ing his lucid explanation upon “ car-
riers,” I noticed the Colonial Secretary,
the Minister for Mines, and others at
full length, asleep, on the well stuffed
couches, supremely indifferent to all
and everything around them. Some
support for the head might be allowed,
and save the legislative elbows and
wrists at all events!
THE LOUNGER.
SHOUTING.
BY AN OLD BUSHMAN.
“Shouting” is a practice which
owes its origin to the principle of com-
petition wrongly applied. Most male
folk know what “ shouting ” is. Four
or five men go into an hotel to have a
drink—under certain circumstances, a
perfectly legitimate, reasonable, and
proper thing to do. The evil spirit of
“ shouting ” won't, however, permit
those four or five men to have their
drink, or mayhap two drinks, apiece ;
no, it enforces its extraordinary dictum,
which enunciates this: So many men
in the company, so many drinks
apiece. Surely a monstrous dictum !
Now this is a drinking practice essen-
tially different from all other drinking
practices the world ever heard of—
and the cheery old planet has heard of
a good many in its time, believe me.


This “shouting" is an unconvivial,
slovenly, gluttonous, extravagant,
mean, utterly foolish custom—’tis a
device by which the drink consumer is
made, often unwillingly, to take more
than is good for him in the (to him)
most costly manner possible, and one
by which the drink purveyor who con-
nives at it is enabled to dispose of his
goods in the (to him) most economic
manner possible. We most of us
know that as a matter of fact it is no
uncommon thing for a man, on his way
homewards after a day's work, to go
into a public-house for the purpose of
taking a glass of ale, wine, or spirit,
and when there being led away by this
perverse spirit of “shouting" which
will have suggested to his mind the
propriety—a wretched conventional
kind of propriety, mind you—of asking
Tom and Dick, also present in the
bar, “to give it a name; ” and
which will have also suggested to each
of their minds, in turn, the like
wretched conventional propriety of re-
turning the compliment—just as if it
were a compliment to ask a man to
drink more than he wants and to re-
fuse to accept his refusal as a personal
insult. In the instance assumed,
“shouting" means three drinks to
each of the three men—the first drink
apiece, perchance, reasonable, health-
giving, properly stimulating, duly ap-
petising—the others unnecessary and
quaffed less for the pleasure of the
thing than from foolish motives of
false shame which wont or can’t say
“no.’ Now, only imagine that, in-
stead of there being merely three per-
sons at the bar, on one of these
occasions to which I am referring,
there were ten ! That means ten dis-
tinct shouts—by Bacchus! a right
Rabelaisian quantum ! Ten times ten
glasses, “nobblers," or “nips," making
by bibulous muliiplication the pro-
duct of one hundred drinks! And,
mind you, there are publicans who.
not content with leaving the subtle
spirit of “ shouting" to work its own
way in the minds of their customers,
will make suggestive remarks on their
own account; and who, seeing empty
glasses but hearing no order, will ask
(in the interest of their breeches’
pockets, the interest of this day and
generation), “who shouts next?" and
the question instead of being treated,
as it should be, as an impertinence, is
usually met by some one of the crowd
observing, “O, it’s my turn now,
bring them in again." Sometimes a
wretched shoutee on being asked by
the shouter “what’s yours?" will
make answer “I’m full up," or will in
some equally clear and forcible man-
ner explain that he doesn’t want any
more liquor, though it were the nectar
of the gods. But to poor shoutee
comes the terrible query, put by the
publican or by those who study the
general interests of licensed victuallers,
“ what! will you take a shingle off the
house?" and then weak-minded shouter,
dreading lest a hole in the roof of
his host’s house may be caused by the
abstraction of one solitary shingle, the
said abstraction being quite logically,
of course, connected with the refusal
to drink an unnecessary glass of liquor,
says, “ well, just one more"—and so
the orders go round ? There ar« hun-
dreds upon hundreds of men whose
characters are socially determined by
their “shouting" powers, and many a
poor devil has gained the most forlorn
of all reputations—that of being a*iood
fellow—by a money expenditure ruin-
ously out of proportion to his means,
and by an expenditure of vital power
ruinously out of proportion to the capa-
bilities of his constitution.
Shouting has crushed all hearty
true conviviality out of our drinking
customs. “ Shouting," in truth, is no
more a convivial custom than (to quote
Charles Reade’s words) “ patriotism is
love of country ; than theology is reli-
gion ; than science is philosophy ;
than paintings are pictures ; than re-
citing on the boards is acting; than
physic is medicine ; or than bread is
bread, or gold gold—in shops. ’ In
the drinking customs of the past gene-
ration there was conviviality, and,
where there was moderation with it—
which wasn’t often I must confess —
much comfort and jollity 7. There was


also in those customs some excuse for
overstepping the bounds of prudence.
A few friends met at a tavern for the
express purpose of having a carouse.
They went to their jollification know-
ingly—to enjoy thoroughly in a cosy
room a jolly evening—a very different
thing from going into a public-house
of the present day to drink a single
glass, or maybe two glasses of liquor,
and being entrapped by the ** shout-
ing*’ system into drinking two or three
more, and that, too, whilst standing in
an uncomfortable open bar in company
with persons whom you probably don’t
care twopence half-penny about. None
of our quaint old Bacchanalian songs
refer to a “ shouting” age. The three
post-boys who were drinking at the
Dragon, and who so stoutly determined
upon finishing the flagon, were not
votaries of this pitiful “ shouting”
system. No! those post-boys are
emphatically defined to have been jolly
post-boys, and must undoubtedly have
preferred a snug corner for the con-
sumption of their October, the reckon-
ing for which they jointly discharged,
to hanging around a bar, asking each
other alternately what they were going
to have.
The practice of “shouting” being
so habitual even on the part of per-
sonally temperate men, who pursue it
for business reasons, gives a drinking
atmosphere to our colonial society, and
goes far to justify the funny notion
of the Right Honourable Lord Staple-
hurst, that in the colonies all the men
are blind drunk the best part of their
time. It certainly is a queer custom
that of ratifying business transactions
by a mutual “shout” at the bar;
which invests the publican with a sort
of notarial importance, as though he
were the registrar of all deals and
swops and bets. This frequency of
the practice, and its apparent necessity
from a business point of view, leads,
of course, to the expenditure of a vast
annual sum upon spirits and fermented
liquors—an expenditure out of all pro-
portion to the value of the rrink con-
sumed. If eight men have five drinks
apiece, the money required to pay their
score (calculating the nobbier at 6d.)
comes to £l. Now, since two bottles
of sound grog can be bought wholesale
for less than half the money, one can
see the extreme extravagance as to-
wards his customers, the consumers.
I notice in the latest published English
wine and spirit circular that Martell's,
Hennessy’s and De Faulong’s very
best brands can be bought out of bond
in London at 11s. per gallon. At
twelve nobblersto the pint, i.e., ninety-
six to the gallon, the returns of the
retail sale of a gallon of unwatered
grog are £2 Bs., returns which leave
an ample margin for profit, even on the
presumption that the liquor retailed is
undoctored.
There is something very ludicrous
about the practice of “shouting”
when it is looked into carefully. Fancy,
a lot of bearded men standing round a
bar, asking one another what they are
going to have, for over an hour or so
at a spell. Melbourne Punch ridiculed
the idea the other day very well. It
shrewdly evolved out of its comic con-
sciousness of things a time when alco-
hol was no more, and, when men, in-
stead of “ shouting” brandies or rums,
or whiskys, or two-ales, or schnap
‘ ‘ shouted” sausages . The notion is
funny, no doubt, but not one whit more
funny than the prevalent notion. To
“ what’s yours?” there is really noth-
ing more comical in saying, “Bo-
logna,” or “German,” or “pork,”
than in saying “brandy” or “ whisky”
or “ rum.” And there would be noth-
ing more injurious to the health in
loading the stomach with adulterated
sausages than with adulterated liquors,
compounded of essential oils, and other
pestilent drugs.
Drinking is the most natural thing in
the world. We are born with a thirst;
our very first cry is for a drink; and
although few of us are so thirsty on
entering upon the stage of this mortal
life as was Gargantua, who (as Rabe-
lais tells us) was no sooner born, than
he cried out, not as other babes do,
but with a high, sturdy and mighty
voice, shouted aloud “ drink! drink! I
drink! !! ” as inviting all the world to


drink with him ; yet most of us have
an exceeding natural inclination that
way, whether we be jolly boys of the
spigot, monks of the screw, good tem-
plars, or young bandsmen of hope
growing up into fathers, sons, or bro-
thers of temperance. To drink is
natural. How then should we drink ?
This is no unimportant question.
Many unthinking persons would, at
the first glance at the query, rejoin,
“ with our mouths.” “Not so,” say I.
“We should drink with our brains.”
“ What do you mix your colours with,
Mr. Opie ?” asked an admirer of that
eminent painter. “With brains, sir,”
was the great artist’s terse reply—a
reply worthy of a great artist. All
brainless work is futile work. Yes,
we must drink with our brains. When
we do, “ shouting” will be a thing of
the past.
A RAT.
BY A. DE FONBLANQUE.
He was a levee * “ Rat,” and his name
was Dick. Dick what ? Nothing ;
and I do not think that he even got
Dick, through Richard given to him by
godfathers and godmothers in the
usual way. As a child he managed
somehow or other to escape the massa-
cres which those modern Herods Want,
Neglect , and Disease are allowed to
hold in our great cities ; and we find
him a small wild animal in the shape
of a boy twelve years old, living whore
he may, eating what he can get; his
hand against everything (that will sell
at the junk-shop) and every one’s hand
against him. A human rat —a thing
to hide itself in dark places, and to be
chased and worried when it dares ven-
ture into the light.
His costume is a pair of old blue
cotton pants, kept up over a faded
flannel shirt by a wonderful contrivance
of old braces and twine. His feet are
bare. On his head is a felt hat, which
(whatever was its original colour) has
now the hue of a well-soaked tea-leaf,
and (whatever was its original shape)
has long taken that of a jelly-bag.
Perhaps if he were washed, be would
be a good-looking Rat, under his grime;
for his eyes are very bright. He does
not know what school means. No one
has ever told him it is wrong to steal,
though the inconveniences of being
caught stealing have been made mani-
fest to him in many ways. His last
hair-dresser was a policeman, as you
might perceive, if his jelly-bag hat
did not come down so low. Experi-
ence is not thrown away upon him, and
he becomes rather hard to catch.
“Why don’t he work?” He does
work in his way.
How do all young animals work for
a living ? By picking up what they
can get, to be sure ! and keeping out
of the way of bigger things who want
to pick them up. That is the Natural
Law of Life, and Dick the “ Rat” has
been taught no other. He lives as
other “ Rats” live—c,n what he can
scrape out of a barrel of sugar, or
draw from a bale of cotton, or cut (no
one looking on) from the rigging of a
ship. He does this just as a blackbird
eats a cherry, or a rabbit nibbles tur-
nips.
The levee which Dick infers is that
of New Orleans ; down by the foot of
Jackson Street, where the English
steamers lie, is his happy hunting
ground, and on the day when we make
his acquaintance it has not been pro-
ductive. The hunting has been all on
on» side, and Dick (discovered hiding
between two bales of cotton) is the
quarry. He is kicked, pushed, drag-
ged, jostled backwards and forwards,
by the stevedore’s men, like a ragged
shuttlecock. Everyone has a curse and
a blow for the “ Rat,” with whom
things are going hard when
“Oh, how shameful to beat that
poor child so!” exclaims a soft voice,
with a ring of genuine indignation in
it.
The speaker is a lady clad in crisp,
cool muslin, elegantly draped—a lady,
beautiful in face and form, and assisted
by every accessory that can heighten
* The Levees are artificial banks of the river
Mississippi, upon which (at New Orleans) all the
business of lading and discharging ships is done.


female charms. From her dainty
little bottines, which fit her like gloves,
to the soft curls of her hair, which the
river breeze caresses, she is stamped
with the Hall-marks of richness, sim-
plicity, and good taste. She is half-
way up the stage which leads to the
English steamer, when the cries of our
hunted Hat attract her attention, and
“ Oh,” she exclaims,?“ how shameful
to beat that poor child so! Do, please,
Captain Gilbert, make them leave him
alone.”
Captain Gilbert, whose guest she is,
and who leads her up the stage, shouts,
“ Hallo ! quit that! Let the boy
go, and get on with your work.” For
you see, one cannot beat “ Rats” and
roll cotton at the same time ; and the
latter occupation, though perhaps the
more exciting, is the less profitable of
the two.
Dick—who, unable to dodge his tor-
mentors, has emulated the principle of
a hedgehog, and made himself as
nearly spherical as possible against a
cotton bale—does not rise. The foe
has not sufficiently retreated, but he
keeps a bright look-out from the corner
of one eye, so as to be ready for a
jump.
“They have hurt him,” says the
lady. “ He can’t get up, poor little
fellow !” and, before any one can in-
terfere, she trips down the stage, and
is stooping over the “Rat,” who is
so taken aback by the apparition that
he forgot to jump, and rolls over
straight. His plight—when it appears
that no bones are broken—makes the
lady smile. He has been kicked into
a coal-heap, and is black. He has been
cuffed against a lot of oil-cake, and is
russet-brown. He is fluffy all over
with cotton waste. His mouth is open,
and his eyes are wild with astonish-
ment. He had never been so near to
a lady, and he don’t know what will
be done to him.
“ Come, get up,” says the captain ;
“there’s nothing the matter with
you.”
“ Can you rise ?” asks the lady ; and
she touches him with the most wonder-
ful thing that Dick ever saw—her
hand ! The creamy glove upon it, the
shimmer of lace and glitter of gold at
the wrist, and the soft, white flesh be -
yond! never had he seen the like!
Never had he felt such a touch, or been
spoken to in such a tone.
“Oh, ain’t I in for it now?” he
muses ; and then he looks up into the
lady’s face.
He saw an expression there that he
did not understand. He had seen
anger in the faces of those who had
caught him suddenly. Triumph—he
knew the look of, when after a long
chase he had been taken. Scorn—
that was common ; plenty of that at
all times. This was pity—so he could
not make it out at all. A Hebrew in-
scription would not have been more
unintelligible to Dick.
There was no chance for a bolt now.
The lady, the gentleman T\ho came
with her, the captain of the steamer
and its chief officer, formed a semi-
circle in front; behind was the bale of
cotton against which he had rolled
himself up for protection. He sits
up, drinking in that strange expression
which at once scares, puzzles, and
pleases him, till a sort of sleepy, faint
feeling makes him close his eyes.
“ He’s going to faint, ’ says the lady.
“ I knew he was hurt. Oh, see how he
is bleeding!”
He is bleeding badly. Big dark
drops are trickling fast down his rag-
ged sleeve, which will soak no more.
These come from an ugly tear (caused
by a nail in the wharf planking) on his
arm, just above the elbow.
“ Don’t you look, Mrs. Austen,’’
says the captain ; “ I’ll have him at-
tended to. Oh, Quartermaster! come
and carry this boy on board, and give
my compliments to the doctor, and
ask him to plaster up his cut.”
Dick has no power to resist. He is
carried on bon’d, muttering, “ Come,
I ain’t done nothing to you!”
A cold lunch is served under the
awning on the main deck. Two other
ladies and their escorts arrive, but the
meal is delayed by the appearance of
some of the crew bearing squat, heavy
boxes, which jingle as they are lowered


through a trap-door in the deck partly
under the lunch table.
“ Mexican dollars.” explains the
captain.
“What a lot of money !” the lady
remarks.
“ Not so much as you suppose, but
a tidy sum. Each box contains two
thousand dollars, and there are four-
teen of them—eh, Mr. Mansfield ?”
This to the officer in charge, who con-
firms the count.
They have got to their first glass of
champagne when the doctor joins
them.
“Well,‘how’s your patient?” asks
the captain.
“All right; and clean, for once in
his life, but rather weak,” is the me-
dical report upon the Rat.
“ Poor child !” sighs the lady.
“What ought he to take?”
“I should prescribe something to
eat,” the doctor replies, helping him-
self to a slice of tongue.
“Captain, I should so like to give
him some dinner.”
It is unnecessary to say who speaks,
and the skipper would indeed have
been a stern man if he could have re-
sisted the pleading of those kind brown
eyes. The quartermaster is summoned
again, and appears leading Dick, who
walks “ groggy.” It has begun to
dawn upon him that he is not going to
be abused, and he goes along there
“like a little cock-o’-wax” as he is
told.
“What is your name, little boy?”
asks the lady.
“Dick.”
“ Are you hungry, Dick ?”
“ Ra-ther!’'
“ Only rather ?” in a tone of disap-
pointment.
“ ‘{Rather,’ ” explains the captain,
“ in that tone, means ‘ very.’ ”
The lady takes a plate and fills it
with cold chicken, stuffing, _ salad,
bread, and what not, adds a knife and
fork, arid gives it to Dick.
The knife and fork are no use to him.
He squats on the deck, and eats with
Nature’s implements. He has no
idea of gastronomic combinations.
First he eats the chicken, then the
stuffing, then the salad, then the bread;
and, this done, takes a long breath,
and looks up with a look that says
more , as plainly as Oliver said the word.
More he gets, from the same kind
hand, which he watches with dimly
awakened feeling of delight. Gloved,
it was a wonder ; bare and glittering
with costly rings, so white, so small—
it bewildered him. Why did every-
one do what she told them? How
could she keep all those gold things ?
She couldn’t “ lick” any one with those
hands ! Dick mused.
The plate is full again, and he turns
his attention to its contents with ap-
parently undiminished appetite .
“ I should keep some of that for to-
morrow, if I were you,” observed the
doctor.
“Then you’d be a fool!” Dick re-
plied with a scoff. “ The big fellows
on the levee'd take it frem you before
you’d gone two blocks ! To-morrow
ain’t here but the grub is, and so I’m
a-going to get outside it while I can.”
There is a general laugh at this
philosophy, and the lady asks if he
may have a glass of champagne.
“ Yes," the doctorjsays, “ but I think
he would prefer whisky.”
“Whisky? a child take that!” she
expostulates.
“ Try him,” replies the doctor.
He is tried, and tosses off three
fingers deep of raw Bourbon without
winking.
“ That’s so’thinglike !” he observes,
smacking his lips.
This feat somewhat lessens the lady’s
sympathy. Dick “gets outside” his
grub without further comment, and is
walking off when the captain calls him
back with a—
“ Why, you young rascal! are you
going without saying thank you ?”
“Thank ye.”
“ No, not me. Thank the lady.”
“Thank )e kindly, maam,” says
Dick.
It was the first polite speech he had
ever uttered, and heaven knows where
he picked it up.

COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.
Why on earth Bluebottle went in for the
Civil Service is a riddle which his most
intimate friends have not been able to
solve. One of the subjects of examina-
tion was writing from dictation, and the
following is a copy of the result in Blue-
bottle’s case.—

TALES OF THE COLO MANIA.
BY OUR OWN MANIAC.
No. 3.
A GOOD SHAFT HORSE.
Horses belonging to miners are for
the most part very tractable animals,
having, however, certain peculiarities
which distinguish them from ordinary
quadrupeds. They don’t object as a
rule to carry anything that can be
strapped on to their backs in the way
of impedimenta. A tin billy, a frying
pan, and a set of mining tools, dangl-
ing about their sides, a pair of blankets
in front of the saddle, or a couple of
well-stuffed saddlebags, with a thirteen
stone digger outside of them, is the
kind of loading which they are ac-
customed to.
They know by a sort of instinct
when they are approaching a public-
house or sly grog-shop, and no in-
centive in the way of whip or spur will
induce them to pass it until the riders
have dismounted and refreshed them-
selves with a nip. They are also
good at jumping logs, which is a
favorite amusement with miners who
take an outing on horseback on holiday
occasions. They will stand patiently
for hours hitched up to a rail, and
after galloping at top speed a few
hundred yards further, will not object
to be pulled up suddeuly and to go
through another hour’s penance of a
similar kind.
Miners of ihe better class, who are
chiefly interested in quartz mining,
usually ride round to the scenes of
their several ventures every morning,
and their horses soon get to know the
claims which they have to visit. In
deep sinking horses are employed to
work the whims, and the intelligence
they display in stopping and retracing
their steps at the word ‘‘turn” is very
whimsical. After a week or two they
do not require a driver, habit teaching
them that when they have gone round
a certain number of times to hoist the
bucket up they must go back an
equal number of times to let it down
again. The brute instinct is quite
strong enough to show them that
“one good turn deserves another.”
But there is one peculiarity in the
horses which are to be found grazing
in the neighbourhood of mining
localities, which often puts their
owners to serious trouble and expense.
The animals get so accustomed to pick
their way through holes and excavations
of all kinds th.it they lose their natural
caution and frequently stumble head-
first into a pit, from which they can
only be extricated by the combined ex-
ertions of a number of men. This
might be excusable if it were only
practised by draught horses who are
accustomed to back into shafts, but it
is a general failing with diggers’
horses of all kinds. Tempting tufts
of grass growing on the edge of
holes from fifteen to twenty feet deep


attract them, and a false step sends
them in.
It is said that a nod is as good as a
wink to a blind horse, but to animals
afflicted with imperfect vision, both
nodding at id winking are dangerous
pastimes in the neighbourhood of deep
sinking. When I was a miner I kept
three horses which were in the habit of
pasturing on an alluvial flat just out-
side the township. This, at one time,
had been the scene of a gigantic rush.
The flat was perforated from end to
end with trial holes of all sizes and
shapes, some shallow and some very
deep.
One of my horses, a bay pony mare,
kept for the use of my eldest boy, was
unfortunately blind of one eye, and
this defect was so far fatal to her that
she came to grief at least once every
week. She had plenty of bottom in
one sense, for it appeared as if she
were systematically testing the capa-
bilities of every shaft on the flat.
At last I got quite used to the mes-
sage, “ That little bay mare of yours
is down a shaft again.”
Then I would hurry to the spot and
find the mare quietly seated on her
haunches at the bottom of the hole,
with her head some three feet below
the surface. The miners working in
*the neighbourhood, always ready to do
a good turn, would quickly find their
waj to the scene and put in an hour’s
willing labour. A trench would be
cut leading from the ishaft to give the
mare footing for her forelegs ; a rope
would be thrown over her hind legs, to
which a score of lusty hands would
attach, and out she would come vi et
rnrriis.
Under such circumstances, of course,
it was only natural to offer some com-
pliment in return for such willing and
ready assistance, and a bottle or two
of brandy would be sent for and
quaffed with the utmost good fellowship
The little bay mare stood mo in at
Last 5s a week during the whole time
I kept her on the diggings for brandy
alone, exclusive of corn, and she was
not by any means a spirited animal
when clear of a shaft.
At last I sold her to a cockatoo
farmer residiug in the neighbourhood,
who made light of her blind eye—this
is not intended as a ioke. —Whether
he had been disappointed in the cash
payments he had received for com
supplied to storekeepers in the town-
ship, or whether something else had
occurred to sour his temper, or whether
he funked his wife’s opinion of his pur-
chase, I cannot say ; but when he paid
the meney, which he did after a good
deal of chaffing, and very reluctantly,
he remarked, “I shall get into a hole
with that pony yet. 4 ’
I breathed a hope that for his sake
the hole would not be below the average
depth.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 15.
Will some honorable member, in
his place in the Legislative Assem-
bly, ask the Government, and insist
upon a clear and comprehensive
reply, two questions, both of which
are closely connected with the health
of the community—what is beng
done to carry out the recommend-
ations made by the late Sewage and
Health Board as to the disposal of
the filth of the city ? and in what
manner is the offal and refuse of
the Glebe Island Abattoirs got rid
of?
The Board, who sat for over two
years considering sanitary matters,
urged repeatedly and in very strong
terms the danger to the public
health caused by the imperfect sys-
tem which obtained in connection
with the closet nuisance, and they
submitted to the Government the
draft of a bill to remedy the evil.
That bill became law under the
title of the Nuisances Prevention
Act of 1875. It provided that
thenceforth the emptying of all
cesspits should be the duty of the
Municipal Councils, to be performed


by their own officers, householders
being required to give notice in
writing to the Council that
their premises required cleansing.
Clauses were also inserted giving
power to the Inspector of Nuisances
to enter and examine premises, and
to take action when necessary to
preserve cleanliness, a duty which
we believe that officer has per-
formed energetically and concien-
tiously. It further provided that
each Municipal Council should
purchase or otnerwiso secure a place
for tho deposit of night-soil, but
unwisely we thick allowed them the
alternative of sending it out to sea
and burying it in the ocean. The
Health Board, after taking a great
variety of evidence on the subject,
and making themselves acquainted
with the modes of disposal in Eng-
lish and Continental towns, were
strongly impressed with the advan-
tage over all other methods of
trenching it in the earth and even
utilising it by raising green crops for
cattle-feeding purposes, as is done
with much success in older countries
where the question has been exten-
sively ventilated. To facilitate the
adoption of this plan by the city and
some of the suburban municipali-
ties, they purchased on behalf of
the Government a sandy tract of
land in an isolated position across
Cook's River admirably adapted for
the purpose.
The City Council, however, were
above both precept and example
and would have none of it. Tney
met in solemn conclave, and ihe
result of their deliberations was to
xend the night soil out to sea in barges.
They had a model barge con-
structed, which was submitted to
the Health Board, and they ridi-
culed the idea of carting the rtfuse
matter to Botany.
In this resolve they were backed
up by most of the suburban muni-
cipal councils, and the matter was
supposed to be definitely settled. But
a difficulty arose. From what point
were the obnoxious cargoes to be
shipped. No wharf could be had for
love or money, and it was found practi-
cally impossible to carry out the plan.
What have they been doing with
the night-soil of the city since that
time, and what are they doing with
it now ? It is affirmed that the
nightmen they employ take their
carts just outside the city and
empty them by the roadside, on
private property, on a portion of
Botany watershed, any wiiere, in
short, where they can get rid of it
without being seen and with the least
trouble to themselves. The health of
the city is thus gravely imperilled
and the Act becomes a dead letter.
Then with regard to the refuse
at the Glebe Island Abattoirs. The
Board were not long in discovering
that the offal went from the
slaughter-houses direct to certain
piggeries in Alexandria and neigh-
bouring municipalities, and they
made strong recommendations on
this subject also. OFFAL-FED
FORK is the rule and not the ex-
ception in Sydney. Will any one
pretend to say this is not another
grave source of danger to the
citizens ? How many cart-loads of
offal still find their waj PER DIEM
to the piggeries aforesaid ? Both
these questions should be of vital
interest to the residents in Sydney,
and we fear they cannot be answered
satisfactorily. But we hope some
member will take the cue from us,
and get definite information on the
subject from the Government if pos-
sible before—NEXT SESSION.


YARN BY A RAILWAY
PORTER.
Station-master is it you want, sir ?
Well, I’m the station-master! Yes,
an’ porter, too, for that matter. Like-
wise bookin’-clerk and lamp-lighter ;
an’ if so be as a wheel-box wants fillin’
with the best Dosset, as we calls the
grease on this line, just for a lark,
why, I’m the man to fill it.
“Dull ? I should think so; in fact,
dull ain’t the word, as keepin’ a pike
on a branch road leadin’ to nowheres
would be lively by the side of it. You
see that box there with the textes on
it ? Well, that’s a collectin’ box for
the orspittle at Spankton, that is ; an’
every day as there is more than three
passengers gets in or out here, I puts
in a penny by way of thankoff’rin’. It
ain’t been opened for close on two year,
an’ there’s—well, I thinks its one-an’-
fo’pence in it, an’ the shillin’ wos gived
by a gent by mistake last month, as
thought*the box was put there for the
Compassionate Turks Fund.
Hadventures, do you say? Well it’s
precious few as we gets here. For
who is there to 'ave ’em, if it comes to
that, unless I goes cranky an’ muddles
the points. There was a bit ’o fun last
week, now I come to think on it, for
when the 2.40 hup train comes in, out
jumps a helderly party, and rushes
into the bookin’-orfice there, an’ I
arffcer him, of course.
“ Oh ? ’’ says he, when I gets in be-
hind the pidgin’-ole, “ I wants three
first-class single tickets for soup ! ’’
and flings down a trouser button an’ a
teetotal meddle. I was that taken
aback I couldn’t speak for a minnit, so
he goes on. “Now then," says he,
“sharp it is, an’ none o’your mock
turtle." But just then another party
comes in, an’ says, “ Oh, there you
are, are you ?’’ to him as wanted the
soup tickets. “ Come along," he says,
and the helderly gent gathered up his
meddles an’ button like a lamb, an’
went out harm-in-arm with the other.
Which I ’ad the cur’osity to foller, an’
hexamine the tickets in the compart-
ment as they was in, an’ sure enuff,
'twas two single for Hanwell as they
'ad.
An' talkin’ o’ Hanwell, there was a
bit of an hadventure here about this
time last year, that has a good flavour
of that same about it. You're very
kind, sir; an’ I shall drink your ’ealth
with pleasure. Hear it? Of course
you shall, if you like, tho' I’m not
good at the patter like some.
Well, I was a sittin’ here as may be,
with one eye on the hup line an’
t'other cn the bookin-orfiee, when all
to once I 'eard a shoutin’ out in the
high road there, an’ goin’ out to see
what ’twas I saw a dog-cart turned
over about fifty yards orf, and some
people standin’ round. As there was
nothink due for ’arf an hour, I runs
down to the place an’ finds as the axle-
tree is snapped, whilst a young gent as
was brushin’ the dust an’ that orf a
young female, as was sittin’ on a
porchmancho, was goin’ on dreffle
about 'is luck an’ sich like.
Seein’ luggidge, I hups with it, an’
brings it to the junction here, the
couple follerin’, whilst a labourin’ man
as belonged to the party, I s’pose, was
told to get the trap an’ 'orse to the
nearest blacksmith’s as soon as he
could.
The first inquiry of the young man
was the next train to Lunnon; an’
when I said 3.so—’twas 2 then—l
thought he’d have flew’d at me with a
chair, he was that vi’lent.
“ Three-fifty ! ” he shouted; “ Non-
sints! That won’t do ; we must go
on now, Get a special —anythink! A
goods train will do. Have yer got a
goods train about ? ”
Arf an hour agone, as I told’im, the
down luggidge was in the station, but
this only made 'im wilder. Though
the young woman, as was very pretty,
kep sayin’, “Be calm, dear Hedward ;
don’t take on so.”
But he went ragin’ about liko a me-
naggery tiger, an' at last he calls out,
a-seizin’ the water-bottle in the waitin'
room, “Go away, porter; we would
be alone! ”
“ Crikey ! ” thought I i “ here’s a
queer customer, an’ no mistake," an’ I


went an’ took hup a persition near the
points, not knowin’ he wouldn’t do
somethink despurd with ’em if he’ad
the chance.
Well, I ’adn’t left ’em about five
minutes when I hears a little scream,
as was hevidently the purty gal’s : so
I takes up a big wrench, and back I
goes.
*• Oh, kind, good Mr. Porter,” says
she, a-comin' to meet me along the
platform, “ ’ave pity on me, won’t
you ? ” an’ she looked up at me that
pleadin’-like I’d have given to ’er the
whole premisses, if she’d wanted ’em.
“What is it, miss?” I says, not
thinkin’ some’ow she could be a
“ mum” at ’er age.
“ Oh, it’s Hedward,” says she,
“ a-goin’ on dreffler and dreffler. He
wants your blood! ”
“ Wants my blood, miss ! ” says I,
a-drorin’ back. “ Whatever for ? ”
“ Oh,” says she, “ that’s ’is peculiar
way. He does get sich whims. But
we must pacify him—eh ; ”
“ Certingly, miss,” I says, a follerin’
her as she went into the waitin’-room.
•‘There stands the bloodthirsty
ruffian!” she cried, a-pointin’ with ’er
finger. “ Bemove ’im, Mr. Porter! ”
Now, I must say that, so far from
lookin’ bloodrhirsty, he was standin’
in a werry mild manner, and when he
caught my eye he gave a wink. Alto-
gether, I couldn’t make no ’ed nor tail
to it.
“ You won’t remove ’im ?” cried the
young woman agen. “Werry well, I
shall call in more ’elp ; ” and with that,
hout she goes on to the platform.
He was by my side in a minnit.
“Poor man!” he says—“and so
young, too 1 Belike you have a mother,
my poor feller ? ”
“No,” says I. not livin’."
“ Ah,” says he, no matter. A lovin’
aunt, then, or a dotin’ uncle ?”
“ What if I ave ?” I says.
“ It hafflicts me to think they must
lose you, that’s all,” he says, por-
tendin’ to weep a tear.
“Lose me! ” I cried. “Who says
I’m goin’ to be lost?”
“ She !” says he, pointin’ thro’ the
winder. “ She’s sworn to ’ave your
blood.”
« What, two of ’era ? ” I thinks to
myself, a lookin’ roun’ for the wrench,
which was gone. “ Here’s a pair o’
manyacs, evidently, an’ me all alone.”
With that the female comes in agen,
an’ says to the young man, as she
shuts the door:
“Well, we must have ’is blood,
Hedward, I suppose.”
•‘I fear so,” replies he, takin’ off ’is
hulster. “ It’s a pity, too.”
It’s no good to say I wasn’t fright-
ened, for I was —terr’ble frightened,
’specially when I sor ’im take some-
think hout of ’is pocket, as looked like
a pistol-case.
“ You don’t want to die yet, porter
—eh ?” asks the young gent, catchin’
me by the harm as I was tryin’ to back
hout to go an’ telegraft for ’elp.
“Of course I don’t,” I answers.
“An’ I hope you’ll ’ave mercy.”
“On one condition,” says be, an’
the young ’ooman nods. “ You must
change clothes with me, an’ lie under
the counter in the bookin’-orfice with-
out speakin’ till the next train is gone.
If you do that, there’s your life an’
twenty pounds. If you don’t, your
blood an’ a pauper’s funeral ? ”
“ Percisely,” says the young ’ooman.
Well, it’s easy to say I was a fool,
now, but at the time I was that fright-
ened, I was only too glad to promise
to do what was proposed; and in about
three minutes, whilst the purty gal
went out on the platform, he got on my
corduroy suit, ’at an’ all, an’ was
smearin’ ’is face an’ ’ands to make 'im
look portery, whilst I was wrapped
hup in ’is hulster, and stowed away
under the counter; whilst the young
female also sat in behind where she
could watch me, tho’ the public
couldn’t see ’er owin’ to the time-table
boards that the young man rigged up
all round ’er.
My wust fear was that he’d go an’
halter the points, an’ I’d made up my
mind to jump hout at all risks, an’ pur-
went that. i>ut he didn't leave the


bookin’-orfice, an’ for a mad couple
they conducted themselves wery hor-
derly.
“ The minnits went on ’till was past
three, and just afore the quarter
struck there was the sound o’ wheels
outside, an’ somethink dashed hup to
the door. A moment arfter, in rushes
a hold gent, as I could see ’im through
a crack in the wood, ’an a tearing
he seemed to be in.
“ Hullc, there !’ he shouts, “ who
is there here ? Where’s the station-
master ? Here, porter! Some one, I
say —quick!”
With that, the young gent as ’ad
been taking a lesson in stampin’
tickets, and learnin' ’owthey was kep’,
opened the pidgin-’ole.
‘•Yessir,” he says, “where for?”
“ Oh,” replies the hold gent, “ I
want the station-master, sir. A terr’ble
thing ’as happened. My niece has
been carried ’orf; an’ I’ve tracked ’er
to this station. Where is tbe station-
master, I say?”
“I m the party!” says the young
gent, as bold as brass. ‘‘l’m every-
think in this establishment hexcept the
proprietor of the line !”
“ Oh, you’re in sole charge, are
you?” says the aged party; “then
you can tell me, p’raps. Where’s my
niece hiding sir, an’ the rascal that
carried ’er orf?”
“ It’s some mistake,” says the
young man in my clothes. “I’ve been
on duty all day, an’ we’ve no nieces
concealed about these premises. It’s
agen the bye-laws for one thing!”
“ Confound the bye-laws!” returned
the angry old man. «Do you mean
to tell me as my neice an’ the scoundrel
who took ’er orf didn’t come to this
station ?”
“No, I don’t,” answers the young
man. “ Was it a tall niece, in a broad-
brimmed hat and big white feather ?”
“It was, sir—it was!” shouts the
old man, excitedly.
“ An’ she wore a tight tie-back, with
a long cloak an’ tassels,” my repper-
sentative goes on.
“ She wore, she wore!” cries the old
party, not knowin’ what he was a say in’.
“ An' the scoundrel, ’ad he on a bio-
black and white plaid ulster an’ a billy-
cock ’at ?” the youthful imposter con-
tinues.
VHe ad—he ’ad !” the old man ex-
claims, gettin’ almost frantic.
“ Oh, then, you’re too late!”
‘‘What? They cant begone. There’s
no train to Lunnon till 3*50.”
“ Who says they went to Lunnon ?”
“ Y( >u don’t mean to say that deep
rascal went West?”
“ When passengers arsks for tickets
I give em, the young man says,
calmly. “An’ if a couple took singles
for Exeter it’s no business of mine so
long as they pay.”
“ The villain !” cries the old party.
“Then he took her off by the 1*55
down express. But I’ll catch em yet.
He dar* not marry ’er till shes of hage,
and that won’t be till the day after to-
morrow. When can Igoon ?”
“ West, sir?”
“ Yes, to Exeter ?”
“There’s a down train in five
minutes,” says the young man, as ad
learned orf all the trains hup or down
for the rest of the day.
‘•' Capital! ” cries the ol d party. “Give
me a fust single. I shall be in time now.”
With that my reppresentative
stamps the ticket an’ gives it out,
while I, as ’ad begun to see what all
the purtended madness meant, could
'ardly keep from chucklin’. But the
poor young gal in behind the time-
tables was in a dreffle state. I could
see ’em all of a shake.
Well, a few minnits arfter in corned
the Exeter train, punctual to the mo-
ment, an’ my fear was as the guard
would see it wasn’t me on the platform,
an’ smell a rat. But, as luck’d ’ave it
’twas a new man, on, an’ the old gent
took a seat an’ went orf without no
’itch of any kind.
As you may fancy, sir, almost afore
the train was out ’o sight the young
female ’ad jumped out from behind the
time-tables, an’ sbe an’ Hedward was
doing a kind of hornpipe ofi the plat-
form, whilst I ’adn’t the ’eart to be
hangry, tho' I had been served sich a
trick.


“We was bound to do it, porter,”
says he, as he fling’d me back my
jacket. “ You wouldn’t ’ave consented
to leave your post for no ornary cause
now, would you ?” An’ I’m boun’ to
say, sir, the young gent was right. I
shouldn’t have dared a done it, if I
’adn’t been frightened into it, an’ that’s
the truth.
“ If we can only get married the day
after to-morrow, we shall be hawfully
rich, shan’t we, Lizzie ?” An’ the purty
gal blushed, an’ said “Yes.” “An’
the fust cheque I draw shall be for
you, porter ; an’ if there’s ever any
bother about to-day’s business you
shall come an’ be our butler—there.’’
Did the cheque come ? Ay, that it
did, about three weeks after, “With
Mr. and Mrs. Mellifill’s thanks’”
Ah, and it does my ’eart good when
I’m gloomy to think o’ that couple, an’
'ow ’appy they was when once they
know’d the old huncle was on his way
to Exeter on a false scent. When the
3.50 came in at last, they ran for it
like a pair o’ children, an’ that’s a fact,
an’ I arfter ’em, till the passengers
must have thought we was all mad.
Yes, that is your train, sir. Thank
you, sir; thank you.
—Comic Paper.
“ Editing a paper,” declares a Transat-
lantic editor, “is a nice business. If we
publish jokes, people say we are rattle-
headed. If we omit jokes, they say we
are an old fossil. If we publish original
matter, they blame us for not giving selec-
tions. If we publish selections, folk say
we are lazy for not writing something they
have not read in some other paper. If we
give a man a complimentary notice, we
arc censured for being partial. If we do
not give complimentary notices, folk say
we are a hog. If we do not cater for the
wishes of the ladies, the paper is not fit to
tie up a parcel. If we remain in our
office and attend to our business, folk say
say we are too proud to mingle with our
fellows. If we go out, they say we never
attend to our business. If we do not pay
our bills promptly, folk say we are not to
be trusted. If we wear poor clothes, folk
say business is bad. If we wear good
clothes, they say we never paid for them.
Now what are we to do ?”
THE CRIMINAL CROWS.
A Yarn of an Australian “ Co-
robbery,”
Out in the Bush, at What’s-its-
name P
(It quite defies all English spelling),
In charge of cattle from the Tame,
Thre e Stockmen make their humble
dwelling.
Dampers and meat and tea their fare,
Varied by meat and tea and dampers ;
Fortnum and Mason sent not there,
Nor friends profuse with Christmas
hampers.
“ Early to rise,” and break their fast;
Then to the ‘ ‘ run ’ ’ they urged their
horses;
First placing for the next repast
Tea, damper, meat—the usual courses.
But sure as ever they return’d,
To feed that “man" we call “the
inner, ”
They all with indignation bum’d
To find some thief had “ boned” their
dinner.
Who could it be ? The doors were lock'd.
The windows in secure condition :
The crows that on the tree-tops flock’d
Began to rouse our friends’ suspicion.
“We’ll trap them sure as eggs!” cried
they :
“To-morrow you shall stay behind,
Jack,
And if the birds come down to prey,
Kill every one that you can find, Jack.”
’Twas tried; one Stockman all day long
Lay hid beneath the “ shanty ” table ;
No crow he heard, but heard the thro eg
Keep up a harsh and deafening Babel.
’Twas clear they were in high debate,
Whether ’twas safe to make an entry,
Some did approve, some deprecate, ’
With arguments quite parliamentary.
The trick had fail’d; one more was tried,
Next day the men rigged up a dummy,
when on horseback firmly tied,
Look’d life-like as a modern mummy,
One, two, three, the Stockmen leave—
At least the crows that watched them
thought so;
Each, as it were, “ laugh’d in his sleeve—
They little dream’d of being caught so. "


All joining in the glorious caws,
Adown the wide flue flew they trooping,
And, sharply arm’d with bills and claws,
Upon the tempting food came swooping.
Upstarts a Stockman all alive—
The birds without their host had reck-
on’d,
Like bees disturbed within their hive,
The swarm was scattered in a second.
Chased round the room, they ail got slain,
Save one, who soon saw what the game
was ;
No crotvs were ever seen again
In—whatsoe’er the place’s name was.
This true but striking story shows
’Gainst corvine instinct there are no
bars,
For had the chimney fail’d, the crows
No doubt would have got in with crow-
bars !
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMANS FERRY ROAD.
Chapter X.—( Continued.)
Yokky, however, had any amount of
stories relative to escapes or attempted
escapes, mainly of the mythical type,
perhaps at the base of them a sub-
stratum of fact upon which his lively
invention had piled lie upon lie until
the foundation was completely con-
cealed beneath the superincumbent
falsehood. Oddly enough none of the
yarns were of successful efforts to
make away from the chaiugang and
the triangles. All told of failure, re-
arrest, and extra “ dowries.”
Caldecott, for several days after his
first discovery of the initials of
Aldridge’s and his mother’s names,
was occupied during all his leisure
moments in searching for further reve-
lations from the rudely-sculptured
rocks, and not without success. Along
the road, on either side of the stone
he had first come across bearing
the engraved letters which had
excited his curiosity, he found more
work evidently by the same hand.
About two miles nearer the ferry he
met with another block of yellow sand-
stone, but a few yards to the right of
the road, and on it read the same two
pairs of initials over the same date.
A more careful scrutiny of the rock
showed him a faintly-cut “6 ’’ some
few inches below the border, by which
the other letters and figures were sur-
rounded. Going back and examining
his other discoveries a second time,
he was surprised to find in each in-
stance some figure, a “6,” or a “7,
or a “ 9.” faintly marked (scratched
rather than cut) beneath the other
work. What these figures could sig-
nify he tried in vain to conjecture.
Did they refer to the years of servi-
tude the wretched man who had
wearily chiselled those weather-worn
marks had still to undergo ere he
could expect a remission of the sen-
tence that doomed him to fetters and
the scourge ? They were evidently by
the same hand, though less deeply
chisel L-d.
All George’s efforts to find similar
traces of J. A.’s handiwork on rocks
at any distance from the road were
unsuccessful. He often penetrated
into the labyrinth of ridge and chasm
on either side of the road and made
anxious search, but met with nothing
to reward his labour.
One afternoon when he had de-
scended with considerable difficulty
down the almost precipitous cliffs that
all but completely surrounded a little
bay in which fern trees and blackbutts
attained to surprising sizp, he met
with an adventure which perfectly
amazed him.
In the deepest recess of the bay he
noticed a man lying asleep !
He was confident it was none of the
survey party. Perhaps it was some
tourist who was enjoying a siesta after
a toilsome ramble. He would go and
see.
W histling as he went, Caldecott ad-
vanced towards the stranger, who did
not stir until George was within a few
feet of him. Then suddenly springing
up, the man, who had evidently been
startled out of a sound slumber, and
was still in a confused and dreamy
state of mind, roared out in a voice
which Caldecott instantly recognised
as that of Devereux’s,


“ Lay a hand on me, and by I’ll
This with a pistol levelled at
George’s head. Then all of an instant,
recognising whom it was, the bush-
ranger dropped his hand and said,
“ In the devil’s name, where have
you tumbled from, Caldecott ? How
on earth did you get here ?”
“ The very question I was about to
put to you.”
“ Look here, Caldecott, your ques-
tion’s easily answered. I’m here in
hiding. Everything went wrong after
the escort affair I couldn’t make
clean away; do what I would, go
where I would, the traps circumvented
me. At lasr, however, I gave them
the slip, and managed to get into this
district to these gullies, where I
flattered myself I would be able to do
a month’s solitary without having my
privacy intruded upon by a human
soul. But how did you find your way
here ?”
“I strolled away from camp for a
ramble and me voila /”
“ What camp ?”
“ Kenny’s survey party.”
“ Why, that’s five or six miles away,
isn’t it?”
“ Yes, about that; and now where’s
your camp ? I suppose you’ve better
quarters than the shade of a gum
tree ?”
“ I don’t mistrust you, Caldecott,
yet for all than I will not show you to
my rock sanctum. I’m getting quite
a recluse you see.”
Looking keenly at the outlaw,
George observed a great change in
him since the day they had first met
in th 3 sheph rd’s gunyah on the Yar-
ramundra run. lie looked careworn,
weary, and depressed. His dress was
soiled and slovenly.
“I’ve a rough look, haven’t I?”
asked Devereux, who had noticed the
scrutiny to which he had just been
submitted. “ But what would you
have, I’ve been hanging about this
quarter since the affair you wot of, and
it’s a devilish rough crib let me tell
you. I’m waiting a chance to get away
from the colony for good. The worst
of it is there’s business which must be
settled before I can leave, and the
scent’s pretty warm. Sometimes I
think old Reynolds has played me
false. God help the dog though, if
he’s turned traitor. I’ve one more
trip to make to Tarramundra before I
can get away, and if it should turn out
as I sometimes think, one reckoning
will do for all.”
“ Hem! I see it all, now,” said Cal-
decott.
“ See what ? ”
“ Why, who it was gave you the ne-
cessary information to enable you to
plan the escort robbery.”
“ Call it ‘ purveyance,’ not robbery,
so the wise it call.”
“ Call it what you will, Hart, it was
a sorry affair after all. However, I
won’t moralise. I must be making
tracks to camp directly, and before I
go must ask you about one or two
matters connected with that story with
which you became acquainted by read-
ing my mother’s letter. What do you
think of this ? In several places along
the road above us I have found J, A.
and L. P., with the date 1823, carved
upon the rocks.”
“ Well ? ”
“ Don’t you think they may possibly
be the initials of John Aldridge and
Lucy Powys, and the work of the for-
mer when a prisonerinthe chain-gang.”
“ fcy Jove, they might be. Nay,
must be. I have it, Caldecott. If
there’s anyone who can help us in this
matter, ’tis Reynolds. Why, man,
now I come to think of it, he was
ganger on that road for two or three
years. I’ve often heard speak of his
villainies in that capacity. He’s a
polished seoundrt 1, but he’s your man
for all that.”
*• Does he know your whereabouts ?”
“ What Reynolds ? No fear, my
good Sir. Though he’s a man with
whom I’ve done a great deal of busi-
ness, I wouldn’t trust him further
than I could see him.”
The sun was fast sinking, a fact
which the encroaching shadow of the
mighty rock wall reminded them of.


“ I must get out of this before dusk,
or else I shall miss my way,” said
Caldecott. “ I’ll see Reynolds about
the Aldridge matter, as you suggest.
But look here, Hart, once more I ask
you is there nothing I can do for you ?
Why not wash your hands clean of all
associations with the past, and make a
fresh start somewhere else, with money
free from the stain of crime ? Surely
it’s not too late, even now? I sent
your portrait home to your father.
Perhaps he’ll ”
** Shut up, lad !” growled Devereux.
I’ll play the prodigal of your gospel
books for no man. I’ve made my bed
—made it devilish badly—but such as
it is I must lie on it. Once (years ago)
I would have jumped at your offer.
There was a little one for whom I
should like to have earned honest
bread, but I was robbed of her, robbed
of her, sir, by one of your blue blood
Powyses.”
“ What do you mean ?”
“ What do I mean ? but that years
ago I was fooled by a fine face, set in
a glory of golden hair—Miss Florence
Powys, your own cousin, Mr. Calde-
cott ; whom I ran off with her from her
conceited ass of a father, and like a
fool believed in her utterly, supremely
for four short years. She cured me of
that belief, though. Things went ill
with us. I wouldn’t minister to her
vanity. It was herself, you see, she
loved at first hand, and then, at second
hand, any one who would pamper her.
She left me one fine morning, taking
with her my little daughter, the only
thing who ever loved me for love’s
sweet sake. May Heaven ”
Caldecott interrupted the impreca-
tion with—“ and did you never recover
your daughter ?”
“Never! I hunted up my wife—
found her dying in wretched lodgings
some few months after her desertion
of me, but she was too far gone even
to recognise me. She died and made
no sign ; her! ”
After a pause of several seconds,
Devereux added,
“Do you know your uncle ?”
“ Yes, I met him at Yarramundra,
and I stayed a couple of days with
him at Mitta Mitta, on my way to
Sydney.”
“Well, Mr. Caldecott, beware of
him. He’s as false as hell. Have no
money dealings with him. Remember
you)- mother’s caution. Unless I’m
much mistaken, her sad story owes its
real origin to Mr. Thomas Powys. I’m
a pretty good hand at putting this and
that together.”
“What on earth do you mean?’
asked G-eorge.
“ Nothing. Time may tell though.
Anyhow, Reynolds is your man. I’ll
tell you what—meet *ne at the Punt
Hotel this day fortnight. Get leave of
absence, or manage it somehow, and
I’ll work him so that he won’t refuse
to tell us all he may know about
escapes from the road gang in 1826.
And now, so long.”
So saying, Devereux with a nod
to Caldecott, walked into the gloom,
while the latter began to mount the
cliffs in the opposite direction, upon
the summit of which the sunlight still
lingered with a warm and mellow
glow.

TOWN GOSSIP.
Until some corresponding develop-
ment takes place in the human organ-
isation, the application of steam pow er
to wind instruments is likely to be
rather trying to the nerves. Residents
in the Western suburbs who have left
the city to find peace and quietness
along the railway line, after a few
months' experience of the American
engine, are beginning to think they are
paying rather too dear for their
whistle. In theory it is a fine thing
to be certain of waking up at a given
hour ; but an alarum set for three
a.m. is of very little practical utility.
They don't see it in the right light,
but there is no mistake about their
hearing it. We will defy any one to
sleep through it unless he is afflicted
with deafness equal to that of the old


lady residing in the Marine Parade at
Brighton, who, after a salute of twenty-
one guns fired under her very ears,
quietly exclaimed *• Come in.” There
is nothing like the whistle of the
American engine either in the
heavens above, the earth beneath,
or the waters under the earth. This
diabolical instrument of torture mur-
ders sleep, and causes sudden panics
which are destructive to health: it
makes the women start and the men
swear, and is calculated, if it goes on
night after night emitting its horrible
yells, to convert householders in the
railway suburbs into a lot of unhappy
and incurable maniacs. A prolonged
howl from the engine at Parramatta is
quite sufficient to send an invalid into
hysterics at Newtown, and it has more
than once been mistaken for the last
dread trump, which to burst suddenly
on the ears when nobody expects it.
“ Of what use is it,” said Paterfami-
lias the other day, “ to have the front
door knocker muffled and to have
straw laid down in front of the house,
if my wife is to be frightened out of
her seven senses by an unearthly
shriek, something halfway between the
roar of an angry lion with a sore
throat and a long distance fog signal ?”
We heartily sympathise with the com-
plainants. It is not pleasant by any
means to be obliged to get through
the night like a story in two parts,
and we shall be glad to form one of a
deputation to the Engineer-in-Chief
for Railways to request that the ob-
noxious engine may be mislaid or sent
away for a time, until householdprs
living within ten miles of it have got
more accustomed to it. If that can’t
be done, surely the whistle might be
muffled or set to a lower key.

A remarkably stylish circular has
just been issued by Messrs. Hardie
and Gorman, of Pitt-street, apropos
of an estate which has been placed in
their hands for sale. It comprises ten
pages of matter descriptive of the sce-
nery and attractions of the locality in
question (the Alphington Estate), to-
gether with a map shewing the pro-
posed subdivisions. Each page is il-
lustrated by a well-executed design of
some villa or prominent feature on or in
close vicinity to the property. The
circular, which is printed on tinted
paper large foolscap size, with a great
variety of ornamental type, is really a
work of art. We hardly know which
most to admire, the artistic way in
which the printing and designs are
executed by Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard
and Co., or the enterprising spirit of
the firm who conceived them. Messrs.
Hardie and Gorman have also circu-
lated for the information of the general
public, and specially for the convefli-
ence of country visitors attending the
Exhibition, a Register of the invest-
ments in land and house property,
which they have for sale. Both these
publications are deserving of notice as
being considerably in advance in point
of taste and general get up of the or-
dinary style of business announce-
ments, and we trust this go-a-bead
firm will reap the advantage of thus
placing the villa residences they wish
to dispose of b< fore their customers in
such an attractive form—literally as
well as figuratively couleur de rose.
* *. *
Touching the efficiency of the police
force. Is the attention of the con-
stabulary so wholly occupied with
sweeping the streets clear of orange
peel that they have no time to put
down the letting off of squibs and
crackers in the main thoroughfares of
the city? The loyalty of the street
arab should not be allowed to vent it-
self in pyrotechnic displays under the
noses of omnibus horses.
* * *
Now that the museum has been
brought rather prominently before the
public by the conflict of opinions as to
the propriety of throwing open its
doors on Sundays, it might not be out
of place to ask what is being done to
increase its attractions. As far as the
present arrangement of its treasures
goes, we cannot say much for its
“drawing” capacity. The trustees
don t seem to care a jot how things are
managed—whether the various collec-


tions entrusted to their care are in
cases or out of cases, indexed or non-
indexed. Neither, as far as we can
learn, do they exercise any care to dis-
cover if rare specimens suitable for
their shelves are ever on sale in the
Sydney market. We happen to know
of a very valuable collection of Poly-
nesian curiosities being now under
offer, not to the museum trustees, but
which if those indiflferentists had any
patriotic desire to make their institu-
tion all it should and might be, would
be secured at once for the people. If
any Member of Parliament will move
in the matter, we shall be happy to give
him the requisite information.

The resignation of the honorary
medical staff of the Sydney Infirmary
because the accommodation is not
sufficient to allow them fair play in the
treatment of patients will,' it is to be
hoped, awake the Government to the
necessity of making the requisite alter-
ations and improvements. A wonder-
ful apathy in respect to sanitary
legislation seems to obtain in this
colony, of which this is only an addi-
tional proof. Now that the necessity
seems urgent, it is just within the
bounds of possibility that the Govern-
ment will take action to carry out the
recommendations which are repeatedly
made to them by the Directors of the
Infirmary, just as a previous Govern-
ment took aciion and appointed a
Health Commission when an epidemic
visited us and raised a panic in the
citv. What degree of alarm will be
sufficient, we wonder, to frighten a
set of Ministers into introducing a
complete Health Bill and appointing
an Executive Board to carry out its
provisions. We fear that nothing
short of a plague will evoke any earnest
feeling in this direction.
* *

We cannot congratulate Mr. S. C.
Brown on the position taken up by him
in opposition to the motion to pension
the widow of John Hubert Plunkett.
Mr. Brown’s argument was of the
world worldly, cold, cynical, and
utterly heartless. It savoured of the
school of Hardgrind and of the
Pharisaism, which is all bitterness to
what does not come up to its own
standard of £ s. d. morality. Of
course Mr. Plunkett ought to have in-
sured his life. But, alas for his sins
of omission, he didn’t, and so the
Browns have a right to sling stones at
him for an improvident wretch!
* *

The Evening News suggests that
the Government should invest in arock
drill and go about somewhat like the
woodpecker noted in song, tapping the
country for geological treasure. No
doubt the notion will commend itself
to that numerous section of the com-
munity who have been for so long
taught to look upon the Government
as t*e source of aid in every enter-
prise. To our minds it seems singu-
larly unfortunate that a daily paper
with great circulation should advocate
schemes, the only result of which
would be the further diminution of
those habits of self-reliance which are
the true springs of national wealth.
It is the fa f e of humanity in this vale
of tears to have to put up with a good
deal of persistent boring at the hands
of newspaper writers and others; for
goodness sake don’t let us urge
our representatives to insist upon
Government putting down a great deal
more at the rate of a good many
guineas per fathom!

The first number of the Comic His-
tory of New Wales is to hand.
Somewhat, as Voltaire said of the Holy
Homan Empire, that the definition
would be accurate were it not for the
awkward facts that the thing defined
was neither Holy nor Roman, must we
say of the publication before us that
its title would not be incongruous with
the subject matter were the latter
comic, which it isn’t, and did it refer
in any intelligible way to the history
of New South Wales, which it doesn’t.
The illustrations are clever; the letter-
press is twaddle.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
‘‘ Sydney Once a Week.” —lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publication. Its pur-
purpose is to give its readers “ a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publisher as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature.— S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says : —lt is a very readable
publication, and while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, -of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
“Sydney Once a Week” —We have
j ust received the eighth number of ‘ ‘Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anvthing, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its characacter, as it gave
opportimities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might be lost to the general
public, and also established a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week. —This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches.—
S. M. Herald.
The Sydney “ Once a Week. I ' —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now he looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may be congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one ; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
Sydney “Once a Week. —The new
number of this capital little serial quite
sustains the character of its predecessors.
Charley Cornstalk’s “ Sporting Adven-
tures’’and the “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry ” are continued. The Rev. A. W.
Petre commences a new story, entitled
“ Aunt Rebecca’s Secret,” which promises
to he good. There is another article on
the “Public Health,” and a variety of
useful and amusing contributions make up
a very readable and pleasant number.—
Echo, April 12.
Sydney “ Once a Week.” This
weekly magazine keeps up the reputation
it has earned for itself, as a well printed
entertaining serial. The local articles and
sketches are good, and there is a large
variety of interesting reading matter.—
S. M. Herald , April 13.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo, a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for hoys. Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the “ Paradise Lost” —intended for the use
of univereity candidates—a clever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sphinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hope the new
organ will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors. — Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains well written papers
and sketches, entitled “The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary o.
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Sydney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney. — Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week. —This is the title of a new
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Etcetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterjicld Star says:—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says: —We have
looked the hook carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages.— Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation. — Border Post( Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable. — Western Post
(Mudgce).
The Bathurst Free Press says:—lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hinds, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant hooks that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. — Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers.— Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”
