The true story how the Chancellor-
ship of the University fell into the
keeping of Sir William Montague
Manning, L.L. D., while one not
likely to reflect credit on that gen-
tleman, or on the “ society of scho-
lars” over which he presides, will
prove of service if it only have the
effect of hastening the coming of the
time when the election to that high
office shall be in the hands of the
senior graduates. At present the
Chancellor is elected by the Fellows
of the Senate, out of their own order.
When it became known, a few
weeks ago, that Sir E. Deas-Thomson
had resigned the Chancellorship,
there was but one opinion among
those of the general public, who have


the real interests of the University
at heart, as to which of the Fellows of
4 -he Senate should be his successor.
It was felt that there was no one
eligible by the terms of the existing
constitution, who by character or
position could be named in the same
breath with the Chief Justice. Even
the President of the Council was
hardly thought of. As to Sir W.
Manning, we are confident that out-
side the limits of a very small coterie,
his name was not so much as hinted
at. When it was rumoured that
inside the limits of that coterie an
endeavour would be made t > degrade
the University in the popular estima-
tion by conferring its highest office
upon a second-rate man, to the exclu-
sion of a brilliant statesman, a con-
summate orator, and a great judge,
there was a disposition not to believe
the report.
The senior graduates, however,
possessing better information than
the general public, discovered that
the rumoured action was actually de-
cided upon, and, to their credit, be
it said, made an effort to avert it—
unfortunately an unsuccessful one.
The election took place, the Chief
Justice was passed by, Sir W. Man-
ning was appointed, and the Univer-
sity was degraded !
It would seem that bitter personal
feelings had a good deal to do with
this result. Sir Hercules Robinson
and Sir James Martin are not, as is
well known, on speaking terms. The
Australian Club influence was
brought to bear by partizans of the
G-overnor, and four Fellows were ac-
tually induced by fear of offending
the Government House set (with
which, we believe, the Governor him-
self has nothing to do), to promise
their votes to Sir W. Manning. The
Government Astronomer and Mr.
Windeyer (the member for the Uni-
versity), did the same, objecting to
the Chief Justice on the alleged
ground that he was hostile to the
Governor, and that as a Fellow he had
taken but little interest in the Uni-
versity, rarely attending the Senate.
His being a Catholic, moreover, made
him obnoxious to their ardent Pro-
testantism. By these alleged reasons,
Mr. Bussell beat up a few more re-
cruits, among them the Speaker and
Mr. Macleay. The Vice-Chancellor,
the Rev. Canon Allwood, taking
high moral grounds, decided for
the same side. The plot was
thickening. Mr. Windeyer pul-
led the strings of the Manning cabal
while leading the Chief Justice to
suppose that it was his intention to
vote for him. Dr. Ren wick fought
manfully for the best man, but the
odds, multiplied by duplicity, were
against the best man winning. At
the election a letter of Sir William
Manning s was read by the retiring
Chancellor. It stated the writer’s
willingness to resign in favour of the
Vice-Chancellor. To Sir James
Martin Sir W. Manning had written
another letter, telling his official col-
league how completely he had been


taken by surprise by the action of
his friends in nominating him for
the vacant office, and expressing a
hope that the Chief Justice would
not be hurt at his responding to their
call.
Magnanimity is a great virtue.
But its price is somewhat unfavor-
able to its adoption as an article of
every day use. A cheap substitute
for it is therefore deserving of every
encouragement. When Sir W. M.
Manning wrote to his predecessor
and begged that he and the Senate
would seriously consider whether
they ought not rather to elect the Rev.
Canon Allwood (the Vice-Chancellor),
and assured him that if they only did
so he should gladly retire in that
gentleman’s favour, he attained to as
much sublimity of sentiment as was
consistent with strict economy. Mr.
Allwood was an ecclesiastic, and
could not have held the office, so we
had all the grand stage effect of a
noble Roman bosom bared for the
knife, with the comforting assurance
that no blood would be shed !
But why did the author of this
happy combination of prudence with
self-devotion spoil the effect at which
he arrived by writing at the same
time another letter to Sir James
Martin, in which he would make it
appear that he could not help him-
self, but was bound to yield to the
wishes of his friends.
If he could not retire in favour of
Sir James Martin—a man whom he
must know in his heart of hearts to
be both, as scholar and lawyer, infi-
nitely superior to himself—how came
he to offer to do so in favour of Mr.
Allwood ? Why did he thus scratch
the gilding off his own pinch-beck?
We hope that the senior graduates
will “agitate, agitate, agitate,”until
they win the franchise they have
commenced to struggle for, and that
in the event of success crowning their
efforts, before the expiration of the
Chancellor’s three years of office,
they will take the needful steps to
prevent a repetition of the pitiful par-
tizanry and pinch-beck magnanimity
which characterized the recent
election.
LAW BREAKERS AND LAW
MAKERS.
[Six of one and considerably less than
half-a-dozen of the other.]
Central Police Court.
Wednesday, 24th April, 1878.
Before the Police Magistrate and Mr.
Smart.
Robert Belford, found guilty of
having resisted constable Devine in the
execution of his duty, was sentenced
to pay a penalty of 405., or to be im-
prisoned one month ; and Joseph Gal-
loway was sentenced to a penally of
£5, or in default of payment to be im-
prisoned two months, for having on
the same occasion assaulted constable
Devine.
High Court of Parliament.
Saturday, 27th April, 1878.
Before Mr. Justice Driver and a full
Bench.
John M*Elhone was charged with
obstructing the business of the Court
during its sitting, and a second count


charged him with assault and using
language and gestures calculated to
provoke a breach of the peace.
Senior-Sergeant Parses deposed that
he was present in Court on the evening
of Friday, 26th inst., and the prisoner,
who appeared to be Very excited, had
left his seat and advanced in a threat-
ening manner, and with clenched fists,
into the body of the Court, and had
then and there challenged two gentle-
men —Messrs. Gray and Charles—to
have their heads punched; was not
aware that any provocation had been
offered to the prisoner ; had been a
number of years in the force, and had
never before witnessed such owdacious
conduct; he hoped the Bench would
vindicate the majesty of the law, if not
there might as well be no law at all.
Bergeant Bobertson gave similar tes-
timony. Theprisoner’s behaviour was
disorderly in the extreme ;if he had
been in charge of the Court at the
time he should have had no hesitation
in ordering [his men to “run him
in.”
The charge having been conclusively
proved by the evidence of several wit-
nesses,
Mr. Justice Driver proceeded to con-
fer jvith the magistrates on the Bench.
The Court was cleared during the con-
ference, but, by the aid of a telephone,
we have been able to obtain tolerably
accurate information of what took
place.
Mr. Fitzpatrick was anxious to know,
first of all, whether the words “you’re
a liar” were really a breach of the
rules of the Court, because he had so
frequently heard them used in Court;
he would also like to know whether it
was not reasonable to suppose that
the phrase “ I’ll punch your head,”
was used playfully or metaphorically.
Mr. Windeyer said, that in law
when a man clenched his fist and held
it close to another man’s nose it was
an assault, but it was not battery,
though it might be within an inch of
it, It was a standing order of the
Court, that no member who was under
contempt could take his seat until he
had been purged. It was laid down
in Johnson’s dictionary, that to assail
meant “to act in a hostile manner,”
and the assault having been proved,
it was clear that the prisoner was
under, or below contempt. The stand-
ing orders had all the force of law
without any of its unpleasant conse-
quences. In the celebrated case of
Regina v. Buchanan, in which the de-
fendant was charged with disorderly
conduct
This interesting quotation was lost
to us in consequence of the imperfect
action of the telephone. When we
had got it into working order again
the case had been referred to a higher
Court, and the Judge’s seat was oc-
cupied by
His Honor Chief Justice Allen.
The public had just been admitted*
and the prisoner was entering the
Court with an unabashed front, just
as a young larrikin outside was whist-
ling
“ See Johnny comes marching home.”
The depositions were now read
over again.
Call Senior-Sergeant Robertson, said
his Honor.
Robertson : Yes, your Honor.
C. J.: Has the prisoner ever been
in Court before for the same offence?
Bobertson: Scores of times, yer
Honor, riotous and disorderly; there
ain’t a man in the blessed force that
hasn’t been more or less insulted by
him. Threatening and abusive, that’s
what he is.
No further evidence was deemed
necessary, and the Court getting
hungry after such a long sitting,
made up its mind that the prisoner,
John M‘Elhone, was guilty of con-
tempt.
His Honor then delivered judgment
in his usual impressive way. He said,
“ Prisoner at the bar, you have been
found guilty of a misdemeanour, the
frequency of which in no way lessens
its enormity. You have repeatedly
and consistently violated the rules of
this Court by the use of quarrelsome
and unseemly language, which has
not only tended to bring our public


institutions, as it has brought you,
into contempt, but has obstructed the
business of the country you profess to
serve, and set a vicious example to
the youth of New South Wales. You
have brought your bullying propensi-
ties into play in the sacred precincts of
this Court, and have threatened to
punch several respectable heads—of
families. The Court cannot overlook
such conduct; it must protect its own
dignity, if it does not it will soon have
not a particle of that commodity left.
I trust the severe sentence which it is
my duty to pass will not be without
a salutary effect, and that henceforth
you will keep your natural violence of
temper under control, and act upon
the advice contained in those beautiful
lines of Dr. Watts’:
‘ Let dogs delight to bark and bite, &c.’
I have no doubt you will recall the
verses to your recollection. The sen-
tence of the Court is that you
apologise. We have a right to ask
for an apology, and you are now at
liberty to make it.”
Prisoner: lam not at all sure about
your right; but I admit that I have
disobeyed the rules of the court.
G. J.: Now my dear sir—l mean
prisoner at the bar—we can scarcely
accept an apology if you contest our
right to demand it.
Prisoner: Well, I have no objection
to apologise to your Honor : but as for
the Court or any individual member
(7. J,: Do I understand that you
make an unconditional apology to the
House, and that you retract the words
you used ?
Mr. Justice Driver : Ah, now do !
C. J •: You will really relieve us of
a very unpleasant difficulty by an un-
equivocal compliance with the order of
the Court.
Prisoner: All serene. I apologise.
G. J.: Then it is my pleasing duty
to inform you that you are purged from
contempt.
Prisoner : Thank yer Honor. (Aside).
For two pins I’d puneh your jolly old
head for you. (Exit purged.)
NORFOLK ISLAND.
BY VIATOR.
There are but very few members, es-
pecially of the older portion of our
Antipodean Society, who have not
some knowledge of this beautiful Eden
of the South Pacific Ocean.
To how many minds is not the very
name itself fraught with dismal recol-
lections of the supposed atrocities of
its once convict population, and do
not many, very many, of our rising
population listen with feelings akin to
horror at the recapitulation of some,
oftentimes exaggerated, tales ; of the
manners and customs of its inhabi-
tants under the ban of penal servitude
and the government of rigid disci-
pline ?
By the cozy city fireside—in the far-
away bush home—on land, or sailing
our ocean’s depths, has not the men-
tion of Norfolk Island been associated
with everything that is degrading and
horrible in life ?
Originally an off-shoot as it were of
the penal settlement of Port Jackson,
or the more commonly recognised
“ Botany Bay,” subsequently trans-
ferred to the care of the government of
our neighbour Tasmania, it still re-
mains a record of days gone by—of
the degradation one of the loveliest
spots in creation could be burdened
with—yet still the same little Eden,
so far as nature is concerned, as ever.
Times have changed with us in New
South Wales. The old leaven of malice
and wickedness—the curse of a penal
colony, thank God, disappeared many
years since. The renowned “ Cocka-
too Island” has merged into Biloela,
the home of the irreclaimable tender
sex. The locality of the once famed
Carter’s Barracks, in Sydney, is now
better known as the “ Police Depot.”
The old settlement of Port Macquarie
is a thing of the past —the ancient
barracks, &c., now utilized by the Go-
vernment in another and worthier
cause. The once despised Van Die-
man’s Land adopted long since the
more befitting title of “Tasmania.”


Port Phillip has become “Victoria,”
and the latest penal settlement of Swan
River now rejoices in the cognomen
of “ Western Australia.”
Botany Bay is but a fishing ground,
but there still stands poor, ill-used,
much maligned Norfolk Island, as
beautiful, as charming as ever, but now
peopled by the descendants of the Mu-
tineers of the Bounty—and one of the
training schools of Polynesian mission-
ary enterprize. Certainly, a consider-
able number of the transferrees from
Pitcairn Island, who were incapable
of appreciating the luxuries afforded
them at Norfolk Island in the shape of
comfortable houses, well laid out gar-
dens, indeed all the conveniences of
modern civilized life—preferred, after
a time, to return to their little rocky
islet, where they still remain, and
where, not long ago, I saw them—but
many of the original Pitcairn Islanders
still live in possession of their new ter-
ritory, dwelling there in comfortable
quietude, under the guardianship of
the governor of this colony.
I need not here attempt to describe
the circumstances under which the
original occupation of Norfolk Island,
as a penal settlement, was carried out.
Suffice it say, that the accommodation
provided in this colony for the large
number of deportes continually arriv-
ing from the mother country, being
found thoroughly insufficient, it was
thought that this Island, situated as it
is within such reasonable distance of
Port Jackson, was peculiarly fitted for
the reception of a limited number of
prisoners of the worst class. Its com-
plete isolation, and its genial climate,
and great fertility were also marked
recommendations to its occupation,
and at length steps were taken by the
Sydney authorities to give effect to
their intention—and this gem of the
Pacific was transformed into a semi-
pandemonium. It had never been be-
fore inhabited, so that the new occu-
pants entered into possession, just as
as a good Providence had formed, and
Captain Cook had last left it.
Norfolk Island is just upon a thou-
sand miles nearly due east from Syd-
ney. “ It is but a little spot”—about
six or seven miles east to west, and
about three from north to south. It
possesses no harbour whatever. There
is an opening in the reef or “ bar” in
the southern side, and an open road-
stead at what is called the “ Cascades,”
on the north. The landing on either
side—when I last was there—was
oftentimes a somewhat risky under-
taking—the surf boats or launches
being specially constructed for the
work—the former pulling six and the
latter as many as fourteen oars (double
banked, of course), yet, despite every
care and caution on the part of the
coxswain, I have seen many a terrible
accident occur, and mere than one life
lost in the bar surf. Anchorage is
too dangerous, owing to the rocky
nature of the holding ground, to war-
rant masters, save in very calm wea-
ther “ letting go.” The usual custom
is for vessels to lay off and on during
the hours of loading or discharging,
taking plenty of sea room for the
night.
The Island, as far as I said before,
is very fertile and productive. Almost
any grain or plant will thrive there ;
while the hill sides, flats and gullies,
used to be—and I dare say are still—
orchards and vineyards in themselves.
I have picked bunches of grapes
from a vine twining itself round the
stem of a pine tree. Figs, lemons, ba-
nanas, guavas (not the little abortions
we see here in Sydney, but as large
as a fair-sized apple), cape gooseber-
ries, and other luxuries; and in
one particular part of the Island
I can remember mulberries. The
sweet potatoe is almost a weed, while
in the cultivated grounds, English
grow side by side with thoroughly
tropical fruits. The herbage is sweet
and plentiful, water abundant; fish in
great variety ; in short, almost every
blessing in the shape of luxurious
food and nourishment a far-seeing and
merciful Creator saw fit to provide.
All there was beautiful to the eye
and grateful to the senses —the only
vile thing was “ mom,” in his direst
degradation, for not one venomous


animal had been known to exist on
this favoured island.
Norfolk Island is the largest of
three—one, Phillip Island, very barren
and useless for habitation, situate
about nine miles to the southward,
and the other, Nepean, a small barren
rocklet, about a mile from the main—
the resting ground of thousands of
sea-birds, but treeless and waterless.
The temperature is very mildly con-
sistent and equable. Blow where the
wind chooses, you must enjoy a sea
breeze. The nights are comfortably
cool, and the heat of the day seldom
or ever prevents manual labour of
any description. From the summit of
the only mountain (Mount Pitt) on the
Island, you can view the grand ocean,
at your feet, as it were, and have the
whole of your demesne under eye.
Having cursorily described the
Island, its capabilities and principal
features, as they no doubt existed upon
its primary occupation, I will pro-
ceed without attempting to describe
any events happening prior to my resi-
dence there, for it would be simply
hearsay, to treat of the Island as I saw
it. I will ask the indulgence of the
readers of “ Once-a-Week," while I
endeavour to describe as graphically
and in as interesting a manner as
possible some few scenes occurring
during the period of my residence
there.
There have been so many different
“yarns” spun, to my knowledge,
touching the character and treatment
as well as the habits of the population,
resident at Norfolk Island in by-gone
days, such outrageous exaggerations
have been indulged in by our colonial
Munchausens on the subject, that I
am nothing loth to say my fair
say, pledging myself to the thorough
veracity of any and every statement I
put on record.
My residence at Norfolk Island
lengthened into some years. Perhaps
I may be permitted to explain that
though I was actually conveyed thither
from Sydney at Her Majesty’s expense,
I was a free.subject.
(To be continued .)
A CELTIC QUESTION.
He came up to me in the neighbour-
hood of Lis son G-rove, one wretched
foggy night during the present month,
and said he :
“ I want an over-r-r-cort."
His intense brogue revealed his
nationality. I looked at his shivering,
thinly-clad carcase, and acknowledged
the truth of his observation.
“You do, indeed," I said. “It's
very cold."
He stared at me stupidly for a mo-
and then repeated, with increased
emphasis:
“Av ye plase, I want an over-r-r-
--cort."
I had agreed with him. What mere
did the fellow want ? Surely he didn’t
take me for his tailor.
“An over-r-r-cort!" he ejaculated,
impatiently. “Is it deaf ye are ?”
His manner was becoming quite
threatening. He was a head and
shoulders taller than I; and he was
evidently growing desperate. The
road was lonely, too. Perhaps I had
better mollify him with a shilling.
I tried the experiment. He indig-
nantly refused the coin.
“Is it a beggar ye’re after taking
me for, when I’m only asking ye a civil
question ?”
He flushed hotly all over the struc-
ture of bone which did duty for his
face ; and began to dance up and down
in front of me with quite a cannibalistic
aspect.
“Where is an over-r-r-cort?" he
shouted, wildly.
Somehow or other he must be paci-
fied, or he might be driven to do me
an injury.
“ Most probably at the nearest ready-
made clothier’s," said I, blandly.
But the oil I sought to pour upon
the troubled waters was fruitlessly
expended.
“ To the divil wid yer clothiers ! I
tell ye it’s an over-r-rcort I'd be findin'.”
By this time there was quite a ma-
niacal light in his pale blue eyes. He
must be as mad as a hatter, and retreat


was the only remedy which now sug-
gested itself. I took to my heels
without- further parley.
But I was no match for that con-
founded spider-legged Hibernian, and
he was upon me like a shot.
“An over-r-r-cortl” he roared, as
he seized me by the collar. “ I will
have it out o’ ye.”
It was my own warm Witney garment
he coveted, then. I prepared for a
desperate lesistance.
“Y’ onpoloite little spalpeen!” he
yelled, as he dragged me into the
nearest gas-lamp. Can ye rade ?”
As he uttered this insulting query,
he shoved right under my nose a dirty
old envelope, on which was inscribed :
“Mr. Terence Callaghan,
No. 6, Hanover-court, N.W.”
“That’s where I’m gaun to,” he
ejaculated. “ For the last time, can
ye put me in my rord to an over-r-r-
--cort ?”
I could, and what is more, I did; in
the same breath hurling an internal
malediction at the irritating Celt who
“wanted Hanover-court.”
Comic Paper.
TALES OF THE GOLD MANIA.
BY OUR OWN MANIAC.
No. 2.
A COUPLE OF DUFFEKS.
I was very near getting a regular pot
of gold on one occasion, but luck was
dead against me. If it had been any-
body else he would have been as right
as the bank, but I suppose I was fated
to be unlucky, or fortune would never
have gone out of her way to play me
such a scurvy trick. It happened in
this way. A rich lead had been dis-
covered in a flat about seven miles
from the camp at which I was living.
No one in our small community knew
anything about it; all we did know
was that there was a small party pros-
pecting in that direction, and that they
were in the habit of coming over for
stores from time to time, loading a
couple of pack-horses and going away
again the next day. No one had ever
seen them sell any gold, and to all en-
quiries as to the success they had met
with, they gave careless answers to the
effect that they were still sinking and
had not bottomed yet, or that they
were prospecting and had come across
nothing payable. No one suspected
that they were on gold.
One evening I had taken a stroll
outside the camp to look for my old
mare, who used to stray to a flat about
a mile off, where the feed was pretty
good, and was just about to cross a
gully in which was a fine large water-
hole, where she was generally to be
found, when I got a glimpse, not of
my horse, but of two other animals
both hobbled, and became presently
aware that some men had found a camp
on the opposite bank. Only for a few
bushes between us on my side, they
must have seen me, as there was little
more than the width of the hole be-
tween us.
I don’t know that I should have
paid any attention to them, and should
most likely have passed them with a
“good evening, mates,” but for a few
words which caught my ear.
“We're much better camping out
here, Bill,” said one of them. “If
we’d stopped over at the public you
might have got a glass into you and let
the cat out of the bag.”
“Bight you are, old man,” rejoined
his companion; “anyhow, we’re safe
here. My wordl if they knew over
yonder what we’re doing on the quiet,
wouldn’t there be a rush ?”
“ Yes, and we should be pegged up
short, whereas now we’ve got it all to
ourselves. If we can only keep it dark
for another month, I don’t care if the
whole lot of ’em come.”
I waited to hear no more. I had re-
cognised in the first speaker one of the
party of prospectors referred to, and I
now knew that they were quietly mak-
ing their pile in some gully or flat not
very far off, that they were returning
with a fresh supply of provisions, and
that they had got clear of our diggings
before camping to avoid any question-
ing on the part of our fellows.


By keeping the clump of bushes in a
line with their fire, I retraced my steps
without giving any intimation of my
presence, and crossing the gully a
little lower down, I soon reached the
township.
Now I am not a selfish man, and
when I have a good thing in hand I like
to share it with my chums.
I had a good many friends living
round about, who had worked along-
side of me, and shared in many of my
disappointments; and in all matters
of this kind we had always been true
to each other. So I made up my mind
to impart the good tidings to a select
few, that they might participate in the
advantages likely to accrue from the
information I had obtained.
I did this very cautiously and quietly,
and having made all our arrange-
ments over night, we mustered a
little before daybreak twelve of us, all
carrying tools and swags, and pro-
ceeded in the direction of the strangers’
camp, which we reached just as it
was getting light, to find it deserted.
The tracks of their horses were,
however, sufficient to guide us, and
after about an hour’s riling, we
turned from a sharp pinch and came
suddenly upon a small flat, almost
hidden by the surrounding hills ; and
there was a solitary tent, and in front
of it the men we hid been following,
in the act of unsaddling the horses
they had just ridden in.
In another ten minutes we had
pegged off twelve men’s claims in a
line with their workings, the men,
seeing the game was up, giving us all
th* information we wanted as to the
course the lead or gutter took through
the flat.
My companions by common consent
awarded me the claim next the pro-
prietors, and l made up my mind that
lor once in my life 1 was in for a good thing
Shortly alter as soon as we had
made our arrangements for camping,
we set to work ; and we were not a
bit too soon, for iu spite of the secrecy
we had observed, our departure had
been noted, and, so ehow or other,
the new find had got bruited about.
The consequence was that the very
same morning the flat was rushed;
the rush comprised several hundred
men, and before night set in the
ground was taken up from one end to
the other.
I chuckled to myself as I ihought
of the lucky start I had obtained
through a mere accident, and worked
with renewed vigour to bottom my
shaft, the sinking being about 15
feet.
Among the new arrivals who were
marking out claims in all directions,
until there was literally not a vacant
piece of ground left on the flat, was a
man with whom 1 had a slight ac-
quaintance. As soon as he saw me
he pegged out a claim on my eastern
boundary, and commenced to put
down a hole.
Now the lead, as far as it had been
laid bare—indeed all the leads in that
part of the country—lay north and
south or thereabouts, and my ground
had been marked out so that a con-
tinuation of the gutter would go
through its centre. It did not ap-
pear that I could possibly miss it,
while my neighbour’s chance of get-
ting any part of the narrow channel
seemed at least to be a very slim one.
We both reached the bed-rock at
the same time. My shaft, which
should have been the rich one, did not
show a speck of gold, coarse or fine,
while my neighbour took off the bot-
tom of his (which from its position
should have ‘had none) 84 ounces of
gold, without driving one foot either
way. The lead had formed an elbow
at that particular point so as to avoid
my ground.
What he took out afterwards I am
unable to say; but I heard that an in-
dividual bearing a strong resemblance
to the owner of that claim left shortly
afterwards by the mail steamer for
the old country with a regular pile.
But that was a mild disappoint-
ment—a mere pleasant surprise—com-
pared to the one I am about to relate,
which occurred some time afterwards
in a totally different locality. After a


great number of failures, it occurred
to me, in considering the causes of my
continued ill luck, that I had relied
too much upon my own opinion of
likely places, and that it would have
been better if, instead of continually
breaking virgin soil to seek new de-
posits, I had abandoned the role of
prospector, and looked for the precious
metal nearer home in spots contiguous
to rich claims, where gold in quantities
had actually been found.
Impressed with this idea I set to
work to obtain information as to the
localities which had been already
worked and had yielded largely, and
making due allowance for the exag-
gerated yarns of enormous finds in
every shaft you come to on the dig-
gings, I managed to satisfy myself,
after listening to lies innumerable,
that the heaviest take on the gold-
field on which I was then residing had
occurred in the bend of a gully known
to have been fabulously rich. It did
seem rather singular that the original
owners of this gorgeous claim were
walking about the township with
scarcely a rag to their backs, but it is
well known that diggers are very im-
provident, and that they may be rich
one day and beggars the next. So
one fine morning I set manfully to
work to clean out an old shaft which,
according to the lowest computation,
had yielded to the fortunate possessors
about fifty thousand pounds. It was
full of mud, slush, and all sorts of
abominations, having been abandoned
for an indefinite period, but it had at
one time, so some scores of informants
assured me, been a regular jeweller s
shop. Nuggets of all shapes and sizes
had been found imbedded in the yel-
low clay which underlay the rubbish
I had to take out, and I was buoyed
up with the hop? that the diggers
who first had it had worked it im-
perfectly, and that I should probably
find they had left as much behind
them as they had taken away—pro-
bably more. So I baled away the
water and mud and worked like a
horse, until I was covered with dirt
from head to foot. But I persevered,
and about 4 o’clock in the afterfloon I
struck hard bottom, and at the next
blow my pick came in contact with
something which gave forth a metallic
ring, and stooping down and clearing
away the dirt with my hands I got a
glimpse of a patch of that peculiar
rich yellow colour which causes the
heart of a digger to bound. There it
was sure enough as large as a good-
sized basin, apparently a round heavy
lump of solid goid.
Now, it was not at all a prudent
thing at that time and in that place to
let everyone know that you had found
a nugget.
If it had been known that I was the
possessor of sucb a treasure there
would have been the risk that I might
be robbed of it, and that the claim
might be robbed of other equally large
nuggets during the night.
It therefore behoved me to be
eautious, and the way I exercised
caution was by covering up the
precious find, and sauntering care-
lessly to my tent as if I had given up
work for the day.
But shortly after the diggers around
me had followed my example and the
gully was deserted, a sanguine indi-
vidual wearing the diggers’ crest—a
patch of mud—in several places on
his clothing—might have been seen
at the bottom of the hole armed with
a pickaxe, on his knees at the bottom
of the hole endeavouring by. the light
of a couple of inches of candle stuck
in a lump of clay by way of candle-
stick, to unearth a monster nugget.
The prize was still there, and by a
little steady leverage with the pick-
axe, it came suddenly up with a flop—
the bottom of an old brass candlestick.
I was so utterly disgusted with this
discovery that I went straight home,
loaded my revolver, and blew out my
brains on the spot.
A lady, visiting a girls’ school, asked
one of tne children, “ What are you
making, my little seamstress ? Is it a
chemise r” “No, ma’am,” replied the
girl, bashfully, “ its a Ae-mise.”


JEAN INOELOW PARODIED.
In moss-prankt dells which, the sunbeams
flatter
(And heaven it knowath what that may
mean;
Meaning, however, is no great matter),
Where woods are a-tremble, with rifts
between.
Through God’s own heather we wound
together,
I and my Willie (0 love my love);
I need hardly remark it was glorious
weather,
And flitter-bats wavered alow, above;
Through the rare red heather we danced
together
(Oh love my Willie!) and smelt for
flowers;
I must mention again it was gorgeous
weather,
Rhymes are so scarce in this werld of
ours:
By rises that flushed with their purple
favours,
Through becks that brattled o’er grasses
sheen,
We walked or waded, we two young
shavers,
Thanking our stars we were both so
green.
We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie,
In fortunate parallels ! Butterflies,
Hid in weltering shadows of daffodilly,
Or marjorams, kept making peacock
eyes.
* * * * * *
Then we thrid God’s cowslips (as erst his
heather),
That endowed the wan grass with their
golden blooms :
And snapt (it was perfectly charming
weather)
Our fingers at Fate and her Goddess-
glooms :
And Willie ’gan sing (0, his notes were
fluty;
Wafts fluttered them out to the white-
winged sea)
Something made up of rhymes that have
done much duty,
Rhymes (better to put it) of ancientry:
Bowers of flowers encountered showers
In William’s carol (0 love my Willie !);
Then he bade sorrow borrow from blithe
to-morrow
I quite forget what—say a daffodilly,
&c.— From Calver ley’s “Fly Leaves."
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY.
Our worthy senators in the Assembly,
after an unusual period of tolerably
good behaviour, have broken out at
the eleventh hour, into an eruption of
the old disease, aad have been posi-
tively most disreputably amusing, for
which I most heartily offer them my
acknowledgements. It’s wearisome
work sitting hour after hour “ taking
in ” the vapid nonsense of an Eckford,
the rhapsodies of a Coonan, the
withering scorn of an Onslow, or the
barbarous treatment of the letter
“H ” by a dozen different members ;
and when, therefore, Mr. M‘Elhone
breaks out suo m>re occasionally,
and is countered by the blunt spoken
Sir John, the whole atmosphere of the
’ouse becomes rarified, and the spirits
of our gallery-sitters rise in propor-
tion. While I ever desire to avoid
too bitter personalities, yet I would
fain ask the reason inducing the mem-
ber for the Upper Hunter to torture
the unhappy stubble growing from
his well-padded cheeks, lip, and chin.
Scarcely a week passes without some
eccentric alteration as to his hirsuteness.
At one time as “clean shaven as a
baby,” next a goatee “a l’Ameri-
canos,” then an incipient “ Dun-
dreary/’ generally succeeded by the
high-shaved whiskers of the period
cut well back, which commonly termi-
nates in a “grow all over, and 10l
hey ! presto ! ” all down again
before the ruthless blade of the
M‘Elhonic steel, and the baby face
appears upon the scene again.
Considerable amusement is to be
derived from the ideas expressed by
members as to the personal capabili-
ties and characters of their co-spout-
ists. “ You know you got your ma-
jority by a lie,” says one. “ Well, if
I did, I put you out by another! ” was
the rejoinder. (Order, order from the
chair). “Oh ! let him go on, nobody
minds what he says ’’ next showed
upon the board of compliments, which
were wound up with the pleasantry,
“ Why you are lying so often that
you don’t know when you speak the


truth ! ” These high-souled Christian-
hearted men bore it all meekly and
mildly, even to smiles of forgiveness,
enjoying the sallies as playful badi-
nage, and knowing that the walls of
the H6use are a shelter and protection
from any consequences attending the
utterance of such vile abuse as would
induce us less refined civilians to meet
by a legitimate knockdown blow.
The “ shiftings ” of some members
during the progress of Fitzpatrick’s
unfortunate Electoral Bill, are scarcely
worth notice. !R. B. Smith’s electorate
(in which he is worshipped like a
graven image of old), was notoriously
put forward as a “ trial horse,” and
whan he and his friends succeeded in
manipulating sufficient votes to give
the Hastings a couple of additional
members, a dozen other starts were
made and races won for other localities,
and finally it was found necessary to
increase the number of our legislative
protectors to 115, the reasons gene-
rally set forward being “ because
Hastings has got two bits of the pud-
ding. I ought to have a piece or two
also.”
I can’t help anticipating the increased
fun there will be for us in the galleries
when the forty new members get to
work. If the present seventy-three are
beyond control, what will it be when
the additional “squad” falls in ? If
F&rnell, as he declares, is driven half
cranky by the pertinacious intrusions
of the land jobbers and others among
the present lot at his office at all hours,
what will he do when he has forty fresh
cravings to appease ? The lachry-
mose countenances of the Ministers
during the debates on this unhappy
bill, showed how ill-at-ease they all
were. Why was the Colonial Secre-
tary left to fight his battles alone ?
Scarcely one of his colleagues gave
him an ounce weight of support, save
on division. I’ll be bound our friend
Fitz. regrets he didn’t let well alone,
as well as Mac—alone!
The rowdiness of all preceding de-
bates, intensified itself on Friday. It
was evident to me that for some time
before the debate upon the Illawarra
Railway question, certain extraordinary
influences were at work to secure a
majority, even as one member (Sir
Henry Parkes) stated, to the subsidis-
ing of public journals. There was evi-
dently to be a sharp and decisive
battle that night, and each general
marshalled his men very determinedly
to the fray.
The present Government, unfortu-
nately, are not possessors of land down
south, and therefore could act more
dispassionately in protecting the reve-
nue from over-burden. But friend
Gray lives down that way, so does
Captain Charles, while it is well known
that Alexander Stuart is the largest
proprietor in the new colliery, and his
late Chief, Sir John, has some little
landed interest between here and Illa-
warra, which the rail-road would
wonderfully increase in value.
“No doubt,” as the inevitable
M‘Elhone blurted out, “there had
been a great many little games tried
on,’ about this matter, and “ whenever
it came on certain members came and
stayed all night, and those who were
against the measure were got rid of.”
One was “got rid of” that night in
splendid style.
The member for Carcoar, more fami-
liarly known as “ Old Andy Lynch”—
who was known to be an opponent of
the measure—was advised to “ pair
off” (and he did so) with Mr. Johnston,
who was on the same side !
Mr. Beyers had “ all sorts of influ-
ence” brought to bear upon his sus-
ceptible conscience by Gray and Co.
Another member, also opposed to it,
turned round in the most unaccount-
able manner when he heard the line
was to pass through 60 acres of his land!
But these were only M‘Elhone's state-
ments !
Parkes confessed to the possession
of enough land on the proposed line
to make him a “rich man,” did the
measure pass—but he magnanimously
voted according to strict qualms of
conscience, disregarding the loaves and
fishes of this wicked world. Oh! Sir
Henry! I see through your little
game—bless your venerable caput 1


The House, by a majority of two,
went into committee, and shortly after-
wards the real fun of the night began.
Gray, in reply to MfElhone, in re
Lynch’s “pair,” remarked that the
man from Uarcoar was “ able to take
care of himself,” and very inconside-
rately mentioned the fact that he Gray
had never been compelled to stand
there in the light of day and confess
he had told a lie to kick one Govern-
ment out and another one in.
Mac admitted the delicate impeach-
ment, expressing his intention of re-
peating the performance.
Somehow or other Mr. Terry be-
came involved in the discussion.
I may remark that, as a rule, Terry,
Mac, and Hoskins sit close together
on the cross benches, and often carry
on an animated conversation in, to us,
a disagreeably loud tone of voice.
What brought it on I cannot assert,
but Terry apprised the “ immaculate”
that he was telling a lie ! He received
the usual “fu quoque,” of course, ac-
companied by a request to adjourn to
the verandah and submit to his head
being “ punched.”
Mr. Mac seemed intent upon doing
mischief to Terry, and advanced with
clenched fist towards him.
Says the latter “I don’t want to have
anything to do with you.” McEl-
hone wasn’t to be denied, and reiterated
his positive itching to damage poor T’s
frontispiece.
In vain Driver implored for order—
“ I won t withdraw a word or apolo-
gise. Will he come outside; I want
to punch ’is ’ed,” roared Mac.
Then, Gray, who, with calm serenity
came to Mr. Driver’s rescue, rebutted
the turbulent representative of the
Hunter (Upper), but threw kerosene
instead of water on the fire.
“If you say that again I’ll knock
your head off;” spurts out the now
furious Mac—and addressing both
Gray and Charles (who had nut his
foot into it by some untoward'means
or other) begged them both to accom-
pany him outside, adding that he
would tackle them.
“ Come outside,” roared Mac
“and I’ll show you howl’ll punch
both your and your brother-in-
law’s heads ” : and I declare positively
entreated his honourable friends to
submit to this novel method of wind-
ing up a debate.
Poor Macintosh feared that “murder”
would ensue. Innocent old John !
Mr. Mac. had as little idea of going
outside (save to the refreshment room)
as any member in the chamber.
My friend is a man of superabun-
dant “gas”; but I doubt him as a
“punchist.’’ The language used,
though nothing new t o legislative ears)
became so abusive that Fitzpatrick (I
am sure, out of a kindly feeling for
us and our sensitive disposition,) called
attention that “we” were present, as
if the fact were not thoroughly known
to all of thfm, the whole evening!
and we were compelled to “skedaddle.”
But as our representatives are not
pledged to secresy, it was not a diffi-
cult job for me to learn that, after we
were bowed out, Fitzpatrick moved
Driver out of the chair, and that on
the Speaker’s taking his seat, the
Chairman of Committees reported
Mac’s disorderly conduct. The cul-
prit was ordered to withdraw from the
chamber, and on re-entering made
some sort of apology, which was ac-
cepted—that the motion was then put
—“Andy Lynch” being wide-awake by
this time —and negatived by a majority
of owe, and that on adjourning,
Charles and Gray, by way of showing
the absence of all ill-feeling, and the
true Christian charity animating them
—actually “stood” champagne and
oysters, Gray, honourably paying his
lost case cf “ fizz” to M‘Elhone like a
man.
So the memorable week ended. I
live in hope of something equally in-
teresting to scribble about in my next.
THE LOUNGER.
A delinquent, arrested for drunkenness,
was asked at the police-court what he had
done with his money ? ‘ ‘ Invested it in
lots,” was the reply. “ What lots ?” was
the next question. “ Lots of whisky,” he
replied with a serious face.


THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 14.
The general disregard of the influence
of our own infection upon our neigh-
bour, which marks the conduct of
persons in this colony, leads to a
rapid dissemination of the germs
of disease, which, under a more
thoughtful provision (public as well
as private), might be destroyed
while limited to the range of their
primary development.
The subject is a very large, and by
no means simple one, and, in the
dealing with it, we may seem to
tread with no tender foot upon the
favorite corn of many a vested in-
terest. These vested interests must
pardon us for our interference with
them, and may rest assured that the
march of sanitation, though begun,
is so slow that the present genera-
tion will not, financially, be appre-
ciably affected by its strides
We hardly know where to begin,
but will take the biggest offender
first. We allude to the Majesty of
the State, which, under the name of
Commissioners, devised and executed
the abominable system of sewerage
from back to f ont, carrying the
nipes, under the houses, to the
(wer in the street, under which the
rity now languishes, and, as the
. vyers say, “ languishing doth live ”
A Detter plan for spreading iofec-
ion of enteric disease could scarcely
have been devised had the engineers
of this measure taken counsel of the
u highest authority ” It is not, as
we have had occasion, in other
words, to say before, when the ~ J pes
are first laid that the error is
manifest, that the escape of gases
f om defective pipes and faulty
joints becomes apparent Mother
Karth covers with her thick mantle
these and other blunders, and not
until her crust is charged, and can
contain no more, do the gases rise.
This rising may begin at a time
when under atmospheric conditions
favoring development, typhoid or
cholera poison may be present, and
according to the species of disease, so
the mortality which this condition of
things brings about, or with regard
to the latter scourge, may at any
time spread among us.
We regard it as of the first impor-
tance that this community be made
aware of the perils over which they
live , a volcano of disease, waiting but
one or two conditions to break out
with desolating power, and, even
while we write, being doubtless the
cause of much of the low vitality
of those who are compelled to sleep
as well as work in the city
By what means, short of a repeti-
tion of the great expenditure which
created this hot-bed of future woes,
the remedy can be applied we do not
at present know. It is, however,
something to know our danger, a peril
annually increasing in volume as well
asin degree While we may not at once
see how Sydney is to be delivered,
we may point the warning to the
suburban towns, which are fast fol-
lowing the same plan of drainage.
Next in order to the designers of
our system of sewerage are those
careless persons who carry their in-
fected relatives, for change of air,
into clean country quarters, infect-
ing the suburbs with the diseases of
the city; who sell, instead of burn-
ing, or at least disinfecting, clothes,
bedding, and curtains impregnate
with the germs of disease —and those
who, having had infectious disease in
heir houses, let the rooms vacated
by the convalescent, or perhaps the
dead, to new lodgers, upon whom the


doctor’s carriage too surely, the
undertaker’s, probably, soon waits.
We know a gentleman who (as he
is a grandfather) ought to know
better, told his friend that he “ had
had five of his family down with
scarlet fever, and that as they were
now getting over it, he had engaged
rooms for them at Burwood, and was
gorng to give the Burwood people a
benefit,” There can be no doubt
that had any of the Burwood people
died of disease contracted in this
manner, this gentleman would have
been guilty of homicide. Can there
be any doubt that such conduct
ought to be the subject of legal
restraint ?
Frequently, during the incidence
of the epidemics of scarlatina and
measles, we have seen invalid chil-
dren in the railway carriages, and
the mothers, or nurses, in attend-
ance upon them, talking without re-
serve on the subject of the disease
which must at the time have been in
the most infectious stage.
It may be said that it is hard that
we can’t take our children away for
change of air, so valuable a restora-
tive measure ! We reply it is harder
still that, to improve your child’s
recovery, you should spread disease
to. people, who, but fcr you,
might ntver contract it during their
entire lives—it is not necessary for
people to have scarlatina, measles,
small pox, and typhoid—they are
preventable diseases, and society
should protect itself against them by
every fair means.
Against the negligence, careless-
ness, and selfishness, which spread
disease in this manner, and also
against that extreme hardihood, with
which attendants upon childbed
cases ignore the possibility of their
own infection, even when demon-
•
strated by many fatal consequences,
it is the absolute duty of our Legis-
lature to provide—true the case is
difficult to treat, the offenders hard
to reach, but as a sanitary writer
among us has remarked, a commu-
nity which legislates to ward off
scab from our flocks, and for the de-
struction of the Bathurst Burr, ought
not to leave our women, in their
most helpless hour, a prey to the
scourge which a couple of years
since caused MATERNITY to be
regarded as another name for
DEAIH!
Legislation must quarantine people,
houses, and things for certain
periods, which shall at least equal
the longest known term of infection 5
we don’t say that this will be plea-
sant to those quarantined, but thus,
and thus only will disease be limited
in area.
A TALE OF THE OLDEN
TIMES.
BY RUS.
It seems strange in such a young
country as this to be talking about
olden times ; and, indeed, the events
which I have to narrate occurred at no
very distant date; but lor some reason
or another, which I will not stop to
analyze, things which happened in the
early days of the colony, even in the
time of our own fathers, seem to be-
long tc a remote antiquity.
The story which I am about to tell
was related to me by one of the chief
actors, whom I will call Captain Stan-
hope, the commander of the native
police over a large and remote district
of the colony.
For the sake of those not acquainted
with these things, I may state that the
native police were principally employed
in keeping in check the wild aborigines
in the more distant and unsettled
squatting districts. They were always


drawn from distant parts of the con-
tinent, and entertained hostile feelings
towards the strange tribes with which
they were brought into contact. If it
were possible that a true account could
be written of their doings, and of the
ways in which they carried out their
ideas of enforcing the law, when left to
themselves, a darker shadow would be
thrown over the early history of the
colony.
In order to afford leave of absence
to a subordinate, Captain Stanhope
took temporary charge of one of the
outlying police stations of his district.
He found himself almost isolated in the
bush with his company of six native
troopers.
One day intelligence was brought m
that a body of blacks had been com-
mitting depredations in the outskirts
of a neighbouring station, and had
murdered one of the shepherds. The
homestead was about thirty miles from
the police station, but the hut where
the murdered man had lived was more
distant.
Captain Stanhope immediately sent
off all his men, but was unable to ac-
company them, for he was suffering
from a slight accident which disabled
him from riding. A few days after-
wards the troop returned unsuccess-
ful, not having been able, as they said,
to follow up the track of the offending
blacks. Captain Stanhope was rather
surprised at this result. His men
seldom came back with such h report,
and he fancied tha he saw something
strange in their manner.
A day or two afterwards intelligence
was conveyed to Captain Stanhope that
nothing had been seen of the native
police at the station where the murder
took place, but that a fresh atrocity
had been committed. A young woman
who lived at the head station had been
found murdered in the bush, and many
circumstances indicated that she had
been first brutally outraged.
The captain now thought that he
understood the unusual story of his
men and their strange looks, and felt
no doubt that they were the guilty
persons. He could see their keen but
furtive glances, enquiring, as it were,
whether he suspected them, and he
knew that if he displayed a shadow of
suspicion he was a dead man. His
position was now a terrible one—
alone, but for the six cut-throats who
surrounded him. Their searching
looks seemed to follow him always,
and the effort to keep up an unsus-
pecting demeanor became almost in-
tolerable.
He managed, however, to conceal his
thoughts—loudly attributed the new
outrage, as, of course, to the same
blacks who had murdered the shep-
herd, and kept the troopers scouring
the country in search of tbeir tracks.
It appeared that at the time when the
troopers should have arrived at the
station, when first sent to avenge the
death of the shepherd, there happened
to be no one at head-quarters but the
unfortunate young woman before re-
ferred to. It was supposed that in the
absence of the men, she rode out with
the police to put them on the track of
the marauding blacks, and that giving
way to their savage propensities, they
outraged her, and then murdered her
to conceal their crime.
At this stage of the story I asked
the Captain how in the world he got
out of this affair, for evenif he obtained
sufficient assistance to arrest his
troopers, there seemed no legal evi-
dence to convict them, however morally
certain their guilt might be.
“Oh,” he said, with a curious smile,
“ we had a very different wav of
managing such things in those days.
I sent them one by one with des-
patches to distant police stations in
different parts of the district, the pur-
port of the despatch in each case being
that a man should be sent to me at
once in place of the bearer of the des-
patch, and that after his departure the
bearer should be taken into custody. I
added some further hints which I do
not care to particularize.”
<• But what,” I asked, “became
of the men taken into custody?”
“Well,” he replied, “it was a very
singular coincidence, but every one of
them tried to escape, and every one


was shot dead in the attempt. Of
course no inquests were held, and
nothing more was said about it, for we
did not think it worth while to send an
account of the affair to the news-
papers.”

Said she “such brute force
Is not nice in one’s horse;”
Then she hobbled back slowly, a cramp’d

There was an old party of Molong,
Who let both his hair ahd beard grow

His favourite bye-word,
When talking, was “ my word,”
And instead of good-bye he said “so-long.”

THE MEEESCHATJM PIPE.
A youth once bought a meerschaum pipe,
And though its praise he sang;
It multiplied his earthly cares
With many an anxious pang.
His qualms when first he tried to smoke
May not be sung or said—
His cheek was pale, his palate dry,
His eyes as dull as lead.


With trembling step and dizzy brain
Up stairs to bed he crept:
He rolled and tossed, and sighed and
moaned,
But not a wink he slept!
But, undismayed, next day the youth
Began again to smoke ;
But soon he felt obliged to own
That smoking was no joke !
He kept it up in spite of all
His anxious friends could say;
And then the climax came, and he
Began to waste away.
His constitution fell to bits,
His sickness became chronic ;
The doctor gave him bullet pills,
Besides a fire-tongs tonic.
But suddenly a change took place
Which made his friends still duller;
You hardly will believe it —but
The youth began to colour !
A ruddy brown appeared above
The collar of his shirt;
And, oh, his dreadful anguish when
He found it wasn’t dirt !
Still, pipe in mouth, he sucked away
As fiercely as before ;
And daily, to his friends’ dismay,
He coloured more and more !
At length the case grew hopeless, and
When this result they saw;
They shipped him off to Africa,
And “ spliced ” him to a squaw.
He died a Black. His widow wrote
An epitaph most tearsome —
“ Kind friends, this Coloured Person
fell
A victim to his Meers’um ! ”

THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMAN'S FERRY ROAD
( Continued .)
Chapter IX.
When George Caldecott met Lucy in
the drawing-room, subsequently to his
interview with her father, and told her
that he had been pressed to stop a few
more days at Uralmindry, and that it
was with the greatest pleasure he had
consented, he took it as a happy omen
of his fortune and hopes that she, with
heightened colour, exclaimed, “Oh!
I’m so glad! you’ll be able to teach me
how to pronounce correctly those
ballads of IJhland.”
George had no scruples now about
striving his best to win the prize upon
which his heart was set. He deter-
mined to make good running during
the remainder of his visit, and as he
well knew that instruction in German
pronunciation would be an admirable
reason for insisting upon pretty con-
stant tete-a-tetes with his pupil, both
morning, afternoon, and evening, he
jumped at her suggestion, and acted
upon it with infinite zeal, though it
must be confessed that Uhland was at
times forgotten for a dearer theme.
As the hour of his leaving Ural-
mindry neared, Lucy began to perceive
that her heart had gone out to her
father’s guest, and that his absence
would throw a gloom upon her days.
The course of her love had run very
smoothly ; she had hardly, indeed, re-
alised that it was love ; but when the
thought flashed upon her, “To-morrow
and he will be gone !” she knew by the
anticipation of the shadow how it was
with her. It was an immense relief to
her in her first sorrow when her father
told her that Mr. Caldecott was going
to study with young Mr. Kenny, and
that in all likelihood he would often be
able to pay them a visit at Crawley,
their place on the Hawkesbury.
The time for departure came. Mr.
Hay was to drive George to Mitta-
Mitta. The buggy was at the door.


“ I suppose,” added the old gentle-
man to George, after the farewells had
been duly made, “ Lucy and I will
find you at the Cosgrove’s when we
pay them our promised visit ?”
“Oh! certainly,” said Caldecott,
glancing as he spoke at Miss Walton.
Lucy’s answering look was a revela-
tion.
George Caldecott drove away with
his heart at rest.
Chapter X.
“ The sweeping theatre of hanging woods.”
The tall rock,
The mountain and the deep and trloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms were then to me
An appetite.’’
The old northern road, now many
years fallen into disuse, ran from ar -
ramatta past Dural, along the sand-
stone ridge that, dividing the waters of
the Cattai from those of the Mother of
Mars, the Layburn and the Dalgetty
Creeks falls precipitously to the
Hawkesbury, a little below its junction
with the Macdonald.
It was constructed at an infinite cost
of convict labour, over the barren rocky
platform across which it winds in
snake-like bends and turnip Possibly
the only man who derived any direct
personal advantage from its construc-
tion was old Solomon Wiseman, the ex-
Channel smuggler, who after a journey
to Botany at his sovereign’s expense,
lighted upon his legs with singular
good fortune, and as its contractor con-
trived to amass a considerable amount
of wealth by very sharp, if not very
humane traffic in the blood and muscle
of his less fortunate brother deporte's.
The hostelry he built near the ferry
which bears his name is almost in
ruins, though still inhabited. From
the terrace of the garden, or rather
from what was the garden, now a scene
of desolation, where mildewed orange
trees and stunted aloes crop out from
a wild entanglement of sweet-briars,
the view is singularly grand; but
rarely now-a-days Eire to be seen des-
cending to the opposite bank of the
noble river horseman, or footman,
making for the inn on the southern
bank. Solomon Wiseman's telescope
(the one with which, as Judge Therry
relates, the o ! d fellow used to scan the
road for travellers to whom he might
offer hospitality) would have little or
no work to-day.
On the banks of a rippling creek,
some six miles south of the Ferry,
and to the left of the road, a surveyor's
camp had been pitched for several
weeks, at the date of our story.
The little stream beneath the tre-
mulous foliage of tea-trees and lillie
pillies, gurgled and twisted, dancing
and eddying over and between and
under stones and rocks which the con-
stant motion of its waters ha ; worn
into all manner of fantastic shapes. A
short distance from the camp the
stream tumbled splashingly into a
pool—a gleaming sheet of water
which, from its fringes of fern and
rushes, looked upwards into the
heavens like an eye’s black intelli-
gence, and out of which again, after a
short panting stay, it dashed with wild
leap and impetuous plunge to search
for further fortunes beyond the shady
glen, which but a few yards on
terminated in a sheer fall into a cliff-
girdled bay.
The Government of the day had de-
clared its intention (as a good many
Governments have done since) of lay-
ing before the country a comprehen-
sive national railway scheme, and to
that end trial surveys were being
pushed forward with a good deal of
vigour.
The camp, the site of which has
just been described, was occupied by
one of these parties, under the charge
of Mr. licensed surveyor Kenny, to
whom had been committed the task of
endeavouring to discover a practical
line (bridging the Hawkesbury) from
Parramatta to Wollombi.
One of the party was George Calde-
cott, whom Mr. Kenny had on Mr.
Walton’s recommendktion, taken as an
assistant. A very few days had suffied
to cement a friendship between the two
young men who, notwithstanding the


somewhat dreary situation of their
temporary camping ground contrived,
what with adventurous rambles and
shooting excursions in the deep re-
cesses of the gorges on all sides of
them, to pass a pleasant enough time
of it while collecting the data re-
quired by the Engineer-in chief,
Edward Kenny was the sixth son of
a man who by good luck and ability
had founded an Australian family, in
the aristocratic sense of the word.
The Kenny property was enormous.
It embraced an immense area of free-
hold estates. The daughters of the
house were all well married to wealthy
men, the sons, who had been liberally
educated, with a similar instinct had
each taken unto himself a wife with
money. Few of the race cared to bruit
it about that its founder had risen
from the ranks. The family tree
imported by Edward’s elder brother,
quite ignored the newness of the
Kennys as members of the aristocracy
of the empire, and boldly gave them a
genealogy as historically sensational
(in the dawn of the middle ages) as
that of e’er an O’Brien, Howard or
Montmorency. For all that, Sergeant
Kenny had re-gilded the old escut -
cheon.
It frequently happened that Mr.
Kenny would leave camp for a day or
so in order to take a run down into the
Goulburn district, where his private
residence was situated. On such oc-
casions the command of the survey
party devolved upon George Caldecott.
The camp cook was an “old hand,”
who went by the name of “Yorky,”
and who (as one of the ckainmen used
to say) could twist the most terrible
coffers a chap ever heard. These
“ coffers” always related to the early
penal days, and not a few of them
made reference to the old road near
which they were camped. Caldecott
would often stroll down of an evening
to fire, and while discussing
a quiet pipe, listen to his yarns. More
than once he made up his mind to ask
the old fellow if he had ever heard any-
thing about the escape of a convict
named Aldridge, but on second
thoughts he would deter doing so, not
caring to connect aught belonging to
his mother with such a terrible old
reprobate as Yorky, in whose charac-
ter the one redeeming point was a be-
lief in his employer’s father, whom
he was too worldly wise ever to speak
of as the Sergeant, and to whom he
always referred as “the old man.”
Caldecott often repented he had not
spoken to Mr. Walton about his
mother’s secret during his stay at
Uralmindry. He had several times
thought of so doing, but had always
been checked by the idea that perhaps
there was no necessity after all to take
such a step, since Devereux would in
all likelihood find a means of discover-
ing a clue to the mystery of the fate of
Uldridge.
One afternoon George Caldecott
strolled up from camp to the old road,
in order to see the sun set behind the
Blue Mountains. As he sauntered
slowly along, his attention was drawn
to the marks and letters that in all
directions round about him were deeply
cut in the yellow sandstone through
which the road had been made.
Hoping to find something that would
interest hffn, he searched among the
boulders and blocks for evidences of
anything of sculptural caricature. One
or two grotesque faces rudely chiselled
in the rock rewarded his pains, and
one or two lines of sorrow, graven,
possibly, with weary hand and heart
by poor wretches in bitter misery.
Suddenly a gleam of sunlight
brightened upon the face of a partially
squared block, and George’s glance is
rivetted upon the letters that the gleam
reveals !
They were carved in this fashion :
J A
L P
1826


The year 1826 was the very one in
which Aldridge had escaped; and
what should “ J.A.” be but the initials
of the name John Aldridge, as “ L.P.”
were those of Lucy Powys.
Was it on this sultry ridge that his
mother's first love had toiled and
suffered? Was it from anywhere
about here that the unhappy man had
dashed off into the bush, down the
tortuous abysses, on this hand or that,
to die ?
Such were Caldecott’s reflections as
he hurried back to the camp to find
out if Yorky knew anything definite
about escapes made by convicts from
the Northern road chain gang in or
about the year 1826.
Unfortunately for the satisfaction of
his curiosity, Yorky had not arrived in
the colony until 1829.

A SONG FOR PEACE.
Slaughter herself is sated and weary,
culture and dog disdain their feast:
Desolation sits lone and dreary,
Queen, sole Queen of the stricken East.
I he weak are falling for sport to the
cruel,
The war-fire is waning for lack of the
fuel;
Shall it he said our Britain fed
The flame of battle, the ranks of the dead ?
Death is tired of bloody mowing,
Plunder lags with his loaded wain;
Winter is weary of deathful snowing
That cannot cover the drifts of slain,
hew shall come to the springtide sowing,
hew shall watch the roses blowing
Shall it be said our Britain shed ’
Her blood to redden the waste rose-bed ?
Falls the scourge from the fierce oppressor,
1 he rod is snapped in the tyrant’s hand •
Victory smiling, a stem Assessor,
Leads young Liberty back to the land •
The wronged stand free on the land that
bore them,
Hope, the immortal, upheaves before them.
ishall it be told that Briton sold
The slave to the master for lands or gold ?
Shall Christian fight fora waning Crescent,
Though men may mourn for a grandeur
gone?
Hail we the nations rejuvenescent,
Th’ heroic races that led them on !
Montenegrin and gallant Rouman,
Theirs the cause of Freedom and Woman !
Ne’er be it told that Britain’s gold
Restored the freed to the Tyrant’s hold!

WAR RUMOURS.
Beading the vague, contradictory
and matterless European telegrams
which during the last week or two
have been published in the columns
of our daily contemporaries, in the
surer light thrown on the war ques-
tion by mail intelligence last to
hand, one is able to discern quite
clearly that the deliberate voice
(taking voice to be what it should
be,, the expression of thought)—we
repeat that the deliberate voice of
England is not for war The reck-
less passionate clamour of the London
mob, of the arsenal artizans, of the
most selfish clique of the pluto-
cratic party is undoubtedly for war
for war, righteous or unrighteous.
And it is just the froth of this
clamour that we have served up to
us as our daily wire diet—the last
“ shave ” of the clubs, or “ on ditf’
of the Stock Exchange.
A careful perusal of the last mail
news—of the influential provincial
journals especially, lets one into the
secret that the sound core of the
home land is for peace. For those
who love England and her old his-
toric fame, it is a wretched thing to
contemplate, that the power and the
honour—the prestige of the Empire
is in the hands of an adventurer,
Vho with all his versatile ability and
melodramatic brilliancy, possesses the
soul of an upholsterer after all—one


who would rather bewitch by effect
than convince by principle logically
applied, or by the honest practice of
a simple patriotism.
The “ privateering ” scare is likely
enough to have had foundation in
the foolish “ bounce” of some Rus-
sian coterie or another much bitten
by Anglo-phobia, but that it arose
from any act of Russian Imperial
Government —a party to the Geneva
Convention —we shall be slow to be-
lieve until circumstances justify us
in so doing.
As we have said before in these
columns that Europe is still at peace
is owing to Russian moderation in
the hour of triumph. It will be a
lasting disgrace to Englishmen if
they allow the bombast of Shoddydom
to precipitate a war for entering upon
which no reason, not even one set on
so low a basis as expediency, can be
assigned.
TOWN GOSSIP
An attempt was made by Captain
Onslow, on Wednesday evening, to
take advantage of the present temper
of the House to introduce some legis-
lation for the proper conduct of
debates, for which we give him credit ;
but the idea of anything in the shape
of immediate and decisive action upon
any conceivable question seemed to be
out of the question with our Govern-
ment. To bring in a short bill, which
would probably be a transcript of the
Victorian bill,“and pass it through all
its stages as quickly as possible so as
to render the recurrence of such scenes
as have lately occured in the Assembly
impossible, would appear to the non-
Parliamentary mind the simplest way
of meeting the difficulty. But this
it was urged, would embarrass
the Government; it would be rush- #
ing into hasty legislation ; it
would prevent the passing of a
comprehensive measure, and there-
fore it was not desirable that the powers
and privileges of the House should be
defined until that happy period when
all differences are to be adjusted, when
the lion shall lie down with the lamb,
and when hon. members shall be able
to put their heads together without
any fear of having them punched, in
short, until next session. For
once, however, these arguments fell
flat upon the ears of hon. members,
and by a small majority it was resolved
that the remedy shall be applied
during the. present session. In the
mean time, until the use of the
obnoxious word is precluded by
law from the Legislative Chamber, we
would suggest to unruly members a
middle course, which we feel certain
would give no offence whatever. In-
stead of “ You’re a liar,” why not say
with dignity, “ The hon. member has
made a statement which is entirely
without foundation, and, but for the
respect I entertain for the forms of the
House, I should employ a much
shorter term to express my opinion of
the hon. member’s veracity. Verbvm

Touching the scare on the subject
of privateers plundering British ships,
a Captain James Watson, formerly a
volunteer on board the Alabama, writes
to the Daily News “As to vessels
of the Alabama class, I cannot see how
the Russians are to get them, con-
sidering that, in the event of war
breaking out, you have the power of
closing the Baltic and the Black Seas
without much trouble, and the vessels
of the Pacific squadron would then see
to the only Russian ones left. They
could not cruise about long without
coals, and at any place they called for
coals the telegrapn now-a-days would
at once inform your naval authorities.
I believe privateering was abolished
by the Treaty of Paris. Now, how-
ever venturesome we Americans may
be, we do not wish to swing at the
yard-arm for the pleasure of burning
British ships, for no neutral ports
would be open for prizes, and so what


advantage could we gain to compen-
sate for the risk ?”

A good story is going the rounds of
the English papers of a reverend
doctor who has a weakness for making
the acquaintance of colored clergymen.
Eecently he gave an audience to three
or four of them, and invited some of
his fellow-laborers in the vineyard
to meet them. The white parsons came
at the appointed time, but, although
the host waited until long past the
dinner hour, the black ones did not put
in an appearance. At last the servant
was sent for and asked whether any
one else had called. “ No, Sir, no one
has called except some Christy Minstrels,
cmd I soon got rid of them”

Eveky one was sorry to hear of the
accident that befell the champion
sculler. The general impression
amongst boating men is, that the loss
of the third finger of the left hand will
not seriously militate against his row-

will be taken of Mr. Trickett until he
has completely recovered from his
mishap.

It was hardly in good taste for the
Anglican Dean of Sydney, in present-
ing a copy of the Bible to the captain
of the Japanese war vessel, Tsukuba,
to relate the hackneyed incident about
the Queen and the African prince.
Had the anecdote been told to the
Mikado himself no one could have
found fault: but surely it was a ques-
tionable courtesy to aim an indirect
blow at the Mikado’s religion while
professing to be doing a kindness to
one of his officers.

At the Money-Order Office they
won't make out an order payable to a
woman unless her Christian name is
given. This rule (which is as one of
the Medes and Persians) frequently
causes trouble. You want to remit
ten shillings, say, to your washer-
woman, whom you only know as Mrs.
Jones. Whether she be Blanche or
Peggy, Cicely or Winifred you know
not; all that you do know is, that she
is Mrs. Jones, of Llewellyn Crescent,
Parramatta. Routine says “Mrs.
Jones" can’t be inserted in the order.
It also sets face against blank" or
“ dash’' Jones. Routine triumphantly
argues that the signature to the re-
ceipt of the payee should tally with the
name of the person to whom the order
was made payable. Theoreticaly rou-
tine may be right. Practically the ap-
plication of the principle leads to in-
convenience. Perhaps Mr. Superin-
tendent Hill will take the matter under
consideration.

In the early days of Constitutional
Government courtesy was practised by
hon. members one towards another,
even in the heat of battle. Glancing
the other day at the report of the
debate on the second reading of the
Constitution Bill, we came across a
passage at arms between Darvall (now
Sir J. B.) and Martin (now Sir James).
Tho latter, in his really splendid
speech on that occasion, said that the
former had made a certain statement.
Darvall remarked, “ I beg leave to
correct the hon. member. I never
stated any thing of the sort." To
whom James Martin:—“l do not
think that I am in error; but if. the
honorable member says positively that
he made no such statement then I
must be mistaken." Members of the
present day think courtesy of that kind
a trifle too tame. They prefer blunt
speaking, things called by their pro-
per names, and so on. We wonder
when the principle of calling a spade a
spade is so dear to them that they still
cling to the use of the term honorable
in speaking of one another I

once in every three years, while in each


intervening year the Agricultural
Society (acting on the plan of the
Highland Association) might hold a

How is it that people in want of
portraits in oil of themselves or friends
betake themselves to the “ Heathen

three or four artists whom we could
name who can enlarge photographs in
a style which, if not celestial, is in-
finitely more terrestrial and true to
nature than the woodeny work of Sum
Thung or Kong Fung ? Why ? but
because the profits of a prophet in his
own country are kept at a low mini-
mum, lest he should wax proud.

The latest novelty in sound instru-
ments is a phonograph, invented by
Mr, Edison, an American, which is
said not only to make sound visible,
but to record it in a permanent form.
While you speak into the tube you
work a handle, which makes a cylinder
reverse ; the sound of the voice causes
a thin disk of metal to vibrate, and
the vibration puts in motion a steel
point, which makes impression in a
band of tinfoil wound round the cy-
linder, the tinfoil bearing the record of
the spoken message. But this is not
all; the tinfoil so indented is then ap-
plied to a hollow tube with a paper
diaphragm called the “transmitter,”
of which the original sounds are re-
produced. As often as the cylinder
revolves the sounds are reproduced
until the tinfoil is worn out. The
practical value of this ingenious con-
trivance has yet to be tested.

A gee at many tall yarns are current
on the subject of the extreme heat in
northern Queensland, but none that
we have heard beat the following :
An old resident of Rockhampton died
recently, and went, it is inferred to
regions below, where the temperature
is generally considered to be pretty
hot. About a month after his decease,
however, he “ appeared to a resident
in his old quarters at Rockhampton in
the dead of night. Alarmed as he
was at this unexpected apparition, the
individual in question mustered cou-
rage to ask his ghostly visitor what he
came for, and received the unexpected
reply— l’ve come back for my blankets.

The appointment to the Warden-
ship of St. Paul’s College will, we un-
derstand be made on Wednesday next.
The gentleman to whom rumour points
as the successor to Mr. Scott, is the
Eev. Mr. Corlette, of Ashfield. The
inquiries we have made since we first
referred to this vacancy, have led us
to the conclusion, that should that
gentleman be the successful candidate
for the vacant Wardenship, it will be
for this reason —he has peculiar quali-
fications and fitness for the office and
is, in all probability, the best man.
Mr. Corlette, who is a native of the
colony, went with a school exhibition
from one of the King’s College, Lon-
don, affiliated schools to Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford, where he took honours
both in his second year and at his
final (degree) examination. After
passing his second year’s examina-
tion, Mr. Corlette went on to the Con-
tinent for the purpose of studying
modern and Oriental languages, mak-
ing good progress in Arabic, and
acquiring German and French. After
taking his B.A. degree, he became
College Prizeman for the Theological
Essay. Mr. Corlette previously con-
tested the Wardenship with Mr. Scott,
and though unsuccessful, his high
testimonials secured the favourable
consideration of the Fellows of ot.
Paul’s.

Judging by points is difficult, even
when the men performing the judicial
functions know what they are about
and are left to do their work in peace
and quiet. When your fellow judges
don’t understand the point principle,
and are interfered with in their duties
by the chaff of outsiders, or seduced
from them by hospitable invitations to
refresh the inner man, the difficulties


are increased. The maximum of diffi-
culty is attained when you yourself are
in a fog as to the precise bearing of
the “ point” principle; and when your
personal attention to your inner man
has been more than ordinarily lavish.
Under such circumstances (to para-
phrase Dante) one “points” no more
that day!

ECONOMICAL COOKERY.
(From the Middle C/ass Cookery Book.)
VARIOUS SOUPS.
Carrot Soup Puree. This is a
winter soup, much esteemed ; whole-
some and nutritious. To three pints
of broth add three or four carrots, cut
up in slices, according to size ; three
onions, tnree leeks, half a head of
celery ; put in a saucepan, add two
ounces of butter, and half an ounce of
sugar ; then add your prepared vege-
tables, and fry them for ten minutes,
taking care that they do not become
brown; mix these to your broth.
When the whole have boiled for fifteen !
minutes, and you find the vegetables I
are done, pass all through a tammy,
and replace the puree again in the pan, j
repass it through the tammy, and, if!
required, season with salt and popper,
and serve very hot.
Onion Soup Puree. —To three pints
of broth, use eight large onions, cut
in slices, fry them in a stew-pan with
a little butter, then add your broth;
let all boil till the onions are well done
—say half an hour; pass all through
a tammy a second time, then give
another little boil ; season with salt
and pepper to your taste, and serve hot,
over toasted bread cut in dice.
Haricot Beans Puree. Boil in
water one pint of beans with two sliced
onions ; mash them all well, but pro-
ceed as for carrot puree.
• treen Peas Puree. —To three pints
of bmth. use one and a half pints of
peas. When done, season with a little
sugar, and serve with toasted bread,
cut into small diamonds, having fried
the bread in boiling fat.
MEAGRE soups.
If the soup you intend to make
should be onion, cabbage, carrot, tur-
nip, or celery, take either singly, cut
it up nicely, and blanch the same into
boiling water for fifteen minutes, then
transfer it into a saucepan with a little
cold water, with a piece of butter and
salt; whilst this is doing, put into
another saucepan a piece of butter
with sliced onions, carrots, parsnips,
and celery,—these last all cut small; a
eschalot, thyme, bay leaf, basil, cloves,
parsley, and spring onions ; pass all
these on the fire, keeping them stirred
until they are of a good colour, then
add water, and let all boil thirty mi-
nutes; pass through a tammy, and add
the liquor to the saucepan which con-
tains the sliced onions ; give a few
minutes’ boil, taste if well seasoned,
pour it over some sliced bread in a
soup tureen, and serve.
Another Way.—Put three pints of
water into a stewpan, to this add the
quarter of a middling-sized cabbage,
a small parsnip, three onions, half a
head of celery, a sprig of parsley and
chervil tied together, and half-a-pint
of peas tied up in a cloth; boil the
whole for two hours and a half, adding
a piece of butter ; then pass the broth
through a tammy, add pepper and salt,
cut in a deep tureen pieces of bread
on these spread the vegetables, after


having neatly cut them, and on these
pour the boiling broth, and serve.
Green Peas and Sorrel Soup.—
Wash a handful of sorrel, and in a bag
put half a pint of geen peas ; boil these
in three pints of any broth; when
done, chop the sorrel, put some sliced
bread in a tureen, put the sorrel and
peas on it, pour the boiling broth over
it, cover, and serve hot.
Having now given a rather plentiful
series of soups, not only fitted for the
middle classes, but not to be despised
by the aristocrat, we shall here intro-
duce another series less expensive,
still wholesome and nourishing, for
the artizan.
The Artizan’s Broth is made ex-
actly as in the first process, the only
difference being in the parts of beef
used, and which, for this recipe, should
consist of either three or four pounds
of leg of beef, or of cheek and palate,
adding in a little bit of smelt
and liver; and in addition to the
vegetables nur**ea, asmall cabbage cut
int quarters; remarking that a very
little bread is required for the first
day, as you have plenty of cut vege-
tables. The next day boil a quarter of
a pound of rice, or a handful of ver-
micelli, semolina, or macaroni, adding
on either of the last a little Dutch
cheese grated.
Palate, Cheek, or Leg.—
The artizan’s broth in last receipt will
be found enough for four persons,
lasting two days ; on the second day,
a hash can be made as follows:—Cut
in slices five or six onions, fry them in
two ounces of dripping, and when they
begin to brown, add a tea spoonful of
flour, and a gill of broth; let simmer
until the onions are quite done, and
then put in your meat, nicely sliced ;
let it get gradually hot, and just before
serving, put in a little vinegar or mus-
tard. You have now, with the addi-
tion of a few boiled potatoes, a nice
dish.
Beef Boulli Salad. — Cut your cold
meat in thin slices, laying them in a
vegetable dish ; put salt and pepper
over with a couple of eschalots cut
very fine, and a dessert spoonful of
chopped parsley and onion mixed, one
tablespoonful of vinegar, and two ditto
of oil ; whilst cold potatoes cut in
slices are a good addition.

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers “a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature.— S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says:—lt is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. GiVos, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
WeeTc Magazine for Town and Conntry
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
Sydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
the day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a W?ek
a welcome Tisitor in every house, and an
agreeable companion to every reader.—
Southern Argus (Goulburn).
“Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
pearance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
Barlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a magazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands abetter
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are bom but to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says: —The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.” —Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may be per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend that
everything in the shape of “ news ” items
should be omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo, a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the ‘ ‘ Paradise Lost ’’—intended for the use
of University candidates —a el ever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sphinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hop • the new
organ will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors. — Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains wed written papers
and sketches, entitled “The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary o
the Kusso-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Sydney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney.— Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week.— This is the title of a new
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary cf the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Etcetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Fern' Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage.' The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterjield Star says: —Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says:—We have
looked the book carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages. — Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation.— Border Post{ Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable. — Western Post
(Mudgee).
The Bathurst Free Press says: —It con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “ Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. — Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers. — Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape ol smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week ” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
local. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches —we
note specially “ The Best Dog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,” —
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
Once a Week we can conscientiously re-
commend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
'1 hose who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse our opinion.— Cumberland Mercury.
The Sydney “Once a Week ” —The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and general
get up are equr* to those < f the first
number which vrt- had occasion to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light leading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. Altogether the number does credit
to editor and printer. — S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says : —“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written—the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “Best Dog in the Colony.”
We have every confidence in recommend-
ing “ Once a Week” to the favorable
notice of our readers.”
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
j ust received the eighth number of ‘ ‘ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might he lost to the general
public, and also established, a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week. —This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches.—
S. M. Herald.
The Sydney “Once a Week." —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now be looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may be congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
Sydney “Once a Week. —The new
number of this capital little serial quite
sustains the character of its predecessors.
Charley Cornstalk’s “ Sporting Adven-
tures’’and the “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry ” are continued. The Rev. A. W.
Petre commences a new story, entitled
“ Aunt Rebecca’s Secret,” which promises
to be good. There is another article on
the “ Public Health,” and a variety of
useful and amusing contributions make up
a very readable and pleasant number.—
Echo, April 12.
Sydney “Once a Week.” This
weekly magazine keeps up the reputation
it has earned for itself, as a well printed
entertaining serial. The local articles and
sketches are good, and there is a large
variety of interesting reading matter.—
S. M. Herald, April 13.
