We shall feel obliged to our Subscribers by an
early intimation of any irregularity in the
delivery of weekly numbers, that it may at
once be rectified.
N.B.—Advertisements for “SYDNEY ONCE A

Thursday evening.
PERSONAL.
In issuing the third number of our
magazine, we think we may con-
gratulate ourselves in having
launched our little boat into smooth
water, thanks to the support of the
Sydney public, and the kind way in
which our effort has been noticed by
the town and country Press. We
have to acknowledge a number of
contributions, many of them original,
and some very original, from all parts
of the colony. On every side has
been expressed a strong interest in
the new venture, and a hope, that it
will be a commercial success. We
have also received a large amount of
advice as to the conduct of the
magazine, which would have been
invaluable only for its singular con-
trariety. It is well that there should
be a diversity of opinion upon matters
of this kind, or the held of literary
pursuits would be cramped and un-
inviting. Readers of weekly pub-
lications, of the “ Once a Week ”
type, certainly appear to hold very
different views as to the style and
contents of such works. One gen-


tleman, who was asked to become a
subscriber, expressed his willingness
to join if we would bring it out
“twice a week;” but he was evi-
dently a wag. Another is of
opinion that we are attempting too
much, and that “ once a month ”
would be an appropriate issue. One
intending subscriber objected that
the type was too small, whilst the
next person applied to thought it
was too large, and that we should
have made more of it. One thinks
that the pamphlet should have a
brighter and more ornamental cover;
another that, in a work of this kind,
anything like display should be care-
fully avoided. There are those who
think we should have enlarged it,
and charged one shilling; and about
the same number have strongly re-
commended us to reduce its size, and
sell it for threepence. These persons
think it is too dry and too respectable,
and not sufficiently racy; others,
again, condemn it for containing too
much wit and frivolity. What can
an unfortunate editor do under these
circumstances'? We cannot allow
our Pegasus to be placed in the un-
dignified position of the donkey
mentioned in .ZEsop’s fables, by
attempting to meet all requirements,
and must, therefore, trudge along
the high road without, in any mate-
rial degree, altering our course of
procedure, or—to return to our first
simile —we must “ paddle our own
canoe ” as best we may, and endea-
vour to steer a straight course into
the haven of success.
Our little bark will leave her
moorings, opposite Hunter-street,
every Saturday morning at nine
o’clock, when our agents can obtain
their supplies. We invite all those
who have not yet embarked to make
a trial trip to-day into the regions of
humor, fancy, and romance, and, if
they are satisfied with the bill of fare
we have provided for them, to take
a season ticket—or, in other words,
to enter their names on the subscrip-
tion list, and thus give the enterprise
substantial encouragement.
VICIOUS LITERATURE.
The “scrofulous French novel ” is
a debasing institution, but never-
theless it is one which, as it finds
numerous supporters, pays. There
are dozens upon dozens of people
who,like Saxe’s “charming woman,’
read authors of whom they never
talk, quite as often as they talk of
authors they never read. But then
it must be owned that the majority
of those authors of whom one never
talks are clever fellows; their very
worst betises are redeemed by flashes
of wit, and it is not without a
charm that they unfold the tales
which strict decorum would fain
have left untold. We grant great
license to genius, and, for the sake
of brilliancy and keen analysis of
character, will pardon a too real-
istic sketch of a Faustine, of a
Wilhelm Meister, or of a Lady with
the Camellias ; but wbat are we to
say of the scrofulous Holy well-street
literature, which, unredeemed by one
flash of wit, seeks to win support
from the dirty-minded and the care-
less, for its impudent disregard alike
of decency as of art ? To the dirty-
minded we do not care to address
ourselves. He which is filthy let
him be filthy still; but to the care-
less we would say a few words.
Why, in these days of cheap books,
when the embarras des richesses , like


“ the litter of the rose-leaves, and
the noise of the nightingales,” is the
sole obstacle to the intending free-
selector in the realms of literature,
why go out of your way to spend
time and money on wretched publi-
cations, that can neither entertain
nor instruct—works that have not
the realism which grimly but truly
photographs a social ulcer, nor the
fancy which can idealise the volup-
tuous sensuousness of an erotic poet’s
day-dream wretched pamphlets,
which attempt the description of
low pot-house life—of the hangers-
on at tavern bars, of the loafers who
are,
“ As you by their faces see,
All silent and all damned.”
Why think that you can reap any
mental titilation of a pleasing kind
from the perusal of ill-written ac-
counts of the drunken hours passed
by wretched traviatas in the back
parlours of dens called cafes , on the
lucus a non lucendo principle, that
coffee is never called for in them ?
The streets of the city, during the
past few weeks, have been exten-
sively ticketed with notices directing
the attention of the lieges to the
fact that pamphlets are “just out,”
hot from the press, with particular
accounts of the “ pubs” and “ cafes,”
and of their frequenters ; and those
pamphlets have been sold by the
thousand, while the colonial story,
u His Natural Life,” the best novel
ever turned out,by an Australian
literateur, is not to be had, because
never asked for. And yet people
wonder that high-toned literature
doesn’t pay. The truth seems to be
that a broadside of libellous person-
alties will pay a hireling scribe better
than many pages of thought-out
ideas will pay the writer whose aim
is to ply his pen in the service of his
fellows. Is this state of things to
continue? We hope not, and trust
that young Australians will refuse
to countenance any publications save
those the object of which is to attract
the notice of the public by purvey-
ing for its healthy, not pandering to
its morbid, tastes.
Southey has left us, in his “ Com-
monplace Book,” an admirable canon
by which to test the value of a
book, which, as it may prove of ser-
vice to some of our younger readers
in these days, when, of the number
of books there is literally no end, we
quote entire :
“Young readers, you whose hearts
are open, whose understandings are
not yet hardened, and whose feelings
are neither exhausted nor encrusted
with the world, take from me a better
rule than any professors of criticism
will teach you ! Would you know
whether the tendency of a book is
good or evil, examine in what state
of mind you lay it down. Has it
induced you to suspect that what you
have been accustomed to think un-
lawful may after all be innocent, and
that may be harmless which you have
been taught to think dangerous ? Has
it tended to make you dissatisfied and
impatient under the control of others,
and disposed you to relax in that self-
government without which both the
laws of God and man tell us there can
be no virtue, and consequently no
happiness ? Has it attempted to abate
your admiration and reverence for
what is great and good, and to
diminish in you a love of your coun-
try and of your fellow creatures ?
Has it addressed itself to your pride,
your vanity, your selfishness, or any of
your evil propensities ? Has it defiled
the imagination with what is loathsome,
and shocked the heart with what is
monstrous? Has it disturbed the
sense of right and wrong which the
Creator has implanted in the human
soul? If so—if you have felt that
such were the effects it was intended
to produce—throw the book into the


fire, whatever name it may bear upon
the title-page ! Throw it into the fire,
young man, though it should have been
the gift of a friend ; young lady, throw
it away with the whole set, though it
should be the prominent furniture
in the rosewood bookcase. ”
ILLA CREEK.
BY HENRY KENDALL.
A strong sea-wind flies up and sings
Across the blown-wet border,
Whose stormy echo runs and rings
Like bells in wild disorder.
Fierce breath hath vext the foreland’s
face—
It glistens, glooms, and glistens ;
But, deep within this quiet place
Sweet Ilia lies and listens.
Sweet Ilia, of the shining sands,
She sleeps in shady hollows,
Where August flits with flowerful
hands,
And silver summer follows.
Far up the naked hills is heard
. A noise of many waters ;
But green-haired Ilia lies unstirred
Amongst her star-like daughters.
The tempest pent in moaning ways,
Awakes the shepherd yonder ;
But Ilia dreams, unknown to days
Whose wings are wind and thunder.
Her fairy hands and floral feet
Are brought by bright October ;
Here, stained with grapes and smit
with heat,
Comes autumn sweet and sober.
Here lovers rest, what time the red
And yellow colours mingle.
And daylight droops with dying head
Beyond the western dingle.
And here, from month to month, the
time
Is kissed by peace and pleasure ;
WJiile nature sings her woodland
rhyme
And hoards her woodland treasure.
Ah, Ilia Creek ! ere evening spreads
Her wings o’er towns unshaded,
How oft we seek thy mossy beds
To lave our foreheads faded !
For —let me whisper—then we find
The strength that lives, nor falters,
In wood and water, waste and wind,
And hidden mountain altars.
Camden Haven, 25th Jan., 1878.
POLITICAL.
We are glad to notice a strong dis-
position in the House, as well as out
of it, to give the Farnell Ministry
fair play, and to allow them ample
time to develope their policy. This
has been unniistakeably evinced in
the Legislative Assembly, in two
recent divisions on important ques-
tions, in which the Government have
had a large majority. The deter-
mination to give a general support
to the new Ministry may be attri-
buted to a tardy consciousness on the
part of hon. members of the waste of
time which has occurred during
previous sessions by frivolous, as
well as factious, motions; and the
feeling, that however defective, in
their opinion, the present holders of
office may be in administrative
ability, they are actuated by a desire
to carry through honestly, and with
as little delay as possible, some use-
ful legislation. Again, we have
before the country a fairly liberal
programme. Again, it rests with
the Assembly to determine whether
the various important measures it
embraces shall be introduced, dis-
cussed, and perfected in Committee
by a deliberative body, or whether the
whole community shall suffer further
grievous injury by a repetition of
those attempts to embarrass the
Government of the day, which have
so often afforded theme for reproach-
ful comment.


We do not care, at this stage, to
express any opinion as to Mr. Far-
nell’s policy so far as he has yet
declared it. Suffice it that it em-
braces the introduction of measures
urgently needed, and frequently
postponed—how much needed would
probably be very unpleasantly shown
should the present drought continue
—that the Premier is credited with
a bona fide intention to adhere to
his programme, and that he has the
prospect, accorded to neither of his
predecessors, of a strong working
majority.
We entirely concur with the re-
marks of the hon. gentleman, in
reply to a deputation which waited
upon him on Wednesday last, urg-
ing the Government to bring in a
bill to remedy certain abuses in
connection with the laying out of
our streets, to the effect that piece-
meal legislation is always expensive
and generally ineffective.
If only one large question—the
sanitary condition of the city, for
instance, be but dealt with thoroughly
and provided for by legislative enact-
ment, we shall at last have a session
not barren of results, and shall have
cause for congratulation that, after
the constant shuffling to which the
Legislative pack of cards has been
subjected, a hand has turned up
capable of making a score by honours
and not by odd tricks.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
All honour to Mr. Farnell ! May
his Government be strengthened !
We have at last a promise of sani-
tary legislation ! We will not make
apology for this outburst of grateful
feeling; but, without further digres-
sion, resume our observations at the
point where we stopped last week—
the influence of increased population
and overcrowding of that popula-
tion.
We learn from high medical
authority, that the mischievous con-
sequences of overcrowding, in warm
climates, are largely in excess of
such conditions in the climate of
Britain; and we do not need the
illustration of the recent suicide,
who was said, by the jurymen, to
have killed himself as an escape
from the misery of the wretched
attic in which he was lodged, to
satisfy us that there is much truth
in the statement.
It is well known that by means
of diffusion (admixture with fresher
air) poisonous gases lose much of
their power; were it not for this
diffusibility we should inhale what
we exhale, and be poisoned very
speedily; diffusion is assisted by
wind, by the currents of air which
in a cold climate are drawn, literally
sucked in, to our rooms, by the
greater heat within doors; but in
this climate diffusion by these means
is much slower and less perfect, un-
less there be a breeze blowing, and
we admit its life-giving influences.
We believe that more change of the
air of a room is obtained, in Britain,
by the crack under the door of a
room with a fire burning in it, than
in this colony with a window open.
If we be not in error in this opinion,
how baleful must be the lodging of
many ol our countrymen in Sydney,
as pourtrayed in the reports of our
Commissions !
Do our Legislators think that
they are breaking the backbone of
our young country by permitting
the continuance of the se horrors ?
or will they, one and all, lend help-
ing hands to a legislation which,
based on the experience and prece-


dent of tlie mother country, shall
take the control of unhealthy pro-
perty out of the hands of present
shameless landlords ?
What has become of the Model
Lodging House of which, some
months ago, promises were made to
us ? We were told that the Health
Society had devoted a sum of money
to the endeavour to place a scheme
before the public, and that a well-
known and philanthrophic broker
had volunteered his services, for
love of the cause, to endeavour to
float it; have the emanations
from “ Sleepy Hollow ” closed
the eyelids of the Health Society’s
Council *? lulled to repose the activity
of Mr. Mullens'? or do one and all
agree that it is impossible to rouse
Sydney people to anything but the
pursuit of the mighty dollar ?
We trust such enquiries may find
better replies. We have men
among us who have laid down very
large sums for objects not of higher
claims than this ; we have seen a
noble gift of a thousand pounds
sterling by one of them, who has
thus shown that the keen pursuit of
commerce has not dulled the sense
of benevolence, and that Pea-
bodies are not confined to the anti-
podes !
Melbourne has set us the ex-
ample, and shown that, in despite of
the high prices prevailing there, a
Model Lodging-House can be con-
structed, and maintained, to pay
about seven per cent, to the share-
holders. We propose, in our next
to give some particulars of this
truly Model Lodging-House.
The condition of our Schools,
public and private, for both sexes,
in regard to requisite cubic space,
is, we believe, in the majority of
cases very deficient. We have heard
of an excellent school in which
twelve scholars, approaching adult
age, sleep in a room about 22 feet
by 15 —that the fire place is
habitually blocked up by a piece of
furniture, and that the windows,
opened by stealth, are closed by
authority when found open, to
prevent colds. This, and similar
overcrowdings, are some of the
results of increased population,
increased wealth, increased thirst for
education, coupled with that thirst
for cheapness which makes our
coats of shoddy and thickens up
our shirts with China clay !
THE RETURN.
To the home of my childhood in sorrow
I came,
And I fondly expected to find it the
same—
Full of sunshine and joy—as I thought it
to be
In the days when the world was all sun-
shine to me.
Those scenes were unaltered by time, and
I stood
Looking down on the village half hid by
the wood;
That happy abode, where I used to
possess
A father’s affection, a mother’s caress.
To others these scenes are as bright as
before,
But I can rejoice in their brightness no
more ;
I stand in the home of my childhood
alone,
For the friends of my childhood are all
of them gone.
’Twas joy shared by others, the laugh and
the jest,
That gave to the place all the charms it
possessed |
And here, the remembrance oppresses me
most
Of all I once valued,—of all I have lost.
ALPHA.


A GOSSIP WITH THE BOYS.
A sensation packet is, as you all
know, a gaily done up parcel of
lollies, which may (or may not) con-
tain a sum of money, varying in value
from a threepenny bit to a golden
sovereign. Your attention is called to
the fact of the sensation packet by
advertisements, by hand-bills, and by
the canvassing energy of honey-tongued
individuals, who point out to you at
the circus, or in the theatre, or on
board the excursion boat, that, by
investing one shilling, you will secure
its full value in first-class sweetmeats
plus the next thing to a certainty of
obtaining a money prize. “ All prizes,
no blanks, only one shilling, and, what-
ever happens, a choice parcel of deli-
cious confectionery ! Will you take
one, sir ?” The appeal is, in an
immense number of cases, a success-
ful one, and our canvasser reaps his
reward. Supposing you lads, now that
Black Monday has passed, were to
seize the opportunity of your all being
back again at school (and so, easy to be
assembled in mass meeting), were to
convoke an assembly of boys with the
view to obtain some statistics about
sensation packets and the sale thereof.
Let us imagine an assembly so con-
voked, and, say, two hundred boys
attending it —Smith, Major , in the
chair. How many of those two hun-
dred boys will have had actual holi-
day experience of the sensation packet ?
Will it be too much to assume that
seventy-five did, at some period or
periods of the vacation, buy four
packets a-piece ? That would repre-
sent the purchase of three hundred
packets, requiring an expenditure of
£l5. If such of these lads who had
won a half sovereign by their venture
were to be asked to hold up their
hands do you think more than two
would ? We don’t. Let us say two,
however. How many found a five
shilling piece in their packet ? For
argument’s sake let us say three. And
let us also presume that the other win-
ners of cash-prizes were five who got
half-crowns, ten who got shillings,
fifteen who got sixpences, twenty who
got threepences, and a hundred and
twenty who got pennies. You are
smiling, because, practically, you know
that we have estimated the winners at
far too high a number. Never mind !
our object is to show that, even with
such a number of winners, the £l5
expended covered all outlay on the
part of the vendors, and left them a
handsome profit to boot ; and that
you seventy-five buyers have, in
reality, paid through the nose for
your sensation packet. Look at this
financial statement :

tising of 300 packets 1 5 0

PROFITS, OVER 40 PER CENT 4 2 6

We hope you begin to see now that the
sensation packet is a gambling swin-
dle ; and that every time you invest a
shilling you are entering into a specu-
lation in which the odds are about a
hundred to three against you—that,
in other words, when purchasing sen-
sation packets, you are playing ducks
and drakes with your money, and the
fool with yourselves. Some may say,
perhaps one of the two younkers who
touched for the half-sovereigns
“ Never mind, let those laugh who
win !” But, even presuming that you
who have just spoken only invested
one shilling—that you secured your
prize, as it were, at the first throw—
do you think it gentlemanlike (we will
not say a word about honesty)—do
you think it gentlemanlike to make
up a little purse at the expense of your
confectioner ; or if, as is most likely,
he declines to play godfather to you,
at the expense of a lot of people, boys
and girls, with a great many of whom
you would not be seen walking on the
same side of the street. Let those
weep, not laugh, who win, as you,
young fellow, have won ; for, the


chances are, that “ win ” may have
whetted your appetite for gambling.
If it have, God help you ! Let
those rather rejoice for whom “sem-
per damnosi subsiluere canes ” —those
whose shillings went, and brought
back nothing but lollies. To become
rich at a leap how nice ! you say.
But sudden wealth is not always
nice. Mammon sometimes throws
“ a cruel sunshine on a fool,” heaps
wealth on him, but not the wit how
either to spend it or keep it. Lollies
are good things in their way, so
are half-sovereigns. Seek to come by
both an you will, but 1 as gentlemen
should. Say, with Browning’s hero—
“ Ne’er shall boat of mine
Adventure forth for gold and apes at once.”
Buy your apes with your own gold,
and seek to win your gold by the exer-
cise of your own wit, skill, or dexterity.
Trust not to chance. Nec Babylonios
tentaris numeros : you needn’t, because
“ the aids to noble life are all within.”
Esquiros tells us that “ the Esqui-
maux sometimes enclose a coiled piece
of whalebone in a lump of blubber,
which the bear greedily swallows, the
whalebone afterwards uncoiling and
killing him.” Don’t you swallow the
tempting bait set before you by the
sensation packet vendor. The blubber
shrouds a snare ! Buy, and you either
lose money like a fool, or win it to
your honor’s detriment ; and, as we
take it, you Australians are not cut
out either for fools or charlatans, but
are meant to “ bear without abuse the
grand old name of gentleman ’ ; and
So should have no dealings with money
you have neither inherited nor earned.
We were asked, the other day, to
explain what capping verses might be.
Capping verses is a very old amuse-
ment, consisting, in two or more per-
sons racking their brains, exercising
their memory, and straining their in-
genuity and wit to quote verses in
this kind of fashion : A. starts oft with
a line from, say Johnson’s well-known
line—
“ If the man who turnips cries .”
B. must now follow with a line com-
mencing with s, the final letter of the
verse first quoted by A. ; that is to
say, B. must cap A.’s verse, which he
does thus, quoting Akenside—
“ Seeks painted trifles and fantastic toys."
C. has now to follow with a line also
beginning with s, the final letter of
B.’s quotation. Remembering his
“Art of Politics,” C. caps B. with
“ Say , Mr. Speaker , shall we shut the
door V'
This leaves D. the task of coming after
with a line beginning with r. Reflect-
ing for an instant, D. dashes off with—
“ Regardless of the siveeping whirlwind's
sway.”
This nonsense stanza will then
read—
If the man who turnips cries
Seeks painted trifles and fantastic toys,
Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the
door,
Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind’s
sway?
The above is the simplest kind of
capping. A more difficult, though
more finished style, is for the cap to
be made, not on the final letter , but on
the final word of the last quoted verse.
The maximum of ingenuity and mne-
monic power is of course demanded
when, in addition to the cap haying
to be made on the final word, the lines
are required to rhyme, and a kind of
logical connection is expected in the
sequence of the verse. When memory
fails, a happy fraud may occasionally
be perpetrated by endeavouring to
pass off an extemporaneously “made-
up” verse as the product of Tennyson,
or Mrs. Browning, or other star in the
galaxy of poetic fame.
We shall be, at any time, glad to
receive contributions of well-capped
verses _of the last-mentioned class
Especially.

RED-HANDED MURDER.
11 There’s that brute in the garden
again. Here, Tiger, hold him”—and
away would go the entire available
offensive force of the establishment,
boys and dogs, in hot pursuit of the
daring intruder—an old black nanny-
goat, the most obstinate and shameless
of her sex, who was literally our bete
noire.
She was in and out of the garden at
all hours, and would do more mischief
in five minutes than could be repaired
in a month. Nothing came amiss to
her. She would breakfast on cabbages,
dine off geraniums, and sup on passion
fruit; the brute was omnivorous.
She was cunning, too, and artful to
a degree. The stealthy way in which
she would make her entrance through
some weak place in the fence, the
rapidity with which she would com-
plete the work of destruction, and her
alertness in retreating the moment the
alarm was sounded, were positively
astonishing, and could only have been
acquired by long practice. Whether
her accomplishments in this direction
were the result of early education, or
from an inherent love of pilfering,
which made stolen flowers the sweetest,
or whether in later life she had been
led by the force of example to acquire
a taste for garden produce, which she
was unable to overcome, I leave others
to determine. Certain it was, she was
an adept in the art of foraging, and
that she kept herself fat and sleek
solely by plunder.
Time after time she had been caught
while engaged in these nefarious prac-
tices, and subjected to punishment of
various kinds. She had been beaten
with whips, rods, and broomhandles;
she had been pelted with stones, brick-
bats, and bottles; had been chased
round the paddock by kangaroo dogs •
caught and thrown bodily over the
fence ; kerosene tins and other impedi-
menta had been tied to her tail ; and
on one occasion, when she had ’been
taken in flagrante delicto, after receiv-
ing three dozen on the bare back, she
had been ignominiously ejected from
the premises, with a board dangling
from her neck, on which the word
thief was printed in large letters.
But none of these punishments
seemed to have any effect upon Nanny.
She had no regard whatever for the
rights of property. Meum and tuum
were to her synonymous terms. In
short, she was lost to all sense of
shame or decency, and trusting to the
gifts which Nature had bestowed upon
her—a quick ear, a great turn for
speed, and a tolerably tough hide, she
continued to trespass with comparative
impunity, now in one garden, ilow in
another, indulging in a great variety
of esculents, and leading a life of stolen
pleasure and excitement.
Our garden had suffered especially
and we were proportionately irate;
but a sense of justice impelled me, be-
fore proceeding to extremities against
this noonday robber, to effect a tho-
rough repair of the fence. It was
clearly my business to render it im-
possible for any goat, hdwever agile
to enter my premises. So I took
great pains to close every aperture so
that no amount of butting could loosen
a paling or dislodge a rail ; and that
night we trimmed and watered our
plants with a sense of ownership we
had not experienced for some time.
But we had underrated the cunning
of the enemy. No sooner had Nanny
discovered that her usual modes of
entrance were not available than she
adopted altogether different tactics.
Barly in the morning she took up her
position at the front gate, and when
the butcher came for orders, she
slipped m behind him, and in half a
minute was at her old work again.
Ihis went on for some little time, and
although we at once formed a vigilance
committee, composed of every member
of the family, scarcely a day passed
without some fresh proof of the enemy’s
presence in the shape of floral destruc-
tion.
At last we could stand it no longer •
and one morning, when old Nanny was
detected, standing on her hind legs, and
devouring with great enjoyment the
young shoots of a creeper, which we
had taken great pains to train over


some trellis work, a council was held
and sentence of death formally re-
corded against her.
Now, although I considered myself
perfectly justified in inflicting capital
punishment in this instance, I am a
humane man, and I desired that the
extreme penalty should be carried out
with as little suffering as possible. To
take the life of an enemy, who was
not to be deterred from open aggression
by any other punishment, seemed jus-
tifiable as an act of self-defence, but
anything like cruelty or bloodshed was
abhorrent to me. So I turned over in
my mind the various modes of destruc-
tion which would apply to the case in
hand.
It had happened, some weeks before
this, that two or three suspicious
deaths had occurred among the rabbits
kept by my youngsters, and I had
purchased a small quantity of strich-
nine, and put a few grains of it into
some pieces of raw meat, which I
placed on the ground near the rabbit-
hutch. The result was the discovery,
on the following morning, of three
large tom-cats lying cold and stiff
within a few yards of the spot where
the baits were laid. They appeared
to have died almost instantaneously,
and there was nothing about them
after death which indicated that any
especial suffering had been experi-
enced.
Poison, then, was the weapon which
I determined to use to effect my ob-
ject, and accordingly I procured a fur-
ther supply of that destructive agent.
At the chemist’s where I obtained it,
I had to write my name down in a
book, in which I stated that I bought
the poison for the destruction of
vermin.
I repeat that I am very tender-
hearted, and especially so towards
dumb animals. Dogs and children
always make friends with me at once,
and I never had a horse with whom I
was not on the best terms in a week’s
time ; their instinct, I suppose, en-
abling them to detect my soft-hearted
disposition.
Judge, then, whether I was a man
likely to commit a cold-blooded murder
under circumstances of brutal atrocity.
I even felt very tender at the last
moment towards the object of my ven-
geance, remembering how often I had
chivied her round the paddock, and
the number of blows and hard words
she had received from each member of
my family, and how kindly she had
taken her gruel. I almost felt inclined
to let her free, thinking it almost a
shame to sacrifice, for the sake of a
few perishing flowers— or, as one of the
poetical contributors to Once a Week
would call them, “ flowerets,” for they
never, thanks to Nanny’s exertions,
reached maturity,—a creature possess-
ing such powers of endurance, fertility
of resource, such persistent resolution,
such an unfailing appetite, and such
rare organs of digestion.
But sterner feelings succeeded, and
I prepared the fatal morsel which was
to end her lawless career. Thinking
that, as the deed had to be done,
’t were well ’t were done quickly and
quietly, I led the unfortunate victim
to a shed at the back of the house,
and then, having given her a piece
of bread containing about as much
strychnine as would have killed twenty
cats, and having seen that she swal-
lowed every morsel of it, I shut the
door in her face, and left her to chew
the cud of bitter reflection.
Next morning I rose early, with the
intention of digging a deep hole in the
garden, for what purpose the reader
may imagine. But, upon opening the
door of the shed, I found, instead of
an inanimate corpse, Nanny herself in
the enjoyment of perfect health, with
an eye as bright as ever, and an appe-
tite evidently sharpened by confine-
ment. To rush back to the house,
and to return with the remainder of
the strychnine was but the work of a
minute, and in another minute Nanny
had bolted it, bread, poison, and all,
licking from the palm of my hand a
few grains that were spilt out of the
paper. I waited another hour, and
finding that the only symptom mani-
fested by the condemned criminal was


a strong desire to escape, in order to
breakfast off my cabbages, I went over
to the house of a neighbour and bor-
rowed a Colt’s revolver, determined to
make short work of the job.
I then took the goat out of the shed
and tied her up to the fence. In doing
this, I was actuated by motives of
humanity. I wished to avoid the pos-
sibility of failure. I was anxious to
effect my end, or, strictly speaking,
Nanny’s end, by one well directed
shot, which should cause as little pain
as possible. Holding the pistol, there-
fore, close to the animal’s ear, I fired.
The bullet went clean through her
skull, and the blood streamed out.
The only effects of this shot were a
convulsive effort on the part of my
victim to climb over the fence to which
she was tied, and a series of the most
horrible bellowings I ever heard. I
felt myself a murderer, and to end the
tragedy with all haste, I fired a second
barrel at the animal’s head, making a
second hole through the forehead, at
right angles to the other : result, more
blood, and a good deal more bellow-
ing, and a still more determined effort
to leap the fence.
Was ever a tender-hearted human
being placed in a more distressing situ-
ation ? I can hardly describe the feel-
ing of shame, horror, and regret which
overcame me. Here was I caught red-
handed in the commission of a cold-
blooded murder, my victim, mortally
wounded but not dead, piercing the
air with heart-rending cries enough to
arouse the whole neighbourhood. To
this day I can scarcely look at a goat
without a feeling of blood-guiltiness.
Determined to put the poor wretch out
of her misery, I snatched up a club
and belaboured its head. I then
dragged it to an abandoned shaft, about
thirty feet deep, and threw it down
into the water. It was not dead then,
and I cannot positively state that it is
dead now, but if not, its tenacity of
life must be wonderful.
No goats get into my garden now ;
but if they did, I should not have the
heart to inflict serious bodily harm
upon them, whatever damage they
might do, looking back to Nanny as
the scape-goat—except that she did
not escape—for all the sins of her
tribe. Vegetable poisons, it seems,
will not kill a goat, and Colt’s revolvers
are at best but ineffective weapons.

THE COMIC PAPERS.
THE NOSE MACHINE.
Thebe was a young noodle named Green,
Who bought a nose-changing machine,
And altered his nose
As occasion arose,
Till you couldn’t tell what it had been.
When he read that of old there was no
man
So feared and respected as foeman,
Or honoured at home
As a hero of Rome,
Said he, “ Hang it, here goes for a
Roman! ”
But this nose he found every she shun,
As a highly obtrusive adhesion,
Till one night, as he rode
Near Conquest’s abode,
It struck him at once—‘ ‘ Try the
Grecian! ”
“A mistake” soon that change he was
dubbing,
There was nothing for holding or rubbing,
And his friend and his foes
Got condemning the nose,
Till he said, “ A snub’s better for
snubbing.”
“ Why, a man were deserving a halter,
Who to change his proboscis should
falter,”
Said this valorous Green
And new noses were seen,
Till at last there was nothing to alter.
And our story this moral discloses,
There is reason in altering noses ;
And a man may erase
Every trace from his face
Of a prominence worthy of Moses.

A KISSING BEE.
“ Kissing” would be an odd heading for
a column of a sporting paper. Yet a
kissing match has lately come off in
France, and been duly reported. It


ended as disastrously as that game when
“ Cupid and Campaspe played at cards
for kisses.” A youth undertook to kiss
his lady five thousand times within four
consecutive hours, or to pay her five
francs in lieu of each kiss not given.
This was the result: First hour, one
thousand six hundred; second hour,
seven hundred. After this, though the
young fool kept on for an hour and a
quarter, the salutes were few and far
between, for his lips were so swollen
that he could not form them, and he left
off, the lady’s debtor in one hundred
pounds. Moreover he fell into a fever,
and had to submit to an operation which
should have been performed much earlier
—that of having his head shaved! It is
sad work when it comes to counting
kisses—does not the proverb warn us not
to kiss and tell ?

USEFUL HOUSEHOLD RECIPES.
Stewed Rabit.— Take your stew, baste
it well for an hour, then stir in a couple
of rabbits; season with cuniberchoke
sauce, and garnish with slices of sipple-
wish cut square ; serve hot.
Moo Cow Pie. —Get a moo cow; peel
and slice ; have your pie ready, and put
your moo cow inside of it, with a
thickening of marrow hammel gravy.
Baa Lamb Cutlets.-— Make your cut-
lets, and lay them one by one in strong
baa lamb * sauce; flavour with snaffle
rack parings, and serve luke-warm.
Chef “Sauce.” —Go into the kitchen
just before a dinner party, and offer to
teach the sixty-guinea cook how to dish
up cabbage.
Puff-paste. —Pour about half a pint
of pure distilled water into the powder-
box, and work it gently round with the
puff until it is done. This paste is par-
ticularly grateful to the ladies.
Bilgewater Pomade.— Rub old planks
with lamb-fat until the cream rises to the
surface. Then melt some fresh bilge-
nuts and whisk them steadily into your
cream. A little scent, such as Carry-
chumble or Petowkery, will much improve
this pomade.
Cure for the Toothache. — Tie up
the face in lint and apply a red-hot poker
gently to the nerve. In a short time a
grateful sensation of warmth will be
felt in the lower extremities, and then
the tooth must be promptly extracted.
The same poker will do any number of
Charm for Snakes In Your Boots.—
Dissolve frog-fits in a solution of stomach-
pumps, and add a quart of marrow-
spasms. Shake the mixture well, and
filter it through gaggleblotz lining. After
a few days a thick film will appear on the
surface; this must be tied up in muslin
bags and put into your bed at the full of
the moon.
Startling Stanzas (for music).
(N.B. —The air can he obtained in any
key—except a latch-key.)
The murm’ring moonbeams their music
are mixing;
The wandering wombat is watching the
wave;
The frolicsome frog his finances are
fixing,
And the grasshopper gropes in his
grandmother’s grave.
Yet dark are the dangers and doubts that
distress me
A horrible heaviness hangs on my
heart;
Come, Caroline, come, calm, console, and
caress me,
And tickle my taste with a turnover
tart.
Then vanish, ye vain and voluminous
vapours,
That buzz in my bosom, and bother my
brain;
Or promptly I’ll publish your pranks in
the papers,
And lay up my lute till I’m lucid
again !

Why should I with wine take pet,
Who have such examples set;
Give me wine, punch, rack, October—

HOW I WENT TO QUEENSLAND.
A FIRST BRUSH WITH THE BLACKS.
In the year of grace 1858, I was sent
for ; yes, and sent for, too, by a
Minister of the Crown.
The Canoona rush had broken out,
and a township, which has since deve-
le lar g e an d thriving town
of Rockhampton, was to be laid out
Surveyors were wanted, and I, having
just passed, was sent for, to be one of
three who were to start next day by
the old “ Wonga ” (now the hulk at
Pyrmont), Captain Walker. The last
point of hesitation vanishing, by the
gallant old minister, whose style of
speech is well known, and who is still
to the fore, saying, “ Well, all I can
say is, you re a fool if you don’t. ”
As good as £550 per annum, six
men s wages, and a bonus of £3O •
more money than I had ever had since
the ever-to-be-remembered gold in-
crease-caused me to say “Yes.” Then
fr 1 w^T7 hurry skurr y to be ready for
the “Wonga.” They were rowdy
“P th er e just then, which
nothmg but Captain (now Sir Maurice)
O Connell s tact and fearlessness before
a mob armed with picks and shovels
to break into the Government
stores, had prevented from developing
into a not ; so our district surveyor
was ordered to be sworn in a beak,
while myself and confrere (a man, by-
the-way, who could drink more pale
brandy at a sitting and keep his head,
than at that time I had ever seen )
were ordered to present ourselves to
Captain M‘Leier and be sworn in
special constables. Now, I had been
a kind of sucking J.P. myself—my
uncle was a P.M.—and constables used
to touch their caps to me from a boy
so I skirked that part of it as perfectly
out of the question. What could
Ministers have been thinking about to
expect such a thing l Thus we ifhet on
board the “ Wonga,” and never shall
l iorget my mate’s apparition. As I
leant over the bulwarks looking at the
excitement on the wharf, who should
I see, busy as the devil in a gale of
wmd, but R——, in a shiny silk bell-
topper, dress coat down to his heels,
i satin waistcoat, black continuations
and, to crown all, his legs stuck into a
pair of huge jack boots up to his hips
struggling with bales of tents, cases of
red triangle brand, and preserved
potatoes, &c.,— for he meant to live
well and, I suppose, astonish the
blacks with his toggery-as he had us.
Well, we reached Keppel Bay, and
taken, bag and baggage, up to
ttockhampton in the u Samson.’*
The work of surveying the town
jommenced at once, and we soon had
he plans out for the first land sale of
he future city. I will just pay a tri-
>ute of kind and pleasant remem-
>rance to many old friends, some now
tassed away, and pleasant days and
Lights spent in their society in the
ood old times. I remember a big
ent on the river bank, where we used
0 ?P end some ha PPy evenings, and the
alls of a mud house, that was to have
een the coolest house in the world
ut which never got any further •
s, the collector of customs’ tent,
nd the nice gentlemanly young fellows
e met at his mess dinners—Cloete the
fid commissioner, and H— ’the
isistant commissioner, and all the fine
rang fellows from Grasmere ; and now
will pass on to my first “ brush with
e blacks. ”
Weii, I was camped on the opposite side
the Fitzroy to the town, down near
’cher’s heifer station, when one day
T cook announced that he had seen
icks dodging behind trees near in an
unous manner, armed with spears
d no gins with them (a bad sign).
1 had no intention that any bone of
ne should form a “ devil ” for a
tck-felWs supper, I sent off directly
old J. M—-, of the native police,
i terror of the Dawson River blacks
inform him that I did not feel
ictly m a comfortable frame of
id, m fact, had visions of an unc-
us blackfellow corrobboreyincr on
kidney fat. My note was answered
John himself and eight troop-
; the tracks were found, and away
lt these sleuth hounds ("Murray
r boys, most of them) from whom
:e is no getting away. I will just


describe the way in which native police
go into action : their uniform of blue
and scarlet is discarded, also boots,
and nothing is insisted on but shirts
and caps, to distinguish them from the
Myalls, or wild blacks, carbines and
ammunition, of course. These fellows
will follow a mob of blacks for days,
till they come up with them, and, when
once close to the trail, or in sight,
their officers loose all control over
them, so keen is their thirst for their
brother blackfellows’ blood ; in this
case we followed down the rises alter-
nately in boats, and tracking on
shore, till night, when we camped in
the mouth of a blind creek running
into the river, among the tall reeds,
waiting for early morning to attack
the blacks, who were camped in a
scrub about a mile lower down. Never
shall I forget the beauty of the scene,
—a broad river nearly a mile wide,
just wind enough to blow away the
mosquitos, a bright tropical moon, and
I moored off in my boat, pipes in full
play, and yarning as only bushmen
can, the troopers on shore restless, and
peeping over the bank every now and
then, and smoking too. In the night
we were woke with a shout, some-
thing had startled the boys, and what
should it be but a cloud of “ fireflies ”
that had been disturbed by one of
them : they rose en masse from the
tall reeds, and their brilliant light had
caused a fear that the Myalls were
on us, but it was a beautiful fairy-like
scene as these tiny little lamp-lighters
dispersed themselves into space. At
dawn the first greeting from the scout
was, “ Maimy black fellow close up.”
Off we went on the tracks, the boys
went clean away from us in the race,
and the first thing we heard was —
bang, bang, bang, in the scrub on the
edge of which the blacks had, as is
their practice, camped ; when we got
up, all within reach of the carbines had
fallen, and it remained only for the
officer to take official memorandum of
of the fact. No women ever suffer in
these encounters ; so there sat the gins
quite carelessly, while a tally was taken
of four savages who had kissed mother
earth, and while the wretched mangy
curs, which infest blacks’ camps, lost
the number of their mess. But, look 1
What is that black spot bobbing, half
way across the river ? ü ßy George,
it’s a blackfellow, swimming for his
life !” Without a word the troopers
had my boat, which my men had
drifted down the river with—a white
curved built captain’s gig, and very
fast. In they tumbled, carbines and
all, all in a heap, seized the oars, and
Old Nick could not have stopped them.
A race for life, now ; the black has
seen the movement, and, redoubling
his efforts, rushes through the water
like a startled water-fowl. The oars
bend ; they gain on him—no, they
don’t ! See! the fellow in the bow,
with the carbine, takes as steady an
aim as he can for the motion of the
water ! Bang comes over the water ;
we see the splash a long way this side,
and the exclamation breaks forth —
“ Poor devil, I hope he’ll escape after
that terrible swim !” Again the ex-
cited demon in the boat raises his car-
bine ; the poor fugitive is near a mile
off us now, and almost across. Can
he do it ? Can the poor wretch gain
the shore, and go off to the scrub on
the other side? The trooper judges
his distance, and, deeming it too far,
lowers his weapon ; he has only one
charge left, and must not waste it.
We are all excitement and anxiety,
after such a terrible race, that the
poor savage shall escape ; the tension
of feeling is almost too much. “By
Jove, he will!—he’s getting up the
bank ; we can see his black skin shin-
ing against the red clay of the steep
shore !” Ah, see !—a puff !—bang !
back he falls, and the waters of the
Fitzroy close over another of a race
fated to disappear before the enter-
prise of the white man.
“ ’Tis true, ’tis pitiful,” ’tis terrible
work—this man-hunting ; but this
officer —a genial, kind-hearted fellow
off duty—gave no mercy to the black-
skins. He had been at the scene of
that frightful Juandah massacre, on
the Dawson river, where every soul
on the station, but one lad —men,


ladies, and little children—had been
butchered and mutilated, with the
most fearful fiendishness ; and he had
vowed a fearful vengeance never to
spare a black-fellow.
It seems to be a war of races, and,
as an inevitable consequence, and in
verification of a law, the savage dis-
appears.

told him his sum was very well done.
Mr. Greenwood is an authority, for he
himself can do sums with much ease ;
can toss you off an omelette, a la statis-
tique, or roast you a piece de resistance,
absolutely bristling with figures, that
shall be digestible and toothsome.
But, even had Mr. Greenwood refused
the Treasurer his modicum of praise,
we feel sure the public wouldn’t ;
because the financial statement of Mr.
Cohen is clear, straightforward, and
intelligible. To reduce the expendi-
ture within economic limits, and to
consolidate the public debt are the two
aims of Mr. Cohen—aims which think-
ing men endorse, and which only the
factious can possibly take exception to.
On dit, that Mr. Lloyd is so struck
with the simple straightforwardedness
of the Treasurer’s statement that he
is going to send copies of it home, for
presentation to the alumni of his old
alma mater, at his own expense. Mr.
Farnell may be congratulated in hav-
ing selected so good a figure-head as
Mr. Cohen for the ship of State.

The Government are not going to
send an executive commissioner to
Paris. Can any one explain what were
the exact bearings of the Morris how-
d’ye-do ? Did he really want to go to
Paris ;or did he merely—as Mr. Holt
suggests—want to have the appoint-
ment offered him, that he might feel
himself honoured, and have the plea-
sure of refusing it ? He is not a horse
of that colour, is Mr. Morris ; yet,
for a cheap, handy way of compli-
menting a man, commend us to the
idea put forward by Mr. Holt—offer
a fellow something you know he can’t
accept, and so kill with the one stone
your two birds : butter your friend,
and save your cash.
Bravo, Mr. Speaker ! Let us hope
the rowdies of the Assembly now know
distinctly that you won't stand their
insolent larrikinism ; and, that if the
House will not insist upon your rul-
ing being obeyed, you will decline any
longer to be the mouthpiece of the
Commons. Perhaps you might have
taken this position earlier ; but better
late than never.
That Cooma hawker who took the
cheque, drawn by Osman Pasha in
favour of General Skobeloff, had evi-
dently forgotten that it was Osman
Pasha who received the check—though,
perhaps, in one sense, it may be said
to have been drawn in favour of
Skobeloft. With regard to such transac-
tions, “’ware, hawk-ers !” is appro-
priate advice.
Mr. Buchanan has forgiven Sir John
Robertson, who probably is, by this
time, perfectly aware that the letter
was forged. Was it right, though, for
the ex-Premier, in order to gratify an
excusable, but purely personal ven-
detta, to put in requisition the appli-
ances of the Government Printing
Office ? Were there no private firms
who could turn out lithographed far.
similes of a letter suspected to be
forged ?
On dit, that a vessel containing over
thirty tons of gunpowder has been
riding at anchor in Double Bay for the
last few days. Surely this is in breach
of the regulations in that case made
and provided, or, as Young Equity
would say, “or otherwise.’’
By all means let us have a Board of
Works. Why not? The English
Metropolitan Board of Works has
been in working existence over twenty-
two years : it drains, builds embank-
ments, aligns and widens streets, tests
gas and water companies’ action, main-


tains a fire brigade, lays down tram-
ways, cleans abattoirs, raises money
for educational requirements, and is
a very high and mighty body, indeed.
Its paid officers are the chairman, the
engineer, the superintending archi-
tect, the solicitor, the board clerk,
the accountant, the chief of the fire-
brigade, and, of course, the members
of the necessary clerical staff. In the
event of the establishment of a Metro-
politan Board of Works who cannot
picture to his mind’s eye the struggle
for the billets and the weariness of
the Premier in wading through the
pile of letters addressed to him by per-
sons, each one of whom presumes him-
self to be the one individual specially
designed by Providence for the Chair-
manship as Mr. Morris wasn’t for the
Executive Commissionership.
Look out for the annular eclipse to-
morrow evening ! The first contact
comes off at about 6'32 p.m. The last
contact comes off below the horizon,
so you needn’t trouble about that.
While referring to the eclipse the riddle
may perhaps be deemed apropos by our
younger readers : Why is a solar eclipse
like a mother thrashing her own bairn ?
Give it up ? Because it is a hiding of
the sun !
The dark side to the picture of this
week’s proceedings is the terrible colli-
sion, on the railway line, between two
goods trains, at Emu Plains, which has
resulted in the death of three employes
—John Egan and John Wiggins, en-
gine-drivers, and Herbert Brady, assis-
tant guard ; and the serious injury to
John Larkins, stoker, and Michael
Stephenson, driver, who are now lying
in the Sydney Infirmary, grievously,
but, it is hoped, not mortally hurt. A
verdict of manslaughter against George
Purdoe, the guard in charge of
the special up goods train was re-
turned by the coroner’s jury, at the
inquest held on Thursday last. Before
this verdict had been pronounced, and
while the inquest was proceeding, a
second accident occurred near the scene
of the first disaster, by which another
life was of a man named
George Bergan, also a railw r ay employe,
who was killed by some ballast trucks
passing over him at the Penrith engine
shed. Full particulars of these melan-
choly events will be found in the daily
papers.
Mr. Creswick is an artist of such
acknowledged merit, that words of
praise in a column of light gossip about
the wheels that are within the political
wheels, about the struggles for place,
about filthy boarding-house, about
wretched suicides, about this that and
the other thing that floats frothily on
the sea of rumour, will scarcely be
deemed complimentary. Yet we must
say this, that any one who w r ants to be
lifted out of himself—to forget for a
while the cares and troubles of daily
existence—to take a flight into the
mystic realms of poesy and art, should
go to the Victoria, and there see the
Jew whom Shakespeare drew, and
whom the creative talent of Creswick
conjures up before your eyes —the liv-
ing Shylock of th 6 past.
An hon. member of the first Queens-
land Legislative A ssembly, since decea-
sed, when rebuked for certain very—
to say the least —plain language
addressed in the house to an opponent,
remarked that he believed Parliament
was derived from two words—French,
'parler, to speak, and mens, your mind,
—a place to speak your mind in,
which he intended to do. Mr. Win-
deyer who speaks his mind after a
fashion, is expected of all others, to
unburden himself in choice and re-
fined language, but the University can
hardly be proud of their representative
after his speech on Mr. Stuart’s motion
of censure. If his utterances on that
occasion were a specimen of culture
and high-class oratory, commend us
to 1 ‘ uncultivated mediocrity ” and
common sense. Abuse is not argu-
ment, but it is sometimes amusing to
the audience, and within the walls of
our National Forum it is frequently
couched in such strong terms, that the
amusement is heightened by the
prospect of a free fight on the floor of
the house, such contest being, at times,
imminent between the member “with
a big belly and little brains,” and the


“ buzzing fly who never had any
intellect; ” or between the “ retired
land jobber accused of nefarious
practices,” and the “honourable
hound ” who has brought him to bay.
So the sea-serpent has at last found
its way into Australian waters. What
does this signify—a drought, or an-
other change of Ministry ? The mon-
ster appeared, early on Saturday morn-
ing off Shark Island, and made his bowto
a party of four gentlemen who were
fishing. Upon catching sight of the
strange visitor, two of the party seized
their oars and showed fight, where-
upon his snakeship retired about two
yards from the spot and paused to
take breath. (First round in favour
of the boat.) A terrific engagement
would probably have ensued, but that
the fishing party, remembering the
words of Job—“ Lay thine hand upon
him, remember the battle and do no
more.”—thought it advisable to haul
up the kellick and be off, leaving
s.s. master of the situation. It is a
curious fact, and worthy the notice of
naturalists, that this serpent, said to
be at least twelve feet in length, had,
unlike the deaf adder, an excellent
ear for music. One of the party
was playing a concertina in order
to give the fish time to bite, and
was halfway through the first bar of
that popular melody, “ My Willie is
on the blue sea,” when the serpent
popped his head and about six feet of
his body out of the water close to the
gunwale, evidently attracted by the
mellifluous sounds.
We learn, from the Newcastle Pilot,
that a Mr. Henry Thomas has recently
come quite unexpectedly into a for-
tune of two and a-half millions ster-
ling. It appears that he has been
found to be the rightful heir to the
Glenmorgan estate, in Wales, now said
to represent that respectable figure
in cash. The story, as abridged by
the papers, appears to contain all the
elements of romance. First, there is
the death of the elder brother, then
the sudden death of the next of kin,
then a claim to the estate by an im-
postor, then a series of enquiries for
the rightful heir by the family soli-
citor, who traces him to Australia ;
then the discovery of the reckless
individual in the hold of the steamer
“ Goolwa,” and his identification, by a
strawberry mark on his left shoulder,
as the long lost brother; and lastly,
his triumphant return to Wales, and
his escort, by rejoicing tenants, to the
Glenmorgan estate, to the tune of
“ See Johnny comes marching home.”
The incident is rare, and the materials
are not wanting for a good story.
Could not one of our contributors
work up these incidents into a sensa-
tional romance for publication in
Sydney Once a Week ? The tale
might be appropriately called
A Welsh Rare-bit.
It is absolutely necessary to take
things coolly while this weather lasts,
in whatever shape they may present
themselves. To do this you have only
to get home as quickly as you can,
carrying with you a good supply of a
certain paint, which must be rubbed
into your roof like Holloway’s Oint-
ment, when, “in spite of the fiercest
heat of a tropical summer,” you will
be, says an advertisement in to-day’s
daily, “cool as a cucumber” Why
not paint your hat with the refri-
gerating compound, and so carry about
with you, wherever you go, that feeling
of sang froid which is so desirable.
To paint the roof of your private resi-
dence would be to create a coolness
among your friends, which should only
be exhibited towards your enemies or
slight acquaintances ; or, why not
paint your head at once, and so do
away with the necessity of wearing a
hat \ Ladies might adopt this plan,
without disarranging that Article of
attire in any way, since it is now worn
at some distance from the head. But,
for our part, we must confess we have


no desire to receive cold looks from
the young ladies of our acquaintance,
and we prefer beauties without paint.
We notice that the Colonial Trea-
surer (Hon. E. Cohen) has called for
tenders for a vessel of 300 tons regis-
ter, which is to be converted into a
floating magazine. This is in view of
the expected arrival of a large quan-
tity of gun-cotton and other explosive
substances for the use of the Torpedo
Corps. We trust the hon. gentleman
will be successful, which he probably
will, as he has no doubt had a good
deal of experience in floating maga-
zines. We have had none, and we do
not find that our magazine goes off
with sufficient rapidity ; but that is,
probably, because it is not intended
for the reception of explosive sub-
stances like the Government vessel.
We shall, however, be glad to receive
tenders for the supply of 300 subscri-
bers to be registered on the subscrip-
tion list of
“ Sydney Once a Week.”

THE MYSTERY OF WISE-
MAN’S FERRY ROAD.
Chapteb I.
Touchstone. —Truly, shepherd, in respect of
itself, it is a good life; but in respect that
it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In re-
spect that it is solitary, I like it very well;
but in respect that it is private, it is a
very vile life. Now, in respect it is in the
fields, it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is
not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare
life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as
there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
against my stomach. —As You Like 11.
“If that isn’t water this time, I’ll write
myself down an ass, and an awfully thirsty
ass, too,” said George Caldecott to him-
self, as, for the two or three hundredth
time, he saw—or thought he saw—-stretch-
ing out right in front of him, a wide sheet
of water, fringed with reeds and in gentle
motion, as if ruffled by a passing breeze.
But, alas, once again was the poor
fellow deceived by mirage. On nearing
what he had, in the credulity which his
hopes had begotten, imagined to be reeds,
he found them to be nothing but a few
miserable tussocks, a little taller than their
fellows ; and that which he had so prayed
might prove water, turned ought to be
naught but dreary plain, such as he had
travelled over for miles—dreary, dreary
plain, hard as iron, dry as ashes, and
rough as a newly-metalled highway.
To follow the road was quite out of the
question, since to right and to left,
diverging here, there, and everywhere,
were roads, or rather tracks innumerable
—dray tracks, buggy tracks, mail cart
tracks (generally the best to follow, by-
the-bye, when you can pick them out),
countless tracks, all, however, seeming to
trend across the arid plain to where, far
on in the hazy distance, a belt of timber
loomed faint and gray.
There was nothing for it but to push
on w T earily. What pleasant fancies of
long cool drinks, quaffed out of mighty
pewters or brimming bowls ; of beer cup,
with the roasted crab and the floating
borrage bobbing up against your nose;
of pale ale, hight of Bass, cool, tonic,
and re-invigorant; of Badminton, not
over iced, seductively redolent of pleasant
vintages and spicy groves ; of old Octo-
ber, drained out of wooden jacks or
mighty horns in shady Kentish, copses ;
of pleasant May-Wein ; of foaming cider
—ah! what pleasant fancies cf deep,
deep draughts, taken in snug hostelries,
rushed through George Caldecott’s heated
brain, as, with the broiling sun pouring
down upon his head its vertical rays, he
plodded on steadily towards the distant
trees.
It was just about noon, and, at the
lowest calculation, there were twenty good
miles between Caldecott and his destina-
tion—the Yarramundra punt across the
Murray. One consolation and hope of
refreshment he had, and that was that the
belt of timber ahead of him marked the
line of a creek, on the banks of which
it surely would be possible to have a mid-
day “ bange,” and recruit exhausted
nature with a pot of tea.
George Caldecott, a tall, well-shaped,
vigorous-looking Englishman, of Saxon
type, ruddy, and fair-haired—his ruddi-
ness considerably toned down by exposure
to Indian and Australian suns was
dressed in simple digger fashion —slouch-
ing wideawake, blue shirt, white moleskin
trousers, and lace-up boots. Every arti-
cle, however, of this unpretending apparel
was well made, well put on, and well-


looking, He looked like a gentleman
who had put on diggers’ garb—not ex-
actly in masquerade, nor yet, perhaps,
quite in earnest. His swag, which was
severe in its neatness, was composed of
blue blanket, quart-pot, tomahawk, and
small, one-pointed pick, fastened in large
horse-collar fashion with natty leather
straps. It did not appear to contain much
—possibly a mere change of undercloth-
ing only. It betokened method in its
bearer ; and also seemed to indicate that
times were not utterly bad with him,
whatever might be his reasons for tramp-
ing across the weary plain, over which he
travelled with a steady, elastic step, that
had evidently been acquired in the bar-
rack-yard and camp.
Bathed in perspiration, half-blinded by
flies, George Caldecott pressed on. How
he cursed the mirage, which would persist
in deceiving him again and again ! How
thick the fancies followed one another of
calm, sequestered shade, of cool refresh-
ment ! Vain fancies, all! And yet how
often do we imagine convenient situations
for ourselves, futures whose scenes and
acts and dramatis persona; are so conform-
able in every way to our own desires, and
whose circumstances are always so apropos
to our own designs ; and, then, how quite
as often do we find, to our cost, those
pleasant imaginations as baseless, as arid,
and as mockingly deceptive as the disap-
pointing waters of mirage land ?
At last the trees were reached. But,
oh! such trees —such miserable apolo-
gies for trees ! How ever could the thin
line of those gnarled and wretched honey-
suckles have palmed themselves off to the
far-off wayfarer on the plains as a belt of
timber ? Never minding what they looked
like, nor gazing at them from any
aesthetic stand-point, George Caldecott,
with much practical mindedness, glanced
down the creek they so scantily fringed
to see if there was a chance of obtaining
water. A little to the left of where the
track he had followed crossed the creek
he espied a waterhole. The sight of it
dispelled all day-dreams. The appear-
ance of the water when he came up to it
was not enticing to the thirstiest of men,
oven bad it been accessible without wad-
ing through an edging of thick, cattle-
trampled mud. The wading (even had
the mud been deeper and thicker) would
not have barred George Caldecott’s passage
to the tepid fetid waters. A horribly
swollen carcase of a white heifer, dead
some four or five days, did bar it most
effectually. Bitterly disappointed, he
again ascended the banks, and looking
around him once again, this time with a
keener glance, was enchanted to observe,
some hundred yards or so from him, a
most umbrageous cherry tree. To its
grateful shade he pressed, carefully scru-
tinising the character of the creek as he
followed its meanderings. He made up
his mind to deposit his swag beneath the
cherry tree, have a few minutes’ spell, and
then, with his tomahawk and hands,
make an effort to put down a temporary
well in the sandy bottom of the creek.
He acted up to this resolve, and to his
huge satisfaction, his effort was crowned
with success.
He got some fairly drinkable water,
cool, and tolerably clear. Within five
minutes after striking it, he had a fire lit in
the bed of the creek, and his “Jack Shea”
on the fair way to a boil. The infusion
of a pot of tea was the next act; and
then George Caldecott set about realising
the position of the recumbent Tityrus,
enjoying his classic ease sub tegmine fagi.
It was close upon four o’clock in the
afternoon when Caldecott prepared to re-
sume his journey. He had about fifteen
miles more to travel, but he had at least
four more hours of light to do it in ; and
now that he was refreshed, and the in-
tense heat of the day was over, he felt
that he could do his three miles and a
half an hour without over-exerting him-
self.
Having harnessed on his swag, and se-
lected the most promising of the many
tracks which lay before him, he marched
on, with buoyant spirits, hugging the
happy belief that the latter end of his
day’s pilgrimage would be a vast improve-
ment on its beginning.
On he walked, trolling forth staves of
songs with his mellow voice, as befitted a
traveller so wholly free from care.
After a while the track appeared to be
growing less and less defined.
Still he walked on, confident that, even
if the precise track he was upon was not
the right one, the general direction of his
advance was towards his destination.
About an hour before sundown, the
road, such as by that time the track which
he had been following had become, led
out of the lightly timbered forest land he
had been for some miles passing through
into a little open plain, remarkable for
one lofty tree marking almost accurately
its centre.


On reaching this tree, George Caldecott
found beneath its mighty limbs a cattle
camp, whence radiated in all directions
an infinite number of faint tracks. No
sign whatever of road, though. He had
lost all indications of wheels for over an
hour. What was he to do ?
The question was this: Yarramundra
could not be more than six or seven miles
off, in a north-westerly direction ; would
it not be best to make straight across the
bush for it, guided by the sun, while its
light lasted, and then by the moon, which
would be up shortly after sunset ? To
return back on his tracks would be waste
of time and weariness of soul.
It was quite evident that a straight
tramp into the north-west was the right
thing. So, as there was no time for hesi-
tation or delay, George Caldecott, in the
clear, cool, delicious evening air, struck
out boldly across the plain, a little to the
north of west.
When out of the plain, which in wet
weather was a swamp, the country was by
no means an unpleasant one to walk
across. The grass was green and of quite
a tender freshness, shooting up luxuri-
antly from where on all sides round about
a recent bush fire had laid low the rank
and tangled herbage. Far extending,
inter-bran ching groves of shapely eucalypti,
with here and there patches of gum-dis-
stilling wattle and dark hued pine, formed
a landscape which, if not exquisite in its
beauty, was neither monotonous nor tame.
The country rose and fell in undulations,
neither too laboriously steep nor too tedi-
ously continuous in the same incline. It
was, in short, a very pleasant pastoral
country, only wanting more strongly-
marked characteristics to be picturesque.
When the sun set, George Caldecott
was still ignorant of his exact where-
abouts. Since leaving the “ one tree ”
plain he had struck no defined track.
The moon soon rose, and enabled him to
keep along pretty accurately in the direc-
tion he had chosen, and which he felt so
certain would bring him safe to his desti-
nation.
Another hour’s walking, and his posi-
tion was no one whit improved.
He resolved, therefore, to camp for the
night, and pursue the attempt to reach
Yarramundra punt on the morrow. Se-
lecting a smooth spot of sward, sheltered
by an acacia, he was soon at full length
on his blanket, watching the silenlfstars
through the interlacing branches over-
head. He had barely been camped an
hour before he heard quite distinctly the
measured blows of an axe or tomahawk,
Although the night was fine, and the
camping ground he had selected most
comfortable in many respects, Caldecott
was without the one thing necessary to
perfect comfort. He had no water, and a
couple of pipes had made him begin to
fancy another pot of tea. He therefore
struck his quarters, and made off in the
direction whence the cheerful sounds evi-
dencing the propinquity so some sort of
society or another proceeded.
Before he had walked a couple of hun-
dred yards, Caldecott was gratified with
the spectacle of a wiry-looking old man
—an “ old hand,” from the sole of his
bluchers to the natty little hexagon sur-
mounting his cabbage-tree hat—busily
engaged in chopping firewood beneath the
glimpses of the moon.
George Caldecott was close upon the old
fellow before his advent was noticed.
The greeting of “ Good evening, mate,”
coming as it did with unexpected abrupt-
ness, and from a position right to the
rear of the wood-cutter, somewhat startled
him.
“Good evening to you, if it’s not toe
late,” was the old man’s response, after a
brief interval of surprise, and rapid, but
keen, scrutiny of Caldecott’s personnel.
The scrutiny seemed satisfactory. To
Caldecott’s question—“ Can you put me
on the right track to the Yarramundra
punt, and give me a drink?” the wood-
cutter cheerily replied, “ In course I can,
the last I’ll do this blessed night, and the
other to-morrow morning; for I don’t
suppose you’ll mind, whoever you be, a
bit of supper, and a rough shake-down
at an old shepherd’s. Mind you, it’ll be
rough enough, for I’m not in regular
quarters, only in a bark gunyah ; but the
night’s clear, and I’ve lashins of grub.”
Caldecott was not long in making up
his mind to accept this offer of hospi-
tality. Whilst the shepherd had been
speaking, he had taken stock of him, and
come to the conclusion that the old fel-
low was a genial, though rough philoso-
pher of the old bush type—a hearty soul
who, despising the Persicos apparatus
and all accessories thereto belonging, had
a sound, practical faith in the restorative
value of a good feed and a long night’s rest.
By stopping the night he could easily
make Yarramundra by breakfast-time the
next day; and, even if he did not, what


was the odds ?—as Caldecott was wont to
say to himself whenever any event ran
counter to his fixed plans, and it became
necessary for him to find some excuse for
giving the go-by to his pre-arranged
programme. What’s the odds? It will
be all the same a hundred years hence!
So would he salve his easily-medicable
conscience, whenever an impulse led him
off (as was the case goodness knows how
many times a day) from the surveyed line
of duty into the pleasant side-paths where
one somehow feels to be more at one’s
ease.
“ Thanks, mate; I’ll stop, and glad to
do so, I can tell you. I’ve walked over
eight-and-twenty miles to-day, if I’ve
walked a rod.”
“ Which way have you come ?”
“ From Morley’s.”
“ From Morley’s! Why, man, you
have come out of your way. Well, never
mind, let’s chop this butt off, and then
we’ll go to the hut. ”
The old fellow soon had his back-log
cut. He then laid it over his shoulder,
and led off Caldecott to the gunyah,
which had been put up for a lambing sta-
tion on the further slope of the limestone
ridge, which gleamed before them in the
moonlight. As they neared the gunyah,
an old sheep-dog, with a few premonitory
yelps, ran forth to meet them, and, hav-
ing satisfied himself that the stranger’s
advent was approved of by his master,
followed behind them with dignified com-
posure.
“ Here you are,” said the shepherd, as
he threw down his load at the bark break-
wind, which served as fireplace and
entrance-hall to his lonely residence;
“put down your swag, and rest on my
bunk while I get you some supper.
There’s some tea in that billy, and that’s
a clean pannikin hanging on that piece of
hoop-iron.”
Having taken a long pull at some very
strong and sweet tea, which had been
slowly simmering on the embers since
sundown, Caldecott sat down on the old
fellow’s bunk, and made a mental ap-
praisement of the place and its surround-
ings. Everything about bespoke exceed-
ing neatness. There seemed to be a place
for everything, and everything appeared
to be in its place. The gunyah was formed
of several sheets of bark leaning against
a ridge-pole. At one end (the back) it was
closed ; at the other, it opened on to the
fireplace, in which—carefully banked up
—was an immense heap of soft, whitish-
grey ashes, from out of the centre of
which glowed a few red embers. Inside
the gunyah were two bunks—each made
of a sheet of bark, resting on logs of pine.
On one of these bunks the shepherd’s
bedding was neatly laid ; on the other
were a few roughly-dressed sheepskins.
Hanging from the battens, which sup-
ported the roof walls, were bags contain-
ing tea and sugar. Between the rafters
and the bark were carefully wedged
match-boxes, tins containing salt and
pepper, a pair of shears, two or three
books, and a bundle of cabbage-tree hat
material prepared for plaiting. From
under the bed peeped out the end of an
exquisitely fine ball of sinnet, evidently
the handiwork of a most accomplished
and artistic hatmaker. A bush safe, made
out of a flour bag, hung from one of the
poles which supported the roof over the
fireplace. A three-footed iron pot, a
frying-pan, a couple of baskets, a billy,
some tin plates, and a few pannikins com-
posed the remainder of the furniture
which met Caldecott’s scrutiny, and
helped him somewhat towards forming
an opinion of the character of his enter-
tainer.
It did not take the shepherd long to
place some corned mutton, some excellent
damper, and a pot of fresh tea before his
guest, who, in the light afforded by the
cheerful blaze of the fire, made a most
hearty supper. The shepherd, while
Caldecott was thus pleasantly occupied,
lit a slush lamp; and then (having first
donned his spectacles) sat down to the
perusal of one of Aimard’s novels. When
Caldecott had finished his meal, the
shepherd put down his book, took off his
spectacles, and said, “Well?”
“ Very well, indeed. I’ve had a rattling
good feed, and feel as right as ninepence. ”
“ That’s good. Did you call in at the
station ?”
“No,” said Caldecott; “I never saw
go much as a fence since I left Morley’s.
Who’s station is this on ?”
“Old Billy Reynolds’; him as they
call ‘ hungry Reynolds,’ and hungry ain’t
no word for him, the stingy hound ! He
keeps the hotel above the Yarramundra
punt, and is making money hand over
fist, yet he won’t let a poor devil have a
bite at any of his stations, if he can help
it. -You see, all this run belonged to
youifg Scrymgeour, him as came into his
property some three years ago. And


didn’t he go through it ?Oh no, not
just a little bit. He stopped at Reynolds’
- drank hisself to death there, a-shouting
and a-carrying on of top ropes, racing,
cock-fighting, and the like. Reynolds
shepherded him, and no mistake; while,
as for the daughter, Carrie Reynolds, she
strung him on to that degree the young
idiot never knew whether he was on his
head or his heels ; and then when the
drink and the d.t. had done their work,
it was found that Scrymgeour had died in
debt to old foxy, and that this run and all
the stock on it had passed into Reynolds’
hands. My word, he’s a regular nipper,
that’s what he is !”
“ What kind of a house does Reynolds
keep ?” asked Caldecott.
“An out-and-outer, and no mistake.
All the swells stop there. For all his
meanness, he knows the policy of flinging
a sprat to catch a mackerel. It’s none of
your rough shanties, but a place where
you can be lambed down respectable.
And its odd, too; he’ll give a hard-up
swagman the best in his house at the
hotel, while at the station yonder its a
strict rule to the superintendent —‘ a
pannican of flour and a growl for the
traveller.’ ”
“What about his daughter? Has he
any other children ?”
“ None besides her; and she ain’t a bad
un to look at, neither; but for keenness
in money dealings, if she don’t beat her
father may I be . Her mother’s a
real good sort, a kind-hearted, motherly
old girl as ever broke the world’s bread ;
but Miss Carrie takes after her father.
There’s a chance for some of you young
fellows. She’ll have coin. Why don’t
you have some more tea ? Make yourself
at home. I don’t care two straws for old
Billy, or his rules neither. Why do I
serve him, you’d say. Well, mate, he
knows a good shepherd, and is quite cute
enough to pay good wages to keep a good
one. I’ve been with him three years
come next Easter, and have no particular
fault to find with him, He gives me the
wages I ax’d for ; and if Ido knock ’em
all down when I goes on my spree, why
its as much my fault as his’n—and its
perhaps none the worse for me in the
long run, that it only lasts a couple of
days or so.”
“ Do you mean to say you let him lamb
you down regularly ?”
“ Regularly as the flowers in May.
The more fool I, says you ; but as you’ve
noticed, of course, I’m lame of one foot,
and it suits me best to stop in one place.
I don’t leave myself quite bare, and then
there’s my hats. I can knock out an
extra quid or two a month with them.
No! no! Billy suits me well enough,
him!
The old shepherd’s shrewd wrinkled
face was quite a study as he spoke of his
lonely life with its annual and inevitable
spree—to which he evidently looked for-
ward as a sheep may be supposed to anti-
cipate shearing time.
The grey hairs of the old man, and
general air of benevolence which per-
vaded his features viewed in connection
with the open book and the substantial
spectacles which lay across its pages, gave
to him the appearance of a venerable
Christian ruminating upon the sacred text
in the calm evening of a well-spent life.
No one would have taken him for a
graceless heathen, winding up another
day of a reprobate career. Yet so it was
Bill the Shepherd, if he did not believewith
the Italian poet, that there is no greater sor-
row in the world than the recollection o
happiness in time of grief, was quite
certain that there was hardly a greater
pleasure in the world than the recollec-
tion of past troubles in times of calm and
plenty. His delight was to meditate on
the past; not to regret it by any means,
but to recall the days when he had been
the most devil-may-care scamp of a time
when devil-may-care scamps were plenti-
ful ; and when the land (at least as much
of it as was known) was a hot-bed of sin
and immorality.
Only on his annual spree did Bill forget
that he was an old man, whom quiet
more became than indecent rowdiness.
On the second day of the spree, the great
day, Bill was “Flash Heywood”
redimvus , for by that nickname had he been
known in the early times when Macquarie
was pro-consul.
Is it quite fair to rip up Bill Heywood’s
past in this manner? Be he venerable
Christian or graceless heathen, he is at all
events exercising a hearty hospitality to
a stranger, and, after his creed and fashion,
playing the part of the honest fellow who
hailed from Samaria, and who didn’t go
by on the other side.
After some moment, of silence, occupied
by Caldecott in cutting up some tobacco
for a fresh pipe, Bill said abruptly to his
guest:—“lf it’s a fair question, mate,


what county of the old country do you
hail him ? ”
“ From Kent.”
“ What part ? Maidstone ways ? ”
“No, from Feversham side ; but I
know Maidstone pretty well, too. Are you
from that part of Kent ? ”
“Ay ! lad ; but not from your Kent. I
come from the Kent of fifty years ago,
I be old Hevwood’s son, him as rented
Squire Merton’s cherry orchard, that
sloped from the back of his old park
right down to the Medway. But, bless
me ! Squire’s dead . years ago ; dead and
mouldered away into dust years ere you
were born. So you’re from Kent, eh, lad ?
“ It’s many a day since I’ve seen a man
as knows ought about Medway banks.
Well, you’re welcome, that’s all I can say. ”
The coincidence of them both hailing
from the same country set their beards
a-wagging.
Caldecott and Old Bill talked far on
into the night. The cheery possums
were noisy in the trees. Heavy beetles
droned through the yellow air. The
sheep lay like a sheet of white on the
dark umber of their dusty yard. The
sheep dog lay before the embers, his head
between his paws, and with “ one eye’s
black intelligence” thrown back upon
his master, the lord of his faithful heart.
Yes! Caldecott and Old Bill talked
for hours—the latter doing the lion’s
share of the work. Forgetting the
chasm of years that intervened between
his age and his boyhood, and all of
action or suffering that chasm con-
tained—he went back to the hours when,
as a little lad, he wrought in his father’s
orchard, the happiest little cherry-picker
in the Shire of Kent.
It was about midnight, when the dog,
starting up suddenly, gave a low growl,
and ran outside the fire-shed.
Old Bill left the gunyah, and looked
towards his sheep. They had not moved.
Presently three notes of a low plaintive
whistle were heard from the ridge beyond
the sheepfolds. Bill, putting tips of the
first and second fingers of his right hand
upon his lips, gave out two loud shrill calls.
The sound of a horse going at an easy
canter was next heard ; and, before
Caldecott had time to ask any questions,
a darkfeatured powerful-looking man
flung himself from off the back of a
large-boned chesnut mare at the door of
the gunyah.

THE WAR NEWS.
Owing to the “ fault ” in the cable,,
and the consequent fact that our daily
contemporaries have had nothing to
publish about the progress of events
at the seat of war, we are in the position
of the knife-grinder—“ Story, God
bless you, we have none to tell you.”
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
We are always glad to receive con-
tributions in the shape of good tales,
local sketches, and humorous articles.
K. —Many thanks. Review in our
next.
K. M. S. —Declined with many thanks.
Albert. —Your handwriting is good, but
your orthography is defective. It
is hardly correct to say—“ Having
noticed in your first issue of this
magazine an algebraical sum. I
having ventured to do the sum, I
now submit it to you.” The answer
was given in our last number.
Sara C. —Botany street. We have not
been favoured by a visit from you.
An order to our jeweller empower-
ing you to select a pair of silver
earrings as a prize for the acrostic
published in our last number, awaits
you at this office
X. L. —Your composition contains
merit but is hardly up to the mark.
Try again.
Scribe. —Don’t repeat the offence. The
lines are very good, as they were
considered to be when written by
Moore about half a century ago.
C. W. —Once a month will be quite
often enough for your contributions.
A Subscriber. —No more on that head-
Blighted Hopes. —Your reflections are
too melancholy to find a fitting place
in the columns of such a lively pub-
lication as the “ Sydney Once a
Week.” We advise you to send the
essay, which is not destitute of merit,
to the “ Protestant Standard," or the
“ Australian Churchman .”

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —It is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter, which
consists of short original papers, written
in a light free style, and of a few extracts
from other publications. Its purpose is
to give its readers “ a good sixpenny worth
of literary pabulum, composed of ingre-
dients at once sparkling, amusing, and
original, and so arranged as to avoid a
suspicion of dulness.” Taken as a whole,
the magazine, which is edited by Mr. C.
H. Barlee, is a very creditable produc-
tion, as well to the publishers as to the
authors, and if conducted according to the
plan indicated in the few words above
quoted, it will be an acceptable addition
to our colonial literature.— S. M. Herald.
The Echo says:—lt is a very read-
able publication, and, while it cannot
aspire to rank as the equal of the
most popular English magazines, it de-
serves to find favour on account of the
local interest which attaches to its papers.
The original papers, of which there are
several, are written in a fight, easy style,
and with considerable ability. We should
like to see the magazine prove to be a
success, for the desirableness of building
up a respectable colonial literature will
hardly be denied by any one, and the
■establishment of a good magaziae is one
of the means towards that end. The
publishers, Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and
Co., are entitled to commendation for the
admirable way in which they have got up
the magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Country
Readers is the title of anew weekly, edited
by Mr.C. H. Barlee, issued from the Sydney
Press, which bids fair to secure a good
share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleasing
manner in which the various topics of the
day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house and an
agreeable companion to every reader.—
Southern Argus , (Goulburn.)
“ Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its
appearance in our city. It is edited
by Mr. Barlee, formerly a member of
the literary staff of the Melbourne Argus,
and a humourist of some note. .The
work contains sketches, tales, and articles,
along with the usual miscellanea of a
magazine. Judging by the contents of
the first number, we think the maga-
zine stands a better chance of succeeding
than many of those publications which
are born but to die, and which in some
cases are disgraceful to the literary efforts
of our city. —Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says:—The num-
ber is very readable, is well printed by
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and
contains a varied selection of original
and extract matter. We wish the
proprietor every success with his ven-
ture, and trust that his efforts will do
something more substantial to encourage
a taste for colonial literature than those
of others who have trodden in the same
uncertain path, have succeeded in doing.
We hail with pleasure all respectable
efforts to establish a republic of letters
in this colony, which at present is too
much confined in its patronage to
newspaper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s
venture is the best effort in this direction
that we have seen for some time. — Single-
ton Argus.
“ Once a Week.” —Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we under-
stand, assisted by a numerous staff of able
contributors. The contents of this new
publication are varied and interesting—
too varied, in our opinion, for the space
at the disposal of the editor. If we may
be permitted to offer a suggestion with
regard to the future, we would recommend
that everything in the shape of “ news ”
items should be omitted. We heartily
wish the proprietors success in their
undertaking, and certainly are of opinion
that the excellence of “ Once a Week”
well deserves it. —Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should, it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes
of every class of readers are consulted.
Thus we have a trenchant article, short
and pithy, on the political status in quo,
a couple of spirited domestic sketches,
some comic matter, and some chapters
especially intended for boys. Among the
last is a scholarly commentary on a
passage from the “ Paradise Lost,”—•
intended for the use of University candi-
dates—a clever set of recurrent verses m
Latin, and an enigma in French. The
palindrome and the enigma are an im-
mense improvement on the foolish ana-


grams and sphinx-like puzzles which
usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend
the production to parents. We hope the
new organ will enjoy a longer term
of existence than some of its pre-
decessors.—Namoi Independent.
This serial contains well written papers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health,” “ Muff Cricketing,” “ Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary of
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether
Once a Week promises well; and without
country readers (who will probably
support it best), the 170,000 residents of
Sydney should keep it going—but we
doubt it. The price is 6d., and the
publishing office 279 George-street,
Sydney. Molong Express.
Once a Week. —This is the title of a new
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as enter-
tained, with the writings ; there is such a
versatility about them that all must be
pleased. It is notified that a summary
of the events of the present war will be
given for the accommodation of its
readers, and so do away with the tedious
task of perusing the complications daily
appearing in our metropolitan journals.
Among numerous articles, in various
strains, there is a very humorous writing,
entitled “My Balloon Adventure ; ” but
to our fancy, the most amusing is one
called “The best dog in the colony.”
There is a very good article, termed
“Et cetera,” which gives an abstract of
the events of the week. In next issue a
story will be commenced, under the im-
pressive heading of “ The Mystery of the
Wiseman’s Ferry Road.” It is a useful,
handy, little book, and well worth
patronage. The price is sixpence.— The
Australian.
The Tenterfield Star says :—Besides
containing a large amount of current
n ® ws > possesses the attraction of
affording to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other edtertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers.— Grenfell Record.
The Moruya Examiner says:—We have
looked the book carefully through and
can confidently recommend it to our
readers and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good
style, and well printed, containing
twenty-four demy octavo pages.— Albury
Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining: it is deserving of a
good circulation. —Border Post (Albury.)
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgee).
The Bathurst Free Press says :—lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting
reading matter—grave, gay, ponderous,
and light. The editorship is evidently in
good hands, and if the editor’s hopes are
realized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces . ’
For he makes his bold assertion : “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once a
Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “ Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. —Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up, and judging
from the matter which this number
(No. 1) contains, it is a magazine that
will no doubt receive a large measure of
support among Australian readers.—
Western Examiner (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes “ The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
