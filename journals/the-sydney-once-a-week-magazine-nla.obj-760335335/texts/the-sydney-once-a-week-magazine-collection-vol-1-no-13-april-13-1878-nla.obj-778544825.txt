JUDGE AND JURY
Wi shall feel obliged to our Subscribers by an
early intimation of any irregularity in the
delivery of weekly numbers, that it may at
once be rectified.
NB. —Advertisements for “ SYDNEY ONCE A
WEEK ” will be received up to ten o’clock on
Thursday morning.
Several pleasing fictions circulate
about the actual position of the Bri-
tish juror, two of which we propose
to examine.
It is continually being laid down
in courts of law that the juror is a
judge of fact, while quite as often
is it asserted that he is the pri-
soner’s peer. Ifthejuror be a judge
of fact, he ought to be considered
(with regard to the particular case
in which he is sworn to make a true
deliverance between his Sovereign
Lady the Queen and the prisoner
at the bar) as being on an equality
of dignity with the honourable


functionary of the Supreme or Dis-
trict Court charged with the con-
duct of the trial. Now, so far as
the actual treatment which the
juror receives at the hands of the
authorities is concerned, it is much
easier to trace his equality to the
prisoner than to the judge. Des-
pite Mr. Holt’s exertions, the Bri-
tish prisoner is treated as a felon
immediately upon his arrest, and
before it is even known whether
there is a prima facie case against
him. Before and during his trial
the prisoner is “ cabined, cribbed and
confined,” so shortly “ in the inter-
est of justice,” as the stereotyped
phrase of bumbledom runs, that
the trouble and cost of defence is
monstrously increased. Now, the
juror seized of the prisoner’s case
is in a somewhat like predicament.
Notwithstanding his being, for the
nonce, on an equality of dignity
with the judge, he finds himself
completely under the thumb of that
functionary, to be by him, at his
pleasure, and at his mere motion
fined, locked up, dieted, snubbed—
(and, as many of our readers doubt-
less know by like experience, one or
two District Court Judges have re-
duced the practice of snubbing a
juror to a science).
Why should this state of things
be permitted to continue? It would,
surely, be far more seemly, more
conducive to the real interests of
justice were greater consideration
paid to the juror, and were the
penal treatment of the prisoner
postponed till it was proved by due
process of law that he was not inno-
cent. If the juror be every whit as
essential to the administration of
the law as to the judge, why should
the one be crowned with honour
and dignity, the other with con-
tumely? The judge is well paid,
why not tho juror ? Why should
the liberty of the latter be restricted
while he is considering the verdict ?
Is he to be considered more f get-at-
able’ than his honour on the bench ?
and why should the juror be finable
at the discretion of the judge ? The
practice of fining non-attending
jurors leads to the evasion by
wealthier citizens of their duty, and
to the narrowing down of the num-
ber from which the twelve men and
true can be empanelled. Were at-
tending jurors treated with consi-
deration equal to that paid to the
judge, the actual duties and un-
avoidable inconveniences of the
juryman’s position, if not sought
after, would at least not be con-
temptuously evaded by those to
whom a £lO fine is a matter of in-
difference.

SPORTING ADVENTURES
IN AUSTRALIA.
BY CHARLEY CORNSTALK.
( Continued).
Jem was easily persuaded to spend a
week at Mr. Grant’s station. As Miss
Georgie remarked in suggesting the
the invitation, “ he would be such a
nice companion for Tom, who wanted
him to stay so much.”
It is doubtful whether Tom, a lad of
sixteen, would have expressed himself
very earnestly upon the subject, seeing
that the new visitor was an entire
stranger to him, but no doubt he had
reoeived a hint from the young lady
who, it could easily be seen, ruled the
household at Tarrawa with a firm
hand. The great inducement held out
was a steeplechase, which had been
arranged to come off at the station
during the ensuing week. It had been
a sudden inspiration, and the idea had
been eagerly taken up by the young
men who had come over to take part
in the kangaroo hunt, all of whom it
may be said, without exception, were
well mounted, as well as bold and
daring riders.
One of these gentlemen, Archibald
M‘Lean, who had recently taken up
some country about fifty miles north
of Mr. Grant’s station, had been es-
pecially eager for the steeplechase,
and upon him had devolved all the
preliminary arragements. All the
horses were, of course, to be ridden
by gentleman riders, and the course
was marked out so as to take in some
stiff fences dividing the land into pad-
docks in the immediate vicinity of the
station buildings, and to finish with a
spanking jump over a freshwater
creek—a good sixteen feet in the clear
—with a straight run to the stand im-
mediately in front of the drawing-
room windows.
Miss Georgie, with the assistance of
her aunt and two young friends who
were staying with her, Fanny and
Eliza Burton, were busily engaged in
making out of such materials as their
limited resources furnished, the neces-
sary colours for the riders ; and the
event was looked forward to with the
greatest expectation.
“ Of course you will ride, Mr. Cur-
tis,” said Georgie, when she observed
that Jem, instead of taking an active
part in the arrangements, seemed
rather moody and distrait , as if he had
nothing whatever to do with the affair.
‘‘We are going to give the prizes
ourselves, but as there are only three
ladies, and there are six entries for the
race, we are making two sets of each
colour, blue, green, and orange, so
that each lady will haveltwo cavaliers
who will, of course, do their best to
show her favours in front.”
Jem protested that he would not
ride at all, unless she would allow him
to carry her colours. Indeed, he didn’t
see how he was to ride at all, as his
horse was unused to timber, and he
would be certain to come to grief.
“Well, Jem, if you are very good
I’ll see what can be done for you,”
said she, “but you must promise to
do exactly what I tell you.”
The countenance of the new chum
brightened immensely at these gra-
cious words, and he was full of
protestations. The poor fellow had
conceived an unreasonable dislike to
M‘Lean, the chief mover in the affair,
not from any personal cause of offence,
but in consequence of the intimate
relations which appeared to exist be-
tween that gentleman and his fair
hostess. They were continually in
consultation, and the “Yes, Archie,”
and “ No, Archie,” which fell from
Miss Georgie’s lips from time to time,
had lit the flame of jealousy in his
breast. He felt convinced that his
rival would wear her colours, and he
went to bed that night with a firm re-
solve that he, Jem Curtis, would
either break his neck or wrest the
prize from that favoured individual.
But how was this to be done ? Mr.
Grant had offered him the pick of the
station horses, but how could he hope
to select a good timber jumper? Stiff
ironbark four-rail fences, four and a
half feet high, are not easily nego-
tiated, except by trained horses.


Nevertheless, he was fully determined
to be one of the competitors.
The next morning he was surprised
to receive a very early visit from Tom
Grant who, with a face full of mystery,
begged him to get up and take a stroll
before breakfast. When tbey had got
about half a mile from the station,
said Tom,
“ Can you sit a buckjumper ? be-
cause Georgie thinks that if you have
a strong seat, and will take the trouble
to get on terms with her, you might
ride 1 The Mountain Maid.’ I must
tell you she is a notorious buckjumper,
and there is no one about the place,
except Bob Simmons, who breaks in
all our colts, who cares much to have
anything to do with her. But there’s
no mistake about her jumping powers.
My word, you should have seen her
one day when we run her into the
yard, clapped a saddle on her, and put
Tommy, one of our black boys, up.
She just put her head between her
legs, gave one buck, and the next
moment Tommy was taking a bee line
in the air towards the bull paddock,
and before he came down again the
mare had cleared the top rad of the
yard, a good 6 feet 6 inches, and was
off like a bird. I’ve had seven purls
off her myself. But she is not vicious,
and she might go well enough in a
crowd, if you could only get her fairly
* started'.”
This was not a very encouraging
description of the horse which was to
win Jem, not the steeplechase only,
but the favour of the prettiest girl on
that side of the main range; but Jem
determined there and then that he
would ride. He had plenty of pluck
and a strong, if not a very elegant
seat; and if his hand was a trifle
heavy, it did not appear that the
“ Mountain Maid ” required very light
handling.
“We’ll go and talk to Bob about
her,” said Tom Grant. “He can ride
her like a book, and I believe you’ll
pull off the race as easy as kiss my
hand, if you dont’t come to grief the
first hundred yards. You keep her
head straight, see that she don’t bolt,
and that's about all you’ll have to
do.”
Retracing their steps they went in
search of Bob, whom they found pre-
sently in a yard at the back of the
house. He was evidently expecting a
visit from them, and singularly enough
the very animal they had been talking
about was standing in the corner of
the yard with a halter on, looking very
much as if she had just been sub-
jected to a severe grooming. Had the
new chum been in a position to view
this incident in a dispassionate frame
of mind, he might have drawn very
favourable conclusions in reference to
the interest taken in him by a certain
capricious young lady, but Jem had
too modest an opinion of himself to
connect the present state of prepara-
tion with Miss Grant. His attention
was at once taken up with the
** Mountain Maid.”
She was a handsome grey, one of
that peculiar colour called fleabitten
grey, well ribbed up, with a good
forehand, and that peculiarity which
makes a good horse, and above all, a
good hunter, a long rein—the stretch
from the nostril to the wither along
the bridle rein being longer than the
distance from the wither to the tail—
four clean sound legs, hard and muscu-
lar as those of a stag, and a bright in-
telligent eye; altogether a mare that
you would say at a glance, would
prove game to the backbone.
“Now,” said Bob, after he had
taken a long and scrutinizing look at
our hero, which was apparently satis-
factory, “I’ll just let you see what
this mare can do, and then we’ll try
whether she takes to you or not. She’s
got her fancies I can tell you, but if she
once gives in there’s no more trouble
with her. But she won’t let every tom-
fool ride her, you can take your colonial
oath of that. Wo-ho lass! ”
So saying he approached the mare,
and put a saddle and bridle on her.
Then mounting her, he cantered her
about with a slack reign, leaping the
slip panel into the next yard backwards
and forwards, the “ Mountain Maid ”
going through all sorts of evolutions


with the docility and good temper of
a perfect lady’s horse.
“ Sit back and stick your knees in,”
he said, as the impatient Jem put his
foot into the stirrups when Bob dis-
mounted ; pretty safe falling any-
ways.”
But there was a little trouble about it,
for just as he threw his leg over the
saddle the mare gave a snort, and
commenced to buck. Jem did what
he could to keep her head up, but to
no purpose. She bucked and plunged
with a vigor and skill acquired by long
practice ; she crouched till her belly
fairly touched the ground, and threw
up her hind legs until she appeared to
be standing on her head. Then one,
two, three violent plunges in rapid
succession, the girths snapped under
her like packthread, and away went
Jem into mid-air, alighting about ten
feet off in the centre of the yard, in a
spot which had been carefully pre-
pared by a cow, to rise considerably
shaken and bespattered with dirt, but
in the best of tempers and quite ready
to try again.
“ It ain’t no manner of use, my lad.
She’s got the knack of it, and she’d
spill you every time as nice as nine-
pins. We’ll try a different tack. She’s
like a woman; she’s got to find her
master, and then she’ll do anything
she’s bid.”
“Now, youngster, I’ve got my
orders, which are that you’re to ride
the steeplechase on this here mare, and
if you’ll do as I bid ye there ain’t no
manner of doubt about it. You’ve
got the grit, and that’s about the main
thing I reckon with horses. They
know precious well when they have to
give in and when they have not.”
Bob was a wiry old chap of some
fifty years, who had been for the best
part of his life employed by the owners
of the Yarrawa station, first as an odd
hand, then as stockman, and then as
roughrider and horse-breaker. In the
course of his career he had developed
such an aptitude for the management
of horses, and such a knowledge of
their habits and peculiarities, that his
word had become law in all matters
equine. He was an excellent horse-
man, and although like many others of
his class, he was possessed by a fatal
inability to pass a public house or a
grog shanty without stopping, or to
refuse any opportunity that presented
itself for a spree, he had not lost his
nerve, and would cram his horses at
anything in the shape of a jump which
came in his way, especially when
riding in company with anyone hostile
in his eyes to the interests of the
owners, who took occasion to say a
disparaging word of the cattle or any
of the belongings of his employers.
It was said that on several occasions,
when he could not have walked ten
yards to save his life, he had been
lifted on to the saddle and had ridden
fifteen or twenty miles home in per-
fect safety. Bob was heart and soul
devoted to Miss Georgie, whom he
had taught to ride, and whose pony
received at his hands as much atten-
tion as ever fell to the lot of a favored
quadruped. Her bit and stirrup-irons
were Bob’s peculiar care, and were
polished till they looked like burnished
silver. In short, no young lady ever
possessed a more devoted follower, and
Miss Georgie’s word was literally law
to Bob Simmons.
It was evident that she had sent for
him and given him some very decided
instructions on the subject of the
steeplechase, and that Bob had made
his preparations to carry out his orders
successfully.
“ Just you wait a bit,” he replied,
“ and we'll try her on a different
tack.” With that he went to the
stables, and presently re-appeared
with his arms full. First he replaced
the broken girths with a pair made of
strong hide split into strands, which
are excellent in their way if they are
only kept oiled and soft; otherwise
they are apt to create a sore, especially
in hot weather. Then, the saddle
being securely strapped on, over it he
placed a strong surcingle, which was
fastened with three straps. Next he
buckled on a pair of side reins, which
crossed the mare’s withers, and fitted
into strong tongues in the saddle bow.


This was to prevent her from getting
her head down. He then took the
further precaution of fastening the
stirrup leathers by pieces of stout
twine to the girths, to give Jim a
secure footing, and to enable him to
resist the plunges of the animal and
their tendency to send him over her
head. Lastly, to give the rider every
chance of retaining his seat at all
hazards, he produced an old ’possum
rug, which he made into a roll, and
strapped in front of the saddle.
“ Now Muster Curtis, I don’t think
as we’ll mount her yet; we may as
well chose a soft spot in case of acci-
dents. You put on these spurs, and
send them into her every time she tries
to throw you. But we’ll go down as
far as the creek, where there’s a patch
of spongy ground. Take this whip,
and don’t be afraid of using it. It’s
you or her for it; and Miss G-eorgie
’ll never forgive me if you don’t come
put right. She won’t have a pleasant
word to say to me for a month at
least.”
Arrived at the appointed spot, Jem
again mounted, and the Mountain
Maid again made desperate efforts to
unseat him. But she could no longer
get her head between her legs, and
every time she crouched for a fresh
spring a vigorous application of whip
and spur sent her bounding forward;
while Jem, with the roll of ’possum
rug before him, and the firm grip his
feet got of the stirrup-irons, sat back
in his saddle triumphant.
The mare did not, however, give in
without a struggle; and it was not
until half-an-hour or more had been
spent in the fight for mastery, and she
had been forced to gallop, trot, and
walk at the will of her rider, and had
undergone severe punishment, that she
gave in, and, with drooping flanks,
carried the new chum back sub-
missively to the starting point.
“ What you’ve got to do,” said Bob,
“is to stick to her. Come over to me
every morning at daybreak and give
her her gallop. Come over whenever
you can, and handle her and rub her
down. Let her know your voice, my
lad ; that’s the secret with horses.
You’ve got to gain their confidence,
and they’ll never fail you. You get on
good terms with the mare, and she’ll
carry you in great style. The race is
sure to be put off till next week, and
there’s plenty of time.”
How Jem Curtis carried out the old
man’s instructions and how the steeple-
chase went off will appear in the next
chapter.
(To be continued.)
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
No. 11.
Wealth, with its too common at-
tendants, indolence and sensuality,
and the race for wealth, with its
too common tempt >tion to stimulate
qualities, are the springs of un-
healthfulness of our modern Capua,
to which we address ourselves to-
day, in the few lines which we
weekly devote to the important sub-
ject of our title.
We think that it may be laid
down without disputation that the
great stimulus to work is formed in
the necessity for work, that appe-
tite, craving for food, is the great
master and dictator of our exer-
tions ; it may also be admitted as
probably true (we having no doubt
of the truth) that our bodily and
mental powers are held by this
tenure, namely, that we make use of
them. In these two positions is con-
tained the whole matter of our state-
ment —the bodily exertion which
keeps the hard-worker in health, is
in colder climates supplied to the
opulent in the various exercises of
the chase, the field, travel, and in
other ways; in those older coun-
tries also, the stage of retirement
from active life is seldom reached
until the bodily powers, and with
them the occasion for their active


use, have undergone considerable
diminution ) whereas here, men in
the prime of life, abandon them-
selves to ease, and relinquishing the
use of their o*tl legs, “ a very res-
pectable form of conveyance in Syd-
ney as we once heard a learned
judge remark, are seldom seen out
of a vehicle. To us who remember
the days when Sir Richard Bourke,
Sir Francis Forbes, Mr. Samuel
Terry, and Mr. William Hutchinson
were the only persons who kept
carriages in Sydney, and Dr. Bland
prescribed for all the sick, and Mr.
Foss dispensed alike prescriptions
and the items of plum puddings, it
does seem that there's something
more than an accidental coincid-
ence between the use of the carriage
and the need for the doctor. The
well-to-do, then, besides the disuse
of their own limbs, instead of
reducing the supply of food, which
want of exertion prevents them from
properly consuming in exercise,
commonly indulge themselves in
eating and drinking more ; a por-
tion of this excess is from time to
time stored up in the various vital
organs, leading to complications.
We appeal to the common saying
that such a man is “ digging his
grave with his teeth,” in support
of our view. So much for the rich
and well-to-do!
Looking to the operation of like
causes among the hard-working
classes, we find that the excessive
wages paid in this colony find ex-
penditure chiefly in dress, and in
drink; of the former we do not
complain, saving in the expression
of a sanitary wish that it were com-
posed more largely of washable mate-
rial ) but with regard to the latter,
the very conclusive evidence which
we have of a gross system of adul-
teration practised in the colony,
superadded to the adulteration
which the filthy compounds have
undergone before their arrival here,
compels us to attribute much of the
sickness and early death in Sydney
to the use of drinks specially dele-
terious ; and, not in the form of
drink alone, do the high wages ope-
rate to dig early graves. We were
told by the respectable owner of a
small shop in the suburbs, that, in
the gold times, an ordinary me-
chanic’s bill would amount to
twenty-five shillings per week for
sardines, pickles, and ham, inde-
pendently of tea, sugar, and other
ordinary articles. Now, without
entering upon a discussion of mat-
ters properly belonging to the pro-
vince of the physician, we cannot
help hazarding a hasty opinion that
our friend the carpenter or mason
would have been better nourished
on beef and potatoes than on any of
the hundred and one messes which
we import. We preach no new doc-
trine, simplicity of life, diet, and
manners, conduce to health, and
long life! Does it not do more ?
Has it not contentment and happi-
ness also as its attendants and its
consequences ?
We must not expect to raise men,
suddenly, out of a condition which
appears to them that of enjoyment
—our slow Saxon race is not capa-
ble of emancipating itself, as the
Japanese are doing , from the tram-
mels of barbarous generations, in
the lifetime of a man. Much has
been accomplished towards sanita-
tion ; fifty years ago few English-
men washed more than their hands
and faces, daily, and with a weekly
foot-bath, and a clean shirt, more
or less considered themselves a
clean people ; now probably there
is not one man in a hundred but
would miss his morning’s “tub”


more than his morning’s meal—so
we take hope. It were to be wished,
however, if only for the sake of
our Japanese friends, that Sydney
people were a little cleaner, that
the improvements which we hope
another generation may see per-
fected, were begun ; that a PUB-
LIC HEALTH ACT and a
HEALTH BOARD were staring
us in the face !
AUNT REBECCA’S SECRET.
BY REV. A. W. PETRE.
CHAP. I.
It was raining incessantly: the gather-
ing storm-clouds hung like a pall over
the face of the earth, and no break in
the sky gave promise of a change.
The parched soil drank in greedily the
welcome drops, and the farmers were
jubilant and exultant; but to Fred
Coventry, who rose from the sofa, and
throwing aside his novel, stood watch-
ing the little rivulets which chased each
other across the gravel path in front of
the window, the sight was anything
but cheering. A frown flitted icross
his handsome face, for he know that
butterflies keep under shelter in wot
weather, and that if he went to the
trysting-place at the waterfall in the
wood, the dark-blue eyes and glossy
hair, and the winning smile which was
wont to greet him, would not be there.
No wonder that he was cross or out of
temper: the rain had spoilt his appoint-
ment.
Fred was just of age, and had in-
herited a handsome property. Good-
looking, with a fair Saxon face and
curly hair, and clever, though some-
what self-willed, he was a general
favourite, but to Bertha Coxon, the
daughter of a well-to-do farmer,
and one of the tenants of the Spring-
field estate, he was a great deal more
than that.
They had but few opportunities of
seeing each other, and exchanging
those soft nothings which go to make
up the conversation of lovers, for no
duenna ever watched over her charge
more faithfully than Bertha’s aunt
Rebecca, and the stolen visits to the
waterfall which Bertha continued to
make when her guardian was absent
were, like angels’ visits, “ few and far
between.” When Fred called, she
was not allowed to see him except in
the presence of her aunt; and when a
lady of about fifty, dressed in a tight-
fitting black silk dress, sitting upright
in her chair, her fingers busy with her
knitting needles and her ears open to
catch every sound, makes up the trio,
how can young people converse with-
out restraint! They had arranged a
meeting at the waterfall that afternoon,
and here was the rain to baulk them.
What wonder that Fred Coventry was
cross and disappointed !
The Coventrys were an old county
family, and had lived in Springfield
from time immemorial. The old manor
house into which Fred had just come
into possession had been built in the
the days when Good Queen Bess ruled
the land, and was a fine specimen of
the architecture of that period. His
grandfather, Richard Coventry, had
loved good wine, cards, and women,
too dearly for the strength of his purse,
and had run through a fine fortune, so
that at his death he had nothing to
leave to his son but his name. The
Springfield estate had been purchased
from that son, Fred’s father, by an
uncle, in order that it might not go
out of the family. The old gentleman
had settled his nephew in business,
and one day, in a fie of caprice, having
been taken by the smiling countenance
of our hero, the youngest of the six
children, went to his lawyer’s office
and made that boy his heir.
Thus Fred, on attaining his twenty-
first year, found himself, the property
having been accumulating during his
minority, in undisputed possession of
a clear eight thousand a year.
Charles, Fred’s eldest brother, had
been taken into partnership by his
father in a flourishing business.
Richard, the next, was at Oxford,
studying for his degree, and Francis,
the youngest but Fred, was employed
in a large manufacturing house in Man-


Chester. Fred’s two sisters, Emma and
Theresa, were both married, and our
hero was living at Springfield alone
with his parents, who were anxious to
see him bring home a bride to enliven
tha old house.

Patter, patter, falls the rain on the
windows of the farm-house which
shelters the pretty Bertha, and gently
fall the tear-drops down her fair cheeks
as the prospect of keeping her appoint-
ment fades away. The water falls all
round, but she is thinking of the water-
fall by the ferns where Fred had im-
plored her to meet him that day.
She and her aunt Rebecca lived alone
in the old farm-house, and it was the
earnest hope of the latter that the girl
would marry some honest, industrious
man in her own sphere, who would keep
on the farm as her father and grandfath-
er had done. No thought of a marriage
with a Coventry ever entered into aunt
Rebecca’s head. A union between the
House and the Farm would have ap-
peared to her as improbable as a visit
from the Pope of Rome. Yet the birds
that twittered and chirped among the
ferns near the waterfall could have told
of vows exchanged and oaths and pro-
testations of undying fidelity often re-
peated.
Bertha’s bright face is dimmed with
tears, which she brushes hastily away
as she hears her aunt’s voice calling her
to come and help to sort some apples
in the storeroom.
‘ ‘ Why, my dear child, you have been
crying ! What in all the world has a
girl like you got to cry about ? Bless
my heart! you had better keep your
tears for the real troubles of life, which
Heaven is sure to send in its own good
time.”
“Aunt Rebecca,” said Bertha, after
a short pause, “ were you ever in
love ? ”
“ My dear Bejtha, what a question!
Who has not, at some time or other,
fallen in love ? ”
“ Did you ever fall in love, aunt
Rebecca ? ”
“ Yes, my dear, I too fallen into
the pit, and how I came out above is
the secret of my life. But as it may
please the Almighty to remove me
soon, it may; not be out of place for
me to tell you the story.”
“Years ago,” she continued, “I
was a pretty girl of eighteen. Life
was to me a rosy morn ; I only saw
the sun rise ; the setting was still far
off in a glowing west, of which I had
not even a thought. In Brentwood I
met and loved William Adamson, but
alas, my love was not returned. In
secret I nourished the passion for two
long years, when, to my great surprise
and unbounded delight, his manner
towards me suddenly changed, and he
paid me such constant attention that
all our friends believed we were en-
gaged. What a joyous time was that!
I was ever building castles in the air,
in which Willie was the prominent
figure. My happiest and holiest thouhts
centred round him. Away from him
minutes seemed hours, and hours but
as minutes in his presence. Objects
that he praised were more valuable to
me than gold ; I lived but for his ap-
proval, and sunned myself in his
smile; in short, I worshipped him,
and he appeared to return my ardent
affection.
“But my happiness was shortlived.
A Miss Wyatt; came to stay with
some friends at Brentwood. She was
certainly very handsome and high-
spirited. She and Willy met fre-
quently, and I soon found that he had
transferred his allegiance to her ; and
although I would have died for him,
he had neither love nor devotion for
me.
“ Soon all Brentwood was aware that
they were to be married—but that
was not to be ; for, two days before the
wedding, the bride elect was found to
be insane. She took a walk in the
twilight one evening, and returned
out of her mind. The match was, of
course, broken off. Willie left shortly
afterwards for London, and from that
day to this I have never seen or heard
from him. That, Bertha, is the his-
tory of my love.”


There was a long pause, and then
Bertha said, “ How the worm does eat
into the very core of the apple!”
“ Aunt Rebecca,” said Bertha, after
another pause, “ what would you say
if I told you that I was in love?”
“ My dear child, you shopld not
jest With such a serious subject.”
‘* I am not in jest, dear aunt; aud
here with the sunshine comes he whom
Hove.”
Aunt Rebecca looked up, and saw
Fred coming up the garden walk.
CHAP. Til
A year slipped by, and Aunt Rebecca
remained firm—Bertha was too young
to be married; and Fred, by turns
happy and despondent, came and
went.
It was a lovely evening in June
when Fred, with his brother Richard,
who was on a visit with him, walked to
the farm. Upon their arrival they
found that Bertha had gone with her
aunt to Brentwood. Throwing him-
self into an armchair, Fred managed
to overturn a worktable with all its
contents. Dick came to the rescue,
and began to gather up the various
nicknacks which were scattered on the
floor. In doing so some letters and
papers fell from his own pocket, and
were mingled with the litter before
him. The work-table, with its con-
tents, was soon replaced, and shortly
afterwards the ladies returned, and the
time slipped by so pleasantly that it
was nearly ten o’clock when the
brothers started to return to the
Manor House. Before retiring for the
night Dick lit a cigar, and amused
himself with sorting the papers which
had fallen out of his pocket a few
hours before. All at once his eye was
caught by an envelope endorsed in a
hand he did not recognise,
“ My Confession .”
Supposing it to be some tale in
manuscript which he had received
from a friend, and had not time
to look into, for Dick had literary
aspirations and was a contributor to a
magazine, he was about to put it away
with the other papers, when he thought
he might as well take that opportunity
of perusing it. He read the first page,
and became interested, and as he pro-
ceeded it suddenly dawned upon him
that he was reading the life of Rebecca
Coxon. Curiosity impelled him to go
on. The reader is already aware of the
first part ol the story it contained, so
we will take up the narrative hallway.
It ran thus :
“ A few days before the day fixed
for Willie’s marriage with Miss Wyatt,
I made up my mind to kill her. Love
had made me mad with jealous hate
of my rival, and I vowed to myself
that sooner than she t-hould be Wil-
lie’s wife she should die by my hand.
I found that she was in the habit of
walking alone across the fields to her
friends’ house, by a path wbicn led
through a wood at a short distance
from the town. On that fatal evening,
maddened by hate and jealousy I dres-
sed myself in white, and with my dark
hair falling over my shoulders, and a
dagger in my hand, I met her face to
face in the twilight.
“ In an instant I saw that she believed
herself in the presence of a super-
natural visitant. ‘Margaret Wyatt,'
said I, ‘you must not marry Willie
Adamson. His love was pledged to
me, and he is mine in life and in
death. Beware!’ Heaven ordyknows
what rash act I should then have com-
mitted in the ungovernable despair
which actuated me, but I was spared
from shedding blood, for my wicked
object was gained. Instead of a rival
triumphing over m? with her youth
and beauty, I saw before me only a
poor insane girl, whom no one would
care to marry. The shock had de-
prived her of her reason. For a mo-
ment I exulted in my revenge, but
soon the horrible crime of which I had
been guilty came upon me in its full
force, and my peace of mind was for-
ever gone. How I got home, and hid
the traces of my remorse, and the bit-
ter tears which my guilty conscience
forced from my eyes, I cannot tell to
this day. Days and weeks of gnawing
sorrow, shame and repentance suc-


ceeded, and when my rival was pro-
nounced to be incurably mad, and Wil-
lie had left the village, my cup of bit-
terness was full. Would that I could
recall the events of that fatal evening,
lean only mourn overthemtomydying
day. This, my dearest Bertha, is
Aunt Rebecca’s secret. You will not
read it until she is dead, and you will
then judge her pitifully.”
A trifling accident had brought to
light a mystery which, in the ordinary
course of events, might not have been
revealed for years. Dick pondered
long and seriously over the matter,
and various were the surmises on the
part of Fred and Bertha as to what
Dick and Aunt Rebecca could have had
to say to each other during the long
two hours they were closeted together
the next morning.
But there was no longer any opposi-
tion on her part to the wedding, which
was celebrated in due course, though
it was not until some years after, when
death had removed the principal ac-
tors in the tragedy, that Fred learned
from his brother the true story of
“Aunt Rebecca’s Secret.”
YOUNG ENGLAND IN AUSTRALIA.
For some time past, and especially
during the last few years, we have
been honoured by an influx of volun-
tary emigrants from the Old World,
in the shape of “ Young England in
search of employment.”
What it is that influences Young
England to journey so far, in order to
reach so benighted and semi-barbarous
a place as (he assures you) Australia is
regarded at home, is a problem not
very easy of solution. Nevertheless,
he comes. Whether it is from a morbid
longing to perish in a savage land, or
from the laudable and philanthropic
desire of conferring the benefit of
civilization on his less fortunate
brethren in humanity, are questions
which I am not prepared to answer—
But he comes,
He has no very clear idea as to what
is to be done on his arrival, but is
confident that ere long he will be able
to say with Cassar, “ Veni, vidi, vici.”
Well, the first two are easy enough,
and so far he acquits himself with
credit; but vici is the staggerer, and
he soon discovers, to his amazement,
thait employment is as eagerly sought
and as difficult to obtain in the colonies
as in the mother country. Under these
trying circumstances he adopts a course
which perhaps is wisest, but certainly
the most dignified, for him to pursue,
and abuses everything connected with
colonial life, up hill and down dale.
He is filled with wonder at our costume,
and satirically amused at our mode of
life. “ At home, my dear fellow,” he
informs you, “one never sees a hat
such as you have on: nothing is worn
but the tall hat, or the pot hat; yet, I
don’t know how it is, but out here you
seem to sport a variety of hats. You
have pith hats, white hats, wide-
awakes, cabbagetrees—in short, every
kind of hat that is at the same time
ridiculous and contemptible.” He then
expresses his inability to refrain from
laughter at the sight of so many out-
landish and grotesque chapeaux, com-
bined as it is with the peculiar and
nondescript cut which colonial tailors
appear to take delight in bestowing on
their clothes, and the utter absence of
gaiters over the boots, —necessaries
one would as soon think of dispensing
with in England as the boots, aye, the
very legs, themselves.
Ask him to dine with you in a quiet
friendly way, and he will immediately
desire to know if he is to come in full
dress; and when you reply “Oh dear,
no > — n o party,—only ourselves,” or
something of that sort, his risible
faculties are tickled beyond all control
as he tells you “That’s a rum sort of
notion you’ve got out here of not dress-
ing for dinner,” or, “ At home, you
know, one never thinks of stirring
without a claw-hammer.”
Even on religious subjects he will
not let one alone, nor suffer you to say
your prayers in peace. He is dis-
satisfied with the Church. “Pulpits
are now quite out of date ; —the white
surplice of the clergyman should only


reach to the knee, with a black robe
underneath itor, “Who ever heard
of a congregation sitting down during
the collection ? ” Under such an accu-
mulation of unorthodoxies, he insists
that it is quite impossible for anyone
to pray without materially degenerat-
ing in the social scale; nor will he
Join his vocal worship to the quire
Of creatures wanting voice,
as the singing should be conducted
entirely by choristers, a musical edu-
cation being absolutely necessary, to
qualify the penitent to lift up his voice
in praise. .
This, then, is Young England m
the colonies— though not, be it under-
stood, Young England proper, by
which is meant the public school boys
and university men; they as a rule are
a fine race of sensible fellows, who, go
where they will, are sure to find a
hearty welcome, and a good deal in
life worth living for. But these, alas,
do not very ofton emigrate to Australia.
It is generally the sons of small city
men, the struggling clerk, weary of
Ms pittance of £SO a year, which, as
he possesses no influence, he sees no
way of augmenting, that with a trunk
full of loud clothes, and a head full of
conceited nonsense, sets sail from his
native land, with the idea of making
an immediate fortune, in the far on
and benighted regions of the emu and
marsupial. They it is that find life so
intolerable, away from the refining in-
fluences to which they have been ac-
customed. They it is who can take no
pleasure in anything that is going on,
because they have seen it, or done it,
so much better at home ; and they it
is who bemoan the cruel fate which
“brought them out,” and seem to at-
tribute 0 a grievance to every colonist,
from the mere fact ot Australia being
in existence. Ah ! how often are some
of us inclined to say, after listening
patiently to a recital of the privat ons,
and hardships to which they are sub-
jected to in this “ dreadful place.
“ What the devil did you come for ?
Society is a good deal to blame, and
in a great measure has brought upon
itself these social bores—“just from
England,” is a passport that works
like magic among the members of
fashion. No inquiry is thought neces-
sary as to who he is, and no one seems
to consider that England, being a most
populous place, must of necessity pos-
sess a large number of adventurers,
snobs, and vulgarians ; yet, so long as
the hat is small enough, the trousers
wide enough, and the pattern of the
cloth big enough, the fortunate owner
is at once taken by the hand, and the
house doors open wide at his approach,
Then, too, society humours his ca-
prices, is not surprised, that he finds
it impossible to go to the opera, after
having heard Mario; and sympathises
with the inability he experiences of
worshiping in a church at once so low
and degraded. Then society listens
with admiration, and even encourages,
the conversation invariably carried on
by two Young Englanders, if per-
chance they meet in her drawing-
rooms. It is usually of the most in-
teresting and intelligent description,
and generally runs somewhat after
this fashion: —
“You know the Strand ?”
“Yes, rather!”
“ And Regent-street?”
“ I should rather think so. Do you
remember that little tobacconist at the
corner ?”
“ Of course I do. What became of
the old fellow ?”
“ Oh, he’s all right, I saw him the
other day, just before I left town.”
“By Jove, you don’t say so. Does
the chemist still live next door ? ”
“ Oh yes, just opposite the iron-
monger’s, you know.” And so on, and
so on, and so on, until at last everyone
is weary and worn out. This, too,
before a room full of people, not one of
whom, perhaps, has as yet travelled,
and who therefore listen with respect-
ful though moody silence to this ex-
citing dialogue, tacitly recognising the
superiority of Young England, and
feeling bitterly their own lamentable
ignorance on the subject of the tobac-
conist, chemist, and ironmonger.
Still as it is thought good style to
venerate anything English, and to


abuse everything colonial, the com-
pany tolerate this social nuisance, and
bear with equanimity a conversation
which, if carried on about a sister
colony, would be at once suppressed
and peremptorily silenced. As it is
about England, however, it is heard
to the bitter end, and, perhaps, if
someone can get a word in edgeways,
he will express a great longing for
travel himself, or an opinion that “it
must be so very nice to see the world.
Whereupon the Young Englands con-
descendingly hope that some day you,
too, will be able to gladden your eyes
with the sight of the tobacconist,
chemist, and ironmonger, and go away
together still talking about them.
O.
"WAYS THAT ARE DARK
AND
TRICKS THAT ARE VAIN.”
BY “RUS.”
I was once obliged to take temporary
charge of the domestic arrangements
of my household. It was rather a
trying time to me, for I never had
paid much attention to domestic
affairs. In the course of my house-
hold supremacy I learned many things,
met with some adventures, and ex-
perienced some novel sensations, all
of a different kind from anything
which I had met with before.
It is not, however, my present in-
tention to publish a history of that
period of my life, interesting as it
would be, but to relate an occurrence
that convinced me, once for all, that
Bret Harto is quite wrong in saying
that
“ For ways that are dark
And tricks that are vain,
That heathen Chinee is peculiar. ”
lam sure that he is not peculiar in
this respect at all, but that a great
variety of the same kind of article, in
any quantity, may be found much
nearer home.
One day a requisition was made for
marking ink. Now I knew generally
that linen has to be marked, with a
dim remembrance of having heard
something about marking ink; but I
was quite at a loss as to how much to
send for and where to send—whether
to the grocer’s, the stationer’s, the
druggist’s, or to the oil and colour-
man’s. I managed, however, by adroit
questions, without exposing my igno-
rance, which would have lessened my
authority in the establishment, to
learn that a bottle might be had at
any chemist’s for one shilling, so I
sent the youngest boy with a shilling
to the nearest chemist’s.
The boy came back with the parcel
in his trousers’ pocket, but the pocket
was so small and the parcel so large,
that I had some difficulty in getting it
out. How he managed to get it in
has never been explained.
This reminded me of a somewhat
similar occurrence in my early youth.
At our school there was a little boy
with a prodigiously large mouth, into
which some of the other boys amused
themselves at times by stuffing a whole
orange. One day, a larger orange than
usual having been employed, it stuck
fast. The little boy with the mouth
turned black in the face and shewed
signs of having a fit; the other boys
were in consternation, but one boy
retained his presence of mind, and
having cut a hole in the orange with
a penknife, sucked at the juice so
vigorously that the orange collapsed
and came out in a few moments.
I was not, however, obliged on the
occasion to which I am referring to go
so far as to tap the parcel of marking
ink, but got it out by gentler means.
When I observed its size, I said to
myself that in the matter of marking
ink at all events I was provided for
for life. I then took off the wrapper,
expecting to find a bottle; but, instead
of that, I found another wrapper, and
another, and another, and so on, till
the process grew so tedious that I
called in some of the children to my
assistance. After a time we arrived
at something hard, which turned out
to be, instead of a bottle, a card box
about the size of a sausage.
We opened the box, and found


another paper parcel. We resumed
cur operations upon this, and at last
our patient research was rewarded by
finding a cork about half the size of a
man’s thumb, at one end of which we
observed a bottle about the size of the
tip of a lady’s little finger. I took out
the cork with some curiosity, half
expecting to find another paper parcel,
but found nothing whatever except a
minute quantity of atmospheric air,
which I corked up again at once and
took back to the chemist.
The address which I delivered to
the chemist on that occasion will pro-
bably be published in a future number.
For the present it is enough to say
that it had such an effect upon him
that, being an M.L.A., and forgetting
for the moment* where he was, he
moved “that the question be further
considered this day six months." I
was about to take objection on a point
of ordei*, when he retired into his back
premises, and so the house was counted
out.
THE JOURNAL OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL
EXPEDITION.
BY A LADY.
December 31st, 1877.
At last all preparations for a long-
talked of expedition to the New Eng-
land table land have been completed.
Our party (nine in all) assembled at
C , where we partook of an early
breakfast and attempted a start at
seven o’clock a.m. The horses were
saddled and a pair put in the buggy,
when some one suggested the advis-
ability of testing the capabilities of the
pack-horses. They were led out of
the stable and let loose, “ Little Dick"
walked quietly away with his huge
“ hump’’ of rugs and blankets, but a
young chesnut mare objected strongly,
and bucked her’s off—smashing straps,
girth, etc., and sending first and fore-
most a frying-pan into the midst of
the yard—this latter article is one of
the most valuable of our possessions,
and destined to play an important part
in the culinary department. After a
short delay, caused by repacking and
placing the frying pan in a more
secure position, we started, Freddy
(our black boy) leading the mare, and
Albert (the other) driving the two
other “ packs." They are poking
things, making for every slip-rail and
corner. Albert’s white teeth show
whenever a remark is made to him—
he has the joliiest little black face.
Freddy joss along in the most solemn
way on a tiny pony by the side of the
mare he is leading. Her pack won’t
keep straight, we are out af patience
with her and it. Four ladies are rid-
ing and two are in the buggy, we
(ladies) change now and then, driving
a few miles and then riding. At a
crossing near Lewinsbrook it was
thought necessary to put Dick’s pack
straight. The five horses were found
in a corner, where the bank rose up
in a high wall on one side and deep
water lay on the other ; when the fore-
most horse plunged into the stream,
leading all the others, we trembled to
see our provisions, as well as rugs,
tents, and blankets disappearing under
water!
The appearance they made after
their bath was sufficiently ridiculous to
make us laugh, in spite of our dismay.
No more adventures till we reached
Hal ion, where the rain came down in
torrents. Had a consultation as to
whether we should go on or turn back
again ; decided in favour of progres-
sion. Arrived at Sherwood at one
o’clock having crossed the Allyn four-
teen times in twenty-two miles. These
crossings are, with very few excep-
tions, most picturesque ; the higher
we ascend the wilder they become,
and the boulders larger and more nu-
merous ; precipitous walls of rock
upon one side and sloping grassy
banks, thinly wooded, upon the other,
be'ng the characteristic features of the
landscapes. Eccleston, through which
we passed, is a po i town. A small
church, some wooden buildings, and
very luxuriant cultivation, do not sug-
gest the idea of a town, but I must
not forget a grand old English oak—
planted by the first possessor of the pro-


perty, and supposed to be forty years
of age.
Having received permission, we de-
cided to camp on the river bank, near
Sherwood, and rejoiced when the sun
came out and enabled us to spread the
contents of submerged packs and bags
over logs, trees, etc. A few scarlet
blankets, blue dressing-gowns, and
white garments enlivened the roman-
tic little spot chosen for “ first camp.”
The lunch, of cold roast beef and
plum pudding, was appreciated by
all, including the black boys, who
helped themselves to pudding first .
Great concern was expressed when
some very delicious biscuits were
found to be reduced to the consistency
of paste ; two of the girls put this
into the frying-pan, and imagine it
will be very nice. “The proof of the
pudding is in the eating,” so we shall
see. I fear they labour under a delu-
sion. Between four and five o’clock
p.m., we were thus disposed of, —
three ladies and one gentlemen ar-
ranging tents, gathering leaves, etc.,
for the beds ; four young people—
boys and girls, whispering soft
nothings to each other on the river
bank, and one lady sketching a turn of
the river where a bcld wall of rock
decorated with vines and shrubs juts
above, and is reflected in the clear pool
below before the water rushes down a
little pebbly rapid. At 5 o'clock we
started for our bathe, leaving
the gentlemen in their tent. We found
a retired spot where the water looked
tempting, but the bottom was full of
huge slippery stones that hurt our
feet when we walked, and knees when
we swam. Notwithstanding, the water
was delightfully cool and refreshing,
though the sun was hot. The different
bathing dresses caused much amuse-
ment ; some are quite elaborate.
Some dilapidated peach and lemon
trees upon the other side of the river
showed that “ there a garden once had
smiled.” We returned to camp in time
to get tea over before dark; after
which we were enlivened by an out-
door concert, seated on logs, and feel-
ing a little nervous now and then
when the existence of snakes and
other reptiles was hinted at. At-
tempted to danee a “reel,” but failed
for want of music. Retired to our
respective tents at about ten o’clock,
six ladies filling one, not very large,
and leaving little room to spare for
goods and chattels. We are all very
tired and sunburnt. It is time to put
out the candle that hangs in a lantern
at one end of the tent, so good night.
January Ist, 1878.
Woke at half-past four after a splen-
did night’s rest, and performed our
toilets at the river, where we bathed
again, finding the water very cold.
We must always do our hair at the
tent, for a small haud glass hangs out-
side, and is much used by all, es-
pecially by the gentlemen.
The grass was very wet excepting in
one spot by the fire, where the black
boys must have been curled up ;all
night.”
Wished every one, absent and
present, a “ Happy New Year.”
Breakfasted at half-past six, and at
half-past eight again started, leaving
the buggy at Sherwood. We rode up
the Allyn for several miles, then turned
to the left and crossed over the divi-
ding range, a steep slippery track.
The pack horses now go like old
stagers, and follow after the riders.
There are sixteen horses in all; and
our guide (who kindly volunteered his
services from the last habitation on the
Allyn). The party looks quite for-
midable filing along some of the nar-
row sidlings. The mountain was
slippery, and is very steep. We rode
up and down the other side, but our
steeds dia not like it.
After coming on to the Williams we
passed several small farms. “ Saxby’s”
(the last) is a comfortable little home-
stead, with flowers and a fruit garden
round it; then we gradually come into
the uncivilized country, the entrance
to which, a beautiful brush, delighted
us. Some of the ferns are lovely, and
enormous trees are completely covered
with them, creeping up and round the
stems ; staghorns, adorned with masses
of drooping ferns ornament the top-


most branches, and an occasional
glimpse of the foaming river rushing
through its rocky bed, and always
sounding, complete the wild beauty of
the ride.
We have decided to “camp” by the
river, and must explore the surround-
ing country.
Found a lovely little bathing place
underneath a rapid, where the water
rushes through a narrrow rocky
channel and spreads out below into a
smoother stream. It is a stream of
liquid crystal, and shows every stone
many feet below the surface, bright
and clear ; it was cold as ice, and we
could only stay in for a few minutes.
The sportsmen shot some Wongas
this afternoon, which Freddy plucked
and we cooked upon the coals, and
have them in readiness for breakfast
to-morrow. One of our party is suf-
fering from the bite of a soldier ant.
The early part of this afternoon was
taken up baking bread, the fire was
obstinately bad, and burnt cakes mixed
with ashes, was the result. After this
was accomplished, three of us went
down the river for some distance to
explore ; we walked and scrambled
for some time, until we came upon a
high bank, from which a lovely water-
fall could be seen. It was not a high
one, but might once have been—before
monstrous rocks had fallen in and
broken it. The water foamed round
and over them before it rushed through
a narrow channel between high-slop-
ing rocks, in the crevices of which a
few stunted trees grew, and met over
the narrow torrent. We got down the
bank somehow (I cannot remember
which part of it), and I sprang on to
one of the high centre rocks where
the water foamed all round it and me.
It was wild below, but when I turned,
to look upwards, where it flowed
peacefully underneath great swamp
oaks, yellow mimosas and soft green
trees, with ferns growing over and
among the stones, and tiny cascades
tumbling here and there, I felt that it
was as beautiful as a dream, and a fit
abode for “ Undine” and her misty re-
latives. We are enthusiasts, and
cannot bear to think of going away
and leaving anything so beautiful for-
ever— where the eye of man or woman
may perhaps never again be delighted
by its beauty.

Horrible thought! from chanting the Te
Deum,
To rush pell mell to Library and Museum.
Oh dire calamity, unlooked for woe,
Is this the object I should like to know
Of Public Institutions ?—this the way
To spend the hours of the seventh day—
In viewing curios brought from every
shore,
And feasting eyes on lions stuffed with
straw,
Or else in Public Libraries to pore,
Over some volume of forgotten lore ?
Do ye not grudge the precious time ye
lose
Among unconsecrated kangaroos,
And birds, and minerals, and marble
stones,
Relics, and skeletons, and fossil bones ?
Are ye not loath to waste the day of rest ?
To list to Pastor Allen sure were best.
To congregate by thousands in the Park,
And revel in a grand religious lark,
To see the army of policemen, backed
With the Military and the Riot Act,
Drawn up in stern and terrible array,
To run those in who’d rather fight than
pray:
Or else in social gatherings to meet
In publics at the comers of the street,
Where all, reclining at their ease, may
Again, and yet again, the friendly glass :


Then there is boating, fishing, Manly
Beach,
To cheer the soul, and righteousness to
teach;
And then— )h yes, a thousand differen;
modes
Of killing time in our own abodes ;
A quiet game of cards —short whist you
know,
At shilling points, will make the hours go
Or now and then, though making it no
rule,
We may indulge in just a round of pool;
While the ladies are happy, you’ll agree,
With just a little scandal and some tea.
Then why should Parliamentary rule be
made,
These old-established customs to invade;
Why change a mode of life that no one
shocks,
At once so moral, and so orthodox ?
’Tis tiue that reverend gentlemen refuse
To countenance these goings on —amuse
They may, but still they really cannot
bring
Their conscience to admit ’tis quite the
thing ;
For they, indeed, regard the seventh day
As one for meditation, not for play;
Nor can they but regard all men as
sinners,
Who want on Sunday more than Sunday
dinners;
Still, knowing that the human heart is
weak,
And mortal spirits worldly pleasures seek,
They pardon these amusements with a
smile
Of kind indulgence, for our earthly guile ;
For they, too, feel how much these things
entice,
And know, “though very naughty, yet
they’re nice.”
Then, too, as these delights occur in doors,
In no way can they interrupt the cause
Of pious teaching preached throughout
the state,
Or strict morality one jot abate ;
But once begin to open public places,
And circumstances straight way alter cases.
Then, then indeed, most surely is it time,
’Twixt sin and righteousness to draw the
line;
Then, if we wish morality to stand,
And peace to be preserved throughout the
land;
If we are loth all piety to see
Lost in the gulf of base iniquity ;
Or fearful lest the Church itself should
faff,
A monster meeting must we straightway
call;
To preach what should be on the day of
rest,
And ’gainst all innovations to protest;
To quote the Scriptures, and most clearly
show
Museums and Libraries lead straight
below ;
Or else in pious anger to review
The tumult and the sin that must ensue;
As well become idolaters, and throw
Virtue to all the stormy blasts that blow ;
As well turn frog-eaters without delay,
And repair each Sunday evening to the
Play,
As suffer this most sacrilegious law
To damn the ignorant, and corrupt the
raw.
True, there are some who strange opinions
hold
On these most sacred subjects, and make
bold
To say, that as for them they cannot see
Why the Museum and Public Library
Should not be opened, nor can they
Perceive their close connection with the
Play;
And every other most obnoxious faction,
So savouring of horrid French extraction:
Gladly would they afford this simple treat
To those who very seldom pleasures greet;
They the poor creatures whom Destiny
hath thrown,
To act the busy worker, not the drone;
They to whom life is full of care and
sorrow,
Who toil to-day that they may toil to-
morrow :
Who, until existence and the world is
past,
Must strive, and plod, and toil unto the
last.
To them would they extend a helping
hand,
And still the voice of censure and com-
mand;
For them would they create one glorious
day
Of peace and joy, to drive all care away;
A day on which all work should be forgot,
And not so hard should seem their bitter
lot;
A day which, all their toil then laid aside,
Should give them just a little fun beside.
This would they do, thus much relax the
rule
Of the orthodox and puritanic school:
Thus would they, pious churchmen, vex
and fret,


By so o’erstepping bounds of etiquette ;
And thus would weaken all established
notions,
As to what is meant by yielding chaste
devotions;
While they declare so much from right
they part,
“ True worship is the worship of the heart."
Ah well, for such as these we can but
sigh,
And to remove their evil thoughts must
try;
Must show them their indulgence would
allow
A state of things ne’er heard or dreamt
till now;
A fearful wilderness of sin and sorrow,
More terrible than Sodom or Gomorrah.
A wreck of all that is most chaste and
pure,
To open wide to wickedness the door;
To banish every thought of love and
grace,
And to make outraged virtue hide her
face.
Thus must we strive these notions to
erase,
And trust that all may mend their wicked
ways.

CHARADE.
“ Now, Mary, this will never do,

So now your boxes you may pack
Soon as you like.” Poor Mary burst

A fast train starts 20 minutes past 12
o’clock, it overtakes a luggage train which
travels 15 miles an hour, and after having
gone 15 miles further, overtakes a slow
passenger train, which travels 20 miles an
hour. Another fast train, which travels at
the srime rate as the first, starts from the
same station at 2 o’clock of that day, over-
takes the luggage train, and after having
gone 65 miles further, overtakes the slow
train also, and finds it has travelled 120
miles. Required the rate at which the fast
trains travel ?

MY LITTLE ADVENTURE.
It was a dread night. The rain urged
me to keep my umbrella up, and the wind
forced me to keep it down ; my umbrella
was turned inside out, and the wind play-
fully threw my hat under a neighbouring
archway.
There, after regaining possession of my
lost property, I ensconced myself, and strove
to repair my damaged gingham.
My labours were in vain; and I was about
to press down my hat over my eyes and
struggle home blindly, when a doctor’s
brougham drove up and stopped before the
door of the next house. The coachman was
half buried under wraps and furs, and I
noticed that he did not even look round
when his master left the carriage.
“ I have it,” I said immediately to
myself.
In a few minutes I sallied hurriedly forth
from my archway, laid hold of the handle of
the brougham door, and, in a voice which I
thought sounded remarkably medical, told
the coachman to drive to No. 2, Rosemary
Villas, West Brompton.
Then I got in, and was driven rapidly off
homeward.
Now, I live at No. 10, and as the coach-
man put me down at No. 2, I had only to
walk a few yards to find myself at home.
That done, I was out of sight, and out of
danger of discovery.
When I looked out through my Venetian
blinds, I could see the coachman sitting
patiently on his box in a semi-drowsy state;
and thus he remained until I went to bed.
Next morning the coachman had dis-
appeared.
The fate of the doctor himself, I regret
to say, I could never afterwards discover.
THE RECOGNITION.
Home they brought her sailor son,
Grown a man across the sea,
Tall and broad and black of beard,
And hoarse of voice as man may be.

Comes to play a sorry joke ? ”
Then they praised him—call d hirn “ smart,
“ Tightest lad that ever stept
But her son she did not know,
And she neither smiled nor wept.

A RAILWAY APPOINTMENT
She vowed she’d he mine,
I thought her divine,
And my heart beat with quick palpitation;
When she whispered that night,
By the moon’s pensive light, _
She would meet me at six at the station.
I longed for the hour,
And in spite of the shower,
Which made the streets muddy and dirty ;
On love’s errand bent,
To Ashfield I went,
And found myself there at five-thirty.
But I waited in vain,
And peered through the rain,
Only to meet disappointment;
On the platform she stood
All this time at Burwood ,
Thinking that was the place of appoint-
ment.
An hour she stayed,
The true-hearted maid,
Then we both took the train sorrow-
haunted ;
And colliding xpidway,
Her fierce glance seemed to say,
11 Avaunt,” and straight way we a vaunted.

THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMAN'S FERRY ROAD.
( Continued.)
Chapter VIII.
His present mind
Was under fascination ; he bell Id
A vision and adored the thing he saw.
Arabian fiction never filled the world
With half the wonders that were wrought for him
Earth m wed in one great presence of the spring.
Life turned the meanest of her implements
Before his eyes to price above all gold.
The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;
Her chamber window did surpass in glory
The portals of the dawn; all paradise
Could by the simple opening of a door
Let itself in upon him ; pathways, walks,
Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirits sank
Surcharged within him, overblest to move
Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world
To its dull round of ordinary cares,
A man too happy for mortality.
Very early in the morning of the day
following the events recorded in the
latter part of the last chapter, Mr.
Hay’s buggy and pair were brought
round by the groom to the front of the
Yarramundra Punt Hotel. The dew
was still falling, and a heavy bank of
nasty cloud canopied the bed of the
creek. Mr. Hay, an old stager, be-
lieved thoroughly in rising betimes,
agreeing with old Isaac Disraeli, that
in it is comprised the secret of the
magic art of multiplying one’s days.
“ An early start against the coun-
try,” said he to George Caldecott, as
our hero came out on the verandah all
ready for amove; “that mist there
creeping up the creek from the river
means a hot day, or I’m much mis-
taken ; so we will do wisely to dispose
of half of our forty-two miles before
the sun’s up any height, I wonder if
Miss Carrie has our coffee ready ac-
cording to promise.”
The words were hardly out of his
mouth when the young woman in
question appeared at the door of the
parlour and told them that their coffee
was poured out for them, and would
get cold if they weren’t quick.
Caldecott, as soon as he saw her,
hurried into the parlour, and taking
her aside, asked her,
“ Who is the De Vismes that arrived
here last night ?”
“ Mr. De Vismes,” replied Carrie,
blushing as she spoke, has been stay-
ing for some weeks with the Mus-
graves, of Pomargarlinga. He’s a
gentleman.”
“ And a particular friend of yours ?
eh ?” inquired George, who had noted
the blush.
“ Yes, a particular one, if you like.”
“ Well, if you don’t tell him of our
little flirtation,” whispered he, “I
won’t.”
t( Now, Mr. Caldecott, drink up
your coffee, we must be making a
start,” said Mr. Hay.
So, after a few minutes, farewell had
been taken of the daughter of the
hotel, and the buggy was moving to-
wards Uralmindry at a spanking pace.
A little more than an hour’s travel-
ling and
“ Up leaped of a sudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one ’
A few minutes radiance dispelled
the mist, and even while the shadows
of the buggy and its occupants were
hundreds of feet in length upon the
plain, the heat was intense, and the
flies which, but a brief space previ-
ously were invisible, now buzzed
around, streaming in from the four
cardinal points of the compass in in-
calculable swarms.
As they had been coming along,
George Caldecott had asked Mr. Hay
if he knew the Mr. De Vismes who
was staying at the Musgrave’s.
“ No,” said the old gentleman. “ I
do not, but the Musgraves, father and
son, are fine fellows. By-the-bye,
young Kit (they are cadets, you see,
of the Eden Hall p ople, and think
Christopher’s the only natural praeno-
men for a first born Musgrave). Young
Kit, as I was going 10 say, was in the
army—a light dragoon, if I mistake
not. You may have known him.”
Caldecott had known young Mus-
grave well, and wondered to hear of
the metamorphosis of the dashing


young hussar into a sheep farmer. He
no longer doubted that Carrie’s Mr.
De Vismes was the whilome friend who
had acted so treacherously to him.
Before the sun was an hour-and-a-
half high, Mr. Hay had halted his
ponies, unharnessed them, and hobbled
them out for a spell. Beneath the
grateful shade of a clump of wattles
the two travellers speedily improvised
a camp. Tea, of course, was made,
and many pipes smoked. Conversa-
tion was pleasantly diversified with
dreamy dozes. The flies would have
been a plague but for the tobacco
fumes, which reduced them to a toler-
able nuisance. At all events a not un-
comfortable mid-day bange was se-
cured. As the afternoon grew towards
evening the horses were put te, and
another move made in the direction of
their destination.
In the course of the second stage of
the journey, several fences were pas-
sed, not a few slip-rails having to
taken down and put up. As Mr. Hay
told his companion they were upon the
Uralmindry run.
At last, a little before sunset, they
came to a white gate, “ This is the
home paddock,’’ said Mr. Hay, “ we
shall be at the place in about ten mi-
nutes.”
The scenery in the paddock was
somewhat parklike. There was little
or no dead wood littering the grass.
The trees which had not been barbar-
ously ring-barked were tall and
shapely. The herbage, though rather
too closely cropped, was green and
fresh. The stock, both horses and
cattle, looked thriving and well-to-do.
All unmisfcakeably showed breeding.
Presently, as they topped a slight
ridge, a low house with an im-
mense verandah and numerous out-
houses and oflices appeared in sight.
From the front windows a garden vivid
with colour sloped to a shingly stream,
along the banks of which were grouped
at irregular intervals masses of luxu-
riant willows. The scene, as it glim-
mered in the light of the setting sun,
was charmingly idyllic. There was
nothing grand about it, but much that
indicated comfort. The place seemed
the abode of ancient peace.
“ That’s the place,” said Mr. Hay,
pointing with his whip towards the
house, “that’s Uralminrry. Mind
you, it’s not Mr. Walton’s home ; that’s
on the Hawkesbury, but it’s a place
where we spend several months in the
year, so it’s passably homelike. There
they are, just come out on to the
verandah, the old gentleman and Miss
Lucy. Do you see them ?”
“Yes,” repeated Caldecott, who had
noticed the young lady’s white dress a
good second or so before Mr. Hay had
spoken. Gazing at it, he could not
help thinking of the beauty and charm
of her who wore it—of the beauty and
charm which had so fascinated him
when on the morning of adventure
she had thanked him, though without
words, for having, at the hazard of
his own life, rescued hers from the
worst phase of peril.
As the buggy drove up to the ver-
andah at the back of the house, Mr,
Walton came out and greeted the
arrivals. Extending his right hand to
George, he said cheerily and with a
certain old time courtesy,
“ Welcome to Uralmindry, Mr.
Caldecott, a hearty welcome. I hope
your arm’s better; it can hardly be
well yet. ’
“ Thanks to Mr. Hay, it’s getting on
famously.”
“That’s right. Come in and—ah!
here she comes. Lucy, my dear, bid
Mr. Caldecott welcome.”
The sun was just setting. The
sunlit foliage of the passion-flower that
was trellised over the cottage walls
formed a perfect frame to the sweet
young girl as she came out to greet
her father’s guest. Her dress was
of white muslin, fashioned with great
simplicity. The only adornment she
had sought from art was a sash and
neck ribbon of deep blue. JNature
had done the rest, and right royally.
Caldecott, who had seen many beauti-
ful women in his time, thought he had
never witnessed anything so perfect.
But one glance at her and the fascina-
tion was complete.


“I do heartily bid him welcome,
papa,” said Lucy, holding out her
pretty hand to George ; “ and oh, Mr.
Caldecott, I do trust that your wound
is getting well. How rude you must
have thought me, never to have
thanked you on that awful day.”
“You did thank me Miss Walton,
and in a way I shall ever remember,”
replied Caldecott, thinking what a
soft little hand it was that had just
clasped his so loyally.
“ Come in ! come in! a glass of
brandy is'nt a bad thing after a long
drive ; is it, Hay ? Come in ! ” and
Mr.l Walton led the way into the
dining-room, where he insisted on
Lucy serving himself and friends with
brandy and water.
“ I think you’ll find the grog right
enough, Mr. Caldecott,” said Mr.
Walton.
“ While as for the cupbearer,” added
Mr. Hay, “if you can find her
equal ”
“ Now please be good, uncle,” cries
Lucy, stopping the old gentleman in
the middle of his observation ; adding,
“ you see, Mr. Caldecott, that they spoil
me. Though uncle’s a truthful enough
man in his way you musn’t believe
quite all he says. But I must go and
see about your supper, you romancing
old uncle. Mr. Caldecott’s room’s all
ready for him, papa.”
“ Come with me then, Mr. Calde-
cott,” said her father. Mr. Walton
led the way to a verandah bedroom
looking out upon the garden.
“ I hope you’ll find everything com-
fortable,” said the old gentleman,
opening the door, “and that if you
want anything you’ll let me know.”
The room seemed perfection to
George, possibly because he could
trace tasty feminine handiwork in so
many of the arrangements, in the
cherry-coloured ribbons that festooned
the mosquito-curtains, in the nosegay
that filled the vase upon the mantel-
piece, in tbe water colour drawing
(with a little “L ” in the corner) that
graced the space between the two win-
dows. Possibly her handiwork. Be-
cause of this possibility, rather this
extreme probability, his bedchamber
was to him a veritable “little white
rose of a room,” not only fragrant with
the perfume of flowers, but with the
charm of association. He was in love,
and she whom he loved had greeted
him with these thoughtful attentions!
Need it be said that George devoted
some care to his toilet, and that when
he went into the the drawing-room it
was with the conviction that he was
the luckiest dog alive ?
Miss Walton did the honours of her
father’s tea-table with easy graceful-
ness. Equally free from forwardness
as from bashfulness, she maintained
the happy mean which marks good
breeding. The meal was excellently
served, the only attendant being an
old female servant, who blended with
her anxious ofliciousness not a few
habits which indicated that she occu-
pied rather the position of housekeeper
than that of a menial domestic. She
recommended the scons, regretted the
scarcity of eggs, insisted upon Miss
Lucy taking some broiled chicken,
pressed Mr. Hay for an opinion of a
new batch of melon and lemon marma-
lade and displayed quite a maternal
solicitude that the guest should enjoy
himself. Old Mrs. Arnott had been for
years in Mr. Walton's service. She
had been nurse to Lucy as well as her
instructress in the noble art of plain
cookery, exact acquaintance with
which is the crown of ladyhood.
“ And do you really like digging,
Mr. Caldecott ? ” asked Lucy, in the
course of a postprandial conversation,
as sitting beneath the verandah they
watched the moon ascending from
behind the willows.
“Yes, honestly. It’s a life full of
adventure and excitement, and to me,
as yet, of novelty.”
“ But surely, after a soldier’s life,
it must seem v-' j ry tame ? ”
“Not at all, I assure you, Miss
Walton. Military life, even when on
active service, is far tamer than most
people imagine. The pomp and cir-
cumstance of glorious war are all for
the readers of the illustrated news-
papers, especially for those imagina-


tive beings who have great capacity
for evolving romance out of their
inner consciousness. Heal service is
usually monotonous enough. At all
events, there’s a hundred times less
monotony—less prosaic dullness in a
digger’s life.”
“There’s a damper for your poetic
notions, Lucy,” said Mr. Hay, “but,”
added he, turning to George, “are
you not unduly exalting the service
you have lately taken to at the expense
of the one you have left. Come now,
don’t you ever regret that you sold
out ? ”
“Hot a bit. You see, you can’t eat
your cake and have it. I’m not sorry
I served; neither am I sorry that I
have no longer the right to wear sword.
Che sara, sara, you know.’ ’
“I’ve no patience with you young
fellows of the present day,” cried Mr.
Hay, excitedly. “Your nil admirari
semi-fatalistic philosophy is an ac-
cursed thing. You care for nothing
except novelty ; acd so long as you
can get that, you’re perfectly indif-
ferent whether it be in the form of a
nigger breakdown or a new crusade.
Che sara , sara , indeed ? ”
“I really think Hay does well to be
angry,” said Mr. Walton, “ though I
must admit, Mr. Caldecott, that I can
thoroughly understand the fascination
of digging. Few squatters would per-
haps say as much, but I look to the
gold-mining excitement as likely to do
the colonies an immense amount of
social good.”
Mr. Hay whistled “ Bonnie Dundee”
defiantly, as he exchanged glances with
Lucy.
“ Well, we won’t go into the old
argument to-night. It’s getting late,
and Mr. Caldecott must be tired :
besides, he’s not off the sick list yet.
We’ll tackle you to-morrow, Hay;
I and our friend against you and that
little Tory in petticoats. And we’ll
beat them, Mr. Caldecott, beat them
hollow, and make them march under
the yoke.”
Lucy gave a charming little pout, as
much as to say that little Tories in
petticoats were not so easily overcome
in argument—marching under the yoke
indeed!
“Good night, champion,’*’ she said
to Mr. Hay, as she gave him a kiss.
“ I’m not afraid of them, not one bit.”
‘ • Afraid of them! psh aw! God bless
you, my darling.”
Having received her father’s blessing
and bidden Mr. Caldecott good night,
Lucy retired to her room.
Mr. Walton then showed his guest
to his bedchamber with all the courtesy
of the old school.
“If you are an early riser, and care
for a bogie, I’ll call you at half-past
five.”
“Please do, Mr. Walton ; I shall
thoroughly enjoy it. Good night.”
On the following morning, before the
hour named, George was up, leaning
out of the window of his room, drink-
ing in the bright freshness of the morn,
watching with an exquisite sense of
enjoyment
“ The velvety'bees in convolvolus bells
And roses of bountiful Spring
and thinking what a happy life a
fellow might lead in such a home
with such a wife as Lucy Walton.
(To be continued.)
Humanity. —A German homoeopathic
physician, previous to sallying forth, armed,
to take part in the Berlin struggle for free-
dom, was observed subjecting his bullets to
some chemical process. He comrades, sup-
posing that he was poisoning the lead,
remonstrated with him. “ Gentlemen,” he
replied, “ you totally misconceive my inten-
tions. Humanity is my aim, and shall ever
be the only object of my life. Observe, if
you please, that this is not poison in which
I lay my bullets, but tincture of arnica.
The oxide thus produced serves as an
infallible homoeopathic cure for the wound,
which, if not at once fatal, is certain to be
healed before morning.”
A doctor returned a coat to a tailor
because it did not fit him. The tailor
seeing the doctor at the funeral of one of
his patients, said, ‘‘Ah, doctor, you are a
happy man !” “ Why so?” asked the
doctor. “ Because,” replied the tailor,
“you never have any of your bad work
returned on your hands.”


TOWN GOSSIP
Touching the death of the unfor-
tunate man who was run over by a
train at Burwood, a few days ago,
we cannot see that the smallest
particle of blame rests with the
Railway Department. The scene
was a level crossing in charge of a
maD whose special duty it is to warn
passengers of passing trains. 1 his
duty he faithfully performed, and if
a madman chose to take the oppor-
tunity of the approaching train to
commit suicide in defiance of that
warning, no one should be censured.
The idea of constructing railway
bridges at all the suburban stations
for foot passengers to cross over, is
rather amusing. No doubt these
are desirable at large stations where
there is a great deal of traffic and
where the up and down platforms
are opposite to each other; but at
small suburban stopping places they
would be useless, and a waste of
money which might be far more
profitably spent in enlarging the
platforms and giving increased ac-
commodation in the way of offices.
How is it that the Railway autho-
rities will persist in erecting such
Liliputian buildings at all the new
stopping places —platforms about 5
feet wide, and waiting rooms cal-
culated to hold half a dozen pas-
sengers ? Is not this being penny
wise and pound foolish, since it will
soon be necessary to replace these
structures with others much larger
and more commodious ? A narrow
platform is very dangerous, espe-
cially in holiday times, when excur-
sion trains attract large numbers of
travellers; while the danger to life
in crossing the line at a station
resonant with the fearful shrieks of
the engine, and the caution always
given by the officials, is reduced to
a minimum. It is far more difficult
to cross George-street during the
busy part of the day in safety, yet
no one suggests over-bridges in that
thoroughfare. It was not found that
the additional railing at the top of
the Monument in London reduced
the number of suicides. Bridges are
gen erally rather attractive to persons
of this class.
The election of Sir W. Manning to
the Chancellorship of the University
of Sydney, will not very favorably
affect the fortunes of that already
somewhat too mediaeval institution.
It simply means the triumph of a
clique, and what the triumph of a
clique means hardly requires expla-
nation in a community which can
trace more than half its failures to
the rampant selfihness which sets
coterie against coterie to the ignor-
ing of the general interests of the
common weal
Signor D’ Albertis is not likely
to be snuffed out by the over-righte-
ous indignation and maudlin senti-
mentality of the Rev. Mr. Jeffries.
We are no advocates of thoughtless
exploration, of expeditions waged
like those of the Spaniard in Mexico
and Peru, in the spirit of wanton
lust of conquest or unscrupulous
greed of plunder. But in the inter-
ests of civilization, the exploration
of such a country as New Guinea
must be undertaken, and it is idle
to expect such work to be done by
men who are not prepared to hold
their own. Had the great Eliza-
bethan navigators gone forth to win
the secret of the sea with their
hands fettered by the “ rose-water’’
precepts of Mr. Jeffries, they would
never have won the fame that still,
halo-like, encircles the name of
Drake, of Frobisher, of Raleigh.
The missionary for our money is a
man like Stanley, who, with equal


ease, can fight his way (if need be)
through hosts of opposing savages,
shame a despot like Mtesa into
mercy, or translate you a Gospel
into the vulgar tongue of an African
kingdom Aut inneniam aut faciam
viam. That’s the true explorer’s
motto, and acting up to it requires
besides trust in God and a due re-
gard for one’s neighbour’s (the
savage’s) rights—a supply of pow-
der, kept dry, and a practical ac-
quaintance with the rifle. “You
musn’t flog a brutal felon,” says
Mr. Driver, one day ; “ sTou musn’t
shoot a treacherous Pagan,” says
Mr. Jeffries, another. Accept these
teachings and the day will come
when your goods won’t be safe in
the store or your daughters in the
street, and when in the fertile lands
of Africa and New Guinea, the god-
less, bloodthirsty, obscene and
cruel savage will be left in the un-
disputed possession of all he sur-
veys.
So, on Friday next, Mr. John
Davies, whose rabid Protestantism
makes him the darling of the
tawny yellow crew, is to ask the
Assembly to hark back on the Sab-
batarian question —to stultify itself
by rescinding the resolutions which,
on the motion of Mr. Hurley, it de-
liberately passed last week. So
strangely Lower House con-
stituted, that we shall not be sur-
prised if Mr. Davies wins—(every
dog has his day, you know), but if
he does it will be at the expense of
the self-respect of the Assembly,
and of that spirit of religious tole-
ration which is presumed to be the
basis of the constitution of the
colony. We subjoin an epigram
clipped from an English paper, which
struck us as being singularly apro-
pos to our remarks on this subject
last week:—
Oar creed is Swanky and Te Deunis, !
Keep Church and Public open wide,
But shut up all Museums.
The vote is good and pleases well
Both Brewer and Divine,
It says, “ The Sabbath sacred is
Sacred to Beer and Wine.”
Here is a wrinkle for Mr. Came-
ron ! Instead of a Hansard, why
not have telephonic communication
between each member of the As-
sembly and the offices of the journals
circulating in the electorate he re-
presents ? This idea properly worked
out, would secure for those members,
who resent having their weighty ut-
down, the object they
have in view, to wit, the full report
of their oracular deliverances, while
it would limit the nuisance of having
to wade through the said deliverances
to the persons whose votes returned
to the national talking shop the gar-
rulous humbug or humbugs in ques-
tion.
Lord Beaconsfield havingplayed
the cards of the Turkish bondholders
is about, as it would seem, to reap
the reward which luck sometimes
accords to those who play a desperate
game. Of course, now that war is,
by his infatuated policy, imminent,
he finds the people with him—with
him, that is to say, on the question
of upholding England’s honour. Any
British Minister can rely on the
patriotism of the people when the
dignity of the empire is actually at
stake. However stupid the blunder-
ing which allowed the nation to drift
into war, let war be at once declared,
and the blundering Ministers will
find even their keenest critics siding
with them in the effort to make the
nation’s blow sharp and effective.
The Premier knows this well enough,
but it will take a cleverer man than
even Benjamin Disraeli to make his-
tory believe that the enthusiasm of


the people to-day is for his policy.
With us the difficulty is to discover
what is the real casus belli as between
England and Russia. Nominal ones
are plentiful enough on the lips of
diplomacy. But the real one ? Is
it not, after all, a matter of “If I
had —s ’ and “or else —s ” You
remember, do you not gentle reader ?
the story of the king who sent to
another king saying, “ Send me a
blue pig with a black tail, or else
The other, in high dudgeon
at the presumed insult, replied, “ I
have not got one, and if I had .”
On this weighty cause they went to
war for many years. After their
armies and resources were exhausted
and their kingdoms mutually laid
waste, they consulted about the pre-
liminaries of peace j but before this
could be concluded, a diplomatic ex-
planation was first needed of the in-
sulting language which formed the
ground of the quarrel “ What could
you mean,” said the second king to
the first, by saying, ‘ Send me a
blue pig with a black tail, or else
.’ ” a Why,” said the other, “ I
meant a blue pig with a black tail,
or else some other colour.” u But,”
retorted he, “ Wbat did you mean
by saying, I have not got one, and if
I had .” “ Why, of course, if I
had I should have sent it,” an ex-
planation which was entirely satis-
factory, and peace was concluded
accordingly. The party nicknamed
" Peace at any price ” thought that
the explanation might have been
rendered before the hostilities com-
menced. But the diplomatists proved
(at least they said they did, and
that’s all the same), by balance of
power, by protocols, ultimatums, and
what not, that the peace party were
traitors and fools.

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers “a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature.— S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says: —lt is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. Gil os, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Country
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
Sydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
the day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house, and an
agreeable companion to every reader.—
Southern Argus (Goulbum).
“Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
pearance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
Barlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a inagazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands a better
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are born but to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says: —The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.”— Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may be per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend that
everything in the shape of “ news ” items
should be omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
—Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political status in quo , a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the ‘ ‘ Paradise Lost ” —intended for the use
of University candidates —a clever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an Immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sphinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hop * the new
organ will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors.— Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains wed written papers
and sketches, entitled “ The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing,” “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summary o
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Svdney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney.— Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week. —Thisisthe titleof a new
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Sydney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Etcetera,”
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
book, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenterjield Star says:—Besides
containing a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says: —We have
looked the hook carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages. — Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation.— Border Post( Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable.— Western Post
(Mudgce).
The Bathurst Free Press says:—lt con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter—grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living.tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper. —Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers.— Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week ” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
loeal. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches —we
note specially “The Best Dog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,”—
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, “ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to he continued regularly.
Once a Week we can conscientiously re-
commend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
'J hose" who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse ouropinion.— Cumberland Mercury.
The Sydney “Once a Week ” —The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and general
get up are equE-1 to those cfthe first
number which v<- had to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light leading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. Altogether the number does credit
to editor and printer. — S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says:—“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written —the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “ Best Dog in the Colony.”
We have every confidence in recommend-
ing “Once a Week” to the favorable
notice of our readers.”
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
just received the eighth number of “ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might he lost to the general
public, and also established, a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week. —This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches. —
S. M. Herald.
The Sydney “ Once a Week.’' —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now he looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may be congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
Sydney “Once a Week. —The new
number of this capital little serial quite
sustains the character of its predecessors.
Charley Cornstalk’s “ Sporting Adven-
tures’’and the “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry ” are continued. The Rev. A. W.
Petre commences a new story, entitled
“ Aunt Rebecca’s Secret,” which promises
to be good. There is another article on
the “ Public Health,” and a variety of
useful and amusing contributions make up
a very readable and pleasant number. —
Echo, April 12.
Sydney “ Once a Week.” This
weekly magazine keeps up the reputation
it has earned for itself, as a well printed
entertaining serial. The local articles and
sketches are good, and there is a large
variety of interesting reading matter.—
S. M. Herald , April 13.
