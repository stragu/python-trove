JUSTICES’ JUSTICE
It is becoming a serious question
with many thoughtful minds whether
there is not just at present a ten-
dency to over legislation, especially
with regard to all matters of small
concern—a tendency on the part of
parliaments to make the peoples they
legislate for give obedience to absurd
minutiae, while provisions in the in-
terests of higher law are compla-
cently omitted. Be that as it may
with reference to legislation, one
thing is certain —there is a great
deal too much justice, i.e , justices’
justice, in New South Wales. The
country is over justiced in point of
fact, and instead of in the multitude
cf its J.’sP. the people finding wis-
dom, there is with most observers
rather a disposition to admit that the
national broth is being spoilt by
what the heathen Chinee would term
the “ too-muchiness ” of the cooks.


The barons an 1 priests who atßunny-
mede complained of the vexatiousness
of having no justice, of never being
able to find a judge, would possibly
have been as little pleased with a
system which, while making magis_
trates as plentiful as blackberries,
does as little to securing practical
justice as did the non-system they
rose up against in arms. In these
days of telegram and telephone, it
is of the very essence of practical
justice that it should be expeditious ;
not the expedition satirised by
Pope—
“ The hungry judges soon the sentence
sign,
And wretches hang that jurymen may
dine;”
not the swiftness produced by such
causes, but the energetic promptness
that characterises the ordinary com-
mercial transactions of business
men. In o:dinary cases we admit
that the business of the police courts
is administered with tolerably suffi-
cient briskness; but in extraordinary
cases —that is, just in those very
cases in which promptness is the
most urgently needed, since they are
those round which partizanry and
bad blood almost necessarily collect,
legal greed and magisterial bias are
allowed to make up a spectacle of
the law’s delay which is absolutely
scandalous.
The whole of the business of the
police courts in all large centres of
population must be taken out of the
hands of the great unpaid and en-
trusted to responsible and capable
stipendaries, and the prosecution of
all alleged criminals must be con-
ducted by salaried officials ; not by
specially retained counsel, whose fees
and refreshers are multiplied by pro-
crastination. These reforms must be
made, if the decisions given in petty
sessions are to command the confi-
dence of the people.
We urge upon the Government
the immediate necessity which exists
for such a thorough reform in the
magisterial system. The term
“ packed bench ” is daily used to
define an evil as common now as it
was in the days of the Stuarts; only
to-day it does not mean one packed
by the unscrupulous minions of a
corrupt court, but one equally partial,
got together by the sectarian bigotry,
the ‘‘shop” interests, the personal
prejudices, or the political chicanery
of the magistrates themselves; and
the result is a festering sore which
forebodes impending ruin to the body
corporate.

MISSING LEAR ONES.
0 Sweetheart, wearing out thy hours
In idle hopes that one may yet
Dry all thy tears, and grace with flowers
What now is saddened by regret,
Thy hopes are vain, bright though
they seem.
He cannot come ! His lusty youth
Death hath enlisted. Thy fond dream
Can never ripen into truth,
0 Mother, yearning all thy days
For one thy songs once hushed to
rest,
Chiding the cruel cold delays
That keep thy darling from thy
breast;
He cannot come ! Black waters glide
O’er whitened bones ; and rushes
green
His requiem whisper to the tide,
Which hears and hurries from the
scene.
O Sister, weeping in the night,
Longing to greet thy brother home,
And wondering why he doth not write
With words of love! He cannot
come !
Ho loved you! Yes, his last fond
thoughts,
Fronting the death-blow undismayed,
Were vivid memories of sports
With you in summer gardens played.
Yet, mourners, yield not all to grief!
Let not a tearful trouble rust
Your tempered brightness of belief—
Your capability to trust
In One who stilled the tempest’s roar,
Who calms lorn hearts with sorrow
tossed,
And who Hereafter doth restore
All that true love on Earth has lost.
S.
BARKER’S TUTORSHIP.
BY THOMAS MOSER.
“Well! I’m off for old England
to-morrow, old fellow ! Fill your glass
and pass the claret!” Nunc vino
pellite curas! Gras ingens iterabimus
cequor. So sang old Horace, who, I
fancy, in his time must have suffered
from mal-de-mer , like Britons in
these latter days. Thus spoke my old
friend John Barker, 8.A., as we sat
together with our feet in the fender
of a snug parlour in a Sydney hotel (a
great rarity by the way), and drank
to his safe journey to Europe. “I do
not suppose” said Barker, “that I
have’ done much good to the com-
munity in this colony since I came
here, but I have been the means of
bringing as an anointed a scoundrel to
justice as could well be found under
the canopy of heaven.” “You mean
that man Brandem, I suppose,” said
I. “ I see, he has got seven years,—
the first one in Berrima. I hardly
know the facts, for one cattle stealing
case seems so like another that I
rarely read the reports, and, in fact,
I have reported too many of them in
my time to make them a novelty.”
“ Do you want the whole history ?”
said Barker, “It is a long one, but
I’ll cut it as short as I can if you will
only listen. Fill your pipe in the
mean time.” The calumet was set
going and Barker then delivered him-
self of what may in the main be here
accepted as facts, though, for obvious
reasons, names are suppressed and
minor details altered.
“When I left Oxford, where I did
not do great things by the way, I
looked about to see how I was to get
a living. A curacy on £7O a year and
find yourself was about the only thing
visible, and as I could not consci-
entiously take orders, I thought I
would try the colonies, and I never
found out that a man’s education was
rather an impediment to his getting on
in the world till I got here. I had
little or no money, for father was
a poor rector, as usual, with a large


family, as they nearly always have —
olives always throwing out the most
shoots on the poorest soil—hence I
had nothing to invest except what
brains I had. I tried literature, but
I found that the man who set the
article earned more than the man who
wrote it. I found out that iiterature
was paid for by the foot rule, and that
a man who spent forty-eight hours in
compiling a synopsis of twenty pages
of crabbed statistics was paid less
than he who spun out three columns
of trash chattered at a religious tea
meeting. Quantity w r as the thing not
quality, and what pleased a certain
section of subscribers was of more
importance than the specific literary
value. I could not live by literature,
so I “ cut” that and a mosc lucrative
offer of commission at 7 per cent, for
an incipient wine merchant next
engrossed my attention. My small
connection evidently was paid for, not
my commercial ability. I had to sue
my small circle of friends in forma,
‘pauperis, and ask them to Mr.
Vault a “lift” because I should get
a trifle out of the transaction. If Mr.
Vault would have supplied the genuine
article I should not have complained,
but he didn’t, and I found myself
sacrificing friendships, which I could
ill afford to lose, b-cause Mr. Vault
“ doctored ” his wines and well nigh
ruined the digestive organs of those
whom I unconsciously cajoled into pur-
chasing them. What reputation I
had would have speedily gone had I
continued long in the wine trade, but
one morning an advertisement in a
newspaper caught my eye, and it ran
as follows: —
Educational. —Wanted a tutor for
the country in a private family.
Graduate of a University preferred.
Apply to John Hides, stock and station
agent.
I was not long before I “inter-
viewed” (how I hate that Mr.
Hides, whom I found digesting an
invoice. I soon explained my errand
and found that Mr. Hides knew very
little about the nature of his adver-
tisement. It had he said been put in
the paper by him through instructions
from Mr. Brandem of Duffer Creek.
The salary would be forty pounds a
year with board and lodging, but how
many children there were to teach he
did not know. “He is one of those
rough fellows who has made his way
you know” said Mr. Hides, “ and I
expect you can do very much as you
like. If you are fond of riding about
and have a fancy for bush life I do
not see that you could do better. You
are a college man I see! You did not
happen to know a brother of mine.”
“Not that I know of” said I. “Ah!
he was at college. Senior wrangler I
believe.” “Well, then, he was at
Cambridge” said I. “No, he was
not” said Mr. Hides. “ Where was
it again, Joe was it? Oh! I have it.
It was at St. Bees ; spendid college
that; considerably ahead of Oxford,
I fancy.” I did not argue the point.
“Well !” now said Mr. Hides at
length, “ What is it to be ? will you
go to Brandem’s ? make up your
mind, for I’m busy !” “I suppose I
must ” said I as I rattled pretty well
all' s the cash I had, in my trousers
pocket. “ There’s no must about it ;
but if you mean to accept sign that ”
said he, pushing over a paper which
looked as if it was a drover’s agree-
ment altered to suit the case. The
terms were, that I was engaged for
twelve months, subject to a quarter’s
notice on either side, to undertake the
plain education of Mr. Brandem’s
children and to make myself gene-
rally useful, a very elastic kind of
duty as I afterwards found out. Mr.
Hides advanced me £5 to take me to
Duffer Creek, got my receipt and told
me that it could be repaid me if I
fulfilled my engagement, and forfeited
if I did not—a proviso which by the
ay, “ was not in the bond.
Duffer’s Creek was some three hun-
dred miles from the metropolis, and
was reached in about three days, by a
vehicle which was said to be a Cobb
and Co.’s coach, but which resembled
a ’gigantic gin case on wheels. My


companion throughout the journey was
an old woman, the wife of a country
publican in the neighbourhood of
Duffer’s Creek, and who, acting upon
the essentially Colonial publican’s code
of honour, that when a way from home
it is necessary to treat everyone to
liquor, carried it out so completely as
to waver between intoxication partial
and intoxication complete the whole
journey. For a considerable part of
the latter we had the cheerful com-
panionship of a policeman and a
lunatic. The latter showed symptoms
of making things uncommonly lively
at the start, stoutly complaining that
he should be compelled to associate
with a “trap but when he had got
shaken up well for a few miles, his
ideas took another turn, and he came
to the conclusion that he was “ at sea”
practically as well as metaphorically.
He drew our attention repeatedly to
logs and lumps of wood, which he
designated as fish, and wound up
ultimately, as we drew up at a way-
side post office, by deliberately taking
a “ header” out of the coach, and we
left him in charge of the constable
with his skull fractured. The old lady,
though personally an offensive com-
panion, after all was exceedingly use-
ful to me, as she knew all about Mr.
Brandem and his family, and a very
bad lot she made them out to be.
“Who shook Micky Hogan’s calf, I’d
like to know, but him ? ” said she, as if
I knew all about it and could corro-
borate the fact. “ Why, Brandem’s
people would shake anything; and the
only calf Mrs. Hogan had, too!” I
thought of Nathan and David, but I
merely remarked that it was probably
a case of mistaken identity. “ Mis-
taken, eh?” said she: “some folks
are easily mistaken ! So, you’re going
to be schoolmaster there, are you?
God help you! Didn’t I know poor
Mr. Cocker who was there, and a
decent gentleman he was when he
hadn’t the ‘horrors.’ If he hadn’t
knocked a slab out of our stable where
we had him locked up all night, and
got lost in the bush, he’d been alive
now, poor fellow ! ” “ Why, what
made you let him drink like that for ?”
said I, fancying I saw a little indirect
manslaughter cropping out against the
old woman. Let him drink! said
she. “ How are we to pay our license
if we keep corks in the bottles ? If he
hadn’t got it from us, he would at
Trotter’s place; and we might as well
have had his money as them. He
owed us five pound when he died, and
he said a week before that Brandem
owed him ten. My * old man ’ will have
to get it somehow/’ I fervently made
up my mind that that same “ old man”
never should if I could help it. With
such-like conversation, only relieved
by occasional stoppages at roadside
public-houses where the old woman
invariably alighted to refresh herself
and any thirsty souls she found about—
upon which occasions she made it her
business to give sage advice to the
landlandies who either had families
or were expecting the same, which
opened up a fresh topic when we
again started—l wended my weary
journey to Duffer’s Creek.
I suppose, with a prophetic antici-
pation that I should ere long follow in
the steps of the late Mr. Cocker, my
predecessor, the “old man” I had
heard of was most profuse in his offers
of hospitality, requesting me not to
“take a shingle off the house,” and
insisted upon my refreshing myself
with what looked like liquid blacking
and smelt like a musty sugar-bag,
which he said was “ supernaculum
rum.” I declined the draught, but
accepted the loan of a horse to take me
to Mr. Brandem’s. “ The cove didn’t
shout , did he ?” I heard an inebriated
shepherd enquire of a blear-eyed
Silenus in the verandah. “ Not he ! ”
was the rejoinder, “ the smell.”
“ He won’t last long at old Brandem’s,
then, you bet your boots. ? ” remarked
the first vagabond, who apparently had
fancied that he had missed a good thing
by accident.
My companion, who undertook to
show me the road, was a youth who
would have made a good telegraph-
post or a smart light-house if he could
have retained his form in an inanimate


state. His hair was long and straight
and profusely greased. He wore no
coat, but a Crimean shirt and a waist-
coat originally blue with a deep drab
border like coach-trimming. His trou-
sers were tight to his lanky limbs, and
were what is called “strapped” with
moleskin outside and inside with a
brown material. He smoked a short
pipe, and when he was not standing in
his stirrups and holding on to his
horse’s mane, galloping ahead, his
mind was apparently intent on show-
ing me how many sentences he could
compose wherein the word “ bloody”
could be introduced. In this particular
he was a fair success , though I have
heard better hands at it than he—but
he was but young.
When Mr. Hides told me that I
should have a bush life of it he spoke
true enough, and it is a pity that' he
did not prove equally veracious in
other matters. The house was a long
slab building covered with bark and a
deep verandah all round. It stood in
a small enclosure, and, except a few
straggling peach trees, which had
apparently been self-sown and never
pruned, there was no attempt to make
it look civilised. Two or three old
huts and sheds were at the back, and a
stockyard where they “killed,” with a
huge gallows sticking up, gave the
place a real “ old hand ” look, which
betokened hard fare and “ shady ”
company.
My employer I should not have re-
cognized if my guide had not picked
him out, as he differed so little from a
number of men about him. He was a
great broad-shouldered man, with a
face which for colour, might have
been an old rusty boot or a potatoe.
The features were hard and wooden,
and wore an expression in which low
cunning and sensuality were stupidly
combined. I handed in my creden-
tials from Mr. Hides, which appar-
ently Mr. Brandem had some difficulty
in reading, and did not seem best
pleased when he did. “I wrote him
the other day not to mind,” he mut-
tered, “but as you’re here I suppose
I’ll have to keep you. But come in-
side/' said he, “ my missus will camp
you down somehow.” With a gruff
remark to his wife “ that I was the
new schoolmaster, ’ he left me to her
care and went outside, where I heard
him relieving his mind with a few
oaths, directed in a general way at
“swells.” It was one of this remark-
ableman’sidiosyncrasies that “swells,”
as he called them, should be hunted
off the face of the earth; one probably
engendered by the^fact that the gentry
in the neighbourhood gave him sys-
tematically the cold shoulder, and so
raised his ire. His wifp was a miser-
able careworn looking woman, who
evidently had seen hard times, and
who between the bullying of her
husband and the perfect insubordina-
tion of her three hulking boys, had a
very sad time of it; for among other
peculiarities, such as occasionally
knocking her down and kicking her,
Mr. Brandem invested periodically in
several gallons of rum, and lay about
the premises until he consumed it.
This, his offspring euphoniously
termed “ being on the bust,” and they
kept religiously out of the way, from
possibly a wholesome dread of kicks
and contamination combined. The
poor wife had to bear it all. With a
father a mere brute and a mother the
“ weakest possible vessel,” what could
be expected of the children ? They
were only fit for a reformatory. The
eldest, Billy, was about sixteen, and
knew enough villany for a man of
sixty ; while the other two, Dick and
Joe, were fast treading on his heels.
Anything like subordination I soon
found was hopeless except under very
strong measures, and I at last com-
plained to their father. I got a cheer-
ful rejoinder. “ Why,” said he, with
an oath hurled at me which I would
have liked to have acknowledged the
receipt of in my own way, “What
did I hire you for ? If you don't
know how to teach ’em, cut the job 1’
I threatened to thrash Master Dick
the first chance he gave me ; but, to
my astonishment, when I overheard
him telling his father of the promised
chastisement the latter replied “that


if he let me thrash him he’d knock
his head off, and to treat me as he did
Cocker”—my ill-starred predecessor;
that way, I subsequently found out,
was to wait till poor Cocker got hope-
lessly drunk, and after making game
of him for an hour, to pretty well
half kill him. I soon got an opportu-
nity, and if I did not hammer that
youth Dick it was a pity. I only wish
I could have got the same chance at
the old man, but he* was too big a
coward to give me it, except by covert
insults, which I never took the trouble
to resent.
It would take too long to describe
the wretched life I led in this place
for many weeks with no associate I
could hold rational conversation with,
not a book fit to read in the place; a
small skillion room some eight feet by
seven my only place for privacy in-
doors ; and but that for Cocker, who
must have had some refinement about
him, had plastered the walls with a
few choice scraps from the weekly
journals, I might just as well have
lived in a jail. A gleam of sunshine,
however, did illumine my path. I
was allowed an old screw of a horse to
ride about on, and although the poor
brute could not get out of an amble,
I did manage to get him four miles
miles away from home and back with-
out any great difficulty. I tojk an
interest in this ill-starred beast, and
my usual ride daily was more to pick
out some out-of-the-way gulley where
I could hobble him out, and let him
fill his poor belly than anything else.
It was on one of these trips that I
made the acquaintance of George
Crawley, a young gentlemanly fellow,
whose father owned the head station
of Thornwood. The lutter had been
an officer in the Indian cavalry, but
failing health brought him to the
colonies. He had some money, and a
wife, three sons, and a daughter. He
remained in Melbourne until he had
completed his daughter’s education,
and in the meantime put the boys on
an 1 inland station, where they were
getting well drilled into the manage-
ment of cattle. He then bought
Thornwood, stocked it, and settled
down. George and I soon ‘ ‘chummed, ”
and a carte blanche £o spend my Sun-
days at Thornwood was the result.
How I used to count the davs in the
week to get away there ! Sundays at
Duffers’ Plains were something awful.
The verandah posts, which were all
garnished with hooks for hanging up
horses, were lined with these animals
like a cavalry barrack, and about
twenty low-looking villains sat down
to dinner cf corned beef and bread
with gallons of tea, and performed
the most startling feats in the way of
knife swallowing ever witnessed. The
talk was of mares —black, brown, and
grey, coming publicans’ races, and
horse and bullock matters generally;
while I sat silently by, only too glad
to bolt my meals like the rest and
retire to my illustrated den. Fortu-
nately for me, so mneh villainy was
concocted on those days that the
further my ears were away the better,
and no objection was made to my ab-
sence ; but when I returned, usually
to find my employer half-drunk and
quarrelsome, I had to sit and listen to
a series of objurgations and low indi-
rect abuse of “ swells ” generally, and
my new found friends the Orawleys in
particular, and retire at last to my
den and clench my teeth with
smothered rage that I could not haul
my respected friend Mr. Brandem out
into his paddock and “ dress him
down ” to some tuue.
A bigoted determination that I would
see my time out; that I would not
forfeit my five pounds, and that I
would not get my salary, had somehow
fixed itself on my mind ; and in spite
of all the persuasion the Crawleys
attempted to get me to stay with them
until Captain Crawley’s influence in
Melbourne could secure me something
more congenial, I stuck to my post.
Now it so happened that the wife of
“ Black Harry,” Brandem’s head
stockman, became seriously ill ;so ill,
in lact, that she was all but gone. No
one knew what to do with her, and as
a last resource I rode over to the
Crawley’s for medicine. The captain,


who, amongst other accomplishments,
had some idea of rough doctoring,
came back with me and induced
“ Black Harry ”to send her over to
Thornwood, where tney would try and
pull her through. The experiment
was so far successful that, perhaps
more by good treatment than anything
else, she was soon in a fair way for
recovery. Mrs. and Miss Crawley
hardly ever left her, and had she been
their own flesh and blood they could
not have done more. “ Black Harry,”
half ruffian as he was in many res-
pects, knew this, and that he did not
forget it, the sequel will show.
Now I may premise that the Craw-
ley’s station was a fattening and not a
breeding one; that is to say they
bought store cattle every year and fat-
tened them off. There was still a
debt on the station, and it was antici-
pated that as cattle had risen much in
price in Victoria, that the next draft
would pay the mortgage off. So much
had George Crawley talked to me of
this, and so often had he referred to
the time when having sold off the draft
he could go in for a bit of fun in Mel-
bourne, that I who had no interest in
the affair, really began to fancy myself
a particeps negotvi. “ I wish you were
going overlanding with us, old fellow, ’
he would say, as we rested our horses
after rounding the mob up on the
camping ground, near a waterhole,
hedged round with myall scrub. “So
do I,” thought I, “ but it couldn’t be
this trip.” “ Are not they beauties ?”
said George, pointing out some sleek
* nine hundred weighters/ the grass on
the road is first-rate —I’ll land them as
good as they are now. Are not those
J. P. bullocks A 1 ?” Such conversa-
tion as this had taken place so often,
and so many times had I ridden
through the mob, that I believe I
knew every beast. It was after one of
these interviews, and on my return
home, that I was surprised on reach-
ing the house to notice that my advent
suddenly broke up a group consisting
of my employer and two strange-look-
ing men, who were apparently in deep
confab. It was difficult to tell what
Brandem was thinking of by any change
in his features, which had no more ex-
pression in them than a ginger beer
bottle, but his companions two thorough
paced “gully rakers,” Irom appearance,
treated me to an inquisitive stare
that had much suspicion about it. I
found myself so clearly in the way that
I made an excuse for not attending the
supper table, and after exhausting an
my ingenuity to wile away the time in
my den, it struck me that as I had
seen Black Harry’s wife that day, I
would go down to his hut and tell him
how she was.
Harry was in bed when I knocked at
the door, and rose to let me in. “ Is
that you, Mr. Barker ?” said he, “ I
did not think you were back yet. “ I
was over seeing Jenny at the Captain’s,
this morning, and she seemed getting
on nicely.” “Wait till I get a light.”
So saying, he uncovered the ashes in
the fire-place, and tearing a piece of
bark from the inside of the roof, he
chafed it to shreds in his hands, then
dropped a red hot ember into it and
blew the bark into a flame, with which
he lighted a slush lamp, made of an
old pannikin, filled with fat and a piece
of an old shirt rolled up for a wick.
The hut was a miserable place
enough. It had only one room, ar. the
end of which was a four-post bedstead,
made of saplings, with a sheet of bark
for a palliass, and a straw tick for a
mattrass, a couple of rough stools, a
wooden settle, which did duty as a
couch, and a ricketty table, made of
old packing cases, were all the furni-
ture in it. A couple ot saddles hung
across the beams, a bridle or two on
long pegs round the walls ; two or
three pair of hobbles and several stock-
whips ; an impromptu dresser, made
by driving pegs into the slabs, and
putting a paling across, on which
were a plate or two ; two or three pan-
nikins, and a dish, all of tin, pretty
well completed the inventory of chat-
ties, outside wearing apparel, which
hung about the Walls. The cooking
utensils, consisting of an iron pot and
a tin billy, were hung up the chimney ,
and a more wretched hovel one could


not wish to enter. “ Things are rough
here, Mr. Barker, now Jenny is away/'
said Harry. “ She put away what few
things we had worth looking at, afore
she left.” “ There they are,” added
he, pointing to a gin-case under the
bed. I had seen even this miserable
place looking somewhat comfortable
when Jenny had been there; for it is
strange what comfort a cleanly, thrifty
woman can throw round the meanest
place, if she only takes the trouble.
We drew the two stools up to the
fire, which • had now brightened up,
and commenced talking about sundry
matters connected with the station;
but I could see the same suspicious
look about Harry that I had noticed
about my employer and the two scamps
I had left at the house. “ Harry,”
said I, at length, as I found him grow-
ing less communicative, “ There’s
something on your mind ; now ! what
is it? Can I do anything for you?”
Harry paused, and bringing his face
close to mine, and glancing furtively at
the door, he said in a hoarse whisper,
“Mr. Barker, can I trust you?”
“Certainly, Harry,” said I. “I am a
gentleman, I hope, and would keep
any man's counsel if it was not actually
wrong.” “Aye! but it is wrong—in-
fernally * crooked,' 1 tell you ? Sup-
pose a man, who had befriended you,
was going to be robbed —what would
you do?” “Why, warn him at once,
of course!” said I “Yes! but suppose
you might ruin yourself if you did.
How then?” “Why, I would warn
him through some confidential friend,”
I replied. “Would you, now?” said
Harry, musing and drawing, I have
reason to hope, honesty out of the bowl
of his pipe. He paused a moment,
and, slowiy rising, he opened the door
and looked out. After satisfying him-
self that there was no one about, he
quietly unloosed a dog tied up behind
the hut, which had well nigh choked
itself trying to get at me as I entered.
“ Now ?” said he, as he closed the
door. “ God help listeners.”
He resumed his seat at the fire,
blew out the light, and drawiug his
stool close to mine, he whispered as
follows :—« Captain Crawley has saved
my missus, Mr. Barker ! There’s no
gammon in that! and I can’t see him
robbed.” I would have told the Sar-
geant what’s up but for one thing,
you’re never sure that the “traps”
won’t turn on you if the case is weak,
and besides, they know me too well—
I’ve been “on the cross” myself,
afore now. Did you see two chaps up
at “ the cove’s ” to-night. “ Yes, I had
seen them” Well, one’s “Jemmy the
Snipe,” and the short chap s Bill
Jones, who’s known as the “Faker.”
“ What do they call him that for ? ”
said I, who had never heard the term
applied to any one but Oriental ma-
gicians. “ ’Cos he. “ fakes ” brands —
alters ’em you know. He’s the only
chap as can make any letters out of a
Sas I knows on.” “ Well, what are
they up to?” said I. “No good, of
course ! ” “ Why, them and the
“cove” are going to shake a mob of
Captain Crawley’s fat ’uns! that’s
their little game!” “Are they?”
said I, “but they haven’t done it yet.”
“Now, for God’s sake,” said Harry,
“ in a state of intense excitement.” as
a gentleman, don’t split on me, and
don’t you interfere yet. The “cove”
don’t trust one overmuch, but that
“ blinded” young pup Billy, he let it
all out to-day. He’s alius hiding about
listening behind doors and places,
that’s why I let the bitch loose to-
night ; she hates him like a blackfel-
low.” “And when is this affair to
come off? ” said I, getting more in-
quisitive than ever. “ Ain’t there to
be a swell ball this week down at the
township?” asked Harry. “Yes,”
said I, “ there is next Wednesday. I
was to go, but I dare not ask Brandem
for leave, as I have had too much
lately.” The Captain’s folks are going,
'aint they ? ” “Yes,” said I, “they
all are!” “Well,” replied Harry,
“ the morning after they start the
‘covo’ and those two chaps will
make a lift out of the mob.” They'll
“ shake ” the JP cattle, ’cos the brand
is easy altered to our station brand.
“ How’s that? ” said I. “ Then where
are your brains Mr. Barker ? ” re-


marked Harry, astonished at my ig-
norance. “ They’ll just make the P
into a B with a bit o’ hoop iron, and
shove the diamond round it ? ” “ But
the brand will show too much, as they
are old cattle.” “Oh,” said Harry,
“ they’ll not drive to market at once —
they’re going to take e’m to Jerry Par-
ker’s place at the Gap, and they’ll
tail ’em in the gorges till the hair
grows a bit. Trust the “ Faker ” to
manage all that. What he don’t
know in the matter o’ brands ’aint
worth knowing.” “Well,” at last I
said to Harry, “Now you can trust
me faithfully. No one shall know,
except the Captain, how I came by
the information, and I’ll guarantee,
that as long as your wife want’s to
remain at the Crawley’s, that you are
engaged overlanding. I know your
time was up here last week, and I
suppose you have not hired again.”
“Not I, Mr. Barker,” said Harry.
“ Nothing but the crooked ways at
this station has made Jenny ill. Why
I don’t think there’s a horse on the
place come honestly by.” I went
home to bed, and little did I sleep
after this. The amount of schemes I
concocted for the ruin of my respected
employer were legion, but not one of
them was subsequently adopted, I
fancy much to the advantage of
justice.
When I met Mr. Brandem at break-
fast table next morning, I was com-
pletely staggered to find his manner
so utterly changed. “ Good morning,
Mr. Barker,” said he. “You were
over at Crawley’s yesterday. Is Jenny
getting all right?’’ “ Yes 1 she’s
much better,” said I. “You sse,”
said he, “ we had no way o’ treating
her here, and I take it kindly of the
Captain as he acted as he did. She
might have died with us.” I privately
thought this exceedingly probable,
especially for all Mr. Brandem could
have done to prevent it. “That re-
minds me,” said he, “that the swells
are going to have a ball at Wingeree
this week, ain’t they?” “I believe
so,” said I. “The Crawleys will be
going now, won’t they ? ” At any
other time I should have said that I
didn’t know; but as I could see
clearly that the way to trap him was
to give him an open coast line, I said
“ that they all were.” “ And why ? ”
said Mr. Brandem, laying down his
knife and fork, “don’t you go too.”
Though you are a “ swell out o ’ luck,*'
you like “ swells’ ” ways. Take a trip
down, and ’joy yourself. And that re-
minds me I never gave you any
“ screw ” yet. I’ll write you out an
order on Trotter, and he’ll cash it, and
let Harry mount you decently, in-
stead o’ riding the “old butcher”
(this was the name of my distin-
guished old crippled steed). I’m
d d if any cove in my employ is a
going to disgrace the station with bad
horseflesh.” 1 thought to myself this,
perhaps, was a pity, considering the
easy way he came by his steeds.
I also deemed it advisable, under
the circumstances, though I fervently
rejoiced at the turn things were takingr,
to accept this gracious indulgence with
some hesitation, so I remarked that I
really had trespassed too much on his
good nature, but that I should really
like to go. “Look here!” said the
confounded reprobate, holding out his
hand, which I affected not to see,
“ I’m not used to ‘ swells,’ and maybe
you have not been as comfortable as
you ought; but you’ve done your duty
by my lads ” (I had certainly got them
into words of two syllables, and taught
them to write their names), “ and
maybe m e’ll agree better when we meet
after your holiday.” I had my doubi s
about the next meeting being so pleas-
ant, even if it ever occurred, if my
schemes “turned up trumps;” but,
nevertheless, I thanked him, and,
thanks to Harry, I shortly found my-
self on a good horse, with my valise
in front of me, bound to Trotter s to
get my order cashed.
I found that worthy up to his eyes
in business. A large station in the
vicinity had just finished shearing,
and the shearers and woolwashers
were sweating out their cheques.
Mr. Trotter, who was washing what
are called “ race-course tumblers


(so called because the bottoms are
about an inch thick, and a fair half
gill of spirits would run over the top
—and, further, they make deadly
missiles to heave at a man's head),
eyed me with much pleasure, anti-
cipating another cheque ready for
“ smashing.” “ Will you kindly cash
me this ? ” said I. Mr. Trotter looked
at it, as also did a huge half-drunken
man habited in a flannel undershirt
and a pair of trousers, whose arms
were tanned like leather and covered
over with scales like a fish. “ Why,”
said the latter, “this is a * cala-
bash,’ mate !” I had never heard the
term before, but it seems that an order
is recognized as against a cheque on
a bank by this incongruous name.
“ It’s a bad mark to collect on,” said
Mr. Trotter : “what do you want on
it?” I modestly replied “The lot.”
“ Then I ain’t got change,” promptly
replied Mr. Trotter. “ Then I suppose
I must take it back,” said I. “You
needn’t do that,” said Mr. Trotter,
ready as he said for a “ fair thing.”
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give
you f ur notes, and you ‘shout’ all
round.” The man in ihe flannel shirt
thought “ nothing could be fairer,”
so I closed at this and discounted five
pounds at sight for four pounds fifteen
shillings.
I interrupted Barker at this juncture,
being anxious to know more about
“ calabashes,” whi(*h I thought were
only known as gourds. “ Well,” said
Barker, “ I don t k"Ow why orders are
given in place of cheques; but I’ll you
what I have been told, and take it for
what it is worth. In old times the
puolican generally got his license,
because the squatters near him could
then evade hospitality by sending
people to the public-houses. It was
handy for them, you see. They, more-
over, were nearly all in the Commission
of the Peace; and when their orders
were cashed by the publican for their
employes, who usually drank the pro-
ceeds, the former had to bring them
back to the drawer for a ch< que. The
latter knowing that the publican had
lobbed the man in whose favour the
order was drawn, insisted on a dis-
count under a threat of either expos-
ing the transaction, which the unfor-
tunate man who had paid it would
willingly do, or stopping the license.
So the thing cut two ways. I don’t
know how true the report is, but it is
likely enough from what I saw in my
bush experience.” But to resume .
I was not long in getting to Thorn-
wood and relating what I knew of the
proposed raid on the Captain’s beeves.
The Captain, George, and I paced the
garden, while I unfolded my schemes;
the Captain closed the matter by sug-
gesting that George and I should
accompany the party as no doubt the
“ Faker” or the “ Snipe” would make
sure that we were all off the station
before the raid was made, and that we
should then branch off to a neighbour-
ing pclice station, about twelve miles
away, and discuss matters with Ser-
geant Casey, who knew more about
capturing cattle stealers than any one
in the force. It was as well that we
took this advice, for as we rode off, a
glance at a horseman crossing the
road revealed the lanky form of “the
Snipe” who was riding with his beak
in the wind at the “rate of knots.”
The Sergeant told us afterwards that
“the Snipe” was a master of the art
of “ bush telegraphy ” having gra-
duated under the Clarke family at
Jingera.
We found Sergeant Casey in his
shirt sleeves blackening his knee
boots, when we arrived at the police
station, and he took stock of us in an
instant by one comprehensive glance,
which, I dare tay, would have enabled
him, next moment, to have sworn to
us, from the colour of our eyes to the
brands on our horses. I had a long
tale to tell him, but he cut me short
with one or two pertinent questions
and then told us that he considered it
a capital case and would considerably
help his calendar for the assizes, about
which he had had some anxiety, as it
was likely to be lighter than he would
wish. “ Now,” said he, “ you go to
the public-house yonder, and rest
your horses. Don’t come near here


again, but meet me at the top of the
ridge after dark, and I’ll manage the
matter comfortably. And whatever
you do, don’t talk about the case one
to another. You never know who
is listening ?” We obeyed him to
the letter, and, just after dark, met
him at the rendezvous. He had two
men with him, one a smart looking
man in plain clothes, as we all were,
whom he introduced as Constable Joyce,
and a black tracker. “Now,” said
the Sergeant, “ here’s the programme.
You say these JP cattle are at the
Oakey Swamp camping ground, and if
they’re disturbed they’ll make for the
water-hole. Now, we’ll put that fifteen
miles betwixt here and there pretty
sharply out of the way. W e’ll stop a
mile away from the scrub and leave
Joyce with the horses, and then we’ll
watch the camp till daylight. The
birds will be pretty early as they know
your station is shorthanded when you
and your brothers are away.” At this
we broke into a hard gallop, and twist-
ing and turning through the bush by
the direction of the tracker, a couple
of hours brought us close on the camp.
Taking a smoke and a pull at George’s
flask all round we helped Joyce to
hobble out the horses and marched off
to the scrub. The Sergeant seemed
to know as much of the place as we
did, and selecting a spot in the scrub
close to the water-hole we sat down
to wait for daylight. Plenty of amus-
ing tales the Sergeant told us of his
chases after cattle stealers; but, when-
ever we broached the one under con-
sideration, the Sergeant dismissed it
by stating that there was no need to
trouble our minds “as the case was
complete” though as yet nothing had
been done at all. The Sergeant had
the finest “police mind ’ of any man
in the force I ever met. Assumptions
with him were facts till he proved
them false. “I’ll tell you what ? it is
Mr. Crawley said he at length,” one
half of you run holders are the
greatest of cattle thieve**.
Lots of you, to save the expense of
impounding stray stock, off your runs,
give poundkeepers authority to do it.
The men may, some of them, be
honest enough ; but their sons often
grow up no good through mix-
ing with all sorts of riff-raff.
Whenever a ‘‘crooked’’ beast is got
hold of. it with a lot of others, is
shoved in the pound and bought out for
next to nothing by dishonest butchers
and others, who receive cattle “on the
cross,” and square it with the thieves.
As soon as ever these chaps find out
that there is anyone after them they
get the hangers on at public pounds to
take the cattle off a neighbouring run
where they have been left, and off
which the poundkeeper has authority
to impound from the owner, then it
comes out in the papers “ impounded
by order of Mr. tSo-and-so, such and
such beasts,’ and handy mistakes are
made in the brands. They like y have
been stolen some hundreds o’ miles
away, and the owner never see the
Gazette. If the police do find the cat-
tle they cannot prosecute, as the pound-
keeper swears he found the beasts on
Mr." ——'s run, and impounded by
general instructions, and Mr. ,
when he is asked, knows nothing about
it. You may get the beasts back, but
you don’t catch the thieves. No man
has a right to impound unless he takes
the responsibility himself, and is made
to bear all consequences. Magis-
trates, too, are not over particular who
they appoint pound keepers, and I
have known many of them do more to
thwart the police than help them.
Why, I knew once, when I asked for a
remand for the production of a wit-
ness, who had given information, that
the magistrates asked me to give them
the particulars privately, before tcey
gave the remand. I did so in their
private room; the only witness got
the “ tip” that I wanted him, and
“bolted.” Now I’ll swear I never
opened my lips to any living being
save the Bench.” “ Perhaps,” I sug-
gested “ one of the was impli-
cated in the transaction.” “ 1
said the Sergeant, “ now you ve got it
—of course he was, or rather one oi
his relations was indirectly; but that
he told my man I know for a fact, be-


cause I “ shopped” the latter a month
or two after, and he told me the p ir-
ticulars in the lock-up.” I t«ll yon
that lots of men are made magistrates
for nothing but because they are
useful at elections. They are utterly
unfit for the position.
Daylight soon broke, and a smart
breeze drifted the fog which rolled over
the swamp gently away. Fortunately
it blew in our faces, and the cattle
would all be to windward of us, other-
wise they wou ] d have scented us so
quickly that they would soon have
settled on the ground.
We waited anxiously for an honr,
when we heard the stampede of the
herd making right on to the camp, and
a minute or two later the “ Snipe,” his
lanky hair streaming in the wind, pas-
sed between us and the herd, and
rounded the mob up in a moment. The
“ Faker” soon after dashed down the
ride with a dozen stragglers, and the
Captain’s “nine hundred weighters”
were ready for capture.
Despite the villainy of the transac-
tion, 1 could not help admiring the
brilliant coup of the thieves. The way
they turned the wings of the mob, and
the rapidity with which they got them
together was something for expertness
and agility worth looking at. The
Sergeant, who lay on his stomach with
his note-book in his hand, and his
watch beside him, preparing the notes
of his evidence was about as cool a
thing as I ever saw. He might have
been a general quietly reconnoitring
the position of an enemy’s country ;
but while George and I wer strung up
to a pitch of excitement which mi»ht
have easily led us to spoil the whole
thing, the Sergeant’s flashing eye
glanced at first one and then the other
and riveted us to the spot. There was
something electrical in his glance, and
had we moved 1 don’t think he would
have scrupled to brain u with the butt
of his revolver, which, to prevent acci-
dents, he had taken off and laid beside
him. Suddenly he heard the “ Faker”
exclaim, “ Here’s the Cove,” and down
the ridge, at a sharp canter, came my
respected friend, John Brandt m, Esq.
He was evidently well np to this
game. He dodged round and round
the heri, and finally, having made up
his mind what to take, he gave a few
words of instruction. About fifty
head were cut out of the mob like
magic, and they were driven off pell-
mell. “ That s all right! ” said the
Sergeant, as he closed his pocket-
book. “ Half-past seven! Tou gen-
tlem°n may as well remember the
time; they might try to prove an
alibi.” We made a mental note of it.
“Now,” said the Sergeant, “we’ll
wait a while here in case the mob
break back, though I don’t think they
will, for they are sure to have some
of Jenny Parkei’s cattle ‘planted'
handy as leaders, and then we’ll go
back for our hor es and put Boyce and
the blackfellow on their track. They
will follow slowly behind. You, gen-
tlemen, had better ride off to Win-
geree, and go to the ball, and you,
Mr. Crawl ey t may meet me, say about
four miles from Jenny Parker’s, at
the cross roads, say at four the
day after to-morrow morning. They
won’t get to Parker’s before to-mor-
row afternoon, and they won’t brand
till next morning. In the meantime
I’ll get the warrants signed for the
three. 1 made ’em all ready for
signing last evening, and I would
have had ’em signed, too, if I could
ha e laid the information to my own
satisfaction ; but it’s just as well as it
is.” “ But why don’t we follow them
now,” said I. •* Why,” said the Ser-
geant, “for one thing, the case is not
quite complete yet. It is good, but it
may be made better ; that is to say,
they’ve got a defeace against the
thieving by saying, if we catch them,
that they claim mme of the cattle,
and are, perhaps, mistaken in the
brands. We might as well make the
case stronger if we can.” “ Ah!
well! *’ said George Crawley, chuck-
ling as if he had got a “clincher” to
the Sergeant, “Do what they can,
they can’t get our station brand off in
a hurry.” “And what might that
brand be?” said the Sergeant. “A
horseshoe,” replied George. “My


dear young man,” said the Sergeant
satirically, “Do you expect to see
those cattle in three days’ time with a
horseshoe on?” 44 Why, hang it!”
said George, nettled at being taken
down— 44 they cannot get it off.”
44 Perhaps not,” said the Sergeant,
laconically, “but it will appear as a
spur.” He said no more. The Ser-
geant’s plans were followed out to the
letter. Constable Joyce and the
tracker were on the trail like sleuth-
hounds, and George and I were not
long finding our way to Wingeree.
We were too excited to sleep, but we
went to the ball, did a 44 duty dance,”
and kept our own counsel, I not telling
the Captain all we knew. I should
much have liked to have seen the
sequel, but the Captain thought I had
best go home. The Sergeant had got
hold of his cue, and there was no
doubt but that he, with his expe-
rience, would do all that was requi-
site.
I started for Duffer Creek early
next morning. A dreary ride I had,
and was dog-tired when I reached
that pleasant abode. I had just time
to see Harry, as I rode past his hut.
He had been to see Jenny that day,
and said, 44 That Crawley’s people had
not been out on the run that day, so
they could not have missed the
beasts.’ “The ‘cove’ is not at
home,” said Harry. “He roused me
up before daylight yesterday morning,
and said he would not be back for a
day or two. He asked me the time,
and I looked at my watch, and it wa
half-past four.” “ All right, Harry,”
said I, 44 Mind you remember that
you told me that. He may try an
alibi f so don’t forget the time! ” The
case, however, proved too strong,
subsequently, for any such dangerous
defence.
I turned my horse loose and went
into the house. There I found poor
Mrs. Brandem, miserable as usual.
Her dear sons were in open revolt, and
my advent was rather a comfort, as
my thrashing of Billy had some small
effect. Things went on as usual for a
day or two, and I began to get anxious
as to the result, when early the second
morning, as I was dressing, I heard
my name enquired for outside. 44 All
right! he’s in!” responded Master
Billy, who had received the stranger.
Billy ran in, and as he came to tell me
that I was wanted, I heard him glee-
fully exclaim to his mother, “ I say!
mother! here s a lark ! here’s a 4 trap’
come for the schoolmaster! Father
always said he was no good.” I went
out, and encountered Constable Joyce.
‘‘Good morning, Mr. Barker,” said
he, 44 we shall want you !”
44 Hooray ! ” cried Billy, who was
eavesdropping, as usnal, ‘ 4 the school-
master’s is tagged. When’s he going
to be tried ? Mother mayn’t Igo and
see him tried ?”
“ There’s nothing to laugh at young
fellow,” said Joyce, breaking in,
“Your father’s ,in the lock-up, if you
must know, with small chance of get-
ting out again till your whiskers are a
bit longer.” 1 really pitied poor Mrs.
Brandem when she heard the news.
Her husband was a low brute, but
womanlike she clung to him to the
last, and sat wringing her hands and
crying bitterly. “ 1 always knew what
would come of it,” said she, 44 L knew
he’d try it on once too often.”
The history of the capture is soon
told. The sergeant and George had
the advice sent them by Joyce through
the tracker that the cattle had been
yarded over night, and he (Joyce) was
watching it. The party joined him,
and early in the morning Brandem and
his men lighted a fire and heated their
irons. The sergeant waited until he
saw Brandem deliberately put the
finishing stroke to the B, and then
pounced on him, took him, 4 * the
Snipe,” 44 the Faker,” and Mr. Jere-
miah Parker, severally and conjointly
into custody, and they were comfort-
ably ensconced in the lock-up.
I need not bother you with the re-
port of the case. The facts came out
just as I’ve given them. The prisoners
made no defence, and were committed
for rial and bail refused.. When the
trial came on the solicitor for the
defence thought he had done a good


thing for his clients when he filled the
box with free selectors. A more fatal
move never was made.
In the first place, they had no love
for squatters; and, in the second, as
they had not many cattle, and could
not look after what they had as they
ought to have done, they were per-
petually victims to “ gully-rakers.”
A legal quibble of some kind saved
“The Snipe” and “ The Faker”—
I suppose because there was no proof
that they acted with a knowledge of the
ownership of the cattle, but had simply,
as servants, followed Brandem’s in-
struction s; but they convicted Brandem
and old Jerry Parker, who was made a
particeps criminis as he was caught
looking on. He got three years for the
entertainment.
I have had enough of bush life, and
now I am off for England to eat my
terms at Lincoln’s Inn with a view to
the Colonial Bar. As I came down the
country, I overtook the coach which
conveyed her Majesty’s prisoners to
head-quarters under the convoy of my
friend sergeant Casey. “I’ve got all
my birds here,” said he; “they’re in
the back yard. Come and look at the lot.
I never had a finer assizes: fourteen
‘shopped’ and only two ‘turned up!”
I looked over the balcony of the hotel
at the lot, all in irons, and padlocked
to a chain which those who chose to
walk had to drag with the consent of
the rest. “See, there’s old Brandem!”
said the sergeant: “he steps out well
in Government gaiters. Not the first
time he has worn them, I suspect! ”
The station will be sold, I expect,
from what Hides told me. The estate
owes me ten pounds, like it does the
administrators of poor Cocker’s estate,
but I shall never claim it. By Jove,
the fire is clean out! Bless me! it is
midnight! Good night, old fellow.
You’ll see us off in the morning ?
o
Ice Cream. A rustic, who had never
before tasted ice cream, was helped by a
lady at an evening party to a plate of
“unsuccessful frigid milk,” under its
usual simple designation of “cream.”
“Your cream is very sweet,” said he,
“but ain’t it a little touched with frost.”
MISS PIPKIN’S PARROT.
Plump little Miss Pipkin only wanted
a husband. And she could not be ac-
cused of hurrying on a declaration, for
Mr. Tarryman had come every even-
ing to pay his attentions for ten long
years, and it had become such a habit
that there was every fear of his going
on doing so for ten more, simply be-
cause, if he married, he wouldn’t know
what to do with his evenings.
So matters were in this state when,
one night in the tenth year, Mr. Tar-
ryman proposed to take Miss Pipkin
to the theatre. The tender maiden
thought it “ must mean something/’
and accordingly arrayed herself so as
to display herself to the best advant-
age. She was a long time, for the un-
usual event excited her. “ I should
not be at all surprised if to-night he
really comes to the point,” thought
she. But when she came costumed
for the theatre down into her little
front parlour, her heart sank within
her, for she found Mr. Tarryman in-
dulging in a peaceful nap. It was an
hour before he awoke, and in that hour
she had resolved that she would put
up with this sort of thing no longer.
She would stir up the sluggish heart
of Mr. Tarryman, or perish in the at-
tempt. Curiously enough, accident
brought about the result she desired
in a manner quite as surprising to
herself as to her laggmg lover.
On his awakening, Miss Pipkin de-
licately suggested that as Mr, Tarry-
man seemed fatigued, he had better
take an early supper there, and defer
the visit to the theatre until another
evening.
t “ And after supper.” said she archly,
‘ I will show you a charming present
I have received to-day.”
“ Present ?”
“Yes.”
Jealousy had never perturbed Mr.
Tarryman’s equanimity before ; but
now it whispered in his ear, ‘‘Presents
to Miss Pipkin,” and affected him with
unwonted vivacity. What could those
presents be ?—rings, bracelets, singing


birds, diminutive puppies, miniatures,
or what ?
For all that, he did full justice to an
excellent supper.
“You cook like an angel,” he
ventured to say, as he thrust his plate
away.
Miss P. was unacquainted with the
exact merits of angelic cookery ; but
as a compliment was evidently in-
tended, she was pleased. Never had
Mr. Tarry man been in such force.
And now, to clench it, she would show
him her present.
G-ivingsome directions in a whisper
to her little maid, that demure person-
age brought in a handsome gilded
parrot’s cage, and in the cage was a
handsome green parrot —an extremely
wide-awake and knowing bird, who,
at first winking and blinking in the
light of Miss Pipkin’s moderator lamp,
then fixed his glittering eye on Mr.
Tarryman.
That gentleman was relieved to find
the nature of Miss Pipkin’s present,
yet somehow he was rather uneasy.
“ Is he not a pet ?” inquired Miss
Pipkin. “It came only this after-
noon. I believe it was purchased
from an auctioneer in the Walworth-
road.”
“Oh, indeed ; purchased from an
auctioneer ?”
“ Yes ; a great bargain ?”
Thereupon Miss P. stimulated her
new pet with a lump of sugar, and
stroking him with her fair finger,
called him many endearing names,
which Mr. Tarryman, who had never
been so “ particular ’’ before in his
remarks, said were quite wasted upon
a parrot. And so they were, for the
bird only looked inquisitive, and spake
never a word.
The little maid thought it was pro-
bably shy, and placing it on the table,
left Miss P. and Mr. T. on~e more
alone.
Mr. Tarryman then rose, and his
aspect was tender, his tones some-
what tremulous. Miss Pipkin felt the
crisis of her life was at hand when her
swain took her soft hand, and gently
murmured her name.
But not with anything in the shape
of a proposal. Alas, no !
Mr. Tarryman simply said, “My
dear Miss Pipkin, I must be going.”
Possibly another ten years more
would have passed with no nearer an
approach to the “ pointbut at the
word “ going,” the mysterious bird,
who had watched Mr. Tarryman
intently, became an altered creature.
The recollections of the auction
room inspired him.
Mr. Tarryman had said “ going”
twice, and he broke the impressive
silence that followed—a silence in
which Miss Pipkin’s gentle breathing
became almost audible—with the un-
expected outcry :
“ Going ! going ! For the last
time !” Then the bird paused for a
second, and once more fixed Mr.
Tarryman with his glittering eye, and
said, ‘‘ For the last time ! Going !
Make an offer ! Make an offer !”
Mr. Tarryman’s feelinys over-
whelmed him, Miss Pipkin’s hand
was in his. pressed it. His dis-
engaged arm slowly glided round her
ample but still not ungraceful waist,
and while that unconscious but sin-
gular bird still repeated, “ Going !
going ! For the last time ! Make an
offer! Gone ?” Miss Pipkin was—
metaphorically —knocked down.
She has now become Mrs. Tarry-
man, and never did talking bird find
himself in such good quarters as Miss
Pipkin’s parrot. — Comic Annual.
The other day, Mrs. Sniffkins finding
he if elf unwell, sent for the doctor, and
declared her belief that she was
pizened,” and that “ Sniffkins had done
it.” “ I didn’t do it; it’s all gammon ;
she isn’t pizene 1. Prove it, doctor ; open
her upon the spot—l’m willing,” shouted
Sniffkins.

the same time pointing to a lean, cadaver-
ous-looking man just passing. “ Looks

had dealt with him a long time, doesn t
he?” The subject was immediately
changed.

MY ADVENTURES
IN PURCHASING HORSES.
BY RUS.
Part 11.
Some years after the events already
related, it became desirable for me to
remove into the country to a distance of
about twenty miles from Sydney. I
looked forward to the change with much
satisfaction, but not without forebodings
on the subject of carriage horses, the
possession of which seemed inevitably
involved in a residence in the country.
I thought, however, that I saw my way
out of the difficulty. Since I had become
addicted to the use of cabs, I had formed
the acquaintance of a cab horse, which
seemed to have attained to the highest
point of perfection possible to an animal
that walks on four legs. He was hand-
some and strong, and so quiet that you
might let off fire works on his hack with
impunity. He was sturdy, swift, and
enduring. He took me in a hansom
cab twenty miles and hack over had
roads in one day : and on his return,
within four miles of Sydney, ran a race
with another fast trotting horse, and won
easily.
I determined to possess that horse. I
opened negociations with the cabman,
which ended in my giving a fancy price.
I felt that I had been extravagant, but
believed that I had done wisely, < speci-
ally as everyone said that he was cheap,
even at the price which I had given. I
drove him to my new home in triumph.
He drew my carriage to my perfect
satisfaction for some time ; but one day,
the road being rather heavy, he stopped
short, and would hardly be persuaded to
start again. After this, he gradually
grew worse and worse, until he became
quite useless. I consulted with his for-
mer owner, who came to my farm to see
what he could do. Being a skilled hand,
he certainly made the horse go pretty
well; but afterwards, he became as bad
as ever.
At last the cabman, who seemed as
much puzzled about the horse’s conduct
as I was, said that he had a larger and
stronger horse which might suit my
heavy carriage better, and that he was
willing to make an exchange and chance
it. I did not like the new animal much.
His appearance was rawboned and un-
gainly, with a sullen expression in his
eye. In trotting he straddled his legs
about in a strange unsightly manner, and
altogether his aspect and demeanour were
not such as to excite admiration or confi-
dence. Reflecting, however, that nothing
would be worse that the horse I had
already, I accepted the offer. The cab-
man took back his old favourite to
Sydney, when I learn, that he has never
since been guilty of the slightest miscon-
duct ; and I believe that he is at the pre-
sent moment, the very best cab horse in
the city.
The subsequent career of the animal 1
took in exchange was an eventful one.
He seemed to shape very well at first, but
one unlucky day he was put into the spring
cart, with a light load. In crossing the
farm, he had to pass over a low bridge
between two rather steep banks. He
went down on to the bridge all right, but


refused the opposite bank. The man in
charge committed the great mistake of
taking him ont of the cart and leading
him home ; not without much blasphemy
I fear.
After this, of course, he refused to draw
the carriage, and I determined to put in
practice various methods which 1 had
heard of for the treatment of gibbing
horses. I had him put into a loaded dray
and led on to the bridge. When he re-
fused to go up the opposite bank, my
directions were to put a log behind the
wheels, so that he could not back, and to
leave him there. That afternoon I was
obliged to leave home. On my return I
learned that the horse stood still on the
bridge all day. Towards dark, the man
in charge, not liking to leave him there
all night for fear of mischief to the dray,
but determined not to repeat his former
mistake of taking the horse out, and find-
ing him insensible to all ordinary forms of
reasoning, resorted to a line of argument
to which the animal yielded at once. The
line of argument was a long chain, one
end of which was fastened round his neck,
and the other to a great strong plough
horse. In this way he was ignominiously
dragged to the stable door and discharged.
I was disappointed at this failure, but
not daunted. The next day 1 put him
into an old dray well loaded, with a set of
harness of little value, locked the wheels,
and left him in the middle of the paddock,
with his head tied up so that he could not
feed. After some time he tried to back,
but could not manage it. He then started
forward and drew the dray about, loaded
and wheel-locked as it was, with apparent
ease. When, however, the wheels were
unlocked, and anyone attempted to lead
him, he steadily refused to do anything
but back.
Our sentiments towards that horse now
began to assume a malignant form—l say
our i for by this time every" man, woman,
and child on the farm shared in the same
feeling. Determined that if he would
not draw the dray at my bidding, at all
events he should stand still in it as long
as I liked, and until he was heartily tired
of it, I backed him up against a fence,
locked the wheels, chained him to the
strong middle rail, and left him for the
night. At one o’clock in the morning I
was made aware by certain sounds that
he was careering about the paddock with
the dray after him, the entertainment
being enlivened by the jangling of the
chains entangled in the wheels, and an
occasional collision with a stump. Of
course I had to rouse up the people to let
him loose. The sound of the rattling
wheels and clanking chains, and after-
terwards of the maledictions naturally
accompanying his release, came to my
ears with a strange unearthly effect
through the quiet midnight air.
I spent the rest of the night wonder-
ing how in the world he could have got
loose. In the morning we found that,
with diabolical strength, and as if to show
how lightly he regarded every load when
it suited his own pleasure, he had broken
the rail of the fence and so got loose.
After this I threw up the sponge —I
was at the end of my resources—l felt
that I was no match for that horse. I
debated seriously in my mind whether it
was right to allow such an animal to live
any longer to torment mankind. If I
had at once terminated his existence, some
painful occurrences which I have to
chronicle would have been prevented;
but when I reflected that, according to
my former experience, he might turn out
of value to some one else, although he
had been a sonrce of annoyance and hu-
miliation to me, I did not proceed to
execution, but sent him to Sydney for sale.
A deluded individual at Blackwattle
Swamp bought him for £2 10s. for the
purpose of drawing rubble. He had to
give up that idea, however, suddenly; for
the next morning, as he was getting be-
tween the rails of the paddock fence, the
horse, as if to mark his return to Sydney
by a signal act of wickedness, kicked him
back again into the middle of the road.
The man was picked up insensible, carried
home, and put to bed, where he remained
under medical treatment for three months.
The horse was immediately sold to a
parcel delivery man for £l 15s.
This purchaser seems to have managed
the horse better than anyone, for he suc-
ceeded in making him go at a full trot;
but he found that if he pulled him up to
any slower pace, the animal stopped alto-
gether. Of necessity, therefore, almost,
but in defiance of the regulations, he
drove at full speed round the corners.
He was observed in the act and sum-
moned. To evade this he sold the horse
to a cabman for £1 55., and having hastily
disposed of his other effects, retired to a
distant part of the colony. It can hardly
be supposed that, if his mind was in a
healthy state, he would thus have aban-


doned his home and his occupation to
avoid a possible penalty of £2. It can
only he supposed that there was some-
thing peculiar about tbat borse's behaviour
which produced a deleterious effect upon
the man’s mind.
All that I know about bis career whilst
in the possession of the cabman, is that
he was seen to back down William-street
with two ladies inside the cab—all the
way down, from the top of Darlinghurst
to the bottom of the hill.
He was last seen with a man on his
hack in th Q middle of a sale yard in Pitt-
street, standing stock still, refusing to
move a muscle, under any form of threat
or persuasion.
Since these startling events, whenever
I have had occasion to drive, I have taken
a steady old plough horse off the farm,
and have not yet met with any further
adventures. lam afraid, however, that
this state of things will prove transitory
and that this history will have to he
continued I believe that if I were to
buy one of the new patent steam loco-
motive road traction engines, with all the
latest improvements, the “ tarnation
critur ” would buck or gib, or perform
round dances in the middle of the road,
or commit some other unseemly action
before I had had it for a week.
THE MYSTERY OF
WISEMANS FERRY ROAD
Chapter YII.— Continued.
“ D’ye see that old reprobate ?” said
Mr. Hay to his companion, pointing,
as he spoke, to the drunken caroller.
“He’s as fine a shepherd as I’d wish
to have, but an unconscionable villain.
He lived with me for years, though.”
George simply said, “Did he?”
not caring to explain that he, too, was
acquainted with the old fellow, whom
immediately he cast eyes on him he
had recognised as Bill Heywood.
The noise of their conversation at-
tracted old Bill’s attention. Looking
round he noticed George.
“ Hullor ! my blooming plum,” said
he, staggering towards Caldecott.
The sight, however, of his old
master, whom he knew to be a magis-
trate of the territory, somewhat took
Bill Heywood aback. He was too
much under the influence of rum to be
able to attempt to reconcile what ap-
peared to him the gross inconsistency
of Mr. Hay’s evident intimacy with
a young fellow whom he had last seen
hob and nob with Captain Storma-
long.
Completely nonplussed, all he could
do was to remark over and over again,
“ Well, I’m ! ”
Seeing that the old man did not
move off, Mr. Hay remarked to him,
“ Why, Bill, you seem to be quite
flush of money ? ”
“Come in for shpree,” was the
stammered response; “all shame
hundred years hensh, eh ? Misha Hay ?
Old Reynolds did cut up rough to see
me, but the mopuses fetched ’im
round—the blooming mopuses.
Them’s the jockeysh for me,’’ and old
Bill dived his hand down into his
extremely dirty moleskin trousers,
and forked out some half-dozen sove-
reigns, which he displayed with an
air of grotesque bravado.
Now, it so happened that Mr. Hay
had been awake when the mob, who
were enjoying their spree, had arrived
at the Bunt Hotel. He had therefore
been able to overhear the conversa-
tion which had taken place between
landlord Reynolds and his shepherd,
and he had not failed to note how
angry the former was with the latter
for having left his sheep and ventured
in to a drunken carouse without leave
or license. Mr. Hay had also heard
Heywood right himself with his em-
ployer, by remarking that he might
just as well have his blooming
mopuses as any other man: that he
had touched for some coin and meant
to spend it, though all the lambs
in the country went to kingdom come.
Wish oi ular demonstration b* fore
him of golden “mopuses” (to use
Heywood’s expression), being in that
old \i lain’s possession, Mr. Hays
suspicions were aroused. He had been
told that the escort robbers had made
off with a considerable sum of coined
gold, in addition to the metal en route
to the Sydney Mint. Knowing Hay-
wood’s character and antecedents


pretty well, he formed certain conclu-
sions, but, unluckily, was quite un-
able to test them, owing to Bill’s sud-
den return to cautiousness imme-
diately after his display of the wealth
which was burning in his pockets.
“ I tumble,” muttered Hey wood, as
he moved away towards the bar.” “ O
yesh! b’leeve me, old Billy’s fly,
devilish fly. Hay’sh not bad filer,
but must get up early to pump Bill,
for the thunderin’ traps are on my
track, says bould Jack Donohue.
The young un’s righteous, I’ll go bail.
I shay Carrie, my darling, ai’nt there
nothing to eat ready ? ”
This to Miss Carrie, who had just
come on to the verandah to inform
Mr. Hay and George Caldecott that
the parlour breakfast was ready.
She looked as fresh as a rosebud, and
as pretty.
“I hepe, Mr. Caldecott, your arm
is better, and that you weren’t dis-
turbed last night,” she said, with a
saucy little smile.
“Oh, it’s much better, thanks.
You don’t look, though, as if you
were disturbed last night, were you ? ”
“Not the least, I’m used to being
called up at all hours, but come in to
your breakfasts, please,” and she
showed them in to the parlour, taking
the opportunity as she did so, to
make a liberal display of foot and
ankle for the especial behoof of the
younger guest.
To old Bill’s query, “Ain’t there
nothing to eat ready ?” Miss Carrie
deigned no reply. It was not the policy
at her father’s hostelry to supply
breakfast to topers on the spree. A
substantial breakfast gives too much
staying power to a hard drinker. Rey-
nold’s method was to get his bushmen
customers as blind drunk as soon as
possible, and to keep them so for such
a period as his not over-rigid con-
science suggested as the right time in
what they could, according to trade
practice, fairly knock down their
cheques. Breakfast would obviously
militate against the proper working of
the scheme, hence it was not so much
as thought of—nor for the matter of
that was dinner or supper, except
course, in the bill whenever such a
document was asked for by a departing
reveller. Soup was to be had in the
kitchen, and then there were sardines
and biscuits, which could be bought at
the hotel stores. If a man starved,
surely it was his own fault!
Unfortunately, even in the year of
grace 1878, it is in but few licensed
houses that the wayfarer of the hum-
bler orders can get the wherewithal to
stay his stomach against the qualms
of hunger. He can get drink in galore,
but no food. The hotel is all bar, and
the barmaid or barman a more recog-
nised institution than Ihe cook. The
inner parlour is too often nothing
more than an ante-chamber to the bar,
and is generally quite comfortless;
the only thing that apparently is stu-
died by the publican is how to push the
bar business to the maximum that so
working expenses may be reduced to
a minimum. Not so was it in the
temple and shady arbours of the “Holy
Bottle/’ wherein, as Pantagruel re-
lates, “alongsideof the drinkables and
the drinking vessels, was all manner
of good store of garlic, onions, escha-
lots, hams, botagoes, caviare, biscuits,
meats, tongues, old cheese, and such
like comforts very artificially and tastily
interwoven.” Alas, comfort has fled
the tavern wherein no man can now
take his ease, and in lieu we have dis-
comfort tawdrily draped. But this is
digression.
When the parlour breakfast was
over, George asked host Reynolds if he
could have a word with him.
“ Certainly, just step into my sanc-
tum,” replied Reynolds.
“ I want to put a plain question to
you, Mr. Reynolds,” said Caldecott,
when the two had reached the safe
haven of the bar parlour; “ from cir-
cumstances that have come to my
knowledge I think you will be able to
answer it. Can you put me in com-
munication with Asher Hart, the
younger ?”
“ With whom ? Never heard the
name 1” cries the publican, with well-
feigned surprise.


“No ? With Harry Devereux,
then !”
“Harry Devereux! Why, as it
turns out, that’s one of that scoundrel
Stormalong’s aliases ! Why think that
I of all men could help you here, sir ?
Why he’s let me in for hundreds along
of the fencing I was fool enough to
let him. I’d give five hundred sover-
eigns this blessed minute to know
where he is. The knowledge ought to
be worth that much at the very least.
Excuse me, Mr. Caldecott, but what-
ever made you think that I should
know aught about the man, besides
whatever can you have to do with
him ?”
Caldecott was completely taken
aback. He had made certain that
Reynolds could arrange for his com-
municating with the bushranger, but
he now found that whatever the land-
lord of the Punt Hotel knew of Hart’s
whereabouts he was not disposed to
divulge at first instance. What was
the “ sesame,” he wondered.
Later in the day Caldecott contrived
a tete-a-tete with Carrie. She protested
that neither her father nor her mother
knew anything whatever of Harte’s
whereabouts.
“ They never knew his real name,”
she declared. “ When he used to come
here as Harry Devereux, he told me
all about himself, and I’m not the girl
to turn round upon a fellow—especially
a handsome fellow like him.”
“And you couldn’t get a letter to
him ? ”
“ Well, it might be done if you were
very good and patient, but not at pre-
sent. If you ride over here in about a
fortnight, I’d let you know ; but when
you leave here you’ll never come back,
I know. Miss Walton won’t let you.”
“ Why not ?”
“ 0, she’s so pretty, and that’s all
you men care for.”
“ And what are you? ’
“0, well enough, I dare say, but
nothing to be compared to her.”
“ I see we can fish for compliments,
eh, Miss Carrie ? Why, you’re lovely.
Now, I presume to be good, but not
patient. Look here!”
“ Now, that’s being particularly
naughty,” cried the little flirt, man-
aging dexterously not to escape the
kiss which George planted on her
cheek.
“It’s particularly nice,” he said,
laughing; “ and so you won’t tell me
for a fortnight ?”
“ I can’t t.ell you till I know, stupid !
but, listen—what’s that ? ”
“ Carrie !” her mother had just cried
from the direction of the kitchen,
“ Carrie ! ”
Off ran Miss Reynolds in obedience
to the maternal summons.
George Caldecott strolled about anxi-
ous for the next morning to arrive, as,
despite his pour passer le temps flirtation
with Carrie Reynolds, he was terribly
ennuyed. In the evening, the bush-
men on “the burst” got up a sensation.
One of the younger hands, a Yankee,
who was a bit of a wag, had in his lucid
intervals fomented a shearing dispute
between Bill Heywood and Tom the
deputy-ostler until it had assumed the
most tremendous dimensions. The
“ dead-house,” in which the latest
passages of the quarrel had been
enacted had resounded with the threats
of the belligerents. Nothing but pistols
for two would satisfy Tom. These the
Yankee had procured, and just when
George happeued to stroll up to the
front of the “palais royal” (as the dead-
house was nicknamed) what should he
find but all the people on the books of
the establishment (except Mr. Hay,
who had gone to bed) grouped about
the two disputants, who were making
maudlin attempts to stand respec-
tively in what each considered correct
duelling position.
Ike the Yankee had arranged that
both should fire at the dropping of his
cabbage-tree hat, after saying “ One,
two, three.”
In the moment of suspense the
drunken merriment had ceased, and
all were awaiting the event anxiously,
though it was as much as Bill Heywood
could do to stand upright. Tom kept
on muttering “’tention” to himself,
and managed to stiffen himself into a
position ludicrously fierce.


“One,” said Ike, himself not by any
means sober.
“ Two.”
Before he could say “ Three,” the
Yankee gave a lurch forwards, and
somehow or another managed to drop
his hat.
This was enough for old Bill, who,
having first tightly closed his eyes,
presented his pistol at his foeman
and pulled the trigger!
Fortune had ordered it that the aim
should be accurate.
The report of the pistol was no sooner
heard than Tom was seen to fall heavily
to the ground, his face apparently de-
luged with blood.
“I’m dead—” he roared.
“ Of fright and raspberry-jam ! ”
shrieke l Ike, who had loaded the
pistols with cartridges filled with that
confection.
The bystanders laughed, but Tom
rolled on the ground, yelling out that
he was stone dead.
Suddenly he jumped up, and began
to tear off his clothes. When stripped
to his trousers, he set off running at the
top of his speed towards the bush, cry-
ing that he was dead and that all the
fiends of hell were after him.
“I’ll shout for all hands,” said Ike,
and the mob moved off for the bar,
leaving the poor wretch, whom the
excitement had rendered delirious, to
scamper on.
“ He’ll come to, bless yer,’ replied
Reynolds to a remark of Caldecott’s
expressive of fear for the man’s state.
“ I’ll send the groom after him pre-
sently.”
George, who had never seen anyone
under the influence of delirium tremens,
strolled off satisfied that there was
nothing specially wrong.
Some little while after supper Carrie
Reynolds, dressed even more coquet-
tishly than usual, brought into the
parlour a parcel directed to Mr.
George Caldecott.
• ‘ My word! but you do look kil-
ling, Miss Carrie ! ”
“ Go along with you, it’s you that ’ll
be that to-morrow when you’ve got
on the contents of that parcel which a
messenger has just ridden in with from
Mitta Mitta, post haste. Nothing less,
if you please, than post haste, to
bring a young gentleman some little
vanities, and yet it’s always us poor
girls who are so extravagant, so oc-
cupied about dress, so stuck-up, and
all the rest of it. You men are every
bit as vain as we are. There,” and
Carrie stamped her little foot in mock
indignation.
“ But really, Miss Carrie, you’re got
up no end of a swell, quite regardless
of expense. Why? if it’s a fair ques-
tion.”
If George hoped that the answer to
his query would be in testimony of
his killing powers, he was doomed to
be disappointed, as he got no answer
to it at all. Carrie, in reply to her
mother’s “quick child, Mr. DeVismes,
has just driven up and is waiting
to see you,” had rushed out of the
room, leaving Mr. Caldecott to think
of the man who, bearing that name,
had in the old country cheated him of
his cash, and robbed him of his mis-
tress.
It certainly never entered Calde-
cott’s head, that the man who had
just arrived at the Yarramundra Punt
Hotel, was the same gay dandy who
had run off with his once-adored Co-
ral ie to Bucharest.
Yet so it was, as it was our hero’s
lot to discover subsequently.

TOWN GOSSIP
While we give in to no one in our
desire to preserve the sanctity of the
Sabbath, we cannot endorse the argu-
ments put forth at the late meeting
against the opening of the Museum
and Free Library on Sundays. If it
is a desecration of the day to spend
an hour or two in the afternoon in
admiring the wonders of nature in
glass cases, it is surely an equal
violation of the Sabbath to gaze
at them in the open air. If there


is any tendency to immorality
or irreligion in the spectacle of
a stuffed kangaroo fixed and immov-
able in the corner of a room, there
must be a proportionate increase in
the tendency to laxity of thought in
the view of a marsupial going through
his playful antics in the Botanical
Gardens; while if any moral is to be
drawn from a butterfly, it is more
like’.y to be suggested by a close ex-
amination of the insect than a flying
glimpse of it; and the same with
regard to the Free Library, granting
that both institutions are closed
during the hours of divine service,
it is a serious question whether the
visitors they would attract would
spend their time half as innocently
or profitably elsewhere. It is urged
that to allow these privileges would
be to let in the “ thin end of the
wedge.” But the thick end has been
in a long time, and until public
houses and all other avenues to Sab-
bath desecration are absolutely
closed on Sundays, we see no force
whatever in the argument that this
would be the first step towards the
overthrow of a great principle, of
which the public as they become
famaliarized with it would require
broader illustrations. The seventh
day should be emphatically a day of
rest —it is a Divine commandment,
the wisdom of which is apparent to
every one But there must be rest
for the mind as well as the body, and
this often means change and inno-
cent recreation—such recreation in
short as will elevate the mind and
fill the heart with thankfulness. We
cannot see danger in the resolution
passed by the Assembly, or even that
it involves any great principle, since
the arguments advanced by the Dean
of Sydney and his supporters apply
with equal force to many other more
questionable modes of spending the
Sunday; while on the other hand
there is the fear that too rigid con-
straint may increase the laxity of
conduct which it seeks to confine
within such narrow limits.
What has become of the grand
scheme devised by the Sydney Cor-
poration to dispose of the night-soil
of the city by sending it out to sea in
barges ? We have a clear recollec-
tion that this mode of disposal was
resolved upon by a majority of the
City Council, some eighteen months
ago, and at a convocation of suburban
mayors, shortly afterwards, it was af-
firmed that the sea should be “ the
open sea” for the sewage deposits.
Could not the city fathers prevail
upon the citizens of Sydney to allow
them the use of a wharf whereat to
load the barges with the obnoxious
freight, or were they afraid that their
vessels would be seized by the Rus-
sians ? It appears now that the
barge scheme was a failure, that the
Council have not availed themselves
of the piece of land across Cook’s
River, proclaimed by the Govern-
ment on the recommendation of rhe
Sewage Board, as a depot, and that
the nightmen are doing their best to
render the Nuisance Prevention Act
a dead letter. Complaints are made
that the reservoir at Botany is in con-
tinual danger of pollution by the dis-
charge of refuse in its immediate
vicinity. This is a matter which affects
the health of the whole community,
and should be rectified without delay.
On dit. —That Sir Hercules Robin-
son, gubernatorial cares being laid
aside, contemplates settling down as
a permanent resident of our “beau-
tiful city.” We hope it may be so.
That ridiculousGobemouchewillhave
it that His Excellency means to set
us as a land agent.


After all the bother and the scan-
dal of the riot trials, it is to be hoped
the teterrima causa of the whole hub-
bub will not get off scot free, and
that the informations said to have
been laid against the rabid pastor
will be legally sufficient, if properly
supported by honest evidence, to
moderate <he rancour of his tongue
in places of public recreation.
We suppose that there is no help
for it, and that having drifted into
war the nation will have to maintain
what the Beaconsfield party pro-
pounds as her rights, but which in
reality are her Turkish bondholders.
Lord Salisbury’s circular note to the
Powers, insisting on the necessity
that the provisions of the proposed
Turko-Russian treaty should be con-
sidered in relation to existing trea-
ties, comes with an ill grace from
that Government which, despite the
terms of those treaties, connived at
Turkish misrule until it had reached
a pitch which Europe declared to be
intolerable, but which Russia alone
had the pluck to endeavour to abate.
The Reserve Forces which are to be
called out, consist of 134,500
Militia, 14,548 Yeomanry Cavalry,
174,241 Volunteers, and 36,000 En-
rolled Pensioners. We are not Pid-
dingtonians, but even at this crisis
of the Eastern question, should
peace be maintained, it will not be
because of the mock heroics of Ben-
jamin, Earl of Beaconsfield, bnt
because of Russian moderation.
From a late English paper we clip
the following words, placed by a hu-
mourist into an ideal paragraph of
an imaginary Queen’s Speech, but
which fairly enough represents aver-
age British feeling with regard to
the Premier’s policy :—“ lam re-
lieved from great anxiety by the
re-assembling of Parliament. The
responsibility of countenancing any
longer the tortuous policy of the
Prime Minister was almost more
than I could bear Lord Beacons-
field means well. With an inherited
tendency to make the best bargain
he can at whatever cost to his rival
his Lordship has assumed the war-
like garb of Bombastes Furioso, and
dressed his Hebrew henchman on the
Press as Major Wellington de Boots,
all with a view to frighten the Im-
perial Father-in-Law of dear Alfred
into granting lenient terms of peace
to Beaconsfield’s protege, the Sultan.
It is in vain I have endeavoured to
hint to the noble Earl that his long
brown Ulster becomes him more
than military array does. Alas ! he
does but fiercely half-draw his sword
from its scabbard, and then —lets it
drop again. No reasonable being
could be alarmed at these mock
heroics. The Czar isn’t ”
We can hardly realize at this dist-
ance from the scene, the horrors
which accompany war, but we can-
not be blind to the accounts which
fill the English papers of famine,
sickness, destitution, and despair
existing in Constantinople. We
read of women killing their own
children sooner than let them starve
to death; of trains covered with
snow and loaded with refugees,
many of them frozen to death; of
the insufficiency of clothing, pro-
visions, and medicine, making alto-
gether a picture of suffering, for
which there has scarcely been any
parallel since the siege of Jerusalem.
Large sums are being raised in
England and elsewhere towards a re-
lief fund. Will some philanthropist
tab t> step for the hold-
ing of a public mooting in Sydney,
and the opening of subscription lists
for the same charita 1 object?


We note receipt of Professor Pell’s
pamphlet on the “ Rates of Mortality
and Increase of the Population of
New South Wales” (a reprint of con-
tributions to the S. M. SeraW). A
perusal of this little work, which is as
clear as it is exhaustive, will bring
conviction to the mind of the reader
that it is to preventible causes that
the weak points of the mortality
tables are to be assigned—those weak
points being an infant mortality for
Sydney and its suburbs-95 per cent,
in excess of that of the whole colony,
excluding the metropolis 5 and ’72 as
the per centage of deaths from mias-
matic diseases of the city of Sydney,
as against *49 for the whole col ny —
both points due to what Mr. Pell
characterises as Sydney’s dirt,crowds,
and horrible sewers.
Say what the Opposition mem-
bers will, the country endorses the
ministerial policy with reference to
electoral reform. Before a full dis-
cussion of the whole question, it is
desirable that there should be more
equitable representation. This is all
that Mr. Fitzpatrick asks for, yet we
are told by men like Parkes,
Robertson, Greenwood, Dillon, and
Cameron, the passing of the
proposed temporary measure will
result in a shock to the constitution
that no patriot can contemplate
without a shudder. If by patriot is
meant an outsider desirous of getting
inside, there may be some truth in
the picture.
A game protection act is needed,
but if it cannot be secured without
introducing to New South Wales
the gamekeeper as a dead certainty,
the poacher as an extreme probabi-
lity and a rigid interpretation of the
word trespass, it will be far better
to do without one.

OPINONS OF THE PRESS.
14 Sydney Once a Week.”— lt is a neat,
well-printed little pamphlet, containing
twenty-four pages of reading matter,
which consists of short original papers,
written in a light free style, and of a few
extracts from other publications. Its pur-
pose is to give its readers “a good six-
pennyworth of literary pabulum, com-
posed of ingredients at once sparkling,
amusing, and original, and so arranged as
to avoid a suspicion of dulness.” Taken
as a whole, the magazine, which is edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, is a very creditable
production, as well to the publishers as to
the authors, and if conducted according
to the plan indicated in the few words
above quoted, it will be an acceptable
addition to our colonial literature.— S. M.
Herald.
The Echo says: —lt is a very readable
publication, and, while it cannot aspire to
rank as the equal of the most popular
English magazines, it deserves to find
favour on account of the local interest
which attaches to its papers. The original
papers, of which there are several, are
written in a light, easy style, and with
considerable ability. We should like to
see the magazine prove to be a success,
for the desirableness of building up a
respectable colonial literature will hardly
be denied by any one. and the establish-
ment of a good magazine is one of the
means towards that end. The publishers.
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., are
entitled to commendation for the admirable
way in which they have got up the
magazine.— Echo.
The New Magazine. —Sydney Once a
Week Magazine for Town and Conntry
Readers is the title of a new weekly, edited
by Mr. C. H. Barlee, issued from the
Sydney Press, which bids fair to secure a
good share of public support. Its moderate
price, its handiness, the entertaining
reading it affords, and the concise, pleas-
ing manner in which the various topics of
the day are touched in its columns, must
naturally render the Sydney Once a Week
a welcome visitor in every house, and an
agreeable companion to every reader. —
Southern Argus (Goulburn).
“Sydney Once a Week,” a magazine
bearing the above title, has made its ap-
pearance in our city. It is edited by Mr.
Barlee, formerly a member of the literary
staff of he Melbourne Argus , and a
humourist of some note. The work con-
tains sketches, tales, and articles, along
with the usual miscellanea of a magazine.
Judging by the contents of the first num-
ber, we think the magazine stands abetter
chance of succeeding than many of those
publications which are horn but to die,
and which, in some cases, are disgraceful
to the literary efforts of our city.—
Evening News.
The Singleton Argus says: —The number
is very readable, is well printed by Messrs.
Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., and contains a
varied selection of original and extract
matter. We wish the proprietor every
success with his venture, and trust that his
efforts will do something more substantial
to encourage a taste for colonial literature
than those of others who have trodden in
the same uncertain path, have succeeded
in doing. We hail with pleasure all re-
spectable efforts to establish a republic of
letters in this colony, which at present is
too much confined in its patronage to news-
paper literature only. Mr. Barlee’s venture
is the best effort in this direction that we
have seen for some time.
“ Once a Week.”— Under the title of
“ Sydney Once a Week,” the first number
of a neatly got-up octavo of over thirty
pages has just been issued. It is edited by
Mr. C. H. Barlee, who is, we understand,
assisted by a numerous staff of able con-
tributors. The contents of this new pub-
lication are varied and interesting—too
varied, in our opinion, for the space at the
disposal of the editor. If we may he per-
mitted to offer a suggestion with regard to
the future, we would recommend that
everything in the shape of “ news ” items
should be omitted. We heartily wish the
proprietors success in their undertaking,
and certainly are of opinion that the excel-
lence of “ Once a Week” well deserves it.
—Yass Courier.
The contents of the new venture give
promise of a deserved success, should it
ever be attained. There is an attractive
variety about the articles, and the tastes of
every class of readers are consulted. Thus
we have a trenchant article, short and
pithy, on the political statics in quo , a couple
of spirited domestic sketches, some comic
matter, and some chapters especially in-
tended for boys Among the last is a
scholarly commentary on a passage from
the ‘ ‘ Paradise Lost ” —intended for the use
of University candidates—a clever set of


recurrent verses in Latin and an enigma
in French. The palindrome and enigma
are an immense improvement on the
foolish anagrams and sphinx-like puzzles
which usually fill this department of our
current literature, and should commend the
production to parents. We hop ■ the new
organ will enjoy a longer term of existence
than some of its predecessors. — Namoi In-
dependent.
This serial contains well written papers
and sketches, entitled ‘‘The Public
Health,” “Muff Cricketing, “Best Dog
in the colony,” and a general summarv ot
the Russo-Turkish War. Altogether Once
a Week promises well; and without coun-
try readers (who will probably support it
best), the 170,000 residents of Svdney
should keep it going—but we doubt it.
The price is 6d., and the publishing office
279 George-street, Sydney .—Molong Ex-
press.
Once a Week.— This is the title of a new
pamphlet, edited by Mr. C. H. Barlee, of
Svdney. We have received a copy and
were highly amused, as well as entertained
with the writings; there is such a versa-
tility about them that all must be pleased.
It is notified that a summary of the
events of the present war will be given
for the accommodation of its readers,
and so do away with the tedious task of
perusing the complications daily appear-
ing in our metropolitan journals. Among
numerous, articles, in various strains,
there is a very humorous writing, en-
titled “My Balloon Adventure; ” but to
our fancy, the most amusing is one called
“ The best dog in the colony.” There is
a very good article termed “Et cetera,
which gives an abstract of the events of
the week, In next issue a story will be
commenced, under the impressive heading
of “ The Mystery of the Wiseman’s
Ferry Road.” It is a useful, handy little
hook, and well worth patronage. The
price is sixpence.— The Australian.
The Tenter field Star says-.—Besides
containing • a large amount of current
news, it possesses the attraction of afford-
ing to its readers much useful and
scientific information, combined with well
written tales and humourous sketches,
and other entertaining matter. The price
is sixpence, and this moderate charge
should command for the magazine the
wide circulation which it justly deserves.
The Moruya Examiner says: —We have
looked the hook carefully through and can
confidently recommend it to our readers
and predict its success.
The new candidate for public favour
contains a number of smartly written
original articles and some well-selected
extract matter. It is got up in good style,
and well printed, containing twenty-four
demy octavo pages. — Albury Banner.
The new publication is both instructive
and entertaining; it is deserving of a
good circulation. — Border Post (Albury).
The new publication is both well got
up and very readable. — Western Post
(Mud gee).
The Bathurst Free Press says: —It con-
tains a large quantity of interesting read-
ing matter —grave, gay, ponderous, and
light. The editorship is evidently in good
hands, and if the editor’s hopes are real-
ized the paper will take its place with
“ The pleasant books that silently among
Our household treasures take familiar places,
And are to us as if a living tongue
Spake from the printed leaves or pictured faces.’
For he makes his bold assertion: “We
shall do our best to force ourselves into
notice, and to compel attention.” Once
a Week is well worth the sixpence that is
charged for the single copy.
Another attempt has been made to
establish a literary magazine in Sydney.
The new venture takes the title of the
Sydney “Once a Week.” Its type dress
is admirable, but then the printers are
Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. The
number before us very fairly sustains the
aim stated, and we shall be glad to see the
magazine prosper.— Maitland Mercury.
It is very creditably got up and judging
from the matter which this number (No.
1) contains, it is a magazine that will no
doubt receive a large measure of support
among Australian readers. — Western Ex-
aminer (Orange).
The Murrurundi Times writes:—“The
contents have a varied range, and many
of the articles possess a degree of humour
and literary merit which will commend
them to the majority of our readers. We
shall be glad to find enough appreciation
to support anything in the shape of smart
writing which has about it no unworthy
I element.”


“ Sydney Once a Week ” —We have
received the first two numbers of a small
neatly got up magazine bearing the above
title, which, in view of its superiority to
the majority of weekly publications lately
issued from the Sydney Press, we feel it
our honest duty to notice with approba-
tion. Its contents (those of the two issues
we have received) are not only well written,
but are for the most part original and
local. They comprise a great variety of
light and instructive reading matter, which
should commend Once a Week to public
favour. Politics, the public health, and
other grave matters are ably treated in its
leading columns. There are also well
written original humorous sketches—we
note specially “ The Best Dog in the
Colony” and “My Balloon Adventure,” —
and a few happy clippings from comic ex-
changes ; a page of town gossip; and an
epitome of the week’s war news. Ad-
mirably written papers, entitled ‘ ‘ Gossip
with the Boys,” appear in each issue, and
are, it is said, to be continued regularly.
The verses in the first number, entitled
1 An Australian Idyll” are very far above
the average of contributions to the ‘ ‘ poets’
corner.” It is an affecting story, well told.
In the second number appeared the pro-
logue of a story called “The Mystery of
Wiseman’s Ferry,” which is to be the piece
de resistance in the way of serial romance.
Once a Week we can conscientiously re-
commend as a weekly magazine, enter-
taining, instructive, and of high tone.
Those who have not seen this publication
should buy copies, and judge of its merits
for themselves. We are certain they will
endorse our opinion.— Cumberland Mercury.
The Sydney “Once a Week ” —The
sixth number of this serial has just been
published. Its literary merits and general
get up are equal to those of the first
number which vf( had occasion to notice
favorably. It contains a large amount of
instructive and light 1 eading; the original
articles are entertaining, and the contents
of the number generally are judiciously
varied. The “Mystery of Wiseman’s
Ferry Road,” has reached the third chap-
ter. The interest of the story in no way
flags. The “War News” and “Town
Gossip ” are readable articles, and the
comic papers sparkle with humour. There
are several pieces of original poetry ; and
two or three pages devoted to ‘ ‘ Columns
for young readers,” containing charades,
puzzles, &c. Altogether the number does
credit to editor and printer. — S. M. Herald.
We heartily recommend the magazine
to our readers. — Grenfell Record.
The Coonamble Independent says:—“ The
first number, which we have received, is
well and ably written —the best sketch, in
our opinion, being a very humourous one,
entitled the “Best Dog in the Colony.”
We wish the proprietor every success, as,
in our opinion, the publication, if well
conducted, will supply a want long felt in
Sydney, and add to the far too small stock
of Australian literature. We have every
confidence in recommending “ Once a
Week” to the favorable notice of our
readers.”
“ Sydney Once a Week.” —We have
just received the eighth number of ‘ ‘ Sydney
Once a Week,” and a rather close inspec-
tion of its contents reveals the fact that it
is, if anything, an improvement upon its
predecessors. The conception of the
publication of such a periodical was ex-
tremely happy in its character, as it gave
opportunities for manifestations of local
literary talents of various orders that
otherwise might be lost to the general
public, and also established a magazine in
the colony respectable and worthy of accep-
tation. The original articles in the present
number are agreeably and vigorously
written, and the few clippings inserted
selected with good taste, while all are
neatly and carefully printed and revised.
— Echo.
Sydney Once a Week. —This periodical
has now reached a tenth issue. The present
week’s number, in point of literary merit
or interesting reading, is in every respect
equal to its predecessors. The most inter-
esting topics of the week are written upon
in a light, agreeable style, and there are
several very readable local sketches. —
S. M. Herald.
The Sydney “ Once a Week.’' —This
publication, having reached its twelfth
issue, may now be looked upon as an estab-
lished addition to our colonial literature.
The public, as well as the proprietary,
may be congratulated upon this result.
The present number of Once a Week is a
fairly average one ; and although its con-
tents are not of great variety, yet they
furnish interesting and agreeable reading.
On this ground, and believing that it has
a healthy tendency, we have much plea-
sure in recommending it and wishing it a
successful career.— Echo.
